<H3>Programs</H3>

<B>1. Introduction</B> - Children study the creatures of nature by looking at them closely and asking questions. Students meet a snowy owl and a green darner dragonfly to learn about seasonal changes, habitats, life cycle changes, and differences between living and non-living things. (12:58)<P>

<B>2. Animals without Backbones</B> - Different kinds and numbers of body parts distinguish animals from one another. Invertebrates take many forms and live in many different environments. Introduce students to earthworms, spiders, and crayfish. (13:17)<P>

<B>3. Insects</B> - Insects all have three body parts and six legs, but vary greatly in size, color, shape, wings, and behavior. Discuss the life cycle and how many insects benefit humans. Students observe a monarch butterfly, praying mantis, grasshopper, cricket, fireflies, ants, and bees. (13:44)<P>

<B>4. Fish</B> - Fish are distinguished by their different sizes, colors, shapes, fin structures, and behaviors. Learn how fins, scales, slime, ears, and gills help fish survive in their underwater environment. Students visit a lake and the New England Aquarium where they see trout, porcupine fish, stingray, flatfish, minnows, and sunfish. (12:16)<P>

<B>5. Frogs, Toads, and Salamanders</B> - Amphibians are animals without hair, fur, feathers, or scales that live both on land and in the water. Students observe a bullfrog, a leopard frog, and a spotted salamander to learn about the double life of amphibians and what special adaptations enhance their chances for survival. (13:07)<P>

<B>6. Turtles</B> - Turtles are cold-blooded vertebrates with dry, scaly skin, a shell, four feet, a tail, and bony mouth ridges. Introduce the different kinds of turtles, their different habitats, and the many different foods they eat. Students learn the difference between a box turtle, a painted turtle, and a snapping turtle. (14:40)<P>

<B>7. Snakes</B> - Snakes are cold-blooded animals whose bodies take on the same temperature as their environment. Study the features that make snakes unique and how they benefit humans. Students are introduced to a garter snake and a seven-foot eastern indigo snake. (14:36)<P>

<B>8. What Is a Bird?</B> - Most birds can fly, but not all birds live in the same kinds of environments. Illustrate the commonalities of birds and some special adaptations that help birds survive: wings, feathers, good eyesight, ears, and beaks. Students see a pigeon, a great horned owl, loons, and great blue herons. (14:06)<P>

<B>9. Mammals</B> - Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates with hair or fur that usually bear live young, and nurse them with special milk glands. Explain that mammals come in various shapes, sizes, colors, and body forms, and live in many places. Students are introduced to a baby raccoon and two fawns to study the distinctive characteristics of mammals. (12:53)<P> 

<B>10. Winter at Squam Lake</B> - Different animals have different ways of adapting to the winter. Emphasize that even though all living things eventually die, people must be careful not to destroy animal habitats and upset nature's balance. Students observe a snowy owl, white-tailed deer, and an American black bear to see different adaptations to winter's cold. (12:59)<P>

<B>11. Life in the Winter Forest</B> - The forest is a complex habitat, containing many different types of life. Learn how animals use a variety of means to survive the winter: hibernating, growing protective coverings, collecting large amounts of food, or utilizing a type of "anti-freeze" in their blood. Students examine the white-footed mouse, gray squirrel, porcupine, opossum, and fisher. (15:08)<P>

<B>12. The Pond</B> - A pond is a vital habitat for a variety of resident animals and transient visitors. See how the amount of animal activity changes with the seasons and how animals have adapted to the habitat in which they live. Students see a bullfrog, crayfish, newt, paramecia, and some water striders. (13:10)<P>

<B>13. Marsh and Swamp</B> - Marshes and swamps are examples of wetlands. Learn about habitats, the food chain, and that wetlands are breeding grounds for many animals and need to be protected from human destruction. Students are introduced to a variety of wetland-area animals including a turtle, duck, heron, red-winged blackbird, beaver, and barred-owl. (11:52)<P>

<B>14. In the Field</B> - Fields are habitats for a large variety of mammals, rodents, birds, and insects. Illustrate that all animals have a strong sense of survival which drives them to find food, seek shelter, and avoid danger. Students observe a fox, woodchuck, opossum, skunk, and kestrel (a swift bird of prey) to learn that many animals have specialized body parts and unique behaviors that enhance their chances of survival. (12:39)<P>

<B>15. Outside Your Door</B> - Animals can be found living just about anywhere. Backyard naturalists study creatures close to home: millipedes, centipedes, spiders, bees, sowbugs, and spittle bugs. Students learn how nature centers and zoos simulate the habitats of exotic animals, so people can observe tortoise, flamingos, and other animals they might not ordinarily see. (12:45)<P>

<BODY>

<H2>We Are the Children</H2>

Social Studies and Multicultural Education for Grades 4-6<P>

<B>Cultivate greater understanding of other cultures with stories told by their children</B><P>

The more we know about other people, the better we understand one another. This is the rationale behind <B>We Are the Children</B>, a unique 36-part series that introduces viewers to the peoples who comprise the vast cultural quilt of southern Africa, from Bushman to Zulu, from Chinese to Greek. Each program looks at the world through the eyes of a child, and each child tells his or her own story, which is always linked to an important event in the youngster's own life. The story may deal with the fulfillment of an ambition or the resolution of a moral dilemma, or it may involve a traditional experience. These programs
<UL>
<LI>illuminate the backgrounds, traditions, customs, and lifestyles of many diverse cultural groups
<LI>introduce students to an important part of the world that is now experiencing remarkable changes, as previously separated peoples begin sharing political power
<LI>open new horizons of understanding through stories that address issues 
of concern to children in any land
</UL><P>

<B>We Are the Children</B> is suitable for social studies and multicultural education in grades 4-6. The programs serve as engrossing supplements to regular curricula. Part of the acclaimed "Kideo" concept, <B>We Are the Children</B> is produced by Safritel of Johannesburg, South Africa, and distributed by AIT. &copy;1995<P>

<B>We Are the Children</B> and these are our stories . . .<P>

<B>Meet "Debbie, the Chinese Girl"<BR> 
(Program 19)</B><P>

Chinese proverbs are an integral part of life, and in this story Debbie Pon, a budding young drum majorette, illustrates the importance of honesty. Debbie is busy rehearsing a dance for the famous Double Ten Ceremony, but afterwards she loses the hat that she is supposed to wear during her performance. She is too ashamed to tell her parents that she lost the hat, but finally, when she admits her negligence and her parents help her, she realizes that she should have behaved differently. With her parents' help, the hat is returned to her at the last minute. But it was nearly too late, for without the hat she would not have been allowed to participate in the celebration.<P>

<TITLE>Wordscape #303</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Wordscape</H2>

Communication Skills and Vocabulary Building for Grades 4-6<P>

Expand students' vocabularies by teaching them to recognize word "cells" as the major building blocks of English words. Help students develop and maintain positive attitudes toward the diversity, utility, and wonder of language.<P>

As students in grades 4-6 begin changing their views of how English is built, they shift from a letter-by-letter or sound-by-sound process to one that focuses on larger units of language--roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Words come alive by demonstrating topic vocabulary used in context through vignettes and explanation. Students see and hear vocabulary in authentic settings, instead of simply "memorizing" a list.<P>

<B>Wordscape</B> explores the multicultural contributions to English vocabulary from Latin, Greek, French, German, Hispanic, West African, and Native American sources.<P>
<B>Wordscape</B> was produced by AIT in association with Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (1990).<P>

<BODY>

<H2>Writer's Realm</H2>

Communication Skills for Intermediate<P>

Who is a creative writer? Everyone who ever scribbled a note, that's who. In <B>Writer's Realm</B> students in grades four through six will meet writers of many kinds -- favorite authors and people their own age. Dramatic segments, animation, interviews, notes, drafts, revisions, and finished products illustrate how real people go about writing.<P>

No two people do it in exactly the same way, but everybody learns to write by writing, and that's the point. These programs suggest alternatives rather than lay down rules. They illustrate how writing for different purposes needs to be different. They stimulate young writers to keep looking for ways to improve what they have written and, above all, to enjoy the process.<P>

<B>Writer's Realm</B> was produced by Maryland Instructional Technology in association with AIT (1987).<P>

<H3>Programs</H3>

1. <B>Put It in Writing</B> - Writing is part of many different jobs. It's part of social life too. Understanding the steps in the writing process can improve the end product. (13:49)<P>

2. <B>What's the Idea?</B> - Writers get started in different ways, but the first step is observing. Techniques such as brainstorming, freewriting, and narrowing in on a manageable topic are shown. (13:49)<P>

3. <B>The Search Begins</B> - Encyclopedias aren't the only resources for writers. Others may require legwork but yield interesting results. Web diagrams of questions may help the researcher. (13:52)<P>

4. <B>That's Worth Noting</B> - There's a difference between retelling and mere copying. Taking notes helps writers collect and organize information, especially for nonfiction writing. (13:46)<P>

5. <B>Asking the Right Question</B> - Effective planning makes for a good interview, whether of a famous person or a family member. (13:49)<P>

6. <B>Picture This</B> - Historical fiction is one type of writing that requires writers to research the facts and then fill in details with their imagination. (13:46)<P>

7. <B>Let's Get Organized</B> - There's often no right order for a piece of writing, but sometimes order does matter. Using a time line is one way to organize the telling of a story. (13:50)<P>

8. <B>Show Me What You Mean</B> - Vivid, specific words make settings, characters, and problems come alive for the reader. (13:49)<P>

9. <B>It's Like This</B> - Figurative language paints pictures, especially in poems.  Metaphors can make a written work clearer and more interesting. (13:50)<P>

10. <B>Just the Right Tone</B> - Just as whining and sweet-talking evoke different reactions, so choosing the tone of written words matters, especially in persuasive writing. (13:49)<P>

11. <B>See What I'm Saying</B> - Sometimes a writer is specifying something that will actually be seen. Scriptwriting, for example, requires care with both visual and verbal elements. (13:49)<P>

12. <B>A Little Help from Your Friends</B> - Friends who respond with specifics can help writers focus and build on their good points. (13:50)<P>

13. <B>Details, Details</B> - How much detail is enough? How much is too much? The right details to put in a letter depend on the recipient. (13:49)<P>

14. <B>Everything in Its Place</B> - When readers need more details, sticking them at the story's end is seldom the solution.  Writers need to find good places to embed additional information. (13:49)<P> 

15. <B>Checking It Out</B> - Some people make their living as editors. Young writers can use checklists to proofread one another's writing and their own for clarity, interest, grammar, and mechanics. (13:50)<P>

<TITLE>Your Choice . . . Our Chance #289</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Your Choice . . . Our Chance</H2>

Abuse Prevention, Drug Prevention Education, and Life Coping Skills for Grades 5-6, Adult<P>

Establish drug abuse prevention skills before children become users of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs. Bring together schools, families, and communities into a working partnership for preventing drug use by students in the vulnerable preteen years.<P>

The <B>Your Choice . . . Our Chance</B> school component focuses on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that influence drug use, because it is easier to prevent risky health behaviors than it is to change them. The community component features effective prevention and intervention efforts in three very different communities that provide useful, adaptable models for local prevention activities with parents and other adults who want to protect young people from the pressure to turn to drugs.<P>

<B>Your Choice . . . Our Chance</B> was developed in cooperation with the Association for the Advancement of Health Education (AAHE) by a consortium of state and provincial agencies organized and managed by AIT (1990).<P>

Note: Duplication rights are not available for this series.<P>

<H2>Zoo Zoo Zoo</H2>

Ecology and Life Sciences for Primary, intermediate<P>
 
It's easy to miss a lot at the zoo if you don't know what to look for. <B>Zoo Zoo Zoo</B> sorts it all out in programs that focus on one topic at a time. Close-ups let children see a grasshopper's ear (under its wing). The camera backs off to show a gibbon soar and dives underwater to investigate the eyes of blind cave fish.<P>

Personnel of the Cincinnati Zoo explain the functions of ears, feet, tails, and such, and how the way animals look is often related to where they live and how they survive.<P>

<B>Zoo Zoo Zoo</B> was produced by The Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation (WCET) (1980).<P>

<H3>Programs</H3>

1. <B>All about Eyes</B> - Humans share binocular vision with animal predators like leopards and condors, but the preyed upon zebra and many birds watch for attackers with eyes on the sides of their heads. Viewers see many special kinds of eyes. (14:32)<P>

2. <B>All about Feet</B> - Two, four, six, many, or none. Water striders skip, waders stand tall, and penguins have short, fat feet for snow and ice. Birds catch prey with talons, hoofed animals run to escape, raccoons climb. Footless snakes and worms crawl, sea anemones take root, starfish swim. (14:32)<P>

3. <B>All about Ear</B> - Water animals have small ears, if any. Fish "hear" vibrations with their labial lines, and snakes "hear" with their bellies. Animals that hunt or are hunted need excellent hearing. Rabbits and elephants lose body heat through their ears. The ears of owls, ostriches, and grasshoppers are hidden. Bats use their ears for echo location. (1 4:32)<P>

4. <B>All about Tails</B> - Skunks "talk" with their tails, kinkajous use theirs to grasp branches, and giraffes swat flies with theirs. Tails help animals balance and are handles for elephant babies, bushy blankets for snow leopards, and chairs for wallaroos. (14:32)<P>

5. <B>Animal Costumes</B> - Colors and patterns help insects, birds, fish and mammals court their mates, hide from their enemies, and sneak up on their prey. Even brightly colored animals are hard to see in certain environments. (14:32)<P>

6. <B>Animal Defenses</B> - Some animals fly or climb quickly to escape predators. Others look like their surroundings. Hard armor, bad smells, and bad tastes protect goliath beetles, skunks, and butterflies. (14:32)<P>

7. <B>The Importance of Predators</B> - Predators are part of the natural cycle. The vulture is "nature's garbageman." Insect eaters prey as efficiently as leopards and sharks. Starfish wait for their prey, but piranha fish attack in schools. Spiders keep the fly and mosquito population down. (14:30)<P>

8. <B>Do Animals Talk?</B> - Kookaburra birds, crickets, gibbons, siamangs, and rattlesnakes communicate with sound. Deer, eagles, and hawks give visual signals. Ferrets leave their scent. Bees dance to tell the hive where to find flowers. (14:31)<P>

9. <B>How and What Animals Eat</B> - Ferrets use their noses to find food, snakes their tongues, big cats their vision, and the sea anemone its sense of touch. Snapping turtles, fish, pelicans, and vampire bats catch prey with Their specialized mouths. Plant-eating animals include the rabbit, the blesbok, and the elephant. (14:32)<P>

10. <B>How Animals Move</B> - Animals climb, run swim, fly, and crawl to get food and to escape predators. Viewers see some special aids to swimmers -- flippers, air bladders, a flat tail, and webbed feet -- and the different ways in which snakes and snails crawl. (14:32)<P>

11. <B>How Animals Help Each Other</B> - Remora fish feed on shark parasites, and the sharks protect the remora. Prairie dog tunnels provide homes for other animals. Lions hunt in prides, bees share warmth, and ants carry the aphids that give them nectar. (14:32)<P>

12. <B>Zoo Babies</B> - Snakes need no mothering; ducklings and goslings, very little. Robins, alpacas, lions, gorillas, and human babies need lots. An opossum depends on its mother's pouch and the seahorse on its father's, but both parents raise Canada geese. If zoo animals reject their babies, specially trained people takeover. (14:31)<P>

13. <B>Animal Homes</B> - Some animals burrow, others live in trees. Social insects and coral make large, complex structures. Spider homes help catch their food, and insect galls are both homes and food. Barn owls are becoming as rare as the old barns in which they live. (1 4:31 )<P>

14. <B>Animal Groups</B> - Animals that live together benefit from many eyes, ears, and noses. Animals that live alone will come together to a common source of food. Some insects and most spiders are loners, but others live in sophisticated groupings. (14:31)<P>

15. <B>Who Works at the Zoo</B> - It isn't easy to give a shot to a Bengal tiger, unusual equipment helps zoo doctors. Zookeepers monitor the water in the aquarium and the heat in the insect zoo. The nursery cares for abandoned babies. (14:31)<P>

16. <B>Where Animals Live</B> - You can tell where many animals live simply by looking at them. Viewers see special adaptations of waders, swimmers, climbers, and plant-eaters. Animals from cold places are contrasted with desert animals. (14:31)<P>

1. <B>How Do You Get a White Tiger? (Genetic)</B> - Applied genetics matters in a zoo, where most animals and birds are born in captivity. Interbreeding keeps lowland gorillas genetically strong. However, Bengal tigers bred for white fur with white stripes (both recessive) must be homozygous. Basic research and the International Species Inventory System help both endangered species and zoos. (28:45)<P>

2. <B>Animal Engineering (Physiology)</B> -  Specialized bones, feathers, and sight help birds live in the air. A gorilla's muscular head is related to its diet. A cheetah's large nasal passages contribute to its speed. The eyes of the "four-eyed fish," spirades of the Madagascar hissing cockroach, exoskeletons of insects, slow metabolism of turtles, and long necks of giraffes all have specialized functions. (28:45)<P>

3. <B>Community: How Do You Live with Your Neighbors (Adaptation)</B> - in wild communities everything depends on everything else. As food sources disappear, so do tropical species. In the temperate forest many animals share food and water, and vultures clean up. Antelope, wildebeest, and zebras warn other grassland animals of danger. Ostrich eggs need to hatch near other ostrich eggs. Drinking and eating habits of elephants and lions benefit other species. (28:45)<P>

4. <B>Environment: There' No Place Like Home (Adaptation)</B> - Polar bears, penguins, and woodchucks adapt differently to cold, fennecs, gopher tortoises, tarantulas, and burrowing fish survive heat. The zoo provides a special environment for an insect from Java. Dissection reveals a mackerel's gills and air bladder, and the sea lion's built-in equipment for long-distance underwater swimming is contrasted with what a human must carry. (28:43)<P>

5. <B>And Then There Were None (Endangered Species)</B> - The venom of a Russell's viper kills arthritis pain, and a chemical from the more common rosy periwinkle treats leukemia. More important plants, herbivores, omnivores (including humans), predators, scavengers, and decomposers need one another in a continuing cycle of food, oxygen, minerals, water, and energy. Humans upset this balance by destroying vast habitats -- but some are cooperating to save endangered species. (28:45)<P>

6. <B>Nutrition, Fitness, and Stress (Health)</B> - A diet of bear biscuits and water would be good for people, too, but carnivores need different food. Keepers must stir blood for vampire bats, mix aardvark food to the texture of termites, and treat water for saltwater fish. The right kinds of exercise space and retreat cages increase fitness and reduce stress in captive animals. (28:45)<P>

7. <B>Can You Teach an Old Dog New Trick ? (Animal Behavior)</B> - Studying the behavior patterns of animals in the wild is important to breeding and training animals in captivity. Banding and radio transmitters let observers follow birds and study the social life of bush babies. A cougar, a falcon, a capuchin and a spot-nosed monkey, a baby Siberian lynx, and a 60-year-old alligator demonstrate behavior natural to each. (28:43)<P>

8. <B>How to Trace a Family Tree (Clarification)</B> - A tiger is traced through its kingdom, phylum, subphylum, class, order, family, genus, species, and subspecies. Many animals illustrate the characteristics of their classes, and a nusty-kneed tarantula shows how spiders differ from insects. Puzzlers include the echidna and the koala. (28:4<P>

9. <B>What Can You Learn from an Aardvark? (Animal Research)</B> - Much zoo research is aimed at reproducing rare animals, such as the aardvark. House cats may become surrogate mothers of exotic cats. Rare bongo antelope have already been born to more common eland mothers, and more bongo embryos await transfer in Cincinnati s frozen zoo." Embryo splitting increases the frozen herd and frozen semen collected from wild bongos widens the zoo's gene pool. (28:45)<P>

10. <B>Life among the Tt Tub (Biological Career)</B> - A background in biology is important for zoo research scientists, veterinarians, animal keepers, educators, animal technicians and many other workers at a zoo. (28:45)<P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_s.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>ince the 1960s, AIT has played a pivotal role in bringing together advanced technology and applied education, and there has been a steady increase in the need for our products and services.  Today, AIT&#146;s educational series are used on six continents and reach nearly thirty-four million students in North American classrooms each year via broadcast.  Our programs account for forty percent of the National Instructional Satellite Service schedule, which is broadcast to K&#150;12 classrooms in the United States.  AIT programs have been translated for use in Spanish and German.  We have series in American Sign Language and many series that are closed captioned.</P>

<P>AIT&#146;s growth was particularly strong in the first half of the 1990s.  During that time, we established important new working partnerships with organizations such as Phi Delta Kappa and South-Western Educational Publishing.  We made significant advances in the use of instructional tools such as computer programs and interactive videodiscs.  And we  improved our ability to produce and deliver quality educational resources rapidly and economically.</P>

<P>The result was a significant increase in business activity and a substantial improvement in our fiscal strength.  AIT has also constructed  a new corporate headquarters in Bloomington and we are completing our second year in that facility.  One of its main purposes is to provide additional space for our computerized distribution center.  It  also significantly increased our video editing and production capabilities.   These improvements and our recently expanded sales force will help ensure both AIT&#146;s future growth and our ability to provide faster, more efficient service to schools and school districts around the world.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>y working in close cooperation with a growing number of strategic partners, AIT strengthens its ability to develop and market educational programs.  These partners include corporate partners such as Ameritech, educational institutions such as Phi Delta Kappa, and publishers such as South-Western Educational Publishing.  Forming strategic alliances benefits both AIT and its partners.  It allows each partner to contribute and share specialized resources and expertise to reach goals that would not be achievable by a single entity.</P>

<P>Our relationship with Phi Delta Kappa (PDK), for example, gives AIT access to leading writers, theorists, and educators in the areas of teacher training and teacher development.  A recent project with PDK resulted in <I>Education Under Fire</I> and <I>Positive Insights on Education</I>, two series with twelve video programs featuring prominent authors, teachers, and educational leaders, including Henry Levin, Robert Coles, and Carol Shakeshaft.</P>

<P>Similar ventures include projects with the National Council on Economic Education, the Center for Civic Education, and two consortia of state departments of education to develop multimedia curricula that support the teaching of economics and civics.    Cooperation with companies such as Ameritech promise to broaden the exposure and increase the sales of our programs through an innovative series of 2-way video field trips to various workplaces.</P>

<P>South-Western Educational Publishing works closely with us on a variety of educational publishing projects.  Three examples under development are two additional modules for the popular <I>Communication 2000</I> product, three modules on <I>Communication in Careers</I>,  and ten modules for <I>Science Links</I>.  These multimedia instructional products will set a new standard for applied communication resources for eleventh- and twelfth-grade students, and integrated science materials for ninth-grade students.  We create and develop the products; South-Western handles financing, production, marketing, and promotion of finished materials.  Additionally , both AIT and South-Western conduct product-related workshops.  As a major textbook publisher, South-Western is particularly experienced in the often complex textbook adoption process and helps us make the most effective presentation of AIT materials to state education departments.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_s.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>ince 1970, AIT has developed more than thirty-six major educational series in cooperation with education and technology authorities from all fifty U.S. states and the twelve Canadian provinces and territories.  A single project may involve work with as many as forty government agencies.  One recent series was initiated by Health and Welfare Canada, a government agency, with funding on behalf of all Canadian provinces and territories.  AIT then expanded the consortium to include educational agencies from all U.S. state governments in the same project.</P>

<P>These cooperative projects arise from identification of a curriculum need that could best be solved by instructional technology.  Typical projects involve developing educational material for core curriculum subjects in grades K&#150;12.  Recently, however, we have also produced an increasing number of series in such related fields as vocational education and teacher development.</P>

<P>AIT begins by preparing a prospectus to which state and provincial education agencies respond with advice and funding.  Depending on the project, additional financial support may come from private education agencies, technology organizations, and corporate and philanthropic sponsors.  The funding agencies then become a consortium of project advisers and partners.  When a project is completed, consortium members retain unrestricted rights to broadcast and duplicate the series videos, reprint accompanying materials, and buy components at reduced prices from AIT.</P>

<P>As projects are scripted and produced, AIT also works with classroom teachers and students to conduct formative evaluations.  These reports are an important research and development resource.  They allow us to measure accurately the effectiveness and adjust our educational materials as they are being developed.</P>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Although the economic climate of the &#146;90s has placed serious restrictions on the budgets of many government educational agencies, AIT has continued to develop a broad range of projects.  We have worked successfully both to maintain a high level of quality and to reduce development and production costs.  Despite the considerably more complex technologies of current projects, our fees to the educational community are significantly lower today than they were ten years ago.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_s.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>tudents learn best when they are presented with lively and challenging information and when material is relevant to their own lives.  For more than thirty years, AIT has provided educators with instructional materials that are interesting and relevant &#151; and equitable in their treatment of students.  Our goal is to provide technological programming that is blind to differences in gender, race, socioeconomic background, and age.</P>

<P>Today, AIT materials help to define and expand the curriculum in classrooms in the United States and abroad.  Our products have expanded to include nearly 3,500 video programs, interactive videodiscs, CD-ROM, computer software, and extensive print materials.  These resources include series designed to be used with large classes, in small groups, and by individuals.</P>

<P>We were one of the pioneers in the use of classroom TV and have constantly redefined its use to keep pace with changes in technology, educational theory, and classroom requirements.  AIT has maintained a leadership role by integrating increasingly sophisticated technologies with solid instructional design.  <I>Economics at Work</I>, our multimedia economics series for senior high school students, demonstrates the range of resources we offer today in a single series.  The core of the curriculum is five teacher guides and five student guides.  They are supported by five interactive videodiscs which combine drama and documentaries with a data base of commonly used economics charts and graphs, and a software program which allows students to engage in business simulations in seven career clusters.</P>

<P><I>Communication 2000</I> has ten instructor guides and ten learner guides, ten interactive videodiscs, and computer-based templates to help students develop and apply writing skills.  The series encompasses six categories of lessons and incorporates nearly thirty works of literature, ranging from articles and poems to selections from books, all with original illustrations.  Most of the literature selections have been recorded on audio cassettes by professional readers, or, in some cases, the original author.</P>

<P>As new technologies are proven effective, AIT is making them available in the classroom.  These technologies are already enabling us to offer more integral standards and assessments as components of our programs.  <I>Media Mates</I> represents a unique packaging of proven AIT video titles with related and supporting CD-ROMs developed by CLEARVUE/eav.  Along with the AIT-prepared print, each topic specific <I>Media Mate</I>, whether on cell biology or the industrial revolution,  allows teachers to have a complete media resource in their classrooms, one that is appropriate for  both large group and individualized instruction.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_p.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>rofessional educators are expected to keep up with all of the latest theories and findings in a constantly changing and evolving field.  To help them do so, AIT is placing increased emphasis on creating resources that support professional development for teachers and administrators, as well as for involved community members, such as school trustees and parent and community groups.  Many of our recent educational programs also include a substantial staff development component.</P>

<P>We currently offer twenty-two professional development resources that consist of video, print, and videodisc materials.  A recent example is <I>Every Child Can Succeed</I>, a comprehensive print and video toolkit for reforming and restructuring schools.  Developed with the support of the Council of Chief State School Officers and a consortium of state and regional education agencies, the program&#146;s premise is that chronic underachievement can be transformed into success for all children, even those most at risk of failure.  Seventeen video programs and accompanying print materials focus particularly on elementary schools and instructional programs proven successful with disadvantaged children.</P>

<P>As part of our ongoing commitment to teachers who use AIT materials, we also offer a growing array of on-site workshops and classes.  Our professional trainers provide up to two days of instruction on integrating AIT materials into an existing curriculum.  They also provide technical training in how to use new technologies &#151; particularly those with interactive features that increase learning greatly, such as videodisc players and computer software.</P>

<TABLE align=left>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="/profile/pd_blbox.gif"><IMG SRC="/profile/comphelp.jpg">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>During 1993, our first full year of formal professional development programs, AIT trained more than 2,000 teachers in site-based sessions in all fifty states.  The programs are available in Canada as well.  Most of them include a follow-up component, in which we return the following year to further refine program skills and prepare the original group to pass on what they&#146;ve learned to other teachers.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_i.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>n addition to developing, producing, and distributing ground-breaking instructional materials, AIT helps to shape current thinking and influence policy on a wide range of educational issues.  <I>TECHNOS:  Quarterly for Education and Technology</I>,  the Agency&#146;s journal devoted to the discussion of ideas about the use of technology in education, provides a forum for leading authorities on current topics and trends, educational policy and reform, and new technologies.</P>

<P>Begun in 1992, <I>TECHNOS Quarterly</I> signaled the launch of TECHNOS Press.  Our journal is a periodical &#147;think piece&#148; that provides the kind of information and perspectives that knowledgeable readers need to make reasoned decisions about the future direction of education.  <I>TECHNOS Quarterly</I> has featured a wide range of prominent writers, from U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley to leaders such as  business management expert Tom Peters, Nobel economist Milton Friedman, and the beloved Captain Kangaroo. The journal&#146;s audience includes government officials in Washington, D.C., all fifty states, and the Canadian provinces; directors of major educational and  philanthropic organizations; prominent print and broadcast journalists; and librarians, researchers, and educators at every level around the world.</P>

<P>In addition to <I>TECHNOS Quarterly</I>, TECHNOS Press gives us the opportunity to sponsor authors who are at the forefront of educational theory and policy  by establishing the AIT Distinguished Fellows Program. The Distinguished Fellows Program was designed to publish new works by leading researchers, writers, and experts and to provide substantive, thought-provoking, and original contributions to the field through concise, informative writing and analysis. The first AIT Distinguished Fellow in 1995 was Dr. Gerald Bracey who wrote &#147;Final Exam:A Study of the Perpetual Scrutiny of American Education.&#148; The 1996 AIT Distinguished Fellow, Morton Marcus, is writing a book on financing education in the 21st century, to be published by TECHNOS Press in the fall of 1996. In conjunction with the annual Fellows&#146;  books, TECHNOS Press publishes monographs.</P>

<IMG SRC="/profile/technos.gif"><IMG SRC="/profile/tp_blbox.gif">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>In 1994, AIT expanded its leadership role still further by sponsoring The Educational Fair Access and the New Media National Conference in Washington, D.C.  The Conference brought together, for the first time, major interest groups and experts to address the issues of copyright and electronic availability of multimedia materials in educational settings. Additional conferences will be organized by AIT that will provide similar forums for the exchange of ideas on other important topics.  Other TECHNOS Press plans include future online debates and forums on relevant and provocative issues in education, as well as increased electronic interactivity with education and technology leaders.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="drop_e.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>ducators and employers alike agree that applied academics is a critical link between rigorous academics for all students and a highly trained, resourceful workforce.  AIT has been a pioneer in the tech-prep movement, providing schools with resources for the school-to-work transition that are designed to strengthen the alliance between traditional academics and vocational training.</P>

<P>Our deepening involvement in this area dates to a project undertaken in the middle 1980s.  In partnership with the Center for Occupational Research and Development, we developed an applied physics series called <I>Principles of Technology</I>.  AIT went on to develop related materials, including <I>Applied Communication</I> and a new follow-up series for high school students, called <I>Workplace Readiness</I>.</P>

<P>AIT has developed two new modules on <I>Electronic Communication</I> and <I>Technical Writing</I>, designed to help tomorrow&#146;s workers master communication skills in an increasingly technological setting.   Students are instructed in how best to send memos over electronic networks, write clear technical descriptions, and communicate with customers by voice mail, FAX, or e-mail.</P>

<P>In addition to similar curricula in other areas of applied academics, such as civics and economics, AIT has developed a multimedia series specifically designed to help students adjust to the demands of an evolving workplace.  <I>Workplace Readiness</I> teaches skills in areas such as problem solving, teamwork, and self-management.  The series was created to be used in a range of educational settings, including high school and vocational classes, associate degree programs, and career guidance and retraining courses.  Designed in cooperation with a consortium of state education agencies, <I>Workplace Readiness</I> prepares students to make a successful transition from school to a wide variety of challenging jobs.</P>

<P><B>Science Links</B> &reg; is an integrated high school curriculum targeted primarily  toward a ninth grade audience.  It will be one of the first curriculums available to be based upon the new National Science Education Standards.  It also provides an integrated approach to teaching science.  Using a thematic approach, each of the ten modules will lead students into investigations in biology, chemistry, earth/space, and physics.</P>

<TR><TD>
<P>The development of a curriculum like <B>Science Links</B> &reg;  is a long and complex process.  It involves far more than writing a textbook and shooting an instructional video.  AIT assembles a staff nationwide to write, assemble, edit, review, and refine every aspect of the curricular resource before it is released.  Recently, an AIT production crew was on location in Pinetown, North Carolina, at one of the <B>Science Links</B> &reg;  review sites to document how the curriculum is used in class.  This video footage will be edited into a special training segment for teachers.</P></TD>
<TD WIDTH="200" ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/sc_link3.gif"><BR><SMALL>&copy; 1996 Agency for Instructional Technology</SMALL></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>AIT frequently receives feedback from teachers indicating their eagerness to introduce integrated science into their classroom.  At the same time many of these teachers have also expressed an interest in receiving training and helpful ideas.  AIT and Thomson Science are responding to this interest by providing a rich resource for teachers for each of the ten modules.</P>

<P>Using the modules in classes like the one in Pinetown, NC allows us to test the investigations.  Based upon feedback from teachers and students we refine the investigations.    Even various methods of assessment, like group presentations, are evaluated so that the curriculum can deliver a full range of options to the teacher.</P>

<P>Electricity is the theme of module 4 in <B>Science Links &reg;</B>.  Students and teachers will get a charge out of discovering how electricity is integrated in biology, chemistry, physics, and earth/space sciences.  Newly  taped video footage will do more than introduce students to basic concepts.  They'll see safety applications, medical uses, employment of math skills, and the many uses and effects of electricity.</P>

<H3>When Attention Deficit Disorder is&#151;or isn't&#151;the problem.</H3>

<P><BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<B><I>AD/HD:  What It Is.  What It Isn't.  What To Do.</I></B> is an in-depth look at this troubling phenomenon.  ADD is often the first diagnosis for any attention problem&#151;but when are other factors at work?  How often is this a misdiagnosis because it is so easy to pin a simple label on inattentiveness?</P>

<P>Exploring ADD itself and the other causes of inattentiveness, such as emotional distress, cognitive or language processing problems, medical disorders or medication side-effects, environmental mismatches, this workshop program focuses not just on identifying the true causes of inattention, but effective management techniques for dealing with them.  Learn to:
<UL>
<LI>Identify problems that need further professional evaluation.
<LI>Understand what ADD is   and what it isn't!
<LI>Identify other attention problems that could be misdiagnosed as ADD.
<LI>Develop effective management techniques for various attention disorders.
</UL></P>

<P><B><I>AD/HD:  What It Is.  What It Isn't.  What To Do.</I></B> consists of a 60-minute program and accompanying facilitator's guide.  Pause points and reproducible materials allow teachers to work through the examples of students in need of help with their attention deficit problems.  It was developed by Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and AIT. &copy; 1997</P>

<B><I>AD/HD:  What It Is.  What It Isn't.  What To Do.</I></B> is a video workshop and facilitator's guide that focuses on the problem of identifying Attention Deficit Disorder <I>and</I> avoiding misdiagnosing attention problems.  Not all attention problems are ADD.</P>

<H2>Program Segments</H2>

<P><B>Segment one</B> of the program introduces viewers to what ADD is and points out that not all inattentive behavior is ADD.  It outlines the basic approach needed to identify attention problems and the steps appropriate to gaining a meaningful dianosis.  We will also see a good example of a successful management strategy for a child with an attention disorder and learn more about <I>when</I> inattention may <I>not</I> be due to ADD.</P>

<P><B>Segment two</B> examines Case Study #1, Seth.  Seth and his parents are troubled by his inability to do well in school.  He is bright and well attuned to the needs and feelings of others, but he just cannot focus.  The smallest things will distract him and he constantly feels the need to move&#151;to fidget, stand, <I>be active</I>.  His desk is a mess and his handwriting is illegible.  He loves hands-on work but he seems totally disorganized otherwise.  Seth has ADD and we see the strategies developed to help Seth become successful in school.</P>

<P><B>Segment three</B> presents Case Study #2, Cameron, a first grader.  She also has trouble focusing on what is going on around her.  She is constantly watching other students to see what they are doing.  Cameron often gives wildly inappropriate responses to her teacher's question and seems confused.  She is well-behaved but seems disconnected.  Cameron does <I>not</I> have ADD&#151;she has a language processing problem.</P>

<P><B>Segment four</B> reviews the various issues of what ADD is and isn't and the various strategies that can be used to improve performance and self-esteem.</P>

<IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/adhd3.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<H2><I>AD/HD: What It Is.  What It Isn't.  What To Do.</I></H2>
<H3>Could you define and diagnose what is taking place in this scenario?</H3>

<P><B>Mom:</B>  When Seth got into pre-school, he was pretty rough with the other kids.  He was not a favorite and was seldom invited over to other kid's houses or birthday parties.  He had a great year in kindergarten.  He could work at his own pace at learning centers.  He also had a good third grade experience but the other years have been pretty awful.  We don't know what to do.  He is always busy at home&#133;he's captivated by gadgets, always taking things apart and putting them back together.  We think he's smart and he's got a heart of gold.  But we don't know why he's doing so badly in school.</P>

<P><B>Dad:</B>  I work with him on homework when I can, but he often forgets what homework he has, or I just can't take the battle of trying to get him to focus.  Sports have been an experience.  Every time a fly ball came to him, he was examining an ant hill or messing with his shoelaces.</P>

<P><B>Seth:</B>  I don't know.  The <I>one</I> thing I <I>like</I> about school is the science experiments.  Other subjects just kind of lose me.  I just&#133;drift off and start thinking about other stuff.  Like these solar panels I ordered from&#133;oh.  Oh, yeah, I forget my homework a lot or I do it and <I>then</I> can't find it in my desk or backpack.  I forgot one whole page of a math test once.  Another time, I filled in all the answers on this stupid computer sheet in the wrong place&#151;like putting answer two where answer three goes.  I don't know.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Shaping and defining our democracy.</H2>

<P><B><I>Civics at Work</I></B> is a powerful tool, combining video and CD-ROM to investigate the uses and functions of government and our role in shaping and defining our democracy.  Using examples from everyday life (a group of tenants forming an organization, a ride with a police officer, employer/employee interactions, students debating a foreign policy issue, etc.), we see how what we do mirrors and is a microcosm of our government in action.</P>

<P>The videos stimulate classroom discussion on a level that is rarely achieved with print alone.  The CD-ROMs extend the process by presenting our legacy of government in the historical context.  <I>U.S. Government: The First 200 Years</I> explores the changes in our government with interactive multimedia programs. Many interesting topics and extended activities examine the political parties, the impact of government on territorial expansion and immigration, and the effects of industrialization, to name only a few.

Five modules of economics instruction for students in grades 9&#150;12, post-secondary, and adult education courses</P>
<HR>

<H3>Journey with us to the world of economics - the one in everyone's home town!</H3>

<P>Contextual learning is what it's all about.  In the complex arena of economics we often hear references to interest, savings, consumption, profit, overhead, production, and a myriad other factors.  Without a context, they are just theories and fancy words!</P>

<P><B><I>Economics at Work</I></B> uses real-world examples (and charming narrators, who walk us through every stage of the process), to accomplish these prime goals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Interpret economic events through the application of economic concepts to the workplace, public policies, and everyday life.
<LI>Acquire the critical-thinking, decision-making, and collaboration skills needed for career success.
<LI>Examine the interrelated activities of individuals, companies, labor, and government.
<LI>Understand how the market system works in today's global economy.
<LI>Apply economics concepts to problem scenarios within seven occupational clusters.
</UL>

<P>Career-to-work curricula are more important than ever and <B><I>Economics at Work</I></B> creates a home-town atmosphere that plunges students right into the process&#151;what decisions would I need to make as an entrepreneur?  How would I control costs?  How could I become more innovative?  Should I invest&#133;and in equipment or new products?  Above all, how does an economy work?</P>

<P><B><I>Economics at Work</I></B> consists of five modules on video and laserdisc, teachers' guides, student guides, software for application activities in seven different career clusters, a classroom utilization component, a teacher training video, and a workshop handbook.  It was developed by AIT, the National Council on Economic Education, and a consortium of state education agencies.  &copy; 1996</P>

<H2>Modules</H2>

<P><IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/368produ.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Module 1&#151;Producing&#151;</B>introduces us to Market Street, USA.
<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>A bicycle shop is going out of business but understanding profit and loss, competition and production, and supply and demand leads to innovative solutions.
<LI>In the unpredictable computer industry we analyze the labor market, fixed and variable costs, and technology when faced with complex unemployment issues. 
<LI>How do supply and demand, relative prices, and international trade affect the athletic shoe industry?
</UL></P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/368excha.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Markets, opportunities, and transaction costs are involved in surprising ways when we purchase tickets for rock concerts, the NBA playoffs, or the Indy 500.
<LI>How do barter and exchange rates affect the decision-making process when U.S. car-makers import foreign parts?  
<LI>We work with a photographer who needs to borrow money for new equipment, and see how inflation affects fiscal and monetary policy.
</UL></P>

<P><BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/368consu.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Module 3&#151;Consuming&#151;</B>explains why prices rise and fall; supply and demand; equilibrium and price control policies; and complementary and substitute goods.
<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Spring break!  Why are prices for the same product higher or lower in different areas?
<LI>A construction company owner explains shortages and surplus, and why replacement cost is not necessarily the same as original cost.
<LI>Next, we investigate unemployment statistics and income levels; students must then analyze production costs and demand to adjust prices.
</UL></P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/368savin.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<B>Module 4&#151;Saving&#151;</B>takes us into the world of interest rates and loans.
<DD><UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Saving, spending and buying on credit: two students are faced with many choices and factors in planning to get the most for their money.
<LI>What is the role of the Federal Reserve Bank in regulating the flow of money?  How do fixed-interest loans compare to floating rate loans?
<LI>Changes in disposable income may affect people's spending and saving behavior   supply and demand apply to money, too!
</UL></P>

<P><BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/368inves.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Module 5&#151;Investing&#151;</B>delves into the complex area of investing: What is investing? What are the various kinds of investing? When should we invest?
<DD><UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Investing in human capital   come along as high school graduates do a cost/benefit analysis to make decisions about training and education.
<LI>What is the difference between present and future value?
<LI>Productivity and robots - what types of investment can play a role in upgrading industrial potential?

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Economics at Work</I><BR><SMALL>is a leap into the world of economics&#151;into our daily lives!</SMALL></H2>

<P>The forces that shape the complex interrelations of economics are brought to life through this highly engaging video and print series.  Using home-town examples and real-life interactions, students learn the ins and outs of economics&#151;the variables, decisions, and realities that form the basis or our economic life.</P>

<P>In contexts that students can relate to, <B><I>Economics at Work</I></B> takes us on a journey through every aspect of the consumer/business relationship.  <I>Producing, Exchanging, Consuming, Saving,</I> and <I>Investing</I>&#151;we all need an understanding of these basic forces and how they affect our lives.</P>

<P>Economics does not have to be dry, dull, and routine!  Capture the imagination of your students&#151;bring economics home to each and every one of them!</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=RIGHT>The original series, <B><I>American Legacy</I></B>, was a geographic and topical exploration of life in America&#151;its diversity, resources, political divisions, and natural features.  It has been one of the most successful series of its kind and now, a generation later, many changes have occurred.</P>

<P><B><I>The New Legacy</I></B> is an extraordinary teaching resource.  Together, the combination of the stunning scenes and narration from the video, the in-depth problem-solving activities of the CD-ROM, the extended activities and topics suggested in the teacher's guide, and the resource materials and discussion group format of the on-line Web service create a powerful classroom tool.  These elements provide students and teachers with an opportunity to explore America like never before.  America's geographic, cultural, and economic diversity is at the heart of what makes our country what it is and how we have evolved over time.</P>

<P>Rich in content, culturally sensitive, and instructionally versatile, <B><I>The New Legacy</I></B> emphasizes the concept of the interdependence of each region of the United States, as well as the qualities that make each region distinctive.</P>

<P>This series will be available as a pre-production lease.  All agencies who join the PPL will receive four years use for three years lease fee.  At renewal time, members qualify for a 25% discount and can buy the teacher's guide for the lowest discounted price.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Twelve 30-minute programs; Education reform and issues training on current theory for teachers, administrators, and parents.</P>
<HR>

<H3>Twelve interviews on the cutting edge of current theory and practice in education.</H3>

<P><B><I>Positive Insights on Education</I></B> is a compelling series of in-depth interviews highlighting some of the most important issues and critical ideas in education reform today.  The field of education never stops changing and professionals are under constant pressure to keep up.</P>

<P><B><I>Positive Insights on Education</I></B> introduces the people behind the headlines, books, and movements that challenge teachers, parents, and school systems to rethink their assumptions:
<UL>
<LI>Are the needs of at-risk students really any different from those of "normal" or even "gifted" students?
<LI>Will violence destroy public education?
<LI>What are collaborative school systems and do they work?
<LI>Are there effective alternatives to outcome-based education?
<LI>Are standardized tests really effective?  Is there another way?
<LI>Is bureaucracy strangling our school systems?
</UL></P>

<P>These are only a few of the many wide-ranging questions being asked.  The focus too often has been on students who "won't" learn or teachers who "can't" teach.  Perhaps the problems, and the solutions, are more complex&#151;and more deeply grounded in our society&#151;than we are willing to admit.  <B><I>Positive Insights on Education</I></B> documents truly original approaches, designed to deepen our insight and revolutionize basic attitudes.</P>

<P><B><I>Positive Insights on Education</I></B> includes two facilitator's guides (covering six sessions each) that profile the experts involved, give directions on setting up workshops or seminars to be used in conjunction with the twelve 30-minute programs, and follow-up questions to further stimulate debate and understanding.  The program was produced by Phi Delta Kappa, Bloomington, Indiana, in conjunction with AIT.  &copy; 1996</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/meier.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Deborah Meier <I>Collaborative Schools: Sharing the Power</I></B><BR>
Ms Meier focuses on the idea that schools should view themselves as membership communities in which students, teachers, and parents work collaboratively; a "membership community," not a "service organization." (28:55)</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/levin.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Henry Levin <I>Accelerated Schools: Raising the Speed Limit</I></B><BR>
Dr. Levin argues that no student need be subjected to the "remedial" approach and that all students have the same basic needs for stimulation and creative thinking; at-risk students excel under accelerated learning just as all other students. (29:37)</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/prothrow.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Deborah B Prothrow-Stith<I> Youth Violence: A New Public Health Issue</I></B><BR>
Dr. Prothrow-Stith confronts the issue of violence in the schools and presents it as a public health issue; what are the roots of school violence?  Is it an outgrowth of our society?  How do we deal with it in the very real world of the neighborhood school? (29:10)</P>

<B>Willard R. Daggett <I>American Schools: Catching Up to the Future</I></B><BR>
Dr. Daggett propels us into the debate on why American schools need to do a better job of preparing students for the world in which they will work; is American education caught in a time-warp? (29:31)</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/spady.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>William G. Spady <I>Outcome-Based Education: Panacea or Poison</I></B><BR>
Dr. Spady  concentrates on outcome-based attitudes in education: "Anything that's new and isn't old and familiar is being challenged, if not outlawed&#133; [and] that leaves education in an extremely vulnerable position." (29:18)</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/simonds.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Robert L. Simonds <I>Beyond OBE: Seeking Common Ground</I></B><BR>
Dr. Simonds argues that the needs of traditional Christian families are not being met by the public schools: "If we can get schools back to what they used to be, that's what made America famous anyway&#133;our education system." (29:10)</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/shakesha.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Charol Shakeshaft <I>Preventing Sexual Abuse in Schools</I></B><BR>
Dr. Shakeshaft  focuses on the problem of sexual abuse and sexual harassment&#133;from data gathered nationwide, Dr. Shakeshaft has found that it occurs in all kinds of districts, to all kinds of students, and at all grade levels.</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/neil.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Monty Neil <I>Alternatives to Standardized Testing</I></B><BR>
Dr. Neil argues that standardized testing is harmful to the educational health of a majority of students.  He proposes an alternative assessment system that provides teachers with a more effective evaluative process to improve learning, curriculum, and teaching.</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/coles.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Robert Coles <I>Moral Development of Children</I></B><BR>
Dr. Coles discusses moral development in education; what is the place of teaching values in modern-day America? Dr. Coles believes that there are both positive and negative moral lessons being taught in our schools and urges a closer look at the values that we convey.</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/sternber.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Robert Sternberg <I>Intelligence, Creativity, and Thinking Styles</I></B><BR>
Dr. Sternberg speaks to the question of the "single trait notion of intelligence."  IQ testing is fundamental to American education; but what are the true components of intelligence?</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/howard.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Jeff Howard <I>Redefining Intelligence</I></B><BR>
Dr. Howard contends that our belief structure of innate intelligence has had devastating results: "smart is not something that you are, but something you get."  He calls for an alternative paradigm of development.
</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><IMG SRC="/images/ahead/first/moe.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Terry Moe <I>Institutional Reform and the Future of Schools</I></B><BR>
Dr. Moe argues that schools are being buried by bureaucracy, making it impossible for educators to teach effectively.  He argues that schools must be taken out of politics, allowing parents and teachers to develop the most effective ways of teaching. </P>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Moving into the 21st Century&#151;<BR><SMALL>creative solutions to the most difficult educational problems.</SMALL></H2>

<P>Critics have subjected our school system to a withering barrage of fire:  The schools are violent and unsafe&#133;students aren't learning enough&#133;traditional morality is being undermined&#133;tax dollars should go to private schools, who do the job better.  There are those who feel the entire system is falling apart.</P>

<P><B><I>Positive Insights on Education</I></B> provides a thorough guide to the most compelling recent thinking on education reform, in a question-and-answer format conducted by program host Dr. Phillip Harris, director of the Center for Professional Development and Services for Phi Delta Kappa International.  The videos are designed to address the concerns not only of educators, but of parents and every individual concerned about quality education today.</P>

<H3>How do diversity, ethnicity, and cultural pluralism operate in our culture?</H3>

<P><BR CLEAR=RIGHT><B><I>Respecting Diversity</I></B> presents many actual classroom situations to demonstrate why multiculturalism is important, offering innovative ideas in exploring the richness of culture and ethnicity.
<UL>
<LI>What is the difference between culture, ethnicity, and race?
<LI>Do children in a classroom respond (or fail to respond), interact (or fail to interact), due to cultural differences, and not necessarily because of our preconceived expectations?
<LI>What is the importance of religion and language in the multicultural framework?
</UL></P>

<P><B><I>Respecting Diversity</I></B> offers a variety of ways to use the material.  As broadcast programming it is a tool for self-paced, in-school staff development; it can also be used as a workshop program.  Wither way, <B><I>Respecting Diversity</I></B> meets these key goals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>To provide strategies for developing multicultural curricula.
<LI>To help teachers be responsive, well-informed, and sensitive to the issues confronting students from diverse backgrounds.
<LI>To suggest effective skills and strategies for teachers working with multicultural classrooms.
<LI>To provide a theoretical framework for work in multicultural education.
</UL>

<P><B><I>Respecting Diversity</I></B> includes a 50-page facilitator's guide with video tie-ins (including breaks for full-day and half-day workshops) and handout masters for each aspect of the program.  The program and companion guide were produced by Del Rey Communications, Chicago, in association with AIT. &copy; 1996</P>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P><B><I>Respecting Diversity</I></B> presents the wide sweep of multiculturalism.  We see the positive side of a multicultural curriculum in action as a Native American woman introduces children to the process and philosophy behind making a "button blanket."  The students make their own blankets, and in so doing describe their own lives.  Suddenly, Native American culture merges with mainstream and other cultures, each retaining its identity, but seeing the world through new eyes.</P>

<H2>Program Segments</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>Segment 1</B>
<DD>Involves viewers by getting them to think about their own cultural background: " List the top four cultural identifiers which best describe who you are."
<DT><B>Segment 2</B>
<DD>Introduces more complex cultural identifiers: "Try using thin/thick descriptors to define your own culture."
<DT><B>Segment 3</B>
<DD>Brings family backgrounds into the equation: "Describe the ways you and your family regard your own cultural orientation."
<DT><B>Segment 4 </B>
<DD>Confronts street language in the school: "If the content is accurate and communication clear, should a teacher accept linguistically different English?"
<DT><B>Segment 5</B>
<DD>Raises the question, do we sometimes exclude others on the basis of mistaken impressions?: "How can teachers and students change 
communication patterns so that students feel more involved?"
<DT><B>Segment 6</B>
<DD>Stimulates sensitivity to the needs of others: "What concerns about religious observance should be respected in school?"
<DT><B>Segment 7</B>
<DD>Puts viewers in others' shoes: "How can we use the experience of a Puerto Rican immigrant in a multicultural approach to thematic exploration?"
<DT><B>Segment 8</B>
<DD>Broadens the learning experience through interaction with another culture: "The Button Blanket Project: A lesson in participating in another world."
<DT><B>Segment 9</B>
<DD>Tests communication skills with all students: "What strategies can you use to address differences in learning style and social interaction?"
<DT><B>Segment 10</B>
<DD>Asks, Is multiculturalism necessary?: "Some critics feel that multiculturalism may disunite America.  What do you think?"

Four 15-minute programs for students in grades 7&#150;12</P>

<H3>The tangled web of economic growth, geometric population expansion, and environmental protection.</H3>

<P><BR CLEAR=RIGHT><B><I>World in the Balance</I></B> takes us on a tour of the world to explore the interrelated problems of population expansion, the inevitable development that follows in a consumer world, and the need to generate a sensible response to environmental damage.  Beautifully photographed, this wide-ranging investigation identifies the many elements of this critical issue.  In a balanced and thoughtful approach, Cliff Lonsdale guides us through the maze of conflicting interests and answers.</P>

<P>Who are the players, what are the stakes, is degradation inevitable? <B><I>World in the Balance</I></B> presents numerous viewpoints that pose often diametrically opposed responses.  Will free-market forces resolve the problems on their own?  Controlled growth, no growth?  Government policy vs. local response?  Nothing shows our interrelatedness more than exploring how every decision we make in the modern world affects every economy, every culture, every environment.</P>

<P><B><I>World in the Balance</I></B> consists of four 15-minute videos, plus a teacher's guide, designed for in-depth classroom discussion and review.  The program is a production of Black Ink Productions. &copy; 1996</P>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P><B>Part 1: <I>6.4 Billion: Will the Earth Drown in People?</I></B>  opens in India, with the basic needs and harsh realities of life in a developing nation.  Soon all developing nations will be entering the consumer age; since development is inevitable, will the earth be slowly strangled as a result?</P>

<P><B>Part 2: <I>Opposing Options/Conflicting Answers</I></B> presents the many conflicting views that reasonable people have on the most basic questions.  Will the free-market economy heal all wounds, address all problems through the power of marketplace forces?  Is government policy, unifying purpose and setting goals, the only curb on greed and devastation?</P>

<P><B>Part 3: <I>Government as Hero, Government as  the Problem</I></B> assesses several strategies for balancing growth with environmental health.  What works, what doesn't?  Subsidies, incentives, governmental regulation in general are explored, along with the national government/local action scenarios.  Who controls growth and how&#151;what are the alternatives to misguided policies?</P>

<P><B>Part 4:  <I>Symbiotic Solutions:</I></B>  The Local Connection  presents several alternatives that demonstrate local solutions to global problems:  a village in Zimbabwe uses tourism to stop the slaughter of poaching; a group of industrial plants in Denmark create a symbiotic relationship that turns one plant's pollution into another plant's useful product.  Innovative answers can restore ecological balance.</P>

<P><B><I>World in the Balance</I></B> is a beautifully photographed examination of the dichotomy of economic growth and environmental protection.  Cliff Lonsdale travels the globe to demonstrate the problems and some novel solutions.  From India to China, Zimbabwe to Ontario, Denmark to Maryland, <B><I>World in the Balance</I></B> discusses the role of government, free-market forces, local action, environmental activism, and industrial self-regulation as it probes today's solutions.  The problems may grow geometrically if we do not develop innovative answers today.</P>

<HR>
<P>Since the text that you enter into the text box on the <I>Submit a Tip to AIT.Net</I> page will be placed in an HTML file, you can use HTML commands to visually enhance your tip.</P>
<P></P>
<P>HTML commands are plain text typed inbetween less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) symbols.  All of the commands that you will be interested in using will have both a beginning and ending command.  The ending command differs from the beginning command only by the addition of a slash to the right of the less than symbol (&lt;/HTML Command&gt;).</P>
<P></P>
<P>The following list shows some of the HTML commands, and how they will affect the text:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Bold-face:</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;B&gt;Bold-Face&lt;/B&gt;
<LI><I>Italis: </I> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;I&gt;Italics&lt;/I&gt;
<LI><BIG>Increase type size: </BIG> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;BIG&gt;Increase type size&lt;/BIG&gt;
<LI><SMALL>Decrease type size:</SMALL> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;SMALL&gt;Decrease type size&lt;/SMALL&gt;
<LI>Super<SUP>Script</SUP>: &nbsp; &nbsp; Super&lt;SUP&gt;Script&lt;/SUP&gt;
<LI>Sub<SUB>Script</SUB>: &nbsp; &nbsp; Sub&lt;SUB&gt;Script&lt;/SUB&gt;
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Additionally of interest, there are some characters which are not recognized by HTML as simple characters.  To use these characters, you need to know their equivalent HTML named value.  Some of these characters which you may find useful are cited below, with their equivalent HTML named value:</P>
<UL>
<LI>&amp; Ampersand:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;amp;
<LI>&lt; Less Than: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp;lt;
<LI>&gt; Greater Than: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;gt;
<LI>&copy; Copyright: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $amp;copy;
<LI>&reg; Registered Trademark: &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;reg;
<LI>&#153; Tradmark: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;#153;
<LI>&#151; Em-Dash: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;#151;
<LI>&#150; En-Dash: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;#150;
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>These commands should prove helpful for accenting your tips, but this is only the tip of the iceberg.  For those of you who are motivated self-learners, I would suggest the O'Reilly &amp; Associates book <I>HTML: The Definitive Guide</I>.  This is the book with the koala on the cover.  On-Line HTML primers also exist, a simple search on the World Wide Web for <I>"Learning HTML"</I> using <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A> yeilded <A HREF="http://wwwhost.utexas.edu/learn/pub/html.html">Learning to Publish - Learning HTML</A></P>

<H2>Teaching Background:</H2>
<P>While I am not an educator, I have found that teaching comprises a surprisingly large amount of my time.  As the Web-Master for AIT, I have found a need and employee interest in educating some of AIT's employees on the Internet, and the development of Web Pages.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To this end, I have offered HTML training classes to those employees who have indicated an interest in developing their own Home-Pages on the World Wide Web.  These classess were well recieved, and everyone who took the course gained, at minimum, a working knowledge of the HTML language, and how the internet works.</P>
<H2>Personal Interests:</H2>
<P>One never stops learning, but I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1994.</P>
<P></P>
<P>After graduation, I accepted employment with the Flight Simulation department of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace.  While working for McDonnell Douglas, I was responsible for the maintenance and upgrade of some of the Image Generation systems used for "Out-The-Window" visuals and target generation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In February of 1996, I opted to be closer to my fiance&#233; and her family, taking this position at AIT.  My current position is that of Software Developer and Web-Master, working to bring a strong Internet presence to AIT.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>AIT.Net News, Fall 1995</H1>
<HR>

<H1>Tips from teachers</H1>

<P>Tips from teachers topped the list when we asked educators what they wanted in an online service. In response, AIT has created <A HREF="/tips/"><B>AIT.Net Tips</B></A>,  an online tips exchange for teachers, and <B>Tips from teachers</B>, a section of "AIT.Net News" that includes some of the tips received through <A HREF="/tips/"><B>AIT.Net Tips</B></A> or by fax, phone, or mail.</P>

<P>A classroom tip is anything: any hint, activity, strategy, game, resource, project, or lesson plan that you think will help another teacher. It's easy to share or seek a tip. Simply access <A HREF="/tips/"><B>AIT.Net Tips</B></A>.</P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50%>

<P><B>When were you born?</B> submitted by Rhonda Hutto, Lawrence County Center of Technology, Lawrence County, Moulton, Alabama. In addition to completing in-class projects based on <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><B>Applied Communication</B></A> materials, Ms. Hutto's students work on career-oriented research papers and literature.</P>

<P>One tip that I learned at an <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><B>Applied Communication</B></A> workshop is to have the class silently organize themselves according to their birthdates. I use this activity when I'm teaching Module 1, Lesson 2 (Barriers that Affect Workplace Communication). Because my class is small, I take them outside and ask them to organize themselves by birthdate without using words or writing. They usually do a very good job. Since the lesson is taught soon after the school year begins, it's a fun activity for the kids and is also an icebreaker of sorts.</P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50%>

<P><B>Creating Billboards and Yellow Page Ads</B> submitted by Rose M. Kipp, Wyalusing High School, Wyalusing Area School District, Wyalusing, Pennsylvania. Grade levels 9-12 are offered <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><B>Applied Communication</B></A>, along with a complementary literature component. Kipp notes that "most of [my students] desire to seek better jobs and many want to leave the area.... About one third of my classes attend the local vo-tech school. Some are, as seniors, involved in the on-the-job training or youth apprenticeship programs. Many are simply looking for a purpose . . . These courses are valuable for all these groups."</P>

<P>One of the things my kids enjoyed was designing an advertisement like a billboard and an ad for the yellow pages for a business they'd like to work for in the future. They highlighted the things the company would offer. The billboard posters and yellow page ads were displayed around the room during open house and attracted a lot of positive attention. These kinds of kids often have a better idea of what they want to do as a career goal than someone going on to college. It was good for them to get these ideas down in an artistic way.</P>

<HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50%>

<P><B>"Take This Job . . . "</B> submitted by Susan Bizzozero, Yough High School, Herminie, Pennsylvania. Susan Bizzozero uses <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><B>Applied Communication</B></A> as supplemental material in two courses, Career Prep 11 and Career Prep 12. Local businesses are involved in guest presentations and mock interviews.</P>

<P>"Take This Job " is designed to give the career prep student practical experience in obtaining a job. To supplement the present curriculum, we use a Total Quality Learning plan that is divided into five stages: deciding upon a career, creating a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, applying for a position, taking a job interview, and preparing an action plan. Our goal is for each career prep student to graduate with a career portfolio that consists of the following:
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>A personal inventory of job skills, experience, and preferences.
<LI>A r&eacute;sum&eacute; (6-10 copies on linen paper).
<LI>Three letters of reference.
<LI>Interviews with employees, employers, and classroom speakers.
<LI>Reference material (models of letters of application and cover letters, models of job applications and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, and a database of contacts).
<LI>Mock interview assessment.
<LI>Assessments by self, a peer, and a professional.
<LI>Computer disk containing the r&eacute;sum&eacute;, references, and a database of contacts.
<LI>Plan of action.
</OL></P>

<P>During the initial stage of our plan, students use a variety of sources to determine career interests and options. For example, a self-assessment inventory is used to determine occupational strengths, interests, and experience. Once suitable career areas are chosen, students learn more about them through research by using written sources and observing and interviewing others. Each student assesses his or her findings, all of which are kept in a career portfolio to determine if a particular career choice is suitable for him or her.</P>

<P>In the second stage, students write and create professional job-quality r&eacute;sum&eacute;s using the five Macintoshes that are available. The r&eacute;sum&eacute; is saved on a disk so it can be updated at any time during or after high school. If a student is applying for a job, he or she can obtain a professional copy of the r&eacute;sum&eacute; through the English teacher. Upon graduation, each student who completes the course receives 12 copies of the r&eacute;sum&eacute; printed on linen paper for use in seeking future employment. Each student is also encouraged to obtain three letters of reference for the career portfolio.</P>

<P>In the third stage, students hunt for jobs through a variety of sources, including local newspapers, employment offices, and contact people. Using the Macintosh to write cover letters, students apply for up to three positions which interest them. At this point, students focus on the importance of good writing skills in developing persuasive letters of application. These letters are also stored on the student's personal disk for future reference.</P>

<P>In the fourth stage, students learn how to speak, act, and dress during job interviews. Books, videotapes, and peer evaluations are used to prepare students for "Mock Interview Day." On mock interview day, members from the community conduct mock interviews of career prep students. Students are assessed by the professional interviewer as if they were applying for a real position. The professional and self-assessments of the mock interview help students evaluate, refine, and improve their job interviewing skills.</P>

<P>In the final stage, each student develops a plan for seeking career employment. Each student then determines what steps to take next, how to take those steps, what realities need to be faced, and what his or her vision is for the future. This, too, is kept in the career portfolio.</P>

<P>It is important for all students to learn <A HREF="http://www.bio.com/hr/search/search_1.html"><B>job-seeking skills</B></A>, but for the career prep student it is essential. A goal of <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><B>Applied Communication</B></A> is to make students aware of a workplace that stresses Total Quality Management, "a perfect product every time"; therefore, the use of a Total Quality Learning format benefits career prep students by serving as a model for TQM in the workplace and providing a means of refining and upgrading students' job-seeking skills. The result: students are better prepared to obtain and maintain a job in today's changing workplace.</P>

<H2>A perfect fit</H2>

<H3><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c317.htm"><B>Workplace Readiness</B></A> develops SCANS Skills</H3>

<P>Where would a resource that covers problem solving, teamwork, and self-management skills fit in your curriculum? And why should you consider sharing it with your students? The answers are simple. AIT's <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c317.htm"> <B>Workplace Readiness</B></A> can complement nearly any course because its emphasis is on preparing today's learners for tomorrow's workplace.</P>

<P>When you integrate "Workplace Readiness" into your curriculum, you will help your students master the five competences that lie at the heart of successful job performance, regardless of the knowledge required: the effective use of resources, interpersonal skills, information, systems, and technology.</P>

<P>These competencies were identified by the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) in "What Work Requires of Schools: A SCANS Report for America 2000" and formed the basis for "Workplace Readiness." The following chart correlates the materials presented in "Workplace Readiness" to the five competencies recommended by the SCANS report.</P>

<H2>Going online</H2>
<H3>A guide to getting started on the Internet</H3>
<P>(Part One in a Series)</P>

<P><B>Hey, wait a minute! I'm online already. Why should I read this?</B> You're right--you probably know all about getting started, but we've included this article for those who want basic information <B>for someone else...a friend, a co-worker, or the principal down the hall.</B></P>

<P>Have you considered going online, but are not quite sure where to start? This article is the first in a series designed to give you the information you need to get started on the information highway. Future articles will cover choosing an Internet provider, exploring the Internet "toolbox," finding funding for online access, and other aspects of building an onramp to the Information Highway for educators and students.</P>

<P><B>What You Need To Get Online</B><BR>
To go online, you'll need a computer, a modem, telecommunications software, a telephone line, and an Internet provider. The following information is intended to provide an overview of what you should expect and look for. Specific requirements and costs for these items will vary depending on your needs and existing equipment.</P>

<P><B><BIG><BIG>1.</BIG></BIG> A computer.</B> Almost any computer will do. If you have a Mac or PC running Windows, you'll be able to use the more friendly graphical telecommunications software. While even an old Apple IIE can run standard software, it can't run the more popular and easy-to-use graphical interfaces.</P>

<P><B>Costs:</B> Basic desktop computers begin in the $1,000 to $2,000 range; a basic multimedia package will add $300 to $400. If you're buying a computer that runs Windows, be sure to ask about the video card. A 486 computer needs a minimum 1 megabyte RAM (random-access memory) and at least a 32-bit video card.</P>

<P><B><BIG><BIG>2.</BIG></BIG> A modem.</B> The modem is the device that dials a telephone number and allows your computer to communicate on the telephone line. Modem speeds are measured in baud rates or bytes per second (bps). Get the fastest modem that you can--it will save you money in the long run. At a minimum, consider purchasing a 14400 bps modem or even a 28800 bps modem (these are usually referred to as "fourteen four" or "twenty-eight eight" modems). Modem speed determines how quickly you can access online information. Double your modem speed, and you should roughly double your speed of access. An external modem--one that is separate from the computer--is preferable to an internal one. Consider choosing a name brand with a 30-day return policy.</P>

<P><B>Costs:</B> 14400 bps modems begin around $100; 28800 bps modems are closer to $200.</P>

<P><B><BIG><BIG>3.</BIG></BIG> Telecommunications software.</B> Telecommunications software enables your modem and computer to talk to each other and lets you interact with the network. Software with a graphical interface is easy to use, and is often provided free from an Internet service provider, but it can usually be used with only that provider. Standard "terminal emulator" software is available on all computers and works for most providers, but it may be harder to learn and use than graphical software.</P>

<P><B>Costs:</B> Software with a graphical interface is often free from an Internet provider. Internet starter kits include the software and begin around $25.00.</P>

<P><B><BIG><BIG>4.</BIG></BIG> A telephone line.</B> A regular telephone line will work for most online users. (Refer to your phone book for instructions to disable call waiting.) The telephone line can be commercial or residential. Remember, when you dial into a system for online access, you will be using the phone line, and no one else will be able to use the telephone for the duration of your use.</P>

<P><B>Costs:</B> No additional cost, if the Internet provider you choose can be accessed with a local telephone number.</P>

<P><B><BIG><BIG>5.</BIG></BIG> An Internet provider.</B> The phone number your modem dials connects you to a company or organization that provides access to the Internet. Internet providers include freenets, colleges and universities, state or local government, and commercial systems. Freenets are local community bulletin board systems whose services are either free or available for a very low cost. Call your local library or computer store for current information on freenets in your area. Many colleges and universities have Internet connections and provide user accounts for students, employees, and alumni. For state and local government providers, call the state or local department of education to find out if either provides access to the Internet for educators. Commercial systems can be accessed from all over the country for a fee. Most provide free trials and software to access them.</P>

<P><B>Costs:</B> Many commercial Internet providers provide free startup and 10 free hours of use. Monthly fees range from $4.95 to $23.00, the number of free hours per month varies, and charges for additional hours range from $2.00 to $9.00 per hour.</P>

<P><B>TROUBLE</B>SHOOTING</P>

<P>Remember to write down the "help line" telephone numbers for your computer, modem, and software and keep them handy. The people answering those lines are employed to assist you and are your best bet for support.</P>

<P>Adapted from "A Roadmap to Getting Started on the Information Highway" by CalTIP, a joint project of Far West Laboratory and the Santa Clara County Office of Education, funded through the California Department of Education, and from "Basic Internet" &copy;1995, The Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>FAST</B>FORWARD</P>
<H2>When more than money matters . . . </H2>
<H3>Introduce your students to "Economics at Work"</H3>

<P>What do ice cream, high-top sneakers, and mufflers from Mexico have in common with night school and interest rates? The economics of living and working underlies nearly everything in the world, from the newest flavor launched by <A HREF="http://infonews.com/franchise/baskin"><B>Baskin-Robbins</B></A> to an increase in <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/fstc/principals/chase_manhattan.html"><B>Chase Manhattan</B></A>'s lending rate. Your students may understand the costs involved in buying the latest style of high-top sneakers, but do they understand the costs and benefits involved in attending night school?</P>

<P>You know that <A HREF="http://econwpa.wustl.edu/EconFAQ/EconFAQ.html"><B>economics</B></A> is more than money matters--it's a way of understanding life that can give your students an edge in the workplace and throughout their lives. Now you can help your students develop that edge with <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm"><B>Economics at Work</B></A>, a one-semester interactive course developed by the Agency for Instructional Technology and the National Council on Economic Education.</P>

<P>Each of the five modules in the "Economics at Work" curriculum is organized around a central economic activity: producing, exchanging, consuming, saving, and investing. Each module contains up to eight lessons spanning from 12 to 20 class periods of 50 minutes each. Taken together, the five modules provide a comprehensive semester-long experience (75 class periods) in applied economics that meets the guidelines of the SCANS reports and answers the call for a school-to-work curriculum. Lesson content has been drawn from "A Framework for Teaching the Basic Concepts, with Scope and Sequence Guidelines" (1995), the National Council's Master Curriculum Guide in Economics.</P>

<P>When you bring "Economics at Work" into your classroom, your students will see people like themselves involved in real-life situations. The interactive video included in 20 of the 27 lessons gives your students the ability to interact with the stories as they unfold on screen, answering questions and choosing options to solve problems that occur at home and on the job. This interaction will help your students realize how economic concepts and trends, such as the following ones, can affect their own lives and careers.</P>

<P><B>The long-term shift from goods-producing to service-producing employment is expected to continue</B>, according to the <A HREF="http://www.bls.gov"><B>Bureau of Labor Statistics</B></A>, with service industries accounting for 24.5 million of the 26.4 million jobs that are expected to be added during the 1992-2005 period. Although the overall number of manufacturing jobs will decrease, some industries will be adding new jobs. These industries produce newspapers, medical instruments, plastic products, and other goods related to the service sector of the economy.</P>

<P>In <B>Module 1, Producing,</B> your students will learn about the activities needed to transform resources into goods and services that satisfy individual and collective wants.  The production of goods and services may be from material resources, such as the leather and rubber needed to make high-top sneakers, or human resources, such as the knowledge needed to run a machine. As students complete the eight lessons in Module 1, they will
<UL>
<LI>look to the shirts on their backs for a lesson in efficiency,
<LI>see how pretzels put the fizz in soft drink sales, and
<LI>watch a bike shop shift gears in its race to survive.
</UL></P>

<P><IMG SRC="/images/pictures/more_tony.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
<I>In the lesson "Personal Best" in Module 1, Anthony learns that profits are a message that a business is doing something right.</I></P>

<P>In one lesson, "Personal Best," Anthony and Kim must start looking for jobs when Mrs. Terhune decides to close her bike shop. As the co-workers apply for positions elsewhere, they--and your students--learn that the ability to earn profits is the driving force of a market economy. Students become active participants in the story as they answer questions (Where should Anthony begin his job search? What could Mrs. Terhune do to increase her profits?) and learn how their answers may affect the situation.</P>

<P><B>The exchange of goods and services can involve transaction costs.</B> The costs of trading with another country for goods or services can include an unfavorable exchange rate or added transportation time. An unintended cost of domestic manufacturing activities can include the cost of handling the discarded containers and packaging that account for 32 percent of all material in America's landfills, according to the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov"><B>Environmental Protection Agency</B></A>.</P>

<P>The four lessons in "Module 2, Exchanging," cover the activities needed to deliver what is produced to consumers. Students will learn that this exchange may involve goods, such as tickets to a concert, or services, such as the time and effort they'll put in for paychecks. As they work through the module, students will
<UL>
<LI>see how inflation can let the air out of their earnings,
<LI>consider who really pays when they take out the trash, and
<LI>travel the world for parts to build the "all-American" car.
</UL></P>

<P>In the lesson "Build You a 'Vette?" your students will travel to Mexico as they consider whether a parts buyer for an American car manufacturer should buy American or accept a bid from a foreign country. This lesson focuses on money as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value; on foreign exchange rates; and on the costs and benefits of foreign trade.</P>

<P><B>Prices for some goods can be affected by state and federal taxes. High prices can lead to improvements in related goods</B>. In 1994 gasoline taxes varied from 7.5 percent in Georgia to 23.7 percent in Nebraska, according to the "Statistical Abstract of the United States." The high gas prices caused by the 1973 oil embargo prompted U.S. car manufacturers to respond to buyer preference for more fuel-efficient vehicles and improve the fuel efficiency of American cars an average of 51 percent, from 13.3 miles per gallon in 1973 to 20.1 mpg in 1991, according to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California.</P>

<P>The activities needed to satisfy the desire of people to consume are covered in <B>Module 3, Consuming</B>. In six lessons, Module 3 explains why prices for goods and services vary from business to business, state to state, and country to country. As students work through the activities, they will
<UL>
<LI>scour the seas of the market for high-tech pirates and illegal CDs,
<LI>see why discouraged workers are out of the employment picture, and 
<LI>understand why customers always pay more when one company controls the monopoly board.
</UL></P>
 
<P>The lesson "What Can a Government Do?" introduces students to the role that government plays in the economy by providing public goods that are characterized by shared consumption and nonexclusion. Students also learn how governmental regulations can affect productivity and costs and how governments may intervene in markets when externalities-secondary or unintended consequences--exist. Instead of an interactive video, this lesson presents students with three case studies. In "Manuel Goes to the Movies," students consider how the limited number of movie tickets indicates that movie attendance is an exclusive activity if the theater sells out, some consumers will be excluded. In the second case study, "SeaFree," students learn about productivity when they form groups and play the role of employees in the packaging department of a large pharmaceutical company. In the third study, "The Saga of Goodestock," students consider the positive and negative externalities created when Sally Goode hosts a rock festival at her cotton farm.</P>

<P><B>Saving and borrowing patterns can have long-term effects on its economy</B>. A reduced savings rate will reduce the funds available for personal and business investments. In the United States, the national savings rate slipped from 9.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in the 1960s to 3.6 percent in the 1980s, according to the Congressional Budget Office. And while Americans on average are saving less, the American government is borrowing more. The national debt has mushroomed from $43 billion in 1940 to nearly $4.7 trillion in 1994.</P>

<P><B>Module 4, Saving,</B> focuses on the activities and institutions needed to satisfy the desire of people to consume less now so that they can consume more later. In four lessons, Module 4 explains how the borrowing and saving activities of people work together to form the market for loanable funds. As students complete the activities in Module 4, they will
<UL>
<LI>learn to speak the language of lenders, 
<LI>build their own budgets, and 
<LI>uncover the costs of buying on credit.
</UL></P>
 
<P>In the lesson "Why Save?" students learn that funds are transferred from savers to borrowers through banks and other financial institutions that act as intermediaries and charge interest for their services. In the video segment, students consider whether Laura should buy a used car, buy a new computer, pay tuition for tech school, or keep her money in her savings account. As they work through the options, students realize how every decision to buy or save involves an opportunity cost.</P>

<P><B>Investing in human capital can yield impressive returns</B>. In 1994 high school graduates with no college education earned an average of $465 per week. High school graduates who completed associate's degrees earned an average of $572, and graduates with bachelor's degrees averaged $821 per week, according to the <A HREF="http://www.bls.gov"><B>Bureau of Labor Statistics</B></A>.</P>

<P><B>Module 5, Investing,</B> covers the economic activity in which people and businesses engage to increase their resources and productivity. Several of the five lessons in this module focus on the value of considering people as investments. Students will realize that one of their most important resources stares back at them when they look in a mirror. As students work through the activities, they will
<UL>
<LI>catch up on the careers of four high school graduates, 
<LI>take five steps to get a jump on the job market, and 
<LI>learn how to survive in the high-tech world of the future.
</UL></P>

<P>The lesson "Invasion of the Robots" introduces students to the idea that businesses can increase productivity by investing in new technology and by improving the human capital of their workers. Through the video segments, students will help two lab managers decide how they should meet the increased demand for lab services--Should the lab buy the latest equipment and lay off one of the technicians?</P>

<P><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm"><B>Economics at Work</B></A> sets the principles and concepts of economics in an everyday or workplace context and challenges students to draw on a range of information, knowledge, and skills to manage problems, often in cooperation with one another. AIT's newest resource will give your students real-world, hands-on applications of economics concepts they can use today and throughout their lives. If you would like to receive a video overview of <B>Economics at Work,</B> give AIT a call at (800) 457-4509 and ask for the <B>Economics at Work</B> video mailer.</P>

<H3>AIT and CCE join forces to develop multimedia curriculum</H3>

<P>AIT has joined forces with the <A HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~cce"><B>Center for Civic Education</B></A> to give students a challenging curriculum in applied civics and government. Using new technologies and proven methods of instruction, AIT and CCE are developing "Workplace Civics & Government," a comprehensive multimedia series scheduled to be available in the spring of 1997.</P>

<P>The semester-long course is designed to help secondary students better understand civics and government and the social, organizational, and technological systems of which they are a part. "Workplace Civics & Government" will allow students to apply learning to virtual workplace experiences. The curriculum will be organized into five modules, each focusing on one of the following five questions:<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>What is government and what should it do?
<LI>What are the foundations of the American political system?
<LI>How does the government established by the Constitution embody the principles of American democracy?
<LI>What is the relationship of American politics and government to world affairs?
<LI>What are the roles of the citizen in the American political system?
</OL></P>

<P>Videodiscs will be used to present realistic workplace and civic settings, inviting scenarios, graphics, and high-quality animation. (Linear video is also available.) Each module will have a corresponding student resource guide and an annotated teacher's guide. An accompanying CD-ROM will feature illustrative problem scenarios from seven career clusters, with a menu that directs students to material relevant to each module.</P>

<P>Modules will include from six to ten lessons each, to be taught over twelve to twenty 50-minute class periods. Together, the five modules will provide a comprehensive 75-class period (semester-long) applied civics and government experience.</P>

<P>"Workplace Civics & Government" is being designed to enhance civic competence and enhance workplace competencies as identified by the SCANS report. The curriculum will include activities that encourage students to develop critical thinking skills, broaden students' perspectives on the world of work, and are adaptable for non-traditional students (the linear videos include closed captioning).</P>

<P>For more information on attending or hosting one of these workshops, call <A HREF="MAILTO:mjlip@ait.net">Mary Jane Lipp</A> at (800) 457-4509, extension 255.</P>

<B>Let AIT Work for You</B><BR>

<P>AIT is developing a new series of practical classroom workshops, including workshops in integrative mathematics.  These new resources are being created to help you develop the professional within and better meet your students' needs.  Future offerings could also include training tailored to meet your specific needs.  Look for further details in future issues of "AIT.Net News."</P>

<P><B>Staff Development Resources</B><BR>
AIT offers a wide range of staff development resources, from <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c366.htm"><B>Managing the Disruptive Classroom</B></A> and <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c344.htm"><B>Caring for Children</B></A> to <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c373.htm"><B>The Road to School-to-Work: A Map for Implementation</B></A> and <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c371.htm"><B>Dorothy Rich's Families & Schools</B></A>.

<P>The roles and duties of teacher aides/assistants have evolved and become more complex since they were introduced in the 1950s. In today's schools, they can more accurately  be described as paraeducators, as they participate in all phases of the instructional process and in the delivery of other direct educational services to students and their parents.</P>

<P><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c385.htm"><B>Before the Bell Rings: What Every Paraeducator Should Know</B></A> provides a foundation on which school districts can build to implement ongoing professional-development programs for paraeducators in preschool, elementary, and secondary education. The 58-minute videotape is divided into six parts, each of which should be viewed separately. The topics addressed on the tape are
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>team building
<LI>roles and responsibilities of teachers and paraeducators
<LI>professional and ethical responsibilities of paraeducators
<LI>communication and problem solving
<LI>behavior management
</UL></P>

<P>"Before the Bell Rings" has been derived from a competency-based curriculum developed for paraeducators by the National Resource Center for Paraprofessionals in Education and Related Services. The professional-development activities in the facilitator's guide are designed to be conducted during a one-day (six-hour) workshop or a series of four 1-1/2-hour or three 2-hour sessions.</P>

<H2>Making it real</H2>
<H3>New releases include fall TECHNOS and FINAL EXAM</H3>

<P>When administrators asked for suggestions about what kind of new school they should build, Lincoln district students answered: "Make it real!" Linda Myers, associate superintendent of Educational Services for the Lincoln Unified School District, discusses how the district is reaching this goal in the Fall 1995 issue of <A HREF="/technos/technos/"><B>TECHNOS: Quarterly for Education and Technology</B></A>.</P>

<P>Winner of the 1995 EdPress Distinguished Achievement Award, <A HREF="/technos/technos/"><B>TECHNOS Quarterly</B></A> was first published in 1992 as a forum for leading authorities on current topics and trends, educational policy and reform, and new technologies. The lineup of articles in the Fall 1995 issue continues AIT's dedication to shaping current thinking and influencing policy on educational issues.
<UL>
<LI>In a guest editorial, Alan D. Morgan, New Mexico superintendent of public instruction, contends that control of public education systems is best left to local interests.
<LI>Ernest L. Boyer, president of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, shares his insights on teaching values and reforming education through the use of technology.
<LI>A call for a new model for pedagogy is issued by AIT's Executive Director Michael F. Sullivan, who argues for models for pedagogy that include technological access and put kids first.
<LI>Linda Myers, Lincoln Unified School District, shares the district's blueprint for making learning real.
<LI>Ralph Brauer, executive director of the Transforming Schools Consortium, welcomes readers into the "virtual schoolhouse," where the Internet becomes the school and students are free to explore nearly unlimited learning resources available online.
<LI>AIT's first Distinguished Fellow Gerald W. Bracey contends that American public education has been doing a better job than we think.
<LI>In the TECHNOS Colloquium, Mark A. Shields, assistant professor of technology, culture, and communication at the University of Virginia, reasons that although techno-utopianism is the message of the day, it isn't the answer to all our educational problems.
<LI>"TECHNOS: Quarterly for Education and Technology" is published by TECHNOS Press as the journal of the Agency for Instructional Technology.  Selected articles from past issues of "TECHNOS Quarterly" are available online in <A HREF="/technos/technos/"><B>AIT.Net TECHNOS</B></A>.
</UL></P>

<P><B>AIT Distinguished Fellows Program, TECHNOS Press Books</B><BR>
The Agency's Distinguished Fellows Program was successfully launched in 1994 with the appointment of noted research psychologist, education consultant, and writer Gerald W. Bracey, Ph.D., as the first AIT Distinguished Fellow.</P>

<P>His TECHNOS Press book, "FINAL EXAM: A Study of the Perpetual Scrutiny of American Education," was just released in October 1995 and provides a history of standards, outcomes, assessment, and criticism of U.S. public schools with commentary on two predominant philosophies of learning in this country: that of Thomas Jefferson's "aristocracy of worth and genius" and that of "all children can learn."</P>

<P>Reviewers have praised "FINAL EXAM" as an "engaging" and "lively" work that makes "a very valuable contribution to the scene because of its scholarship and its honesty." </P>

"FINAL EXAM" is available from AIT for $24.98, plus $4.00 shipping and handling, per copy. Subscribers to AIT.Net can purchase "FINAL EXAM" at 10% off. <A HREF="/ait-bin/survey.htm"><B>Register</B></A> online today, and ask for product number 387-BB-1.

<P>Accepting a position as the second AIT Distinguished Fellow is economist Morton Marcus, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana University. As part of his fellowship, Mr. Marcus will conduct original research and write a book about new methods of funding public education in the United States. Marcus writes a weekly syndicated column on economics that is published in Indiana newspapers, and his wry commentary on economics and society has been heard on <A HREF="http://www.npr.org"><B>National Public Radio</B></A>. His book will be published in September 1996.</P>

<P><B>TECHNOS Press Monographs</B><BR>
The TECHNOS Press Monographs premier this fall with the publication of "Setting Standards in the Age of Knowledge: A Framework for Establishing and Using Educational Standards" by Yesha Y. Sivan, Ed.D. The author has developed a process for educators to follow as they set standards in K-12 and higher education. This 56-page monograph is available for $9.95 each from TECHNOS Press. Receive a discount on the monograph when you <A HREF="/ait-bin/survey.htm"><B>register</B></A> online and order a copy of "FINAL EXAM."</P>

<P><B>National Conference on Educational Fair Access and the New Media</B><BR>
In an effort to answer questions about <A HREF="copy.htm"><B>copyright law</B></A>, fair-use guidelines, and new technologies, AIT paired with the Consortium of College and University Media Centers to cohost the National Conference on Educational Fair Access and the New Media in June 1994. The conference was convened to begin developing new fair-use guidelines in the wake of an explosion in multimedia--digitized, networked media that are easily accessed and manipulated by computer. Educators should be concerned about obtaining access to and fair use of such materials for classroom purposes.</P>

<P>The conference brought together major interest groups and a host of copyright experts to address these issues. To further discussion, AIT released a 96-page report on the conference. "What's Fair? A Report on the Proceedings of the National Conference on Educational Fair Access and the New Media" includes
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>keynote speeches and presentations,
<LI>summaries of working committee reports,
<LI>current copyright laws and fair-use guidelines, and
<LI>a list of readings on the subject of copyright.
</UL></P>

<P>"What's Fair?" is available from AIT's TECHNOS Press for $14.95 plus $2.00 for shipping and handling per copy. For prepaid orders, AIT will pay shipping costs.  For more information on these publications, contact TECHNOS Press at (800) 457-4509, extension 220; fax (812) 333-4218; or contact TECHNOS at technos@ait.net. <A HREF="/ait-bin/survey.htm"><B>Register</B></A> with AIT.Net, and you can order "What's Fair?" for 50% off.</P>

<H1>Tips from teachers</H1>
<H2>From desert survival to stock market savvy</H2>
<P>
Give me more tips from teachers, Claudia Conner said in response to <I>AIT.Net News'</I> fall survey. So many of our readers agreed with this senior high school teacher at River Ridge School in New Port Richey, Florida, that we've included 12 teaching tips in this issue. Even more tips are available in <A HREF="/tips/">AIT.Net Tips</A>.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c372.htm"><IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/372slogo.gif" BORDER=0>
<H3><I>Mathemedia</I></H3></A>
<P><B>Following the <A HREF="http://www.lib.lsu.edu/bus/finance.htm">stock market</A>.</B> I like to expand <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c372.htm">Mathemedia</A></I> lessons with mini-units. In the section on logic, we do a logic box unit and the students even write their own logic box problems. In the unit on decimals and the money exchange system, I include a unit on the <A HREF="http://www.secapl.com/cgi-bin/qs">stock market</A> that has students &quot;buying&quot; 100 shares of a stock and then following its performance for a week. I really like these mini-units as starting points to build on <I>Mathemedia </I>lessons.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/pictures/ait2-1a.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT><BR><BR>
<B>Whether your students choose hard hats or high finance, they'll improve their communication survival skills with <A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><I>Applied Communication.</I></A></B><BR></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm"><IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/275slogo.gif" BORDER=0></P>
<H3><I>Applied Communication</I></H3></A>
<P><B>Take note.</B> My students keep a notebook in which they write all the main points and key concepts organized by module number, lesson number, and title. On test day, I let them use their notebooks for five minutes during the test before collecting them for a 100-point daily grade.
<br><I>Janet E. Davis, Southside High School, Batesville, Arkansas
<P></I><B>Learning a new language. </B>When studying Module 5, my students get excited about selecting an occupational area and working independently to do the &quot;Application&quot; from Lesson 10. Each student presents his or her new language to class for understanding and discussion.
<br><I>Gladia M. Perry, Middleton High School, Saulsbury, Tennessee
<P></I><B>Calling for customer service. </B>After I teach the unit &quot;Communicating with Clients and Customers,&quot; the students use real telephones and role-play &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;irate&quot; customer situations. Worked great with seniors!
<br><I>Phyllis L. Wright, Dothan High School, Dothan, Alabama
<P></I><B>A younger audience. </B>My seniors prepare a report on the vocation of their choice and present it (orally and with visuals or activities) to younger students (grades 5-6). Presentations are also made in our classroom so students must vary their presentations to fit the appropriate audience.
<br><I>Sherry Hott, <A HREF="http://isbe.state.il.us/~dhendric/litch.htm">Litchfield High School,</A> Litchfield, Illinois
<P></I><B>Integration. </B>We are integrating our <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm">Applied Communication</A></I> course called Technical Communications (English) into the trades taught at our Career Development Center. In two areas, <A HREF="http://www.english.upenn.edu/~schwebel/theater.htm">theater arts</A> and <A HREF="http://www.carsurvey.com/links.htm">auto,</A> the English teacher works in the trade space and meets regularly with the instructors to coordinate the curriculum.
<br><I>Candace Burkle, ACDC, Addison Northeast, Middlebury, Vermont
<P></I><B>Exploring local businesses.</B> Each of my students researches a business and writes a paper. We use Modules 2 and 16 as well as additional materials. It has worked well, and my students learn a great deal about companies that they would like to work for or that they patronize.
<br><I>Shelia Penick, Yates Center High School, Yates Center, Kansas
<P></I><B>A place for <A HREF="http://oksw01.okanagan.bc.ca/fiar/research.htm">art.</A></B> We've added several units to our <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm">Applied Communication</A></I> class. One unit covers <A HREF="http://oksw01.okanagan.bc.ca/fiar/research.htm">art</A> through visual imagery by combining <A HREF="http://www.bubl.bath.ac.uk/BUBL/Photography.htm">photography</A> with <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/~cheny6/link_poetry.htm">poetry</A>. This unit helps students learn to express their ideas in a dual modality.
<br><I>Marilyn D. Gattuso, Wahconah Regional High School, Dalton, Massachusetts
<P></I>
<A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c317.htm"><IMG SRC="/images/prodlogo/317slogo.gif" BORDER=0>
<H3><I>Workplace Readiness</I></H3></A>
<P><B>Only the shadow knows.</B> A career unit we added last year requires students to research a career and give an oral and written report. To gather material, students shadow someone working in that career for a day. Students observed <A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu">Purdue</A> athletic trainers, Embassy Suites managers, pediatricians, travel agents, etc. After the job shadow day, two students realized their careers of choice were not the careers they wanted. That's O.K. Mission accomplished!
<br><I>Char Rogers, Clinton Prairie High School, Frankfort, Indiana
<P></I><B>Cooperative programs in the community.</B> We have developed several workplace readiness programs in our district. 
<P> <OL><LI>A cooperative program between business and health teachers trains the students for medical office positions and helps them learn medical vocabulary, lab procedures, and business office skills. The program also has an internship component in which students rotate through various medical positions.
<P> <LI>A program between a <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.htm">health occupations</A> teacher and an <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.htm">anatomy and physiology</A> (A&amp;P) teacher helps students learn the textbook side of A&amp;P and brings them into a hospital where they go to surgery, laboratories, rehabilitation, etc., and see the practical side of it. They also receive lectures from practicing doctors, nurses, and others.
<P> <LI>A program between the drafting machine shop, <A HREF="http://ewi.ewi.org/ewi/">welding,</A> and <A HREF="http://sashimi.wwa.com/~merbland/utility/utility.htm">electricity</A> instructors prepares selected seniors in their second year in the subject to be multi-skilled workers. This program was created to meet the needs expressed by local business and industry professionals.
<P> <LI>A program between a microbiology teacher and the local hospital enables students to study microbiology theory in high school and practice what they've learned by completing a lab internship at the hospital in various labs with mentors from the health profession.
</OL><br><I>Cathy Fisher, United Technical Center, Clarksburg, West Virginia
<P></I><B>Surviving the <A HREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Country_Specific/W_Sahara.htm">Sahara.</A></B> I found my students had a hard time relating to the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; assignment so I substituted it with another one I found in the <I>VICA Journal</I> (April/May 1993) entitled &quot;<A HREF="http://www.goldcanyon.com/htm/desrtsur.htm">Desert Survival</A> Situation.&quot; It's the same idea, but my students know more about the deserts than the <A HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/homepage.htm">moon.</A>
<br><I>Loretta Hanisel, Kentucky Tech, Laurel County Campus, London, Kentucky
<P></I><B>A balancing act. </B>I've incorporated a unit on balancing work and family and another on career choices that uses the Choice computer program to increase student awareness of the interaction between their personal and work lives. They need to assess their own interests and qualities in order to make appropriate career choices. In effect, they must realize the trade-offs some decisions in life require and how they can balance the demands in their lives.
<br><I>Mary Griswold, North Linn High School, Coggon, Iowa<P>Share your favorite teaching tip with other teachers by submitting it to <A HREF="/tips/">AIT.Net Tips.</A>
<P></I>
<H3><A NAME="A6"><B>Seek a tip, share a tip</B></H3>
<P> These six teachers are seeking classroom tips--hints, strategies, resources, or projects. If you have a tip--or need one--contact the editor of <I>AIT.Net News</I> via email at <A HREF="MAILTO:ait@ait.net">ait@ait.net</A>; fax at (812) 333-4218; or snail mail at P.O. Box A, Bloomington, IN 47402-0120. 
<P> How do we get those who enroll students to understand that <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm">Applied Communication</A></I> is not a &quot;bonehead&quot; English class?
<br><I>Pat Deitz, Century High School, Bismarck, North Dakota
<P></I>Where could I find out about schools and programs that have on-campus, work-based learning sites? We're looking at sites and <A HREF="http://www.slu.edu/eweb/">entrepreneurships</A> on high school campuses.
<br><I>Jeanette Gehuke, Snowline Jouit Unified School District, Phelan, California
<P></I>Does anyone have a list of novels that deal with work themes and are suitable for high school juniors and seniors?
<br><I>Donna Smith, Cascade High School, Leavenworth, Washington
<P></I>What order do you recommend to start the <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c317.htm">Workplace Readiness</A></I> units?
<br><I>Sharyn K. Paige, Wayne High School, Wayne, Nebraska
<P></I>What other <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm">Applied Communication</A></I> teachers teach in block scheduling? This is our first year on block scheduling and my second year with AC. I'm still looking for ideas--especially on testing procedures.
<br><I>Beth Newman, Ripley High School, Ripley, Tennessee
<P></I>Does anyone have suggestions for using <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c320.htm">Attributes for Successful Employability</A></I>?

<HR>

<H1>Thank your <A HREF="/links/lstates.htm">state DOE</A>!</H1>
<P>
<H2><A HREF="/projects/default.htm">Consortium</A> investment yields savings dividend</H2>
<P> For over 35 years, AIT has pioneered the consortium process of funding curriculum projects. Educational agencies pool their financial and intellectual resources to cooperatively develop new learning materials. In return, schools in member states can buy innovative curriculum materials at greatly reduced rates.
<P> Investments by state departments of education in the <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm">Economics at Work</A></I> consortium are already paying off, with schools in 19 of the 35 member states saving more money on the materials they purchased than the state originally invested in its membership. Schools in the other 16 member states have saved money too, and their savings will soon surpass their original investment. Schools in the 15 states that did not join the consortium must pay full list price; fortunately, these states can still join the consortium and save.
<P> One outstanding savings success story began when <A HREF="http://gadoe.gac.peachnet.edu/">Georgia's Department of Education</A> joined the consortium while the course was in the planning stage. The state's far-sighted action placed its officials and teachers on the design team and ensured substantial discounts for Georgia's schools. To date, those schools have saved $151,750 on materials against the state's consortium membership fee of $23,730.
<P> Better yet, the Georgia Council on Economic Education helped introduce the course by training teachers and securing a significant grant from the Atlanta-based <A HREF="http://www.ups.com">United Parcel Service</A> for continuing assistance in training, hardware, and materials.
<P> Altogether, schools in the 35 states that formed the <I>Economics at Work</I> consortium have saved over $1.2 million! What is truly amazing is that the course is only in its first year of use. This means that it is being widely used and that schools will continue to save money for many years. 
<P> Schools using <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c275.htm">Applied Communication</A></I>, <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c317.htm">Workplace Readiness</A></I>, and 33 <A HREF="/catalog/default.htm">other courses</A> developed over the years through AIT's consortium process have accrued similar savings, as will consortium member schools that start using <I><A HREF="/projects/civics/">Civics at Work</A></I> when it is released next year. 
<P> Please remember to thank your state superintendent for being far-sighted, helping to create these excellent materials, and conserving your school's precious funds.
<P><I>For additional information on consortium membership in our newest consortium project, </I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm">Civics at Work</A><I>, contact John Nelson at (800) 457-4509, extension 204 (or <A HREF="MAILTO:jnelson@ait.net">jnelson@ait.net</A>), or your <A HREF="/links/lstates.htm">state department of education</A>.
<P></I>
<H3>A GROWING LIST</H3>

<H2>An inside look at the 1995 AECT Crystal Award winner</H2>
<P>
As winner of the 1995 Crystal Award, AIT's <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm">Economics at Work</A></I> has been recognized by the <A HREF="http://www.aect.org/">Association for Educational Communications and Technology's</A> Division of Telecommunications as the most innovative and outstanding video-based instructional telecommunications project with a development budget of over $100,000. What's inside the 1995 Crystal Award winner? A fully interactive economics curriculum designed for today's classrooms and tomorrow's workplace.</P>
<P>
<B>Contextual economics.</B> <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm">Economics at Work</A></I> combines videodisc and barcode technology, videocassette, print, and computer software into a comprehensive, one-semester course designed around five economic activities: producing, exchanging, consuming, saving, and investing. <I><A HREF="/catalog/catpages/c368.htm">Economics at Work</A></I> was developed by AIT, EconomicsAmerica, and a consortium of 35 state education agencies.</P>
<P>
<B>Interactive lessons.</B> All of the 27 lessons draw their content from EconomicAmerica's &quot;A Framework for Teaching Basic Economic Concepts&quot; and begin by introducing an economic event in general terms in the printed guide (&quot;Econ Briefing&quot; and &quot;Econcepts&quot;). In the 20 video lessons, the guide then presents an introduction to the interactive video segment, which is punctuated with questions and problems (&quot;Economic Puzzle Challenge&quot;) that draw in the students as active viewers and learners.</P>
<P>
This is followed by a section which connects the main themes of the lesson. Finally, the lesson presents a concluding section with summary, extension, and assessment (&quot;Quality Control&quot;) activities. (In the seven print-only lessons, &quot;Case in Point&quot; sections replace &quot;Economic Puzzle Challenge&quot; sections.)</P>
<P>
<B>Teacher support.</B> Each videodisc includes suggestions for introducing material and managing student activities and assessment prompts. The teacher guides contain a glossary of key terms, a list of additional resources, and ideas for extension activities involving the community. The laserdiscs also include a database of graphs and charts that are accessible by barcode in the teacher's guides. A classroom utilization component includes a workshop leader's handbook and a videotape that shows actual classroom use.</P>

According to the Public Agenda Foundation, 72% of teachers and 80% of the public believe that teaching computer skills and media technology are absolutely essential. Funding the future of technology in your school can involve many efforts--from identifying needs to finding the resources to meet them. One challenge facing all schools is convincing the school board to support a technology plan. You can improve your chance of success when you follow the strategies outlined below.</P>

Technology moves fast. To keep on top of opportunities for educators, and garner grassroots support and commitment to technology for your school, consider forming a School/Community Technology Committee or a joint School District/School/Community Technology Committee.</P>

<H3>Develop a technology plan</H3>
<P> It's harder to argue with a well-developed plan. Be sure your plan includes a mission statement and addresses key policy issues. Create a mission statement around these three questions:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>What education will students need to prepare them for the Information Age?</P>
<LI><P>What skills are needed to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world?</P>
<LI><P>How can technology help teachers provide a better education for their students?</P>
</UL>
<P>Develop a plan for the purchase and implementation of technology that addresses these questions, plus such policy issues as:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>How do you ensure that all students will have equal access to technology?</P>
<LI><P>How will hardware and software be previewed, purchased, and evaluated?</P>
<LI><P>How will you train educators to use the technology and incorporate it in the curriculum?</P>
<LI><P>What <A HREF="http://www.cua.edu/www/eric_ae/intass.html">assessment</A> strategies will be used to measure learning and skills acquisition?</P>
</UL>
<P>Online examples of technology plans are available in the <A HREF="http://www2.msstate.edu/~lsa1/nctp/index.html">National Center for Technology Planning</A> World Wide Web site.</P>
<P>
<H3>Show, then tell</H3>
<P>When trying to sell the school board on the value of technology, a demonstration is worth a thousand words. Here are some ways to persuasively present the power of technology:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Ask educational manufacturers and software publishers if they will either loan your school or district hardware and software or come to your meeting to make a presentation for you.</P>
<LI><P>Take advantage of the free guest accounts or trial offers to show your school board what's available online.</P>
<LI><P>Obtain low-cost videos from <A HREF="http://www.gov.nb.ca/hotlist/nasa.htm">NASA</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/ResearchersGuide/Programs.html">National Center for Education Statistics</A>. Many technology companies offer free videos about success stories involving their products--ask your sales representatives, and be sure to contact <A HREF="MAILTO:ait@ait.net">AIT Customer Service</A> at (800) 457-4509 for free video previews of interactive courses using videodisc and software technology. </P>
<LI><P>Coordinate tours to high-tech schools. Your state <A HREF="/links/lstates.htm">Department of Education</A> can identify these schools.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Seek outside funds</H3>
<P>If you can figure out how to pay for all or part of a technology investment, it's likely you can purchase what you want for your school. Obtain grant and funding information for educational technology from local colleges and universities; technology companies; online service providers; the local business community; and federal, state and district budgets. Online information about grants and funding for educational technology include:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>The <A HREF="http://eryx.syr.edu">Educational Resources Information Center</A> (ERIC). Ask for the AskERIC InfoGuide called &quot;Grants and Funding Sources.&quot;</P>
<LI><P>U.S. Department of Education's <A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/oeribro.html">Office of Educational Research and Improvement</A> (OERI), via <B>gopher: gopher.ed.gov (port 70)</B>. </P>
<LI><P>U.S. <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</A>'s Science and Technology Information System. Telnet to <B>telnet stis.nsf.gov</B>, login: public; via <B>gopher: stis.nsf.gov (port 70)</B>.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Communicate, communicate, communicate</H3>
<P>Develop a method of regular communications with your school board about technology-related successes and issues. A newsletter is a great way to spread the word about your progress, projects, and successes.</P>

<H1>Getting Started...</H1>
<H2>Bringing a public school into the 21st century</H2>
<P>by Mark Johnson</P>

<P>Getting a public school system up to date with new technologies that are appropriate and timely for students is often a frustrating experience. The problem is compounded by a traditionally slow reaction time to new ideas and a shortage of funds. Teachers are not unfamiliar with these barriers to modernizing their classrooms.</P>

<P> Teachers and administrators at the Ontario School System, a small rural school outside of Mansfield, Ohio, have tackled the problem through grants, board funding, and the formation of a technology foundation.</P>

<P> The local board of education has invested precious resources into a fiber optic linkup, new computers, and inservices for the staff that have run costs in excess of $100,000. Although this is an impressive figure for a small system of less than 1,900 students, it doesn't begin to meet the needs of students. Technology is expensive and ever-changing and we are like most school systems: we just don't have the financial resources to cope with these changes.</P>

<P> Another source of funding is through grant writing. Anyone that &quot;entered the arena&quot; to compete for grants knows how time-consuming this can be. We have had some success through a manipulatives and software grant from the Mildred Holdren Jennings Foundation. This grant was for the purchase of Lego Dacta sets to teach simple machines at the fourth-grade level. A logo software package called TCLogo was also purchased to give upper elementary students an introduction to computer programming.</P>

<P>We are currently teaming up with a local branch of the <A HREF="http://www.orst.edu">Ohio State University</A>, expanding this program to take advantage of recently installed linkups to the outside world. With a little luck, we will be awarded $10,000 from the Toyota Tapestry Grant to form a triad between Stingel, OSU, and the middle school. Students will be able to invent machine models available through <A HREF="http://legowww.itek.norut.no/faq/FAQ.html">Lego Dacta</A> and share ideas online with peers and adults. We keep in touch with Internet sources and the county office so that any grant or funding ideas do not go unexplored before expiration dates.</P>

<P> The technology foundation is the culmination of over two years of effort by staff and administration to implement a strategic plan developed in 1994. The foundation is a legal entity that was formed through the efforts of the committee, our curriculum director, and a local lawyer who donated his time to the legal documentation. Individuals and corporations can use the foundation to donate monies to our efforts. The foundation is also linked up with another established local foundation and enjoys tax-exempt status. Although it is a new effort, the initial reaction of the community to its formation has been positive and the balance has begun to grow.</P>

<P> We are just beginning! The task of shaping curriculum that incorporates new technologies into the everyday experiences of our students is the next step. Obviously, not every staff member is overjoyed with the changes, but the excitement is contagious and I'm sure those old attitudes will change. With a little effort, you can bring your school into the 21st century ready to meet the challenges of a changing world.</P>

<P><I>Mark Johnson is a fourth-grade teacher at Stingel Elementary School in Mansfield, Ohio.</I></P>

<P><B>TECHNOS</B>PRESS</P>
<H1>Who will warm your bones?</H1>
<H2><I><A HREF="/technos/technos/">TECHNOS Quarterly</A></I> begins fifth year with special offer</H2>
<IMG SRC="/images/pictures/oriental.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE="10">
<BR><BR>
<P><I>&quot;Now, how can two lone men need so much room? Cannot father and son sleep together? The warmth of the young one's body will comfort the old one's cough.&quot;</P>
<P>But the father always replied, &quot;I am saving my bed for my grandson. He will warm my bones in my age.&quot;</P>
<H6>Artwork by Joe Lee</H6><BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P></I>In the pre-revolution <A HREF="http://www.kn.pacbell.com/wired/China/ChinaQuest.html">China</A> depicted in Pearl Buck's <I>The Good Earth,</I> intergenerational transfers dictated the responsibilities and benefits of status and age. Successive generations cared for those who gave them life. Wang Lung's father, for example, assumed that the warmth of his grandchildren would ease the cold and ache of his old age. </P>

<P> AIT's 1996 Distinguished Fellow Morton Marcus explores the intergenerational transfers implicit in modern American society in the Spring 1996 issue of <I><A HREF="/technos/technos/">TECHNOS: Quarterly for Education and Technology</A>.</I> In his essay, &quot;Who Will Warm Your Bones?&quot; Marcus draws a startling lesson on funding education in the 21st century: If you hope to retire well tomorrow, educate your neighbor's children today.</P>

<P> The role of economics in educational reform is also considered from numerous perspectives in the Spring 1996 issue of <I><A HREF="/technos/technos/">TECHNOS</A></I>:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><A HREF="http://www.nobel.se/">Nobel Prize</A>-winning economist Milton Friedman advocates introducing competition to the public school system.</P>
<LI><P><A HREF="http://www.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</A>'s Asa G. Hilliard III contends that such competition obscures the real issue: Who will pay for those who cannot pay for themselves?</P>
<LI><P>Howard D. Mehlinger, director of Indiana University's <A HREF="http://cee.indiana.edu/index2.html">Center for Excellence in Education,</A> argues that school reform will fly farther and faster if propelled by the tailwind of technology.</P>
<LI><P>William L. Lepley and A. James Jones of the <A HREF="http://ally.ios.com/~mcw39/Milt/Milt.html">Milton Hershey School</A> assert that America knows how to educate its poor children, but wonder if it's willing to foot the bill.</P>
</UL>

<P>To celebrate the beginning of the fifth year of <I><A HREF="/technos/">TECHNOS Quarterly,</A></I> TECHNOS Press is offering subscriptions to<I> <A HREF="/technos/">TECHNOS</A></I> at the 1992 rate. For a limited time, new subscribers--and current subscribers--can get an <A HREF="/ait-bin/tech_sub.htm">online discount</A> on the 1995 rate of $20 for one year ($24 for international subscriptions and $16 for library subscriptions).</P>

<H2>Gerald Bracey on American Education</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>An Interview with the author of FINAL EXAM</H3>
<P>
Gerald W. Bracey is the first Distinguished Fellow of the Agency for Instructional Technology (AIT). Dr. Bracey's TECHNOS Press book is called FINAL EXAM: A Study of the Perpetual Scrutiny of American Education. It is a definitive examination of the educational reform movement in this country, and its results. FINAL EXAM provides historical perspectives on assessment, standards, outcomes, and criticism of U.S. public schools. We talked with Gerald Bracey about his book and the issues raised in it.</P>
<HR>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey01.htm">Dr. Bracey, why did you write this book?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey02.htm">Is American education in bad shape--and if so, can it be fixed?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey03.htm">If American education is not in bad shape, why are we hearing so many bad things about it these days?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey04.htm">Are we just spinning in our tracks? Will we ever figure out what to do about our educational system?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey05.htm">Maybe this conversation should have begun with a discussion of the purpose of public education, or learning, in the United States.</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey06.htm">What did Thomas Jefferson mean when he talked about "an aristocracy of worth and genius"?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey07.htm">You mention in your Prologue this pendulum swing between Jefferson's aristocracy of worth and genius and the philosophy that everyone can learn. What's the significance of that swing in history?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey08.htm">Is the notion that all children can learn a realistic one?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey09.htm">So, is the American dream of an education for all citizens just a pipe dream?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey10.htm">What one thing would you change in the focus of education as you've encountered it during your career?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey11.htm">If you could build your own school and staff it with teachers, where would you start? What would be the first thing you would do?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey12.htm">Dr. Bracey, do you have any final thoughts on this topic?</A></P>

<H2 align=center>1996 Distinguished Fellow Book by Morton Marcus</H2>

<P>TECHNOS Press is pleased to announce a new book by AIT&#146;s 1996 Distinguished Fellow, Morton Marcus, to be published in the fall of 1996.  A weekly columnist on current economic issues for 37 newspapers, Marcus is director of the Indiana Business Research Center at the Indiana University School of Business.</P>

<P>With a focus on funding for public education, this book examines current education dilemmas and intergenerational concerns, with help from everyman Septum Sixpack, his family, and friends. Incisive and entertaining, it is generously supported by data and filled with powerful, compelling arguments, as it challenges America&#146;s approach to education funding and the dreaded &#147;T&#148; word&#151;taxation. The author&#146;s candor, insights, and humor make this book a must-read for anyone interested in our financial and educational future, not just economists, tax experts, and educators.</P>

During the National Conference on Educational Fair Access and the New Media, participants met in small sessions where working committees discussed possible guidelines governing three difficult copyright issues that particularly affect the handling of new electronic and digitized media: the quantity and sources of excerpted materials; the presentation, utilization, and duplication of copyrighted materials; and the retention, access, and storage of multimedia materials. On the final morning, participants met in general session to hear committee reports. A summary of each report follows.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I started out voicing the <b>"THIS WEEK IN WORLD HISTORIES"</b> on <b>Assignment:  The World </b>some 19 years ago.  When <b>WXXI</b> asked me if I'd like to host the show, I jumped at the chance.  That was 18 years ago.  I began my broadcasting career in college, working at the college radio station at William Smith College in Geneva, New York.  After receiving my masters in television from the S. I. Newhouse School at Syracuse University, I worked in commercial television as a reporter/producer.  I'm now an associate professor at SUNY Brockport teaching braodcast journalism and writing.  I'm married to Skip Battaglia, a film animator, and have one daughter.  We share our house with one very bossy cat.  In my spare time I like to read, bake and practice aerobic gardening.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I have been involved in the production of <b>Assignment:  The World</b> for over fifteen years.  As a Production Assistant I ran camera, teleprompter and acted as floor manager on <b>ATW</b>.  I have been the producer of the program for around 8-9 years now.  In addition to <b>ATW</b> I have produced a wide variety of television programs ranging from documentary to live sporting events.  I attended the State University of New York-Geneseo campus and graduated with a bachelor of Arts degree in Speech Communication.  My wife, Valerie and I are the proud parents of two boys, Kyle-age 5 and Erik-age two...both already regular viewers of <b>ATW</b>.  I'm a big sports fan!  A native of Boston, Massachusetts I live for the day the Red Sox break the "Curse of the Bambino" and bring a World Series title home to Fenway.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="MEIER"><IMG SRC="/images/pictures/389meier.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A><B>Deborah W. Meier</B> is president of the Center for Collaborative Education, a network of nearly 40 elementary, middle, and high schools that are working on issues of school reform in New York City.  A true reformer, she encourages new approaches to enhance democracy and equity in public education.  She stresses the need to create school environments in which children can learn to see themselves as creators and possessors of &#147;wonderful ideas.&#148;  She also believes that teachers must experience the power of their own ideas and the power of joining with parents in making critical decisions that affect their schools.</P>

<P><B>Deborah Meier</B> was a founding member of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and the North Dakota Study Group on Evaluation, and she is currently on the boards of the Educational Alliance Fair Test, the Association of Union Democracy, and other organizations. Born in New York City, she attended Antioch College and received a master's degree in history from the University of Chicago in 1955.   Over the years, she has played many roles; among them teacher, principal, and elected school board member.  She is the author of many works, including the recent book, <I>The Power of Their Ideas</I> &copy; 1995.</P>

<P><A NAME="LEVIN"><IMG SRC="/images/pictures/389levin.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A></A><B>Henry M. Levin</B> is the David Jacks Professor of Higher Education and Economics at Stanford University, where he also directs the Center for Educational Research.  A specialist in the economics of education and human resources, Dr. Levin's work has dealt with educational finance, educational and workplace productivity, and investment strategies for educationally at-risk students. Much of his recent work focuses on the establishment of &#147;accelerated schools,&#148; which are designed to bring all students into the educational mainstream and to make them capable of academic success.  In 1994&#150;95 more than 700 elementary and middle schools in 37 states were involved in the accelerated schools process.</P>

<P>In 1991 the <I>New York Times</I> named Dr. Levin one of nine &#147;national standard-bearers&#148; in educational innovation. Before arriving at Stanford in 1968, he earned a Ph.D. in economics at Rutgers and served as a research economist at the Brookings Institution.  Since then he has been a visiting professor in Spain and China, served as editor of the Review of Educational Research, and published 13 books and numerous articles.</P>

Dr. Prothrow-Stith regards violence as a societal &#147;disease&#148; that can be prevented through public health strategies.  After receiving a B.A. in mathematics from Spelman College, she earned her M.D. at Harvard Medical School in 1979. She trained in internal medicine at Boston City Hospital, where the typical &#147;stitch 'em up, send 'em out&#148; response to patients injured by violent acts that she observed there led her to examine ways of preventing violence.</P>

<P><B>Deborah B. Prothrow-Stith</B> is the author of <I>Violence Prevention Curriculum for Adolescents</I>, the first such work for schools and communities. She is coauthor of <I>Deadly Consequences</I>, the first book to present the public health perspective on violence to a mass audience, and of <I>Health Skills for Wellness</I>, a high school textbook that contains a chapter devoted exclusively to the prevention of violence.   In 1987 Dr. Prothrow-Stith became the first woman to be appointed commissioner of public health for the commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Her honors include the World Health Day Award (1993).</P>

<P><A NAME="MEIER"><IMG SRC="/images/pictures/389meier.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A><B>Deborah W. Meier</B> is president of the Center for Collaborative Education, a network of nearly 40 elementary, middle, and high schools that are working on issues of school reform in New York City.  A true reformer, she encourages new approaches to enhance democracy and equity in public education.  She stresses the need to create school environments in which children can learn to see themselves as creators and possessors of &#147;wonderful ideas.&#148;  She also believes that teachers must experience the power of their own ideas and the power of joining with parents in making critical decisions that affect their schools.</P>

<P><B>Deborah Meier</B> was a founding member of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and the North Dakota Study Group on Evaluation, and she is currently on the boards of the Educational Alliance Fair Test, the Association of Union Democracy, and other organizations. Born in New York City, she attended Antioch College and received a master's degree in history from the University of Chicago in 1955.   Over the years, she has played many roles; among them teacher, principal, and elected school board member.  She is the author of many works, including the recent book, <I>The Power of Their Ideas</I> &copy; 1995.</P>

<P><A NAME="LEVIN"><IMG SRC="/images/pictures/389levin.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A></A><B>Henry M. Levin</B> is the David Jacks Professor of Higher Education and Economics at Stanford University, where he also directs the Center for Educational Research.  A specialist in the economics of education and human resources, Dr. Levin's work has dealt with educational finance, educational and workplace productivity, and investment strategies for educationally at-risk students. Much of his recent work focuses on the establishment of &#147;accelerated schools,&#148; which are designed to bring all students into the educational mainstream and to make them capable of academic success.  In 1994&#150;95 more than 700 elementary and middle schools in 37 states were involved in the accelerated schools process.</P>

<P>In 1991 the <I>New York Times</I> named Dr. Levin one of nine &#147;national standard-bearers&#148; in educational innovation. Before arriving at Stanford in 1968, he earned a Ph.D. in economics at Rutgers and served as a research economist at the Brookings Institution.  Since then he has been a visiting professor in Spain and China, served as editor of the Review of Educational Research, and published 13 books and numerous articles.</P>

<P><A NAME="PROTHROW"><IMG SRC="/images/pictures/389proth.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A><B>Deborah B. Prothrow-Stith, M.D.</B>, is assistant dean of government and community programs and professor of public health practice in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Harvard University's School of Public Health.  Dr. Prothrow-Stith regards violence as a societal &#147;disease&#148; that can be prevented through public health strategies.  After receiving a B.A. in mathematics from Spelman College, she earned her M.D. at Harvard Medical School in 1979. She trained in internal medicine at Boston City Hospital, where the typical &#147;stitch 'em up, send 'em out&#148; response to patients injured by violent acts that she observed there led her to examine ways of preventing violence.</P>

<P><B>Deborah B. Prothrow-Stith</B> is the author of <I>Violence Prevention Curriculum for Adolescents</I>, the first such work for schools and communities. She is coauthor of <I>Deadly Consequences</I>, the first book to present the public health perspective on violence to a mass audience, and of <I>Health Skills for Wellness</I>, a high school textbook that contains a chapter devoted exclusively to the prevention of violence.   In 1987 Dr. Prothrow-Stith became the first woman to be appointed commissioner of public health for the commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Her honors include the World Health Day Award (1993).</P>

In 1986 he founded the High Success Network, a consulting organization dedicated to improving educational systems. His network has helped policymakers, educators, and parents in more than 40 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada implement the principles of outcome-based education. As a member of the staff of the American Association of School Administrators, Dr. Spady served as director of its National Center for the Improvement of Learning and cofounded the Network for Outcome-Based Schools.</P>

<H2>Ever Wonder?</H2>
<P>After a fire, the forest becomes a different kind of place.  The fire has produced a layer of ashes that seem to cover everything.  What is in these ashes?  How will they affect the soil?  How will they affect the new plants, which begin the process of recovery?  In this investigation you will compare ashes with other familiar substances, and you will discover how the kinds of materials in ashes affect living things.</P>

<LI><P>Tear off small pieces of red and blue litmus paper and pH paper.</P>
<LI><P>Use the forceps, if necessary, to dip one fresh piece of each kind of paper into each sample. The pieces of paper may change color. (Compare the color of the pH paper with the color chart in the package, and note the pH number.) Enter all results on your group's copy of Data Form A.</P>
<LI><P>Use a spatula or small spoon to add a small quantity of baking soda (about the size of your thumbnail) to each tube. Observe the results. Record observations on Data Form A.</P>

<LI><P>Using a 10-mL graduate cylinder to measure, add 1, 10, or 20 mL of vinegar to each flask, as labeled.</P>
<LI><P>Using a 25-mL graduate cylinder to measure, add enough pond water to each flask to bring the total volume in each flask to 45 mL. (Explanation: Add 44 mL of pond water to the "1 mL" flask; add 35 mL to the "10 mL" flask; add 25 mL to the "20 mL" flask.) Use a 10-mL graduate cylinder to add 5 mL of water containing pond organisms to each flask.</P>
<LI><P>Cover the flasks with aluminum foil or loose cotton plugs. Set them aside in a warm sunny place where they will not be disturbed. Wash your hands with soap and warm water before leaving the lab.</P>
<LI><P>Wait at least three days. Then place a drop from each flask on a microscope slide. Add a cover slip, and perform Steps 18-23 again. (Be sure to use the same magnification when you use the microscope.) If possible, repeat your observations three more days. After each observation enter the results on Data Form B. Wash your hands with soap and warm water every day before leaving the lab.</P>

<IMG SRC="/images/ahead/talk.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
<H2>Talk It Over</H2>
<P>Work with the other members of your group to answer the following questions.</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Examine the information on Data Form A. Can the substances be classified into groups that share certain properties. For example, do substances with a high pH tend to react the same way to litmus paper? To baking soda?...</P>
<LI><P>Are ammonia and lemon juice in the same group? What happened when you combined them?</P>
<LI><P>How did you classify soil and pond water? How did ashes affect the pond water?</P>
<LI><P>Examine the information on Data Form B. How did vinegar affect the pond organisms?</P>
<LI><P>Substances with pH below 7 are called acids. Substances with pH above 7 are called bases. Pure water, with a pH of 7, is neutral - it is neither an acid nor a base. (You'll learn more about acids and bases later.) Are ashes acidic or basic?</P>
<LI><P>Does the survival of living things depend on their pH? Is it likely that all living things require the same pH range?</P>
<LI><P>What would be the effect if rain washed ashes into a pond after a forest fire?</P>
<LI><P>What effect would ashes have on soil and plants after a forest fire?</P>
<LI><P>From what you have learned in this investigation, would you expect the plants that grow back after a fire to be the same kind that grew in the forest before the fire?</P>
</OL>

<IMG SRC="/images/ahead/spread.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=15>
<H2>Spread the Word</H2>
<P>Much of your testing involved color and color change. Make a color chart, table, or other diagram to make it easier for the class to understand the results of your investigation.</P>

<P>Present your ideas about how important acids and bases are to living things, particularly in the workplace. You might also present a game show at the end of your talk: Have your classmates guess which substances are acids or bases, and then let them verify their guesses with indicator paper.</P>

<P>Tell how what you have learned can be applied at home or in various jobs.</P>

<H2>Before the Bell Rings:  What Every PARAEDUCATOR Should Know</H2>

Professional Development, Paraeducator Training, and Teaching Techniques for Preservice/Inservice Educators<P>

Develop education's most vital untapped resource--the paraeducator. <B>Before the Bell Rings: What Every Paraeducator Should Know</B> is a video and print workshop resource that will enable you to prepare your education team to implement ongoing professional development programs for paraeducators in preschool, elementary, and secondary education.  Train paraeducators to communicate more effectively with teachers, administrators, parents, and students. Define the roles and responsibilities of paraeducators, especially in relation to the education team. Develop paraeducators' problem solving and behavior management techniques, and prepare them to actively practice your district's professional and ethical standards of conduct.<P>

Paraeducators are helping schools meet new educational challenges, like inclusion, multiculturalism, teaching ESL students, and working with children from family backgrounds that place them at risk. To meet the needs of today's larger, more diverse student populations, schools are looking to highly skilled paraeducators for answers. Paraeducators are also important members in Title I and IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) programs. In fact, it is estimated that nearly 500,000 Title I-funded staff positions are filled by paraeducators. Funding for professional development opportunities for paraeducators is also called for under Title II (The Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program) guidelines.<P>

<B>Video Program</B><BR>
Anna Lou Pickett, the leading authority on paraeducator training, provides insights into the importance of developing a skilled paraeducator workforce. Paraeducators, teachers, and administrators from schools across the United States offer examples and proven strategies for building a successful paraeducator program in your school or district.  The video program is divided into six parts, each organized around one phase of paraeducator training and development:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Building a Team
<LI>Roles and Responsibilities
<LI>Professional and Ethical Responsibilities
<LI>Communication and Problem Solving
<LI>Behavior Management
<LI>Conclusion
</UL><P>

<B>Facilitator's Guide</B><BR>
The facilitator's guide contains professional development activities and follow-up materials for two workshop formats. The guide includes detailed workshop agendas, program previews and objectives, role-play scenarios, reproducible handout masters, overhead masters, follow-up activities to each part of the video program, and listings of additional resources.<P>

Before the Bell Rings was produced by Video Features, Inc. and AIT (1996).<P>

<TITLE>Respecting Diversity in the Classroom #386</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Respecting Diversity in the Classroom</H2>

Professional Development, Multicultural Education, and Teaching Techniques for Preservice/Inservice Educators<P>

Discover the power of diversity as an educational resource--one that you can use to enhance your curriculum, and broaden the perspectives and enrich the lives of your students. <B>Respecting Diversity in the Classroom</B> provides insight into the nature of diversity and illustrates how to establish your own successful multicultural curriculum. Define and apply the culture of individual classrooms to the development of multicultural lessons and activities. Incorporate "thematic learning" techniques into current curricula--blending cultural messages into reading, history, geography, social studies, and mathematics lessons. Recognize the various learning styles and communications techniques of different ethnic groups, and develop methods for responding to these issues. Learn to effectively use different types of study tools to reach students and their families and to encourage multicultural understanding without racial and ethnic separatism.<P>

<B>Video Program</B><BR>
The video program develops guidelines for building a multicultural curriculum and practicing techniques for implementing multicultural materials in the classroom. "Attend" a seminar by Dr. Lucinda Lee Katz, director of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where different multicultural issues are introduced and discussed. Successful teaching techniques are then illustrated with scenes from multicultural awareness programs in such diverse cities as Seattle, Minneapolis, and Chicago.  Expert commentary on multicultural awareness programs is provided by award-winning teachers and educational leaders like Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch. Dramatic reenactments of typical classroom situations then allow teachers to practice their newly acquired skills. As these scenarios illustrate, diversity is much more than race. It involves ethnicity, religion, age, gender, and socio-economic status.  The video program is divided into five sections:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Introduction--Defining Culture
<LI>Respecting Diversity--A Resource in Our Midst
<LI>The Multicultural Curriculum
<LI>Instructional Strategies to Fit Student Needs
<LI>Caution--Unpaved Road Ahead
</UL><P>

<B>Facilitator's Guide</B><BR>
The activities and resources included in the facilitator's guide provide the necessary tools to formulate a practical multicultural awareness program for your school or classroom. Designed to be used interactively with the video program, the facilitator's guide encourages discussion, problem solving, and skills development during pause points in the video.<P>

<BODY>

<H2>Looking from the Inside/Out</H2>

Health and Guidance for Grades 3-5, Teachers, Parents, and Caregivers<P>

<B>Give children the emotional skills they need to make healthy decisions</B><P>

It is difficult for young people to identify their feelings, other than to say they feel
good or bad. And yet, emotions are as much a part of good health as hygiene, physical fitness, and nutrition. Emotions affect a student's physical health, self-concept, behavior, and relationships. Equipped with life-coping skills, children are more likely to make healthy, responsible choices.<P>

<B>Looking from tbeInside/Out</B> strengthens existing health education instruction by:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>helping students in grades 3, 4, and 5 acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need to understand and cope with their emotions and feelings
<LI>providing reinforcement through positive role models in contemporary
situations
<LI>providing teachers with interactive and engaging classroom activities
<LI>reinforcing the role parents play in developing positive health skills in their
young children
</UL><P>

<B>Looking from the Inside/Out</B> consists of fifteen 15-minute programs and an extensive teacher's guide that incorporates a parental component with at-home activities. The video programs feature dramatic sequences with children of various ethnic groups and races, and children with disabilities coping with their emotions. An on-camera host leads student viewers and studio children through "children-on-the-street" interviews, illustrated stories, and performed songs.<P>

The teacher's guide includes program objectives, summaries, and lesson plans. The
guide also includes a unique "community connection" that recommends activities to
involve parents and representatives from the community.<P>

<B>Looking from theInside/Out</B> continues the tradition of the phenomenally successful <A HREF="c087.html"><B>Inside/Out</B></A>. Created in 1973, <B>Inside/Out</B> has enjoyed wide use by educators as an effective resource for helping 8-10-year-olds handle their feelings. AIT, the producer of <B>Inside/Out</B>, has updated the content, format, and pedagogy of the original series to create <B>Looking from the Inside/Out</B>. &copy;1995<P>

<B>Knowledge, Attitudes, and Life-Coping Skills provide the keys to understanding emotion</B><P>

<B>Looking from the Inside/Out</B> is designed to help students discover their emotions. Each video program provides basic knowledge about human emotions and their universality. Then <B>Looking from the Inside/Out</B> supports that knowledge by demonstrating the physical and social results of both positive and negative attitudes and habits.<P>

To help children learn how to deal with the emotions they have identified, each of the video programs concentrate on a specific life-coping skill. Four categories of skills are developed throughout the programs:
<UL TYPE=DICS>
<LI><B>Decision-Making Skills</B> - enable students to actively solve problems that may arise in social situations
<LI><B>Communication Skills</B> - help students articulate their feelings and express their needs to others in appropriate ways
<LI><B>Stress-Management Skills</B> - show students how to identify stressors, learn positive coping strategies, and build a support network
<LI><B>Goal-Setting Skills</B> - enable students to realize the importance of looking ahead and considering future goals when making decisions

<HR>
<H2>Gerald Bracey on American Education</H2>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>An Interview with the author of FINAL EXAM</H3>

<P>
Gerald W. Bracey is the first Distinguished Fellow of the Agency for Instructional Technology (AIT). Dr. Bracey's TECHNOS Press book is called FINAL EXAM: A Study of the Perpetual Scrutiny of American Education. It is a definitive examination of the educational reform movement in this country, and its results. FINAL EXAM provides historical perspectives on assessment, standards, outcomes, and criticism of U.S. public schools. We talked with Gerald Bracey about his book and the issues raised in it.</P>
<HR>
<P>Choose a question from the list below to begin your version of the Bracey interview or access the <A HREF="bracey-all.htm"><B>complete Bracey interview</B></A> to read the entire exchange.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif">Dr. Bracey, why did you write this book?</P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I think the book stemmed out of my desire to know how we got where we are today. We are, as a nation, very ahistorical. We tend not to look into the history of things, and I thought it would be useful to look into the history of education, particularly the history of education criticism, and see what people had said about schools from time immemorial. I also thought it would be useful, since there is so much emphasis on standards, assessments, and outcomes, to research the histories of those three areas, too.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif">Is American education in bad shape--and if so, can it be fixed?</P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> First off, I really don't think it's meaningful to speak of American education. And the reason I say that is that the performance of different schools and different school districts is so great around the country. The chief defining quality of American education is not quality or lack of quality, but inequality. Inequality is huge around different areas. For example, in the most recent international study of mathematics skills, Taiwan and Korea as countries had the highest scores. Asian kids in American schools outscored them. Hungary as a nation finished third. White kids in American schools tied Hungary for third place. White kids and Asian kids together make up over 70 percent of the school population. So a large proportion of our kids are world class. They're scoring up there with the best nations.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>If American education is not in bad shape, why are we hearing so many bad things about it these days?</TD></TD></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> Different groups have been bashing schools for different reasons. Let's start with the politicians. Ronald Reagan came in on an education agenda that was dedicated to vouchers, privatization, and school prayer and tax credits. George Bush extended Reagan's agenda. I am convinced that part of their strategy for trying to soften up the American public to permit the transfer of public funds to private schools was to constantly portray the American public schools as abject failures.</P>
<P>
When we turn to the universities, we find a different reason for school bashing. The universities have, unfortunately, invested far too heavily in school failure. Shortly after the first "Bracey Report on the Condition of Public Education" came out, David Clark, who had been dean of the School of Education when I was on the faculty at Indiana University, wrote me a nice letter, but he said in passing in part, "the American common school is an endangered species. The wimps in education"--by which he meant his fellow professors--"will not defend it. They're afraid of losing their money or access to the corridors of power."</P>
<P>
At the most recent "Phi Delta Kappan" editorial board meeting, Susan Furman, a policy analyst from Rutgers University, said, "If you want money, you've got to say the schools are lousy. So what else is new?"</P>
<P>
Business and industry have in their self-interest to portray schools as deficient in order to get the schools to do for free what business and industry ought to be spending money on: in on-the-job training.</P>
<P>
And finally the media have been bashing schools for a variety of reasons. In the first place, the media accentuate the negative. Good news really is no news in many quarters. In addition, media by and large tend to print what people in places of authority tell them to print. Content analyses show that 70 to 90 percent of what journalists write is what people tell them to write. And in the last 15 years, the people who have been in positions of power have been telling media to write negative stuff. There is, I must say, something unique in the conversations that I have with media representatives. I find that these people have made up their minds about the condition of public education, and they don't detach their investigative reporting from their personal views.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>Are we just spinning in our tracks? Will we ever figure out what to do about our educational system?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I don't think we're spinning in our tracks. Sometimes it seems that way. One of the things I've noticed is that each new round of reform acts likes electro-convulsive shock, inducing immediate amnesia for the previous rounds of reform. I recall that Ted Bell, Secretary of Education during the Reagan years, in his book "The Thirteenth Man," when he reflects on the impact of "A Nation at Risk," he gets very nostalgic and asks how can we get back to a past when we were a nation of learners?</P>
<P>
Well, my research has shown that we have never been a nation of learners. I came across a very scandalous survey by "The New York Times" showing that kids knew nothing about American history, knew nothing about American geography. The "Times" was scandalized, and put this on page one with a big headline right next to the other big headline of the day which was, "Patton Attacks at El Guettar," this having taken place in 1943. What made this so incredibly scandalous was that these were not high school students who were so ignorant about history and geography; they were college students. And in 1943, you only had about 15 to 20 percent of all high school graduates going on to college. They were an elite.</P>
<P>
In one book on the history of literacy in this country, the writers looked at all of the what are called "then-and-now studies." This is when, for example, students in Indiana in 1974 were given a 1946 version of a test--1946 becomes "then"; 1974 becomes "now." By and large, in then-and-now studies, kids now do better than kids then, no matter how "now" is defined. I think what we have here is an evolutionary process where we really are getting better and better.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>Maybe this conversation should have begun with a discussion of the purpose of public education, or learning, in the United States.</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I see two purposes of public education. And I see one purpose that public education is currently pursuing, which I think it should not. I do not think that education should prepare students for the world of work. Much work is boring, demeaning, even dangerous, and schools have no business getting kids ready for that. Most work is an ugly fact of life, and we have to acknowledge that, but schools shouldn't have any part in it.</P>
<P>
The word "school," by the way, comes from the Greek word "schole," which means "holiday" or "leisure time." Schools were intended to be holidays from the grim world of work which most of us face once we get out of school. And I think they should continue being that.</P>
<P>
That said, then: the purpose of schools should be, I think first of all, to prepare citizens for democracy. Thomas Jefferson, who was our first educator of any import, saw schools as the means of protecting us from our government. Jefferson said that all governments tend to degenerate and become corrupt, and the means of absolutely protecting the nation from this was to improve the minds of its citizens through schools. The second purpose I see is to prepare people to have a rich and meaningful life when they're not at work. We need to have people who can deal with leisure. They must be able to have an interesting life of the mind when they are away from work.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>What did Thomas Jefferson mean when he talked about "an aristocracy of worth and genius"?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I think by "an aristocracy of worth and genius," Jefferson meant to contrast the kinds of aristocracy he wanted to produce in this nation with the aristocracies in Europe. The aristocracies in Europe were based entirely on birth and blood; there was no room in or out of them. Jefferson saw the schools as a great sorting machine by which you would get the brightest kids each year and give them more education and thus in the end have an aristocracy. These would be our leaders, and that would be the aristocracy of worth and genius, not an aristocracy of birth.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>You mention in your Prologue this pendulum swing between Jefferson's aristocracy of worth and genius and the philosophy that everyone can learn. What's the significance of that swing in history?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I'm not sure that it has a significance beyond its historical existence. I believe in part it reflects the swing back and forth between a meritocratic thinking about education in which we encourage the best and brightest to come forth and be schooled, versus an egalitarian philosophy and approach to education in which we see it as imperative to provide the same education to all children in order to permit all children to have a chance to succeed in life.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>Is the notion that all children can learn a realistic one?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> Well, the notion that all children can learn is basically a meaningless one, until you try to specify what they can learn. And then I think we are in for some disappointment. Because while I do think that many children in schools could learn a great deal more than they are learning today, it is the case that some children cannot learn. We have studied several effective remedial reading programs like Reading Recovery and Success for All. The children who move through those programs are, for the most part, ably assisted. They do learn to read, but some do not.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>So, is the American dream of an education for all citizens just a pipe dream?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I wouldn't say it's a pipe dream. And it's certainly something that we ought to strive for because, as we have seen, education has become even more important for individual success. Schools have very little to do with our international competitiveness as a nation, and education is no longer a guarantee that you will get a good job. But what seems to be guaranteed now is, if you don't have an education, you will not get a good job. So we must strive to educate everyone. At the same time, I think we absolutely have to realize that if we were to educate everyone, the country would fall apart. It would fall apart because educated people are allergic to sweat. They won't do the dirty work. They won't clean out the cesspools. They won't sweep the streets. They won't cut branches down that are on the electric wires. We absolutely positively have to have a group of undereducated, unskilled people to do all these dirty jobs that "the comfortable classes," as John Kenneth Galbraith calls them, will not do.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>What one thing would you change in the focus of education as you've encountered it during your career?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I think what led us more astray than anything that comes immediately to mind was an emphasis on the kinds of skills that could be assessed using multiple choice examinations. That drew us away from the old goals of developing a "disciplined mind," as they referred to it, and more to looking at atomistic, concrete, decontextualized skills--because those are the only kinds that you can assess with multiple choice questions. The desire for this kind of assessment was driven only really from a concern for efficiency. How fast could we get this assessment done? How cheaply could we get it done? And that became an overwhelming consideration once the electromagnetic/electromechanical means of scoring tests were developed.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>If you could build your own school and staff it with teachers, where would you start? What would be the first thing you would do?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> The kinds of teachers I would want are the kinds who can lead children. Educate comes from the Latin "educare," which means "to lead out." And there are teachers I have seen who are able to lead children towards educative experiences. They have some warmth. They are good people at leading seminars. They seem to have an insight into the thinking process. They also, by and large, like children. And I would start by finding those kinds of teachers because I think no matter what kind of structure you have for the school, if you have a structure at all, no matter what kind of technology you enrich the school with, at heart it's the teacher/learner interaction and the learner/learner interactions that are critical to the educational process.</P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>Dr. Bracey, do you have any final thoughts on this topic?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I just hope that if people do read this book, they come away from it with a new sense of what American education has been about. Historically, no matter how good American schools have been, they've never been good enough--they've always been carped at and criticized. But you take where we were a century ago and look where we are now--it's quite an amazing process. A century ago we were a nation of 50 million people. There were only about 200,000 students in secondary school. There were some 3 million students who were of the age to be in secondary school but who were not. We now graduate about 83 percent of our students on time. More come back for degrees. More take GEDs.</P>
<P>
If you look at test scores of a variety of kinds, you find that achievement test scores are at all-time highs. You find that many of the national assessment trends are at all-time highs. You find the proportion of students scoring above 650 on the SAT mathematics is at an all-time high. The data show that, as we have gotten education to more and more people, it has not, so far as I can tell, been bought at the cost of quality. And I would hope people would come to realize what an amazing experience the American public schools' provision of education has been.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>An Interview with the author of FINAL EXAM</H3>

<P>
On the other hand, if you look at the bottom in this recent comparison, you find Jordan and Mississippi tied for lowest country and lowest state, respectively. But below that you find Hispanic kids and below that you find disadvantaged urban kids and below that you find black kids. So some of our students are not even third world. And by the way, I have lots of evidence to indicate that what is operative here is not ethnicity. These kids are not scoring low because they're black and Hispanic. By and large, they are scoring low because they're poor. So if you look at different groups in American education, you find that overwhelmingly American kids are doing well. Even in math, where we are such putative dolts.</P>
<P>
If you go to reading, we're doing even better. In the most recent international comparison of reading, which was done in 31 nations, American kids finished second. They finished second only to Finland, a small, homogeneous country that doesn't spend a whole lot of time worrying about how to teach Finnish as a second language.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> Different groups have been bashing schools for different reasons. Let's start with the politicians. Ronald Reagan came in on an education agenda that was dedicated to vouchers, privatization, and school prayer and tax credits. George Bush extended Reagan's agenda. I am convinced that part of their strategy for trying to soften up the American public to permit the transfer of public funds to private schools was to constantly portray the American public schools as abject failures.</P>
<P>
When we turn to the universities, we find a different reason for school bashing. The universities have, unfortunately, invested far too heavily in school failure. Shortly after the first "Bracey Report on the Condition of Public Education" came out, David Clark, who had been dean of the School of Education when I was on the faculty at Indiana University, wrote me a nice letter, but he said in passing in part, "the American common school is an endangered species. The wimps in education"--by which he meant his fellow professors--"will not defend it. They're afraid of losing their money or access to the corridors of power."</P>
<P>
At the most recent "Phi Delta Kappan" editorial board meeting, Susan Furman, a policy analyst from Rutgers University, said, "If you want money, you've got to say the schools are lousy. So what else is new?"</P>
<P>
Business and industry have in their self-interest to portray schools as deficient in order to get the schools to do for free what business and industry ought to be spending money on: in on-the-job training.</P>
<P>
And finally the media have been bashing schools for a variety of reasons. In the first place, the media accentuate the negative. Good news really is no news in many quarters. In addition, media by and large tend to print what people in places of authority tell them to print. Content analyses show that 70 to 90 percent of what journalists write is what people tell them to write. And in the last 15 years, the people who have been in positions of power have been telling media to write negative stuff. There is, I must say, something unique in the conversations that I have with media representatives. I find that these people have made up their minds about the condition of public education, and they don't detach their investigative reporting from their personal views.</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>Are we just spinning in our tracks? Will we ever figure out what to do about our educational system?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I don't think we're spinning in our tracks. Sometimes it seems that way. One of the things I've noticed is that each new round of reform acts likes electro-convulsive shock, inducing immediate amnesia for the previous rounds of reform. I recall that Ted Bell, Secretary of Education during the Reagan years, in his book "The Thirteenth Man," when he reflects on the impact of "A Nation at Risk," he gets very nostalgic and asks how can we get back to a past when we were a nation of learners?</P>
<P>
Well, my research has shown that we have never been a nation of learners. I came across a very scandalous survey by The New York Times showing that kids knew nothing about American history, knew nothing about American geography. The Times was scandalized, and put this on page one with a big headline right next to the other big headline of the day which was, "Patton Attacks at El Guettar," this having taken place in 1943. What made this so incredibly scandalous was that these were not high school students who were so ignorant about history and geography; they were college students. And in 1943, you only had about 15 to 20 percent of all high school graduates going on to college. They were an elite.</P>
<P>
In one book on the history of literacy in this country, the writers looked at all of the what are called "then-and-now studies." This is when, for example, students in Indiana in 1974 were given a 1946 version of a test--1946 becomes "then"; 1974 becomes "now." By and large, in then-and-now studies, kids now do better than kids then, no matter how "now" is defined. I think what we have here is an evolutionary process where we really are getting better and better.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I see two purposes of public education. And I see one purpose that public education is currently pursuing, which I think it should not. I do not think that education should prepare students for the world of work. Much work is boring, demeaning, even dangerous, and schools have no business getting kids ready for that. Most work is an ugly fact of life, and we have to acknowledge that, but schools shouldn't have any part in it.</P>
<P>
The word "school," by the way, comes from the Greek word "schole," which means "holiday" or "leisure time." Schools were intended to be holidays from the grim world of work which most of us face once we get out of school. And I think they should continue being that.</P>
<P>
That said, then: the purpose of schools should be, I think first of all, to prepare citizens for democracy. Thomas Jefferson, who was our first educator of any import, saw schools as the means of protecting us from our government. Jefferson said that all governments tend to degenerate and become corrupt, and the means of absolutely protecting the nation from this was to improve the minds of its citizens through schools. The second purpose I see is to prepare people to have a rich and meaningful life when they're not at work. We need to have people who can deal with leisure. They must be able to have an interesting life of the mind when they are away from work.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I think by "an aristocracy of worth and genius," Jefferson meant to contrast the kinds of aristocracy he wanted to produce in this nation with the aristocracies in Europe. The aristocracies in Europe were based entirely on birth and blood; there was no room in or out of them. Jefferson saw the schools as a great sorting machine by which you would get the brightest kids each year and give them more education and thus in the end have an aristocracy. These would be our leaders, and that would be the aristocracy of worth and genius, not an aristocracy of birth.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I'm not sure that it has a significance beyond its historical existence. I believe in part it reflects the swing back and forth between a meritocratic thinking about education in which we encourage the best and brightest to come forth and be schooled, versus an egalitarian philosophy and approach to education in which we see it as imperative to provide the same education to all children in order to permit all children to have a chance to succeed in life.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> Well, the notion that all children can learn is basically a meaningless one, until you try to specify what they can learn. And then I think we are in for some disappointment. Because while I do think that many children in schools could learn a great deal more than they are learning today, it is the case that some children cannot learn. We have studied several effective remedial reading programs like Reading Recovery and Success for All. The children who move through those programs are, for the most part, ably assisted. They do learn to read, but some do not.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I wouldn't say it's a pipe dream. And it's certainly something that we ought to strive for because, as we have seen, education has become even more important for individual success. Schools have very little to do with our international competitiveness as a nation, and education is no longer a guarantee that you will get a good job. But what seems to be guaranteed now is, if you don't have an education, you will not get a good job. So we must strive to educate everyone. At the same time, I think we absolutely have to realize that if we were to educate everyone, the country would fall apart. It would fall apart because educated people are allergic to sweat. They won't do the dirty work. They won't clean out the cesspools. They won't sweep the streets. They won't cut branches down that are on the electric wires. We absolutely positively have to have a group of undereducated, unskilled people to do all these dirty jobs that "the comfortable classes," as John Kenneth Galbraith calls them, will not do.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I think what led us more astray than anything that comes immediately to mind was an emphasis on the kinds of skills that could be assessed using multiple choice examinations. That drew us away from the old goals of developing a "disciplined mind," as they referred to it, and more to looking at atomistic, concrete, decontextualized skills--because those are the only kinds that you can assess with multiple choice questions. The desire for this kind of assessment was driven only really from a concern for efficiency. How fast could we get this assessment done? How cheaply could we get it done? And that became an overwhelming consideration once the electromagnetic/electromechanical means of scoring tests were developed.</P>

<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> The kinds of teachers I would want are the kinds who can lead children. Educate comes from the Latin "educare," which means "to lead out." And there are teachers I have seen who are able to lead children towards educative experiences. They have some warmth. They are good people at leading seminars. They seem to have an insight into the thinking process. They also, by and large, like children. And I would start by finding those kinds of teachers because I think no matter what kind of structure you have for the school, if you have a structure at all, no matter what kind of technology you enrich the school with, at heart it's the teacher/learner interaction and the learner/learner interactions that are critical to the educational process.</P>

<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey01.htm">Dr. Bracey, why did you write this book?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey02.htm">Is American education in bad shape--and if so, can it be fixed?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey03.htm">If American education is not in bad shape, why are we hearing so many bad things about it these days?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey04.htm">Are we just spinning in our tracks? Will we ever figure out what to do about our educational system?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey05.htm">Maybe this conversation should have begun with a discussion of the purpose of public education, or learning, in the United States.</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey06.htm">What did Thomas Jefferson mean when he talked about "an aristocracy of worth and genius"?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey07.htm">You mention in your Prologue this pendulum swing between Jefferson's aristocracy of worth and genius and the philosophy that everyone can learn. What's the significance of that swing in history?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey08.htm">Is the notion that all children can learn a realistic one?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey09.htm">So, is the American dream of an education for all citizens just a pipe dream?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey10.htm">What one thing would you change in the focus of education as you've encountered it during your career?</A></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/arrowr.gif"><A HREF="bracey11.htm">If you could build your own school and staff it with teachers, where would you start? What would be the first thing you would do?</A></P>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/arrowd.gif"></TD><TD>Dr. Bracey, do you have any final thoughts on this topic?</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>
<B>BRACEY:</B> I just hope that if people do read this book, they come away from it with a new sense of what American education has been about. Historically, no matter how good American schools have been, they've never been good enough--they've always been carped at and criticized. But you take where we were a century ago and look where we are now--it's quite an amazing process. A century ago we were a nation of 50 million people. There were only about 200,000 students in secondary school. There were some 3 million students who were of the age to be in secondary school but who were not. We now graduate about 83 percent of our students on time. More come back for degrees. More take GEDs.</P>
<P>
If you look at test scores of a variety of kinds, you find that achievement test scores are at all-time highs. You find that many of the national assessment trends are at all-time highs. You find the proportion of students scoring above 650 on the SAT mathematics is at an all-time high. The data show that, as we have gotten education to more and more people, it has not, so far as I can tell, been bought at the cost of quality. And I would hope people would come to realize what an amazing experience the American public schools' provision of education has been.</P>

During the National Conference on Educational Fair Access and the New Media, participants met in small sessions where working committees discussed possible guidelines governing three difficult copyright issues that particularly affect the handling of new electronic and digitized media: the quantity and sources of excerpted materials; the presentation, utilization, and duplication of copyrighted materials; and the retention, access, and storage of multimedia materials. On the final morning, participants met in general session to hear committee reports. A summary of each report follows.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="../bios/mmarcus.htm">Morton J. Marcus</A></H3>
<HR>
<P>&#147;It won't work, you know,&#148; Septum Sixpack said, rocking with conviction. &#147;You can't go around restructuring the way we finance our schools and changing the balance between the various levels
of government. Folks just won't have it.&#148; &#147;It sure will work,&#148; I responded with equal certainty, &#147;if people will give it a chance.&#148; That exchange alone summarized most of the conversations we had
since I moved into the neighborhood eight years earlier. &#147;But wait a second,&#148; I had to confess my
confusion, &#147;what are we talking about this time?&#148;</P>

<P>As usual, we were sitting on the front porch of Septum's home, looking out on the street, its
traffic, and the people who passed by. Septum also used the porch as an observatory&#151;to watch
Henna Homestead, the widow who rented rooms and puttered about the garden across the way.
&#147;Can't do it,&#148; he continued, &#147;too many hurdles, too much doubt, too much trying to change the
way folks think about schools. Gets right to the core of local control. And it won't work.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;What,&#148; I repeated, &#147;are we talking about?&#148; &#147;Fool book you're writing,&#148; he said, surveying the giant rhododendron bushes in the Homestead front yard for signs of Henna's presence. &#147;How do you know what I'm writing?&#148; I asked. &#147;Everybody knows you're writing a book. You've used it for months as an excuse to avoid everything you don't want to do,&#148; he sneered. &#147;But you don't know what's in the book. We haven't talked about it. Nobody, other than the folks at AIT, has
read it,&#148; I insisted.</P>

<P>&#147;Don't need to read it,&#148; he replied. &#147;I know everything in your head from talking to Serina. She goes over there, and you talk to her, and then she comes back over here and talks to me. Don't
take no special training by the CIA to know you're pushing higher taxes, advocating federal control of the schools, and wanting to cut local school boards down to nothing at all.&#148; Serina Seriatim is Septum's granddaughter, a frequent visitor to our house, where she plays with our dogs and our grandchildren. She is the neighborhood mosquito, an innocent carrier of information viruses.</P>

<P>&#147;Hold on,&#148; I said, &#147;your granddaughter is charming, but she doesn't necessarily understand
everything she hears. And, you know as well as I, she loves to use information to inflame well-known passions. She is your daughter's daughter.&#148; &#147;You leave Suzannah out of this,&#148; Septum blazed, defending his daughter, whose one great crime, in his eyes, was marrying an accountant. &#147;Suzannah, my darling Serina, and that parasitic CPA Sheldon are the only family I have left,&#148; he sighed, as his eyes scanned the garden across the street. &#147;Exactly,&#148; I declared, &#147;you and millions of others who are retired or are going to be retired soon. All you have is Suzannah, Sheldon, and Serina. Broadly speaking, that's all any of us have.</P>

<P>&#147;Everyone has heard about the great baby boom, but most people just do not appreciate its
significance. That's what I was trying to tell Serina one day when she was watching me write. The
greatest force in America for the last half of the 20th century and the first third of the next century
is the baby boomers, those persons born between 1940 and 1964.&#148; &#147;Wrong,&#148; Septum interrupted, &#147;the baby boom started in 1946.&#148; &#147;Yes, most people think that, but I look at the data and they tell me the boom started in 1940. The important thing in economic and social affairs is the relative
magnitude of a change. Births from 1940 to 1944 increased by 18% over the level of the preceding half-decade. It was the first increase in 15 years. Only the 1945 to 1949 half-decade saw a greater increase. Even when we had those huge numbers of births in the 1950s, we didn't have percentage increases as great as those we experienced in the early 1940s.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;And it was the baby boomers who put all the pressure on the schools,&#148; Septum said in a hollow
voice, as he spotted Henna. &#147;Sure,&#148; I continued, knowing that I had only his ear and not his brain.
&#147;When the first wave of children entered the schools between the Second World War and the Korean War, there was excess capacity in schools which had been built for larger populations before the Great Depression. But since the 1960s, the edge of the wedge for changing markets, for redirecting resources, has been those born 1940 and on.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;So what?&#148; he asked, now turning his rocker to face directly toward the presumed Garden of
Eden just beyond the flow of traffic. &#147;So what?&#148; I echoed. &#147;So we now have to provide for the
health care and retirement income of approximately 70 million Americans.&#148; &#147;Do not,&#148; Septum
answered, smoothing down his rumpled few locks of hair. &#147;Folks like me have their retirement income and social security. I did it all myself. I saved and put money aside in the stock market, and I have my pension, and I don't depend on anybody. Don't need to have nobody's help on that.&#148;</P>

<IMG SRC="3toles.gif">
<P><I>TOLES &copy; The Buffalo News. Reprinted with permission of UNIVERSAL PRESS SYNDICATE. All rights reserved.</I></P>

<P>&#147;Do too,&#148; I countered, ignoring the invalidating double negative. &#147;Who's going to pay the taxes to support your monthly social security checks? Who's going to create the profits that will pay the
dividends which give your stocks value? Every person expecting to live without earning income in the years ahead is dependent on the income generated by those at work. And how do we get higher levels of income?&#148; Septum was not listening. Henna was on her toes, her arms extended to trim some over-hanging limbs. </P>

<P>&#147;Well, I'll tell you,&#148; I persisted. &#147;This country has to generate earnings by having an internationally competitive labor force. And that is Suzannah and Sheldon today, joined by Serina in a few years.
Your social security check comes from the taxes on their income. Your pension payout comes from the dividends companies distribute out of profits and the sale of stock in your fund's portfolio. And the price received for that stock is a function of the present and prospective profitability of the firm. All that income flowing to you and other retirees depends on the creativity, imagination, and productivity of our children and their children. </P>

<P>&#147;Your family, Septum, is typical of the demographic reality toward which America is moving. You have two adults of labor-force age: one child and one person of retirement age. That's the future population profile of our country. You don't want to be denied your retirement pleasures, to take less income. You don't want to be forced into seeking employment because your social security check is inadequate and your pension insufficient. That's why you should support measures to help today's and tomorrow's workers be more capable of generating income.</P>

<P>&#147;And how do we do that?&#148; I knew I was talking to myself, but I went on. &#147;We reopen our school systems to our former students. We use our school resources to go into the community, the offices, factories, and homes of adults who are 25 to 45 years old today, and we help them learn what they did not learn when they were in school. We need an all-out effort to eradicate not only illiteracy but also the deficient knowledge that so many adults have in math and science. Even if a person got top grades in a 1973 high school biology or chemistry class, he or she could be seriously deficient today. Educators will have to work with employers to identify the areas where the deficiencies are greatest impediments to productivity . Together, they will have to design flexible programs that school systems can provide to improve both knowledge and skills needed on the job.</P>

<P>&#147;And how do we pay for that, Septum? Do you want to see the federal deficit grow? Do you want
this country to go further into debt?&#148; &#147;NO!&#148; he roared. There's nothing like debt and deficit to get Septum's attention. &#147;Blasted government is going to drag us all to perdition.&#148; He was listening
again, on guard, attentive. &#147;Right,&#148; I agreed. &#147;We need to spend money carefully, and we need to pay for the things we want. That's fiscal responsibility. That's the mature conduct of government
affairs.&#148; &#147;Hmm,&#148; he grunted in concurrence.</P>

<P>&#147;So,&#148; I proceeded, &#147;we need to raise taxes. And what should we tax? I think it's a good idea to tax discretionary consumption. It won't hurt too much to consume a little less today in order to
have more tomorrow. Yes, I do think we should raise taxes on a few selected goods and services. For example, when you go bowling, what do you pay?&#148; My friend thought for a moment, and I could see in his eyes an image of Henna Homestead hooking a ball into that sweet spot between the one and the three pin. &#147;Oh, &#145;bout $3 at one of those places that has a $1-a-line for seniors in the early afternoon.&#148; &#147;Would you be willing to pay $3.30, if you knew the revenue was going to be invested in raising the productivity of the American labor force, increasing income, making it easier for Suzannah and Sheldon to earn enough to support you and themselves?&#148; &#147;Might be,&#148; he said softly.</P>

<P>&#147;Right,&#148; I rolled on. &#147;There are taxes we could raise. In addition, there are funds currently used to hide the extent of the federal deficit. These we could use to assure every Serina, wherever she may live, a good, fundamental base of financial support for her education from kindergarten through high school.&#148; &#147;That's how you're going to do it, isn't it?&#148; he smirked triumphantly. &#147;You're going to raise taxes and have the federal government dole out money with heavy chains attached. You'll lure schools into the control of the Department of Education with the carrot of federal funds and then slam them with mandated programs. You'll have Big Brother telling schools all over America what they should teach and how they should do it.&#148; &#147;Did you hear me say that?&#148; I protested. &#147;You don't have to say it,&#148; Septum replied, his eyes flashing with anger. &#147;Just let the Feds get their funding foot in the door and there will be regulations and mandates coming out of every window before long.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;There are three considerations here,&#148; I said, trying to defuse the situation. &#147;First, there is a
legitimate national interest in education and workforce development. Wherever we live, we have a stake in the education of people in other places. Education is not something that can be left entirely to the states and localities. What was reasonable when the country was formed over 220 years ago is not efficient in America today. Second, the local property tax which is currently used to fund so much of the spending done by our schools is inappropriate for that purpose. We should be taxing income, one of the benefits of education, to
support education. Third, there are ways to organize the distribution of funds without the Department of Education deciding who should teach what, how it should be taught, or where it should be taught. To a degree, the day-to-day operations of school systems can be separated from their funding and their accountability.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;Those are easy things to say,&#148; Septum responded, as his eyes drifted to Henna hauling a garden hose into position for an arboreal libation. &#147;And difficult to do? Yes,&#148; I agreed, &#147;but we don't have the luxury of arguing for a decade. Those born in 1940 are enjoying 56 candles on their birthday
cakes this year. They will be demanding more and more health care in the next few years, and they will want their full retirement income shortly thereafter. America needs to expand income. There has to be more to share so that Sheldon and Suzannah can attain the standard of living that you and&#133;,&#148; my eyes indicated the lady across the street who looked as if she were in actual combat with a serpent, &#147;&#133;others of our generation have achieved. As a nation, we want to avoid the bitterness and intergenerational rivalry that could result if the economy does not expand sufficiently to accommodate these claims on income. We don't want you and Suzannah, and ultimately Serina, contesting over a small pie. Improving education is one way of increasing the size of the pie we all must share.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;You're right,&#148; Septum said, as he rose from his rocking chair. &#147;A nice piece of pie would taste good. Maybe you could go over and ask what's-her-name there if she'd like to join us. I'll go cut a
few slices of apple pie or whatever's in the kitchen and make a fresh pot of coffee. There's a touch of autumn in the air.&#148; &#147;Sure,&#148; I responded, &#147;what's-her-name and whatever. Sounds good to me.
I'll be right back.&#148;</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
<I>By <A HREF="/ait/board/sullivan.htm">Michael F. Sulltvan</A></I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>I</BIG></BIG>n a small midwestern city, a first-grade teacher sought a theme to unify her students' work, something that would engage their imaginations and interests. She found what she wanted in a favorite children's picture book, <I>Clifford the Big Red Dog</I>, by Norman Bridwell. Each year, she read the story aloud, and the children drew pictures to illustrate it. She typed the text into a classroom computer, using a program that permitted the students to interact with the words and answer questions. ("Find the word that means a color, and type it.") She recorded her reading of this story and its sequels on audiotape, so that beginning readers could practice listening to the words as their eyes followed the texts. She helped the children create a large papier-mach&#233; model of Clifford, which became the basis for activities in math and measurement. She gave out small felt cut-outs representing a big red dog to each child who read the original book, or any of the sequels, alone. The children glued or sewed these onto a bandolier, similar to ones the Boy and Girl Scouts use to display their badges. At each year's fair at the school, her class mounted a display of the Clifford pictures they had painted, and they proudly wore their Clifford badges.</P>
<P>
Good teaching? Undoubtedly.</P>
<P>
Violation of copyright law? Quite possibly.</P>
<P>
A biochemist at a California university is reading proofs for a scholarly book he has written in collaboration with a colleague in a New York laboratory. Just as he is about to send the proofs back to his publisher, he reads an article, just out, that forces him to reconsider his conclusion. He quickly scans the article into his computer and uploads it for immediate sending to his New York colleague over the Internet. He also sends electronic copies to three other colleagues around the world who are familiar with his work, asking each of his correspondents to consider how his book's conclusion should be modified.</P>
<P>
Does current copyright law require this biochemist to get permission from the author or publisher of the article before converting it to digital form and disseminating it over the Internet?</P>
<P>
Simultaneous revolutions in education and technology are forcing a reexamination of the criteria of "fair use," embodied in the 1976 Copyright Revision Act. A "literature based" reading program, encouraged for K-12 language arts instruction, requires providing students with a great variety of copyrighted print materials. Limited textbook and library budgets undoubtedly send many teachers to the copy machine. As students are encouraged to put together portfolios for assessment purposes, what criteria govern what they are allowed to include? Is a student violating fair-use guidelines when his study of <I>Raisin in the Sun</I> inspires him to direct the production of one scene from the play and to include a videotape of the production in his portfolio? What if the videotape  is shown at a school fair? Suppose his teacher takes it to a professional conference, where she plays it as part of a presentation on portfolio assessment? Should she, or her student, have arranged for performance rights?</P>
<P>
The concept of fair use was introduced in Title 17 of the U.S. Copyright Law, section 107, "Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use" (see appendix). The paragraph lists certain limited circumstances in which copyrighted material can be used without permission from the copyright holder, for news reporting, criticism, research, and teaching. The tests for determining fair use fall short today when questions arise from other applications made possible by new media and technological developments. The line between teaching and performance, and between education and commerce, has become very difficult to map. A teacher may hold up a book before his class to show an illustration or chart, but can the same teacher hold up the book before a television camera in order to broadcast the illustration through a closed-circuit network to a distant learning site? Does a student have the right to put together a multimedia term "paper" that combines material from a variety of sources, including text, graphics, sound, and video?</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Simultaneous revolutions in education and technology are forcing a reexamination of the criteria of 'fair use,' embodied in the 1976 Copyright Revision Act.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
Copyright experts, representatives of educational institutions, and producers of copyrighted material debated questions such as these at the Educational Fair Access and the New Media National Conference, convened at American University in Washington, D.C., June 15-17, 1994. The idea for the conference was born in 1992, when the Consortium of College and University Media Centers (CCUMC) recognized the potential of computerbased technology in educational settings and the need to accommodate instructors and students when they request that a copy of an excerpt be made. At the same time, CCUMC understood the concerns of copyright owners. Fact-finding meetings with copyright experts and concerned government agencies affirmed the need to clarify the issues presented and to provide a vehicle for their open discussion. Thus the mission was defined.</P>
<P>
Other interested parties had also begun to express concern about the vagueness of current fair-use guidelines and the difficulty of applying them to educational uses of new media. The Agency for Instructional Technology (AIT), as a nonprofit producer of innovative, media-based materials for classroom use, recognizes the great need for new guidelines for the use of multimedia technologies in the information industries, especially as they are used by learners and facilitators of learning. Further, AIT holds that convention and the law in our society should allow learners to have "fair access," which the Agency defines as the right to incorporate copyrighted electronic materials into student-produced works or exhibitions of learning.</P>
<P>
Together, CCUMC and AIT planned and sponsored the conference to foster a collaborative, working environment for representatives of the various affected interest groups. The sponsors hoped that participants would come away with a greater understanding of the issues for teachers and learners as well as for copyright holders and with a commitment to the development of new guidelines, even though there remained considerable disagreement about what revised guidelines should say.</P>
<P>
This volume contains papers by the major presenters at the conference, who together represent the full continuum of perspectives on a difficult issue. From the attack of instructional technology director Fred Hofstetter on what he feels are unnecessarily restrictive interpretations of copyright and fair-use guidelines and his call for their thoroughgoing overhaul to Time Warner counsel Bernard Sorkin's thesis that any loosening of current copyright protection is "both unnecessary and undesirable," the essays present the spectrum of the opinions in the field.</P>
<P>
Robert Wedgeworth, representing the situation of librarians, reviews the 1976 Copyright Revision Act, describes the strain that new multimedia uses have put on existing guidelines, and sketches out the kind of new framework that needs to be developed. Acting Register of Copyrights Barbara Ringer discusses the development of the current fair-use guidelines and the role the U.S. Copyright Office might play in revising them. Bruce Lehman, assistant secretary of commerce and commissioner of patents and trademarks in the U.S. Department of Commerce, describes the likely actions of interest groups in shaping new fair-use guidelines and lays out the role of his office in dealing with new technologies, especially in resolving intellectual property issues in connection with the establishment of the national information infrastructure.</P>
<P>

<P>
Michael Ribaudo writes of the quandary of an academic administrator concerned with both faculty members' access to multimedia materials and their rights to materials they have developed. Jon Baumgarten relates his experience as an attorney dealing with copyright issues in an academic setting. Educational use, he says, "is not ipso facto fair use." Bill Mullin, president of a company providing music for media productions, discusses the role of music in multimedia productions and procedures for obtaining performance permissions. Speaking on behalf of producers of educational video programs, Charles Benton relates his experience with the uses and abuses of copyright law and fair-use guidelines by the educational establishment and tells of an attempt to create a commercially viable clearinghouse for licensing off-air copies. President of a large consortium of higher education institutions and associated corporations, Robert Heterick argues that a recent initiative by research libraries and universities to clarify intellectual property rights in an electronic environment deserves support, as long as there is a recognition of the very real differences between print-and the traditions of ownership that have grown up around it-and the new electronic media.</P>
<P>
Speaking for American publishers, Carol Risher says that many of them are ready to explore new-media possibilities for the dissemination of copyrighted works and to work with educators to discuss pilot projects and experimental cooperation. Charles Schneebeck, director of computing services at a California university campus, describes two current activities and one proposal that seek to ensure fair and efficient access to information and at the same time preserve the rights of creators of works. He, like Heterick, points out that information in new, digitized formats requires policies that are quite different from those that were developed to govern print. Hope Botterbusch, representing the Association for Educational Communications and Technology, presents its position statement on fair-use guidelines. Mary Lou Mosley, associate dean of an Arizona community college, enumerates some of the promises and problems that new media and attendant copyright concerns have brought to the faculty. Finally, Kevin Howat describes a promising collaboration between software and hardware providers, publishers, multimedia developers, legal experts, governmental agencies, and educators that provides equipment, design, training, and technical advice to community and education users.</P>
<P>
In addition to the papers presented at the conference, this publication includes reports of the working committees; a summary of the open discussion on the last day; relevant sections of the 1976 Copyright Law; fair-use guidelines for books, music, and off-air videotaping; addresses of participants; and a list of suggested readings.</P>
<P>
We hope this collection will become a useful source of information and opinion to all those engaged in the debate about new media and fair access for education. If the lively discussion at the recent conference was any indication, it will not be easy to decide how much use the first-grade teacher can make of Clifford before she is guilty of copyright infringement. Nor is there any consensus about the actions of the university professor. Everyone involved agrees, however, that such issues must be aired and debated. Ultimately it should be possible to preserve the interests of Clifford's author and publisher, the teacher who uses him creatively, and the children whose learning depends on their fair access to him. <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>A New Framework for Educational Uses of Copyrighted Works</H2>
<P>
<I>By Robert Wedgeworth</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>hank you for the honor of opening this important and timely conference on fair access and the new media.</P>
<P>
It is important in that it addresses issues very much at the heart of the educational enterprise, namely, the environment in which we use the existing knowledge base and add to it. The conference is timely in that almost eighteen years since the enactment of a new copyright law in the United States, there are signs of great apprehension over its application to an increasingly electronic information world.</P>
<P>
Although estimates vary considerably as to when most of the much-heralded promise of the information superhighway and the National Information Infrastructure will appear, it is still a much different world than that which shaped the current copyright law.</P>
<P>
There are, of course, both promises and perils predicted for the new information environment. One of my favorites is the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>'s Mike Royko's description of his experience on the Internet. He describes it like being on a highway in a blizzard with no windshield wipers and all road signs are upside down and backwards.</P>
<P>
And, of course, there are many positive assumptions as to how potential users will behave. Several weeks ago Richard Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios, highlighted some of the insensitivity to consumer convenience by replicating a computer program for ordering pizza. Selecting the size, toppings, and method of payment took more than three minutes. He then picked up the phone and ordered a pizza in seventeen seconds.</P>
<P>
Since the major driving forces of the new information environment anticipate consumer services and products, the educational world will need to be very aggressive in order to keep its interests visible.</P>
<P>
Media educators have been at the front of innovation in education since the end of World War II. However, it may be useful to look at the university library as an illustrative example of factors that influence higher education. Libraries tend to reflect the dominant mode of production and use of educational information.</P>
<P>
As early as 1962 in an exhibit at the Seattle World's Fair, the U.S. library community demonstrated its concept of the library of the 21st century. That exhibit ran from April to October in Seattle and then moved to New York City, where it ran for two similar six-month periods. The exhibit included a traditional collection of books for adults and children. However, it featured several new technologies that were not commonly known to the public at the time. There was a UNIVAC Solid State 90 computer programmed to retrieve three types of information: bibliographies of the great authors of the western world, quotations from those authors on common subjects, and gazetteer information on more than ninety countries.</P>
<P>
Photocopying on plain paper was demonstrated in a machine designed to copy from books. Several stand-alone teaching machines, crude predecessors of today's computer based models, were used to demonstrate repetitive instruction. Finally, we improvised to illustrate a satellite network by connecting pins in a globe with thread. As of 1962 to 1964, these were essential elements of the library of the 21st century.</P>
<P>
Currently, a number of projects are experimenting with components of the library of the future driven primarily by changing technologies and changing economics. In 1994 we still see the continuation of collections of books, journals, manuscripts, and other materials, but in the future they may be stored in electronic formats for retrieval on demand. In addition, many more types of information sources are likely to appear for the first time in an electronic format. These specific changes recognize the increasing costs of books and journal subscriptions and the additional costs of building and maintaining physical spaces to house them. Since 1986 journal prices alone have increased by 108 percent while library budgets increased 92 percent in the same period.</P>
<P>
Information management systems for the storage, retrieval, display, and manipulation of local and remote information sources interconnect libraries from coast to coast and will continue to be developed for more and more specialized constituencies. While early computer-based information sources targeted scientific, legal, and financial communities, more recently the advent of audio and full-motion video capabilities to computing systems have encouraged the arts and humanities to develop networked information sources. Satellite communications envisioned in 1962 now connect the nation's and the world's great library collections, making them accessible to users across the world.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>These issues and their complexity point inevitably to the creation of collective copyright management systems that balance the interests of users and owners under broad-based agreements.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
The more recent developments in library capabilities have been the cause for alarm among some in the author and publisher communities. The principal fear is that, as intellectual properties increasingly become accessible in electronic formats, there will be a tendency toward greater frequency of infringing activities. On the other hand, educators recognize that a huge market exists that cannot be served without more effective delivery and access mechanisms.</P>
<P>
A recent task-force report of the Association of American Universities (AAU) presidents recognizes the enormous changes in the information environment and their copyright implications. Entitled "Intellectual Property Rights in an Electronic Environment," the report addresses the universities' interests as copyrighted materials users, creators, and publishers. Some of the concerns prompting the report include
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>expanded modes of library acquisitions with restrictive contracts or licenses that erode fair use
<LI>restrictive licenses on CD-ROM products, computer software, and on-line services
<LI>limitations on network applications and interactive uses that enhance, alter, or create new materials for classroom use
<LI>questions of university ownership interest in copyrighted materials created by faculty
<LI>changing patterns of faculty transfer of copyright ownership.
</UL></P>
<P>
The AAU recommends (1) creation of model policies that address issues of use and ownership of copyrighted materials; (2) development of a national consensus on fair use in an electronic environment; and (3) study of the feasibility of strengthening university and society-based electronic publishing outlets as means of moderating increased costs of academic information. Model policies are intended to guide practices in ways that will encourage fair use while discouraging abuses or potential infringing activities.</P>
<P>
While the AAU focus on copyright is welcome and will raise new levels of interest within the academic community, it does not address a fundamental problem that hinders the widespread use of copyrighted multimedia materials in an electronic environment.</P>
<P>
Several recent reports address different aspects of this barrier. Problems of inducing voluntary copyright registration are studied in the ACCORD report issued by the Library of Congress. In addition, the American Research Libraries/CAUSE/EDUCOM March 1992 report pinpoints the need for a copyright management system capable of handling the enormous growth and complexity of use stimulated by new information technologies. The report cites three points as motivating factors for supporting this recommendation: ease of access; limited skill required; and social, economic, and political issues.</P>
<P>
The report assumes that the current copyright law is a workable legal framework but that it needs a mechanism for managing the complex technical and legal issues in the electronic domain. The report concludes that the current system for accessing copyrighted works is unmanageable. The features of the system it proposes are open access; security and accuracy for storage and transit; definitions of compensable uses; and advantages of using the system that will accrue to users, creators, brokers, and repackagers.</P>
<P>
These issues and their complexity point inevitably to the creation of collective copyright management systems that balance the interests of users and owners under broadbased agreements. However, in all of the complex economic, social, and political issues affecting the future of copyright, we must not forget that the ultimate purpose is not just to compensate copyright owners or to encourage and support users. Ultimately, we are connecting future generations through the transmission of the culture. Perhaps this is the most important responsibility each generation exercises.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Register of Copyright Perspective</H2>
<P>
<I>by Barbara Ringer</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he passing of the 1976 Copyright Law jarred thousands of librarians and educators in general into an awareness of legal realities. Their initial fears were calmed, however, when they found out that the new law did not appreciably change library operations or decision making. Accommodations had been worked out. People had reached some understanding of their mutual problems.</P>
<P>
But the problems were different then from what they are today. The recent series of lawsuits by the Association of American Publishers, with their unsatisfactory out-of-court settlements, and the campaign to eliminate the fair-use provisions of the copyright law now have librarians practically as well as ideologically on the defensive. Librarians also fear that price discrimination by publishers may be creating a defective licensing environment. For their part, publishers look with suspicion on efforts by the Library of Congress to bring storage-and-retrieval techniques to bear on prices.</P>
<P>
You may wonder why I left the private practice of copyright law to return to the U.S. Copyright Office after thirteen and a half years. It was the result of a crisis in the Library of Congress. Legislation had been introduced in Congress to, in effect, eliminate the main incentive to registration of copyrights still very much a live issue in Congress and elsewhere. The Library of Congress was concerned not only about its own collection but also about the future of the Copyright Office.</P>
<P>
Some of you may have heard of a committee called ACCORD, which is a very nice name for a very contentious committee. It was divided down the middle on whether to keep section 412 of the 1976 Copyright Law; this section is the issue of the day in certain quarters. Eventually there was an understanding among committee members. I think they came out of that exercise, as I certainly did, with a lot more understanding of the whole problem as it now exists.</P>
<P>
What I discovered is that the whole copyright situation had changed since the time I had retired. I had tried to keep my hand in it by reading and so forth, but reading newsletters doesn't really tell you what is going on. The whole technological climate had changed. What astonished me more than anything else was that there was an enormous impasse between publishers and eleemosynary users of all sorts, copyright users such as teachers and librarians. They were not only not talking to each other; they were not even talking among themselves, and that's why I welcome this sort of conference. We need lots more of this sort of thing.</P>
<P>
What will happen with ACCORD and the challenge to the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office remains to be seen. What we did discover was that the Copyright Office itself had to become a lot more user friendly and to encourage registration rather than to try to serve as a sort of gatekeeper for the courts. What I see as the future of the Copyright Office and the copyright system is to provide the informational infrastructure for a copyright management system that will make the process extremely efficient and extremely usable, something on-line and free to everybody that provides a complete, accurate, and dependable record of copyright information, including not only bibliographic information but also ownership information, licensing information, even pricing information. And we're working in that direction.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>We are operating on the premise that we are not going to change the copyright law. I think we can work out at least short-range solutions that will enable us to go forward without meddling with established law.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
There are two initiatives that I would like to tell you about. But first I should note that we are operating on the premise that we are not going to change the copyright law. I think we can work out at least short-range solutions that will enable us to go forward without meddling with established law. You can really open a Pandora's box if you get into section 108, for example. There have been dozens of amendments to the copyright law, and it has not been improved by the process. Down the road, long after I'm gone from the scene, there will probably be another general revision of the copyright law. The last one was in 1976; the one before that was in 1909.</P>
<P>
The first of the initiatives comes out of the Patent Office, from Bruce Lehman, my old pal from the days when we were working on revising the copyright law; he is now commissioner of patents and trademarks and assistant secretary of commerce. Bruce is not only a visionary but also a doer and shaker with respect to copyright. You may wonder why this initiative is coming out of the Patent Office, but that fact does reveal something that people are beginning to realize: that the concept of intellectual property is changing. Copyright used to be for literary property and patents were for industrial property and trademarks were somewhere in between. The portmanteau phrase now is <I>intellectual property</I>, and I am pleased with that. You can't really talk about software, for instance, solely in copyright or patent terms. You have to think of them both. The U.S. Constitution linked them in 1790, and maybe we're coming back to that point again in our history.</P>
<P>
The Patent Office, which is swimming in money because it is fee driven, unlike the Copyright Office, is going forward with a report, a very challenging and stimulating report, that addresses the problems we are here to talk about today. It is based on hearings and a lot of study within the Patent Office. I think it deserves our careful consideration. It's called a preliminary draft of the report of the working group on intellectual property rights, and when it is released it will be distributed fairly widely. There will be hearings on it. It has administration backing, and I urge you to take careful account of it.</P>
<P>
The report calls for amendments in the copyright law. The two that I focus on as most important involve the distribution right. The law speaks of transmission of performances and displays. What we are now concerned about is network transmissions that might be downloaded and manipulated at various places. The present law doesn't quite fit. It could be made to fit, but it probably would be better, as the report suggests, to try to make clear that the transmission right is a distribution right when it involves hard copy that you are putting on the network, visual images that are the full text of copies of works. This would be a new right that would be added to the law. It would affect teachers, scholars, librarians-the whole educational and eleemosynary community.</P>
<P>
There are other more technical proposed amendments, but the one that you are mainly interested in is fair use. This is very controversial. What I interpret the proposal as saying is basically, let's beef up copyright; let's give copyright owners substantially more protection across the board in areas where there are big gaps, like the performance of records. At the same time, revisit the whole fair-use provision and possibly expand sections 107 and 108 to accommodate what is going on in the real world. This may be a good idea, but it will not be easy to accomplish. It will be like moving a mountain. I went through such processes during the 1976 revision, and I know exactly what I am talking about.</P>
<P>
The other initiative comes out of the Library of Congress, which has been frustrated by lack of money and lack of infrastructure to go forward with it. The basic plan, as just approved, is to have a series of meetings at the Library of Congress to address problems with respect to the information superhighway, not just the intellectual property problems but also the whole technical infrastructure funding and reorganization that would be necessary in institutions like the Library of Congress. One of the main things on the agenda will be a working party on copyright in a very broad sense.</P>
<P>
Eric Schwartz, policy planning advisor in the Copyright Office, has put forward a proposal-which the librarian of Congress has accepted-to do a test project that would be tied in with another test project we have going for electronic delivery of copyright applications. (The whole copyright process would be done electronically. We are pretty far along with that project now; I think we're actually going to start the test this year.) According to Eric's proposal, we would first define the works desired by the Library of Congress for the project, and we're thinking only of printed material, although I know that many people think we should go beyond that. We need to start small. For published, printed material, we would work out a system under which we have copyright permission and would be paying royalties for putting it on line. Then we would define the community of users, and we're now thinking seriously about confining the first test to nonprofit educational institutions, for classroom use only. We would try to determine the number of students who would participate and receive the materials, then define the intended uses. We would use dedicated lines that wouldn't be open to the public in general. Whatever you call it, performance or display or whatever, would be permitted within defined limits, a certain amount of reproduction so that the students could do what students do with such things.</P>
<P>
We would identify the copyright owners of all the works included and try to find some kind of umbrella monitoring system. It is useless to talk in terms of one-on-one licensing. You just cannot do it. People will not use the material or will start using it clandestinely. We need an umbrella organization like ASCAP-not the clammy hand of government, not compulsory licensing, but some way that users could call up something, get permission to use it, and then pay for it without going through gyrations. This must be built into budgets. We cannot go forward into the next century trying to rely on the totally bankrupt notion of fair use to cover everything you want to do.</P>
<P>
Finally, and this is the bottom line, we would try to negotiate a single license with appropriate representatives for a limited time, and maybe some part of the licensing fees could come back into the system to try to make it run.</P>
<P>
I urge and implore you to be involved in this system. If you resist it-or, even worse, do not talk about it-you're going to be bounced one way or the other anyhow. We must sit down and talk together; I see this happening today, and I'm very grateful to be here to see it.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<B>Barbara Ringer</B> returned to the U.S. Copyright Office as acting register of copyrights in November 1993, having served as register from 1973 to 1980, when she retired from the office. Ringer began her career in 1949 as a GS-5 copyright examiner after earning her law degree from Columbia University's Law School. She held various posts with the Copyright Office, from head of the Renewals and Assignments Section, to assistant chief, to chief of the Examining Division. In addition, she was director of the Copyright Division of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization in Paris (1972-73). Ringer played a major role in the revision of the 1976 Copyright Law and active roles in the 1971 revisions of the Bern Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention. Beginning in 1980, she served in the law firm of Spencer & Kaye in Washington, D.C., in her specialty of copyright law. Ringer is the author of numerous studies, bibliographies, and articles in legal and professional journals and is a teacher and lecturer in her area of expertise.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Department of Commerce and Patent and Trademark Office Perspective</H2>
<P>
<I>By Bruce A. Lehman</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>I</BIG></BIG>'d like to start by explaining why I'm on this program. There is some confusion about my role. I am commissioner of patents and trademarks but also assistant secretary of commerce, and in the latter capacity I am an advisor on intellectual property issues to the Clinton administration. It's in this capacity that I'm here today.</P>
<P>
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown heads the National Information Infrastructure Task Force. That is the administration's primary mechanism for carrying out its promise to promote the rapid construction of the electronic superhighway. In keeping with our role as new Democrats, we're not going to pump a huge amount of money into big public works projects, partly because we don't have the money but also because the job is already being done, and in many ways quite well, by the private sector: fiber-optic cable, satellite distribution systems, cable systems, and so forth. So we already have or are building the main features of an electronic information infrastructure.</P>
<P>
The real issue for the administration is whether the full benefits of this infrastructure are going to reach the American people, and sooner rather than later. Will it have minimal benefits or maximum benefits? Will it have a minor effect on the economy, or is it going to stimulate major economic growth? Will it stimulate exports? Will it put the United States in a more competitive position internationally?</P>
<P>
The way that we make certain that the full potential of the NII, the national information infrastructure, is realized is by tuning the dials of public policy in Washington. A major part of this effort is improving and accelerating the building of the physical infrastructure. My colleague Larry Irving, who is assistant secretary for telecommunications policy in the Department of Commerce, is leading that part of the task force. He is working on bills that are already pending on Capitol Hill to try to accelerate deregulation and competition in constructing the highway.</P>
<P>
Also in the Commerce Department, Arati Prabhakar, who is director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is working on the issue of applications for the highway. The federal government is the biggest user, and Prabhakar is working on trying to harmonize and standardize government applications so that they will provide a road map for everyone else. If we, who use the NII in government, come up with standards, that will make it easier for all the disparate elements of the private sector to work together.</P>
<P>
We also have an Information Policy Committee headed by Sally Katzen, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. It has three parts. One part is concerned with privacy and security, an important area in these days of electronic data. Another is examining how we will treat government information. Work produced by the government is not copyrightable, mainly because we want to make it widely available to the public.  The committee is busy finding out how the information infrastructure can make it even more accessible to the public.</P>
<P>
The third part of the information committee is the intellectual property rights working group, which I have been assigned to chair.  It consists of people from just about all the federal agencies. Since last fall have been attempting to define the intellectual property issues and to come up with a series of recommendations. Our opening shot was a series of public hearings where about 60 witnesses testified. We have also brought in experts and consultants from time to time and talked with them.</P>
<P>
The overall NII Task Force, by the way, consists entirely of executive branch officials. Our advisory council, however, consists of about 30 nongovernmental officials from both the not-for-profit and the profit-making sectors. The co-chairs are Ed McCracken, president of Silicon Graphics, and Delano Lewis, chief executive of National Public Radio. The committee's role is to look at what we're doing and represent the community that is concerned with this project.</P>
<P>
We are now reaching a critical point. We are about to release our preliminary report. There is a good reason why we call it preliminary. We want to get feedback from as many people as possible; the information infrastructure is too important to let it be dominated by special interests. When our report is released we will seek comments that will be on the Internet. Those who wish may download the report or access it from the Internet, and we will accept comments in writing from the Internet. Those comments will be available for public inspection in our office. We will have public hearings in addition so that people can come and explain their views. Eventually we will issue a final report. Only then will we make serious recommendations for changes in statutory law.</P>
<P>
I'd like to say a few words about the philosophy of this emerging report. Fortunately we have some successful examples in history to look at. The whole evolution of the 1976 Copyright Law, which many of us worked on, and the things that happened subsequently, the amendments-all of that gives us a good history. I think basically the Copyright Law has worked very well in an era of changing technologies over the past twenty years. We don't want to completely rewrite the whole law. We would be working for the next hundred years. It took twenty years to do the 1976 law.</P>
<P>
The place to start is to decide how the existing law is going to cover the information infrastructure, then write an analysis that will serve as a guidepost for people wanting to use the infrastructure. We have precedent for that. The Commission on New Technological Uses (CONTU) of copyrighted works that was set up in the 1970s issued a report in 1978 that ultimately became the legislation on computer software copyright in 1980. Now the computer software copyright amendments were probably about five sentences long-very modest amendments to the law. But those statutory changes built on a scholarly and extensive analysis of how the existing law of copyright should apply to the new age of computer software. And so the CONTU report provides a basis for people to work on, and it has worked quite well. The proof is that even though there is a lot of anxiety in this field and people are talking about litigation, there is more litigation in real estate in one year in Washington, D.C., than there is in the area of copyright, and certainly computer software copyright, in the whole United States. That is proof of the efficacy of these processes that we evolved over the past twenty years.</P>
<P>
Some fairly modest statutory changes may be recommended in the preliminary report. But by and large the report will be an explanation of how the existing copyright law will function in the context of the digitized world of the information superhighway. This question not only has important domestic implications but also is critical to world commerce in intellectual property, to freedom of information and exchange of information on a global basis. I hope it will be the basis for an emerging global understanding of how the intellectual property law will work.</P>
<P>
I know that the present group has a particular interest in fair access and fair use. And I know that those attending this conference include people in the academic and library communities and people in the proprietary publishing community. One thing we realized early on when we got into our analysis of how the existing law would work is the very fine work that was done in the 1970s to provide a statutory foundation for the previously existing traditional doctrine of fair use and then to flesh that out with guidelines and understandings that an elementary school teacher could apply. That work was going to come under considerable strain in the digital superhighway context and those guidelines simply would not apply. Guidelines on photocopying don't have any relevance to the downloading of a copyrighted work by a PC in an elementary school and the use of that work in the elementary school, if one wants to make copies or use it in various ways and share it within that environment. We don't have guidelines on that right now. If people are to feel secure in using the information superhighway and if proprietors of copyrighted information are to feel secure in putting their vehicles onto the highway, they must have some sense that products won't be stolen. And the users need assurance that they won't be sued if they use the superhighway.</P>
<P>
This gets back to the point I made about the superhighway benefits coming sooner rather than later. If we do not move quickly to define the scope of fair use in this area, there will be a chilling effect. Publishers will be unlikely to want to use the superhighway to distribute their products, and users will be afraid to use it because of the legal liability. Those who work for school systems know that one of the most flourishing areas of law these days is advising school boards on potential liabilities. So it is important to have a new round of discussions about the scope of fair use in the digital context.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>If we do not move quickly to define the scope of fair use in this area, there will be a chilling effect. Publishers will be unlikely to want to use the superhighway to distribute their products, and users will be afraid to use it because of the legal liability.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
One of the things we will be doing as a working group of the National Information Infrastructure Task Force is convening a conference at which we will attempt to determine what the issues are and how to come up with a common understanding of what the scope of fair use is in the digital environment. For example, in the existing guidelines, we have section 108 for library photocopying, but we have a separate section 107 for educational fair use. I don't imagine at this point that there will be any statutory changes in section 107. I think 107 probably can work well in the digital context, but we do need to understand how it applies. This is the kind of issue we will be looking at in this conference.</P>
<P>
As for our report, we encourage everyone to read it carefully and to give us their reactions. We in the administration are concerned about improving access for all of our citizens to all of the benefits of our society. We have not forgotten our responsibility to make certain that the nation's resources are available fairly to everybody, and one of the hallmarks of the national information infrastructure project is to attempt to ensure wide access.</P>
<P>
I'd also like to say a word about the copyright management system at the Library of Congress, which Barbara Ringer also spoke about and which is discussed in our report. It is a perfect example of the tremendous central role that the Library of Congress can play in the national information infrastructure, to provide a standardized mechanism for keeping control of copyrights so that they can work in the digitized system. We applaud that work.</P>
<P>
You may recall that the Clinton campaign in 1992 was summed up in the phrase "It's the economy, stupid." Someone has now coined a phrase in the context of the national information infrastructure: "It's the content, stupid." That's what we're all concerned about: the content and the rules of the road for the content in the NII. I look forward to working with all of you in the coming months so that our nation will continue to occupy a leadership position on the emerging superhighway.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Copyright Issues from the Perspective of an Academic Administrator</H2>
<P>
<I>By Michael Ribaudo</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>I</BIG></BIG>ssues of copyright pose an almost schizophrenic dilemma for those of us involved in academic administration in higher education.  We know that exposure to multimedia-based course materials can be tremendously beneficial to the learning process.  On the other hand, we find ourselves supporting individual faculty members and faculty development teams with released time, equipment, and programming support.  We expect a return on our investment that will yield multimedia applications rich in primary and secondary source materials from which our students can profit significantly.  And while we would hope for an ideal world where our faculty authors could operate without the restrictions imposed by intellectual property concerns, we recognize the legitimacy of the claims of copyright holders who expect to see their rights of ownership honored.</P>
<P>
As administrators, we often feel like laymen, neither conversant in the intricacies of copyright law nor as experienced as authors with the frustrations of navigating the system.  We are told of the barriers that copyright regulations present to the creation and dissemination of media-rich instructional software.  We are barraged by the accounts of individual faculty members and by what we read in the press to such an extent that at times we have difficulty knowing which end is up.</P>
<P>
And, if anything, advances in technology and the dramatic growth of media-rich materials now sitting on file servers and widely available over the Internet make the situation even more confusing.  From my desktop machine today, using Internet navigation tools such as Mosaic, I can browse through hundreds of virtual museums all over the world and call up to my display high-resolution images of paintings, photographs, movie clips, animations.  In most cases, the servers on which these digital data reside contain no caveats or cautions regarding ownership or what I can do or should not be doing with these files if I choose to have them forwarded to me.  In the area of World Wide Web servers alone, it seems that hundreds of new resources are announced each month, and more and more colleges and universities are deploying the networks and work stations that are making access by faculty to these resources more and mores ubiquitous.</P>
<P>
Media consumers need to work hand in hand with media owners to grapple with these issues and to look toward advancing technologies not as the source of new problems in the area of intellectual property concerns but rather as a means to new solutions.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Corporate Perspective</H2>
<P>
<I>By Jon A. Baumgarten</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>I</BIG></BIG> was pleased to be invited to participate in this conference, which I think will illuminate important developments and concerns in law, technology, and education. It's interesting to be following Dean Michael Ribaudo of the City University of New York, since I did my undergraduate work at what was then City College of New York. (But I obtained my law degree from New York University [NYU], and, when my clients found NYU photocopying, that didn't stop me from taking the appropriate legal action.)</P>
<P>
I must immediately make a disclosure that I hope will not unduly disappoint the organizers of and participants in this conference. Though I am and have long been copyright counsel to the Association of American Publishers, I am not here as a formal representative of the AAP; nor do I have any authority whatsoever to negotiate or agree to specific guidelines on behalf of the association or its members. You're most fortunate today to have with you Carol Risher, the vice president for copyright and new technology for the association. I think that I speak for both Carol and myself when I say that our purpose here is principally to learn about the use of technology in an educational context, to participate in discussions about these developments, and to share publishers' concerns. We're just beginning to understand what the new role of publishers, the new role of librarians, and the new role of educators is in this exciting, emerging environment.</P>
<P>
Having made this disclosure, let me share with you a few of my personal general observations about fair use. First, in my view-and, I suggest, in the view of the United States Supreme Court, the appellate courts, and trial courts as well as the Congress- the doctrine of fair use is a limited, albeit very important, defense to copyright infringement. It is not, as some commentators would have it, a broad-based fundamental right of unauthorized use or a pillar of users' rights on a par with the exclusive rights accorded to copyright owners under the copyright laws.</P>
<P>
Second, a related concept: although the application of fair use can and undoubtedly will be affected by developments in technology, it remains a limited privilege for occasional and essential supplemental activity. The doctrine is not and should not be a basis for regularized or systematic exploitation of others' property without permission. I recall during the case I mentioned earlier against NYU the great public anguish expressed by educators that we were pursuing such a case. Nonetheless, a lot of educators came to us privately and applauded the bringing of the lawsuit. And when we began to think about it, we realized that the condemnation was coming mainly from undergraduate faculty members and that the praise was coming more quietly but equally powerfully from graduate faculty. A large part of the difference, we realized and had confirmed to us, was that graduate faculty members, who wrote the books, were seeing their royalties disappear as their undergraduate colleagues picked bits and pieces from their books and put them in homemade, unauthorized anthologies, leaving their books to go out of print.  Authorization for the use of other people's property, as Luddite as it may seem to some, is still a matter of fundamental importance to publishers, authors, and to the societal interest in the creation of quality educational materials.</P>
<P>
Third, I think it is clear that educators, school administrators, and publishers share the objective that Commissioner Lehman mentioned, and that Barbara Ringer and Bob Wedgeworth reflected as well, of a common commitment to the importance of educating schoolchildren and students at all levels of achievement in this country. Having a thriving educational environment is a national imperative. And the fair-use doctrine undoubtedly has a role here, though its parameters are yet to be determined. But just as publishers must and will come to understand the legitimate needs of educators in the technological age, educators must understand that educational use is not ipso facto fair use. Court decisions have restated and emphasized this point, not just in recent cases but as long ago as the early 1900s, long before photocopying was thought of.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Authorization for the use of other people's property, as Luddite as it may seem to some, is still a matter of fundamental importance to publishers, authors, and to the societal interest in the creation of quality educational materials.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
Educational needs in this country have been and will continue to be served by a dedicated, risk-taking, and profit-seeking private publishing community willing to invest its resources, time, effort, and money in creating, developing, and disseminating educational materials. As new technologies change the nature of the educational marketplace, publishers will seek new ways of serving these needs with innovative materials designed to capture the attention and the imagination of students and to enable educators to work their skills and their incomparable magic in the classroom. Education and publishing form a cooperative, not an antithetical, environment. The usurpation of this market through an unbridled rush to capitalize on the promise of technology without regard for the interests of those-authors and publishers-who make possible the works that the technology uses will in the end be counterproductive and will destroy the cooperative environment.</P>
<P>
If this conference is a first step taken in a cooperative spirit, to be complemented shortly by other steps forward, then it is certainly worthwhile. But if this conference and others like it are simply additional steps in pressing the notion that technology is wonderful, we must use it, and everything else be cast aside, then I suggest that not much is going to be accomplished. I hope the first picture that I portrayed is the one that develops, and I look forward to participating with you. Thank you.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Getting Your Music's Worth Beyond Fair Use</H2>
<P>
<I>By Bill Mullin</I></P>

<BIG><BIG>F</BIG></BIG>eelings are often remembered long after intellectual details have faded. In the words of Thomas Fuller, "Seeing is believing, feeling's the truth." Educational media programs, while designed to convey the range from concrete information to abstract concepts, are not wholly effective as strictly factual presentations. The more compelling and engaging programs are emotional in content to some degree, even when conveying clear-cut information. Students' developed affinities toward a topic can have a great deal to do with what they retain about it. The feeling people have about learning a subject has a lot to do with how they integrate it into their collective and sometimes tacit understanding of it. One of the most effective tools for creating an appropriate feeling in your message is music.<P>
<P>
<B>M<SMALL>USIC'S</SMALL> R<SMALL>OLE IN</SMALL> M<SMALL>EDIA</SMALL> P<SMALL>RODUCTIONS</SMALL></B><BR>
Music can play a number of roles in your script. It can attract attention. It can set up, emphasize, or punctuate points of interest. It can create tension and release for problem/solution deliveries. Are you attempting some finality, or do you want to suggest that there's more to come? Sometimes music is simply a bridge from one topic to another. It acts as a nice buffer between statements. In this respect, it's the equivalent of "white space" in print. The audience can relax, breathe, and prepare for more.</P>
<P>
There are times when no music at all is best. This "effective silence" technique can act as a point of punctuation or lend gravity to a point, cueing the listener to give serious attention.</P>
<P>
<B>H<SMALL>OW TO</SMALL> F<SMALL>IND</SMALL> A<SMALL>PPROPRIATE</SMALL> M<SMALL>USIC</SMALL></B><BR>
There are educational situations where a fair use of copyright material may be valid. However, there are other cases where the program may be considered as enhancing the academic worth of the school or instructor and so gaining a "commercial advantage."</P>
<P>
So, where do you find music that complements the environment you're creating? With sufficient time and budget, you can have original music scored. With this option, you may be licensing the use of a composed piece (on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis) or you may create a "work-for-hire" agreement, where you own the song upon payment. These terms should be clearly established with the music provider.</P>
<P>
You can also opt for tracking down the licensing of a popular song. This process may involve several levels of permissions to use. The record label, which owns the recording, and the composer and publisher, who own the composition, need to approve the use. If you can only get the license for the song, or the recording use is expensive, you may want to record your own version.</P>
<P>
When original or popular music is not required to be your theme, or the process is too cumbersome and expensive, your best resource is a production music library. There is a wealth of preproduced stock music of every kind on compact disc, designed specifically for media production, at very reasonable rates. Best of all, long past are the days of the canned, postwar, newsreel/documentary sound that once was available on vinyl records. The difference between the quality of production music and the output of a major record label is virtually nonexistent.</P>
<P>
There are many advantages of using a production music library:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>The library includes good music recordings and quality performances that are not otherwise available. 
<LI>Library compositions are designed for media use and blend well with narration.
<LI>The music is less expensive than original or licensed pop music.
<LI>It's relatively easy to get clearance from one source.
<LI>Library music is available for immediate use.
</UL></P>
<P>
<B>M<SMALL>USIC AT</SMALL> W<SMALL>ORK</SMALL></B><BR>
Your audience today, whether in the classroom or across a satellite network, is sophisticated about media. The viewer will accept a diversity of styles and moods that work with the message. This cultural mingling is present everywhere, from motion pictures to local advertising. The styles of symphonic orchestration coexist with cutting-edge rock, and the textural effects of new age or world-beat music are often superimposed on music that is eclectic, electric, acoustic, and even opera. General acceptance of this mixture allows a lot of liberty in this global village and provides a broad palette of choices as we move from project to project or from scene to scene within a project.</P>
<P>
How does music work with your message? The obvious consideration is tempo and rhythm. Your audience will readily identify with the pace of a piece, as their heartbeats respond to its rhythm. The level of activity is important, too. Do you want to imply busyness or sparseness? What style appeals to your audience's lifestyle? Styles can invoke geographic images, time periods, or states of being such as action or reflection. Some copywriters report that they often select the appropriate music first and then use it as a source of inspiration for the copy.</P>
<P>

<P>
<B>C<SMALL>OPYRIGHT</SMALL> A<SMALL>WARENESS</SMALL></B><BR>
It is essential to be aware of how music, an intellectual property, is acquired. There are basically three rights to be concerned with when using music. One is the <I>synchronization right</I>. This gives you permission to apply the music to visuals or spoken word. The <I>mechanical right</I> gives you permission to reproduce copies. These two rights are granted by the music library. The <I>performance right</I> provides permission for public performances of the music in your production. ASCAP and BMI are organizations governing performance rights to which most composers assign clearance and fee-collection duties. It is often best for the instructional media presentation to secure the performance rights directly from the music library, too. Doing so eliminates the concern for ASCAP/BMI clearances. Music libraries will cooperate for most forums that are not wide-broadcast exposures, such as radio and television.</P>
<P>
<B>L<SMALL>ICENSING</SMALL> O<SMALL>PTIONS</SMALL></B><BR>
Libraries usually offer at least one of three basic licenses or purchase options for the synchronization and mechanical rights. The "per-use" license may be the oldest established type. With this, you can obtain a set of discs, usually by paying a nominal access fee to have them on hand, and remit a license payment when you use particular songs found on the CDs. This option has traditionally been called "needle-drop." Costs vary from $25 to $75 per song for each application. The advantage of a per-use approach is that you have about the lowest initial outlay and only pay for what you use.</P>
<P>
If you are using a large quantity of music, an "annual blanket" or "lifetime license" may be your best choice. The annual plan gives you a quantity of music with rights to apply any of it to unlimited productions within a year. The library asks that you log what you use, reporting it at a certain time. Depending on the amount of music you get, an annual fee can run from $800 to $5,000.</P>
<P>
The lifetime license (sometimes called a <I>buy-out</I>) is long term. You pay one time for use of a set of music.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Association for Information Media and Equipment Perspective</H2>
<P>
<I>By Charles Benton</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>hanks to the organizers of this conference for bringing us together to consider new fair-use guidelines for the new media in education. The subject needs to be addressed by all the affected parties. I am here to offer my experience and judgment and also to try to represent the views of my beleaguered colleagues in the audiovisual business. But most important, I am here to listen, to learn, and to get involved however I can to be of help in our collective struggle for progress on this issue.</P>
<P>
The Association for Information Media and Equipment (AIME) represents approximately 100 agencies interested in copyright law. Educational media copyright owners are represented as regular members; the National Association of Regional Media Centers and major school district and museum audiovisual and instructional technology directors are represented as associate members. AIME was formed in the early 1980s for people who were interested in copyright issues and how they related to fair use in education. AIME formed the Copyright Information Center, including the AIME copyright hotline, which services AIME members. We also produced a widely used video, hosted by Bill Kurtis, which is currently being revised to reflect the new technologies. AIME also writes articles, provides information on copyright issues, and sponsors workshops at many state and national educational conferences. AIME is here today because its members support the need for developing guidelines for fair use of the new media in education that are clear and usable.</P>
<P>
Perhaps some personal background would also be useful. This is my 41st year in the educational media business-15 years with Encyclopaedia Britannica Films and 26 years with Public Media Inc. (PMI) and Films Incorporated. We call ourselves a video publisher-distributor-licensor. Between 1978 and 1982 I served as chairman of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, and in 1979 I chaired the first White House Conference on Library and Information Services. As one of the legacies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Benton Foundation was created in 1981, and you'll notice that, on your list of participants, I am identified as its president. Two months ago, at the request of the Clinton administration, we hosted in Washington, D.C., a public interest summit for the national information infrastructure, which over 650 people from the nonprofit sector attended. Vice President Gore was the keynote luncheon speaker. Therefore, I bring to our discussion not only a business but also a public policy and public interest perspective.</P>
<P>
I think perhaps it was this "multiple hats" perspective that led PMI to start the Television Licensing Center (TLC) in 1980, just one year after Representative Bob Kastenmeier developed his fair-use guidelines for off-air videotaping-the educational fair access and new media guidelines of 15 years ago.</P>
<P>
Improving accessibility for all educators was a goal of PMI when we developed the TLC in 1980 with PBS to license the off-air taping of "Cosmos." We can draw upon the experience of the Center. It allowed educators to tape off air and pay a fee to retain programs on tape. At that time videos were high priced, and this gave teachers the opportunity to use videos at a much lower price. It was the only attempt in the industry to improve accessibility through establishing a commercially viable clearinghouse for the long-term licensing of off-air copies.</P>
<P>
Through the early and mid '80s, the Licensing Center continued to serve a useful function with BBC, Annenberg, and other major PBS programming. But then it died. What happened? I think our experience is instructive.</P>
<P>
While all this was happening, the home video business was exploding. After settling the Beta-VHS format war in the early '80s, more and more new programs came into the market at increasingly low prices. Of course, Hollywood led the way with its feature films. Public libraries (Rochester, New York, was the first) began circulating videos "for home use only," without acquiring public performance rights from the nontheatrical distributors. Home video distributors and institutional catalog companies started to push into the educational market, using the face-to-face teaching classroom exemption as the rationale for ignoring and bypassing public performance rights. School boards and administrators began asking why there should be such a large price differential between videos for home use and videos for education. Many of the major film libraries and media centers began to atrophy as prices fell and decentralization of educational media decision making accelerated. Meanwhile, Cable in the Classroom and Whittle Communications grew with their political and business agendas only partially focused on meeting real educational needs. And PBS was rediscovering its original educational mission, most recently affirmed by Ervin Duggan, its new president, in his May 25, 1994, report to PBS member stations, discussed at the annual meeting in Orlando.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>AIME is here today because its members support the need for developing guidelines for fair use of the new media in education that are clear and usable.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
You may ask, what does all this have to do with the Copyright Law and the new media? What I am trying to communicate is the climate in the audiovisual sector-the "old" new media, if you will-of the educational media business where misrepresentations or ignorance of the law have led to the devaluation of public performance rights. The overall impact of this has been devastating to the audiovisual business.</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there is only so much time for media use in the classroom, and if that time is being taken up by "free" media whatever the source, through cable or PBS or fair use or otherwise then one must consider point 4 of Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Law: "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."</P>
<P>
Consider how many of the established educational audiovisual producers are still producing original programs for the classroom-almost none. TV entertainment or programming produced for the general audience and somehow adapted for educational use is now more the rule than the exception.</P>
<P>
As we're struggling with fair-use guidelines for the new computer-based multimedia programs for education, which are proliferating, we need to bear in mind both the intended and unintended consequences of the new media guidelines for video 15 years ago, and do better this time around.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Managing Intellectual Property on the Net</H2>
<P>
<I>By Robert C. Heterick, Jr.</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he nation's capital has been much taken with discussion of the Internet, a national information infrastructure (NII)-"information superhighways"-and even a global information infrastructure. Competition for the protocols that will undergird the NII has been waged between those who favor a de jure approach and those who follow a de facto strategy. It would appear that the de facto approach to the Internet protocols has won out by sheer force of arms, or at least by having something that works and is used, in contradistinction to the laboriously crafted and mostly ignored International Standards Organization protocols.</P>
<P>
There may be a lesson here in approaching the issue of copyright and fair use in the networked world. The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and the Association of American Universities (AAU) project, "Intellectual Property Rights in an Electronic Environment," attempts an extrapolation of intellectual property from the print to the networked world based upon laboriously crafted legal and political precedent. But the networked world isn't anything like the print world, and it certainly isn't a simple extrapolation of it. Without some better understanding and resolution of intellectual property issues there isn't likely to be much scholarly information on the information superhighway.</P>
<P>
We all know the general outline of the problem. Colleges and universities have, certainly since the 1970s and 1980s, paid a fair amount of attention to patent policy. Striking it rich in biotechnology has been on the wish list of every research university development officer. Copyright policy, on the other hand, has not captured the attention of institutional administrators, who have generally seen it as part of the faculty role in research output-something with little or no market value. What has generally been overlooked is the role of faculty members as consumers in their teaching and scholarship roles.</P>
<P>
The impact of faculty as consumers of scholarly information certainly hasn't been lost on our institutional libraries, which have contended with double-digit inflation in science, technology, and medicine serials for most of the last decade. Nor has it been lost on print publishers, many of which find packaging faculty scholarly output to be quite profitable. At the same time, abuse of intellectual property rights has been downright painful for some, particularly software publishers.</P>
<P>
Lost revenues by software copyright holders alone are estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. As a consequence, we have witnessed an increasing effort on the part of owners of intellectual property to seek the stronger protection of patent. As we are all painfully aware, the Patent Office has not been prepared to deal with software as "invention" and has awarded several highly questionable patents for processes that most have considered prior art. In fact, the Patent Office has recently moved to overturn one patent granted within the past year and is considering similar action on at least one other patent recently granted.</P>
<P>
One would have to conclude that copyright in the networked world is not working very well, for either consumers or owners of scholarship. As we deal more and more with networked, multimedia forms of scholarship, we can only expect the situation to worsen.</P>
<P>
The AAU/ARL report calls for several activities on the part of our colleges and universities. All are long overdue. The report encourages the academic community to come to consensus on what should constitute fair-use rights in an electronic environment. It calls for a study on creating and strengthening competitive university and society-based electronic publishing outlets. And it calls upon institutions to volunteer to create model policies for institutions as copyright users and as creators of copyrightable materials.</P>
<P>
All this is good, but we need more, I think. And what we need isn't likely to come from our historic community of scholars but is much more likely to arise from the networking community much as the Internet protocols did-by experiment, by consensus on what works, and by common agreement on what is useful.</P>
<P>
The print paradigm is one that invests heavily in up-front effort because it was expensive to typeset, to have reasonable press runs, to maintain inventories, to misestimate the number that will be sold, and to distribute artifacts of tangible weight and dimension. Much as most of our financial activities were preaudited before computers, our print media has been pre-everything for similar reasons. In the electronic age it is not even clear that editorial judgment should be exercised before "publication." It may be the case that some of the ideas that are needed to make copyright work in the information age are already being tried on the Internet and bulletin board systems.</P>
<P>
There is already a fair amount of research being done on how to transfer copyright royalties on the net. There are likely more folks than we know experimenting with embedding copyright indicators in message headers or checksums. I'm sure some folks are experimenting with "knowbots" or agents that carry and disseminate information about copyright. A number of perceptive students of the Internet and copyright have already made the observation that the time-value of information might be recognized in an electronic environment by decreasing royalties over the life of copyright for ephemeral scholarly materials.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Copyright in the networked world is not working very well, for either consumers or owners of scholarship. As we deal more and more with networked, multimedia forms of scholarship, we can only expect the situation to worsen.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
So, by all means, let's pursue the AAU/ARL agenda. But let's also try to understand in what ways the electronic environment is different from print. Digital information is nonexcludable (copying is almost free) and nondiminishable (copying is almost perfect). These are not characteristics of the print world. Derivative works and the bundling of public with private goods by value adders will be characteristic of the networked world. Neither form is particularly commonplace in the print world.</P>
<P>
While the rationale behind fair use can be found directly in the Constitution, it can also be seen as a subsidy. Unlike most federally directed subsidies, this one does not direct federal funds to consumers or their agents, but rather imposes an almost unenforceable burden of unknown magnitude on copyright owners. There is no clear or compelling evidence that fair use will work in the networked world. This is not to say that there shouldn't be federal subsidies or investment strategies to ensure the rapid dissemination and easy use of "invention," only to say that contract is likely to be the sine qua non of the networked world. And just as the competitive base of the NII will drive out cross subsidies, contract is likely to drive out fair use.</P>
<P>
If we can't extrapolate from the print to the networked world, how should we approach the issue of copyright and fair use? I believe that we must create reasonable scenarios of what we expect the networked world to become and reason back from them. And as we have done with Internet protocols, we need to experiment and come to community consensus on what works and satisfies the needs of both copyright consumers and owners as well as the federal interest in rapid dissemination and use of the knowledge that supports a robust economy.</P>
<P>
Can the existing copyright and fair-use provisions be fine-tuned to cover intellectual property in the networked world? I doubt it. Wrong choices, no matter how well intentioned, can stifle the growth of scholarly information on the networks of the future. Wrong choices will ensure an entertainment-based rather than knowledge-based networked world and we will have missed another opportunity and encouraged the creation of another "vast wasteland."</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. I think Abraham Lincoln captured it well in another context when he observed, "The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate for the stormy present and future. As our circumstances are new, we must think anew, and act anew."  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>Use of Copyrighted Works in Multimedia: A Publisher's Perspective</H2>
<P>
<I>By Carol A. Risher</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he use of copyrighted materials in multimedia works is really no different from other uses of copyrighted materials-a marketplace develops to respond to needs. I would like to go through a few real-life experiences to demonstrate how that occurs.</P>
<P>
<B>I<SMALL>NTERNATIONAL</SMALL> C<SMALL>OPYRIGHT</SMALL> I<SMALL>NFORMATION</SMALL> C<SMALL>ENTER</SMALL></B><BR>
In 1971, when the international copyright conventions (Bern and Universal) were modified to provide compulsory licensing for publishers in developing countries to get the rights to reprint or translate works published in developed countries, there was tremendous concern that the publishers in developing countries wouldn't be able to find the copyright holders to try to negotiate licenses. So each of the countries created an "International Copyright Information Center" whose purpose was to help publishers in the developing countries find the copyright holders for the purpose of negotiating reprint and translation licenses. When I joined the Association of American Publishers (AAP) in 1977, I was named, among several titles, director of the United States office of the UNESCO-sponsored International Copyright Information Center (INCINC). We were still getting a few requests a year in 1977, but today most people in the developing countries know how to contact copyright holders and their need for INCINC assistance has declined. It's a service we still offer, particularly to the East European countries and those that have not used our services before, but there isn't the same fierce problem of finding copyright holders of copyrighted works.</P>
<P>
<B>P<SMALL>UBLIC</SMALL> B<SMALL>ROADCASTING</SMALL> E<SMALL>XPEDITING</SMALL> C<SMALL>ENTER</SMALL></B><BR>
In 1978, when the 1976 U.S. Copyright Law became effective, another title was added to my list. I became director of the Public Broadcasting Expediting Center. Section 118 of the Copyright Law deals with public broadcasting uses of copyrighted works, and no compulsory license was put in for the use of literary materials--materials in books such as poems and short stories. Instead there was an antitrust exemption in the act that allowed publishers to sit down with the public broadcasting entities and negotiate a kind of model licensing plan. One of the concerns expressed by the public broadcasting entities during the negotiation was how they would find the copyright holders and what to do if the publishers did not respond to their permission requests. What if the process took too long? And so AAP set up the Public Broadcasting Expediting Center and said that if any public broadcasting entity or anyone producing for such an entity was having problems locating a copyright holder or had sent a request to a copyright holder and it was not being handled in a timely fashion, that person could call the Center and it would expedite the matter. In the early days there were a few calls a month; these eventually dropped to a few calls a year, and last year we had no calls at all. The public broadcasting entities learned how to find copyright holders, and publishers simply responded to the needs of the marketplace. There was no longer any need for the AAP to expedite requests.</P>
<P>
<B>O<SMALL>PTICAL</SMALL> D<SMALL>ISK</SMALL> P<SMALL>ROJECT</SMALL></B><BR>
In the early 1980s the Library of Congress came forward with an idea to create an optical disk project. The Library of Congress, of course, has a lot of useful material in its stacks, and officials there thought if the information could be digitized and stored on an optical disk, it could be made available to users with terminals. The AAP offered to help the Library. We asked officials there to identify the list of materials they wanted to put in the system. These officials gave us a list of 74 publishers of potentially usable materials. We wrote letters to all of these publishers noting that since they were the copyright holders, the Library of Congress would be writing directly to them to request permissions, but AAP would like to facilitate the pilot project. We noted that there was much for all participants in the projects to learn, including whether users would want to read the information on screen or automatically print out everything. No one knew how users would react or how the system would work. Individual publishers weren't even sure whether each use (browsing, on-screen reading, downloading, printing) would involve separate accounting. The publishers and the Library of Congress developed a very effective and useful tool by dialoguing. The Library of Congress received permissions for, I think, all 74 serial publications to be digitized over a two-year period, stored on an optical disk, and used. At the same time, the Library of Congress convened two working groups: one comprising proprietors and the Library, the other comprising librarians and the Library. Sometimes the two groups met together. The theory behind these advisory groups was, let's identify what your concerns are. Let's realize what it is that's driving your decisions. Let's talk to each other, but let's also talk among ourselves. It's the spirit that has permeated everyone's remarks this morning-the importance of talking to one another.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>The publishing community is interested in working with users in doing experiments, pilot projects, and models so that together we can envision a new environment</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
<B>C<SMALL>OPYRIGHT</SMALL> C<SMALL>LEARANCE</SMALL> C<SMALL>ENTER</SMALL></B><BR>
In the private sector, the Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) has received from many publishers the right to license the photocopying of materials from publishers that are participating in the system. The CCC system is voluntary; publishers choose to participate. The publishers set the fees for copying; CCC goes to for-profit corporations and says, we are here to offer you a license; these are all of the publishers whose works are in our system, and if you take the license, this is what you can do. One after another the corporations have said they were interested in "electrocopying." They explained that they have big computers and databases and would like to scan material, store it in the database, and provide access by their researchers at their desks rather than having them go to the corporate library. CCC told the corporations that they did not have that right from the publishers but would see what they could do to talk to the publishers. They came to AAP, and we created a special task force to deal with these requests. What we found is that if you tell copyright holders that people want to scan your material and stick it in their database, they all say, "Wait a minute! What does this mean?" But when the CCC came with specifics noting a particular campus that would like to create a totally digital library to serve one of its disciplines and had identified the list of materials it would like to have in digital form, the publishers responded differently. It was a manageable list-only one of a publisher's 40 journals, only three of another publisher's many books. They were all willing to participate in a pilot project because it presented an opportunity to address concerns and interests such as system security, whether onscreen resolution would be good enough to communicate the very complex x-ray and high-level graphics in some books, and whether the electrocopying would undermine or support the total dissemination goal.</P>
<P>
Then another project was brought to the group by CCC that needed other materials. And similarly, one by one, up to 15 projects were developed. AAP members individually gave approval, through the CCC as middleman, to participate in these projects because everybody had something to gain by working with the community, by dialoguing, by addressing the very complex technological and other issues that we all faced.</P>

<BIG><BIG>There will be multiple avenues to support the needs of multimedia users and developers-the private sector will respond to the needs of the marketplace.</BIG></BIG>
<P>
<B>A<SMALL>CADEMIC</SMALL> P<SMALL>ERMISSION</SMALL> S<SMALL>ERVICE</SMALL></B><BR>
AAP is probably best known for the Kinko's litigation, in which AAP coordinated a lawsuit against the chain for its infringing photocopying. As a result of this lawsuit and the determination by the courts that making course packs is an infringement and that anyone who does so must get permission for everything, the CCC developed a new Academic Permission Service (APS) to facilitate the needs of both publishers and the marketplace. Publishers put their materials in the APS system, and CCC licenses those who make course packs. This is a relatively new service; it is another example of the marketplace responding to need. In the two years of APS's existence, the number of permission requests that CCC has been able to handle has doubled each semester. If you need to get a permission, this service is one way to do it. The other, of course, is to go directly to the copyright holder.</P>
<P>
<B>E<SMALL>LECTRONIC</SMALL> R<SMALL>ESERVE</SMALL> R<SMALL>OOMS</SMALL></B><BR>
AAP members are also talking with people in the library world who are creating "electronic reserve rooms." Scanning technology makes it possible to scan, store, and print on demand. AAP representatives are attending meetings hosted by the Association of Research Libraries and the National Association of College Stores to discuss this topic. We have talked individually with officials at various campuses about how they can create electronic reserve collections that will work for all players, recognizing copyright and supporting the educational needs.</P>
<P>
<B>X<SMALL>EROX'S</SMALL> G<SMALL>LYPH</SMALL></B><BR>
There's another new project that's just in the talking stage. I've received two phone calls from officials of the Xerox Corporation. They have developed something called the Glyph, which makes it possible to put all the necessary copyright information-who is the copyright holder, what is the fee for printing, what is the fee for scanning, whom do you contact, what is the address-in a tiny microscopic dot that can be embedded in a small line or border on a page. Thus the publisher can provide all the necessary information on the printed page. And the Glyph reader works just like the barcode scanner at a supermarket: when a page is put on a Xerox machine or any other copier that has such a reader, the copyright information can be tracked and recorded. Eventually, a billing and payment mechanism can be established. Obviously the technology is there, and Xerox would like to work with publishers on trying it out.</P>
<P>
<B>T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> R<SMALL>OLE OF THE</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKETPLACE</SMALL></B><BR>
We are living in a very exciting transition period. We're watching technologies grow. We're trying different things. We're experimenting, and publishers want to work with all of the user communities to understand their needs and their wants and to consider the things publishers can develop to meet those needs. The publishing community is interested in working with users in doing experiments, pilot projects, and models so that  together we can envision a new environment. When Barbara Ringer spoke earlier about the project at the Library of Congress to create a database of copyright holders, it reminded me of a report the AAP received in February from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which has designed and was asking for worldwide comment on a global database of copyrighted works. It envisions a voluntary system. Everybody who holds copyright in animation, video, graphics, music, or text can voluntarily register with this Japanese database and set their own fees. And there are incentives to encourage registration. But the impetus behind the project is that the Japanese government wants everyone to have a central place to go to find out who holds copyrights. This morning you heard that the U.S. government is looking at this kind of project too, and what I've said to you today is that there are also projects in the private sector. There will be multiple avenues to support the needs of multimedia users and developers-the private sector will respond to the needs of the marketplace. <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<HR>
<H2>Position Statement of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology</H2>
<P>
<I>By Hope Roland Botterbusch</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) is a leading international, professional association dedicated to the improvement of instruction through the utilization of media and technology. The Association provides a forum for the exchange of information among such professionals as audiovisual media specialists, library and information specialists, microcomputer specialists, educational administrators, researchers, teachers and professors, television producers and directors, and instructional technologists.</P>
<P>
The mission of AECT is to provide leadership in educational communications and technology by linking professionals holding a common interest in the use of educational technology and its application to the learning process.</P>
<P>
The charge of AECT's Copyright Committee is to keep members informed of current copyright issues, develop and review positions on copyright, develop and review copyright materials published by AECT, and monitor changes to the Copyright Law of 1976 and related legislation. This charge has been delegated to a committee comprised of K12, college, and university educators and scholars, all of whom hold some expertise in the area of copyright. All but one of these committee members offer informed opinions but do not dispense legal advice. The one committee member who is able to dispense legal advice regarding copyright is a renowned copyright attorney who is an integral part of these proceedings today.</P>
<P>
The Copyright Committee's newest and most exciting charge, and the reason I am here today, is to communicate AECT's position on educational fair access for the use of copyrighted works in multimedia programs produced by faculty and students for educational purposes.</P>
<P>
<B>P<SMALL>OSITION</SMALL> S<SMALL>TATEMENT ON</SMALL> F<SMALL>AIR</SMALL> A<SMALL>CCESS OF</SMALL> C<SMALL>OPYRIGHTED</SMALL> W<SMALL>ORKS IN</SMALL> M<SMALL>ULTIMEDIA</SMALL> P<SMALL>ROGRAMS</SMALL></B><BR>
First, AECT vigorously promotes the adherence to the Copyright Law of the United States of America contained in Title 17 of the United States Code and, in particular, to Section 107 Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use.</P>
<P>
Second, AECT has promulgated and subscribes to a code of ethics that is intended to aid its members individually and collectively in maintaining a high level of professional conduct. AECT's Code of Ethics includes a statement on copyright that reads:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>In fulfilling obligations to the profession, members shall inform users of the stipulations and interpretations of the copyright law and other laws affecting the profession and encourage compliance.</I></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>
Third, AECT recognizes that the standards of the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and Administration of Justice Negotiating Committee-specifically, the "Fair-Use Guidelines for Off-Air Videotaping"-reflect the negotiating committee's consensus as to the application of fair use and carry the weight of law.</P>
<P>
In light of the three points above, AECT recommends adoption of a set of proposed criteria regarding fair access for the use of copyrighted works in multimedia programs produced by faculty and students for educational purposes.</P>

<BIG><BIG>Because of the unique nature of multimedia development, AECT recommends a review of the appropriateness of the '10/10 guidelines'.</BIG></BIG>
<P>
<B>R<SMALL>ECOMMENDED</SMALL> G<SMALL>UIDELINES</SMALL></B><BR>
The following criteria should be included in "The Fair-Use Guidelines for Multimedia Programs." The guidelines should
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>encompass grades pre-school, K-12, vocational, college and university education;
<LI>be for the purpose of scholarship, research, criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, or learning;
<LI>include student use to demonstrate competencies;
<LI>include faculty use for scholarly research and instruction;
<LI>provide for the use of out-of-print materials;
<LI>provide for the use of copyrighted materials when the copyright owner cannot be located from which to obtain permission;
<LI>define "fair use" in terms of the portion used in relation to the whole work; and,
most important
<LI> define <I>multimedia</I>.
</OL></P>
<P>
<B>T<SMALL>OPICS</SMALL> N<SMALL>EEDING</SMALL> D<SMALL>ISCUSSION</SMALL></B><BR>
First, a discussion of what constitutes multimedia is needed. The AECT Copyright Committee has developed a working definition of <I>multimedia</I> as material taken from various audio, visual, and textual mediums that is combined by means of an electronic device.</P>
<P>
Second, to define fair use, a discussion of what is commonly known as the "10/10 guideline" is in order. Reference to such a guideline may be found in the records of discussions of the Congressional Committees prior to the adoption of the Copyright Law of 1976. The "10/10 guideline" may be summarized to state that
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>ten percent of a work may be copied for educational purposes as long as that ten percent constitutes ten percent or less of the educator's or student's original finished work and that the ten percent copied is not the essence of the work.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
Because of the unique nature of multimedia development, AECT recommends a review of the appropriateness of the "10/10 guidelines."</P>
<P>
Third, a discussion is in order for extending the meaning of the term <I>instructional setting</I> to the library media center because face-to-face instruction takes place there.</P>
<P>
Finally, AECT believes the fair-use guidelines currently in place should be used as a basis for developing fair-use guidelines for multimedia. Those guidelines that apply are found in the Copyright Law of the United States of America, Title 17 of the United States Code Section 107, "Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use," and Section 110, "Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Exemptions of Certain Performances and Displays."</P>
<P>
<B>C<SMALL>ONCLUSION</SMALL></B><BR>
AECT has members who individually hold copyrights to their creative works. In addition, AECT has members who desire, in an educational setting, to utilize copyrighted works for valid instructional and educational purposes. Thus we strive to maintain a balanced perspective as to the extent and limitations of fair use. We sincerely feel that there is a need to provide fair-use access to copyrighted materials to be used in multimedia programs in an educational setting, while protecting the intellectual property rights of the authors.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>AECT believes the fair-use guidelines currently in place should be used as a basis for developing fair-use guidelines for multimedia.</BIG></BIG></P>

<H2>Multimedia Development and Copyright Issues in the Maricopa Community Colleges</H2>
<P>
<I>By Mary Lou Mosley</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD) in Phoenix, Arizona, consists of ten community colleges and centers and serves approximately 90,000 students. MCCCD has been a leader among community colleges in the integration of technology into instruction, including providing many computer labs for students, giving every faculty member an office computer and software, supporting faculty development of instructional materials that supplement classroom instruction, and exploring new technologies and new types of classrooms. MCCCD is also an active member of the League for Innovation in the Community Colleges, and several of our colleges have active partnerships with computer companies. Glendale Community College is an IBM demonstration center for multimedia instructional development and Paradise Valley Community College focuses on multimedia instructional development for Apple as a member of the Apple Community College Alliance.</P>
<P>
Community college students represent a variety of needs, experiences, and learning styles. They range in age from 17 to 80-plus, with many of them falling into the category of adults returning to education. They attend school for a variety of reasons, including the intent to transfer to a four-year institution, to update or improve job-related skills, to obtain retraining, to develop skills in order to get a job, and to enhance personal growth and interests. Many of them bring work and life experiences with them that need to be taken into account when teaching. Finally, many community college students learn in different ways, with different learning styles, than the student who graduates from high school and goes directly to college. Our instructional materials must address the needs and motivations of the adult learners who do better if they can control the pace of their learning, interact, respond, and get information in ways that are alternatives to the traditional lecture. For these reasons, multimedia and computer-based instructional materials are very successful with the community college student.</P>
<P>
<B>D<SMALL>EVELOPMENT OF</SMALL> M<SMALL>ULTIMEDIA</SMALL> I<SMALL>NSTRUCTION</SMALL></B><BR>
MCCCD faculty members have been very active in developing alternative methods of instruction that rely on various technologies, such as computers, video, distance learning, audio and video conferencing, and multimedia. The computer-based materials have been developed on Macintosh, NeXt, DOS, and VAX platforms. These materials are designed for multiple uses, including classroom presentation, review and reinforcement of instruction, exploration beyond the classroom, and independent learning. In addition to classrooms, students use these materials in computer labs and content-specific labs such as biology, chemistry, math, and English; in learning centers; and in libraries and the Information Commons. In some cases, students take the materials home. Although the faculty members often develop the materials to use with their own students only, colleagues soon ask if they also can use the materials with their classes.</P>
<P>
The faculty-developed instructional multimedia materials range from simple one-concept or one-skill stacks to complex modules that include detailed color illustrations, still photographs, video, music, and interaction with other resources or media. Many multimedia modules are being created that access videodiscs or CD-ROMs and incorporate QuickTime clips. Music or sound is another key aspect of the modules. The modules are created in a variety of authoring programs and languages including HyperCard, SuperCard, ToolBook, Director, Authorware, Course Builder, and many others. Students also are developing multimedia materials for class projects, and faculty are using commercial multimedia instructional programs, such as the ABC News Interactive series, <I>BioSci II</I>, or Mozart's <I>Magic Flute</I>.</P>
<P>
Several of the colleges are producing their own videodiscs and CDs based on video they have shot themselves because of the lack of clear guidelines and the complexity of the process for getting permission for using commercial clips. Faculty members also are relying on royalty-free music clips or on colleagues to compose and play music for their instructional modules. Others are drawing their own pictures and graphics, pixel by pixel, since finding the copyright owner is so difficult. Yet the question still arises whether they are actually copying or making a derivative work when they create their illustrations and pictures for their programs.</P>
<P>
<B>C<SMALL>OPYRIGHT</SMALL> I<SMALL>SSUES AND</SMALL> C<SMALL>ONCERNS</SMALL></B><BR>
As faculty members have developed multimedia materials, they have raised issues and concerns about copyright, in terms of both what they want to incorporate in their materials and the protection they have after developing them. Many of their concerns about using parts of others' copyrighted work are the same as those being addressed at this conference. A number of other situations and questions about faculty developers' rights and responsibilities have arisen as they become more involved in developing multimedia instructional modules. Some examples include
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>creating a QuickTime clip from a small segment of a videodisc
<LI>scanning in a photograph of the "Mona Lisa" to use in a HyperCard stack
<LI>using popular music as introductory background by accessing the CD
<LI>typing the dialog from a videodisc so that students can read while the videodisc is playing
<LI>drawing graphics and pictures in a paint program that are based on a textbook illustration but are common knowledge
<LI>changing a scanned/digitized copyrighted image to meet their own needs
<LI>digitizing a speech recorded off TV to include in a module
<LI>adapting others' multimedia programs to fit their own situation
<LI>demonstrating a multimedia module at workshops and conferences and sharing it with colleagues at the home college or at other colleges
<LI> deciding where to give credit for using another person's work, as in a clip in a videodisc or CD that they are developing.
</UL></P>
<P>
Our faculty members are willing to ask for permission to use others' work and to pay royalties, but they have had great difficulties accomplishing that. For example, an anthropology instructor has developed multimedia materials that would be enhanced if he could use several illustrations from a book. When he contacted the publisher, he was told that no one really knew who owned the copyright to the illustrations, so no one could help him. In another case, a faculty member wanted to use some music clips and contacted ASCAP, which gave him incorrect and misleading information. A member of the psychology department wanted to use some video clips from a series that the college owned and was given verbal permission to do so. When she put her request for permission in writing, however, she was told that written permission would not be granted.</P>
<P>
Faculty members want clear guidelines and answers to questions so they can develop instructional materials to use with their students and still adhere to the Copyright Law. Essentially, our faculty is asking for the following actions:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Development of guidelines for using parts of others' work, whether print, audio, video, still images, graphics, or scripts, in instructional multimedia materials that they are developing to use with their students. The guidelines should also address-or a process should be established-that will enable faculty members to share these materials with colleagues who want to use them with their students.
<LI>Expansion of the definition of face-to-face teaching to include labs, networks, libraries, learning centers, and so forth, because much of the teaching and learning in community colleges, especially with multimedia materials, occurs outside traditional classrooms. The key factor should be that the materials are in support of instruction, not where or how they are used.
<LI>Establishment of a clearinghouse for getting permission and paying royalties to use parts of others' work in their own multimedia instructional materials.
</OL></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Multimedia development and such new technologies as scanners and digitizers are not covered in any of the copyright materials, the guidelines, or the law.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
Our faculty members are very frustrated because they do not have a clear or easy way to get permission or pay royalties to use nonprint materials. They are driven by their desire to help students learn, and developing multimedia instructional materials is one very important and successful method at the community college level for improving the teaching and learning process. Thus our teachers feel that they have only two viable options: violating the letter of the law or not using the materials. In both cases, the creator of the original material is injured. Establishing guidelines for fair use, a process for getting permission, and a clearinghouse will help the creator, the teacher developing materials, and, most important, the students.</P>
<P>
Much confusion and uncertainty about what faculty can and cannot do will be eliminated by establishing guidelines. We have heard conflicting opinions from attorneys who specialize in copyright and educational institutions. For example, during a recent teleconference, three attorneys said that the Kastenmeier guidelines for off-air taping were more restrictive than the actual Copyright Law and did not need to be followed by faculty members. Publishers and producers tell us unofficially that we can use parts of their materials in our multimedia modules because we are an educational institution, but they will not give us written permission.</P>
<P>
Faculty members are willing to follow guidelines and get permission to use others' work if a process is established. Getting permission to use parts of print materials through a clearinghouse, through our campus bookstore, and through specialized publishers has greatly changed the way our teachers view copyright. No longer do they see it as an impediment to their teaching. Our teaching professionals are looking for a similar process or clearinghouse that will enable them to develop multimedia materials in accordance with the Copyright Law.</P>
<P>
<B>MCCCD I<SMALL>NTELLECTUAL</SMALL> R<SMALL>IGHTS</SMALL> C<SMALL>OMMITTEE</SMALL></B><BR>
Three years ago, MCCCD established a committee to look at intellectual rights, in terms of both how we are using and developing instructional materials and how our faculty developers can protect their own materials. The committee consisted of our legal counsel, an instructional administrator, and faculty developers. The MCCCD Governing Board had passed a policy requiring employees to adhere to the Copyright Law. However, no guidelines or training had been developed to help employees understand their rights and responsibilities under the law.</P>
<P>
The Intellectual Rights Committee reviewed a number of materials on copyright, both print and video, to find information we could give faculty and staff. We were concerned because the materials were negative in approach and tone, emphasizing what could not be done. We wanted to be positive so that faculty would be willing to comply with the Copyright Law. We also were frustrated because the materials dealt with print and video, but had little or no information or guidelines for the newer technologies, such as multimedia and distance learning.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Establishing guidelines for fair use, a process for getting permission, and a clearinghouse will help the creator, the teacher developing materials, and, most important, the students.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
As a result of our decision to take the positive approach about the rights faculty had under the Copyright Law, we had to develop our own videotape. The emphasis was on what could be done legally under the law and how to get permission to use copyrighted work. The videotape covers print, off-air broadcasts, and computer software. The narrator is a member of the faculty talking to other members about successes in legally using copyrighted materials. Every college in the district has a copy of the videotape and supporting materials. We also put guidelines, information about getting permission, and MCCCD copyright policies on a computer file server that could be accessed by anyone in MCCCD.</P>
<P>
At the same time that we were creating the videotape, significant changes were taking place in the area of print materials. Our college bookstore company, Follett, was offering to put together anthologies of articles for faculty, including the service of getting permission from copyright owners. The bookstore then would sell the anthologies to students. Several book publishers were willing to offer a similar service to faculty. No longer do faculty members have to make their own copies of articles, essays, short stories, and so forth-often without permission. Getting permission also is becoming easier for print materials. Many publishers have departments and procedures set up to handle requests and are more willing to grant permission. A similar change in ease of getting permission or paying royalties has occurred with using videos in the library and on videoconferencing networks.</P>
<P>
Multimedia development and such new technologies as scanners and digitizers, however, are not covered in any of the copyright materials, the guidelines, or the law. We surveyed members of our faculty about their concerns as developers, and we consistently heard pleas for guidelines, a procedure for requesting permission and paying royalties that would be successful, and a clearinghouse for handling requests, much like what is available for print materials. The Intellectual Rights Committee invited Ivan Bender to work with us and our faculty for two days this spring to provide more information about copyright and multimedia development as well as to identify gray areas. We also wanted to demonstrate what we are doing at the community college level and how our teaching methods, facilities, and student needs may differ from those at a four-year university. Bringing the community college experiences and concerns to this task force should strengthen the results.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<H2>New Media Centers Program:<BR>
Forum for Research and Development of Multimedia Technologies in Education</H2>
<P>
<I>By Kevin J. Howat</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>H</BIG></BIG>eadquartered in San Francisco, New Media Centers (NMC) is a not-for-profit organization that helps create model learning centers in institutions of higher education worldwide. The program helps educators better understand, utilize, and integrate digital technology into their classrooms and surrounding communities.</P>
<P>
New media offer educators innumerable opportunities for exploration and innovation; they also pose many challenges. New Media Centers helps educators meet those challenges by acting as a clearinghouse for faculty and students to exchange ideas and know-how with industry experts on topics ranging from optimal system configurations to curriculum development. The program also coordinates collaborative projects between centers and a broad range of interested parties, including technology industry leaders, publishers, creative professionals, multimedia developers, legal experts, legislators, government regulators, and nongovernmental organizations. Through outreach programs, centers provide training and workshops on new media for such community members as K-12 teachers and local business executives. To ensure that each center is equipped with state-of-the-art tools and equipment, the program's technology members offer the centers advantageous pricing on complete hardware and software configurations for professional-quality new-media development. The goal of the program is to create 100 New Media Centers worldwide by 1996.</P>
<P>
New Media Centers' broad-based constituency forms the foremost body of expertise on ground-breaking technical, developmental, social, and ethical issues surrounding new media today. As the world continues its transition from a manufacturing-based to an information-based economy, the program will play an increasingly critical role in developing innovative ways that digital technology can create new educational and economic opportunities.</P>
<P>
<B>B<SMALL>ACKGROUND</SMALL></B><BR>
In early 1993, a group of technology companies formed a consortium to explore new ways of fostering use of interactive media in education. The goal was to find approaches that could prosper even in times of economic uncertainty, maintain currency in the face of rapid technological change, and extend the benefits of interactive media to a far broader audience.</P>
<P>
The result was the formation of the New Media Centers program. Based on a long-term partnership among a group of key industry players and a diverse group of colleges and universities, this program is dedicated to providing access to state-of-the-art new media technologies not only to faculty, staff, and students at the host institutions but also to the business, creative, and educational communities they serve. The founding companies include Adobe Systems Incorporated, Apple Computer, Inc., FWB Inc., Macromedia, Prentice-Hall, Sony, and SuperMac Technology, Inc. Since inception, Kodak and Clement Mok Designs have joined the program as corporate sponsors.</P>
<P>
A request for proposals for the program was announced at the 1993 EDUCOM conference in Cincinnati. Executives from the sponsoring companies addressed an audience of over 200 representatives from the press and academic communities. They were joined by Senator J. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, sponsor of the Electronic Libraries Act of 1993, the goals of which are synergistic with those of the New Media Centers program.</P>
<P>
Clearly the program tapped into a strong vein of interest on campuses across the continent. The New Media Centers office received over 700 requests for the request for proposals package. Over 140 institutions submitted detailed proposals that included major financial and other resource commitments for the 15 sites planned for the first year of the program. Based on this overwhelming response, the consortium's board expanded the number of sites to be created in the first year of the program to 22.</P>
<P>
The schools selected to host the initial set of New Media Centers include Stanford University, California Polytechnic at Pomona, California State University at Long Beach, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Lewis-Clark State College, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Nebraska, Princeton University, University of New Mexico, Cornell University, Hostos Community College of the City University of New York system, New York University, Elizabeth City State University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Houston Community College, Bennington College, Virginia Tech, University of Wisconsin, and University of Calgary.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Students can gain new insights into their academic studies from new-media course materials. Through hands-on experience with professional tools, they can master skills that can be hard to acquire in traditional academic settings but that can be vital in the job market.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
<B>Partnership Between Industry and Academe</B><BR>
The program is unique, requiring mutual commitments from both corporate and academic partners. The requirements for the corporate partners include
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>guaranteeing extended, preferential pricing for an entire complementary range of media-related hardware and software, as well as for upgrades;
<LI>establishing a close working relationship between industry and academic partners, including a two-way exchange of support, information, and resources;
<LI>providing New Media Center sites access to the consortium's industry contacts, technology developments, and emerging new media solutions;
<LI>involving the New Media Centers in the advance testing and use of prototype new media products;
<LI>steering debate over practical ways to deal with intellectual property issues, distribution, and royalties in the context of new media;
<LI>sharing expertise in the process of turning prototypes developed at New Media Centers into viable products for the academic or commercial marketplace;
<LI>financing the introduction of the program; and
<LI>communicating New Media Centers achievements to other academic institutions, to the technology and publishing communities, and to the business world.
</UL>
For participating educational institutions, the requirements of the program include
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>allocation of financial resources, a facility, and staffing to create, equip, and maintain the center;
<LI>a commitment to train faculty and students, introduce interactive media into a range of academic disciplines, and develop media-based curriculum materials;
<LI>opening New Media Centers to community access, via workshops and seminars on using interactive media for alumni, business professionals, K-12 teachers, parents, and others; and
<LI>showcasing new-media technologies developed by the corporate partners in the New Media Centers program.
</UL></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Intrigued by the educational benefits and economic potential of multimedia, many leading publishing houses have begun to extend the reach of their product lines by adding new-media enhancement to their textbooks.</BIG></BIG></P>
<P>
<B>D<SMALL>IFFERENCES</SMALL> B<SMALL>ETWEEN</SMALL> NMC <SMALL>AND</SMALL> E<SMALL>XISTING</SMALL> I<SMALL>NITIATIVES</SMALL></B><BR>
Compared with the ad hoc undertakings that typify many of the first-generation multimedia ventures on campuses, the New Media Centers program represents an effective model for deploying new-media technologies in education. The New Media Centers initiative differs on several counts.
<OL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><I>Practical and stable economic model.</I> Because they don't rely on donations, seed programs, or one-time grants, the New Media Centers are less subject to the vagaries of corporate largesse. Participating universities have financial responsibility for their New Media Centers. But in exchange, each center has a unique guarantee: deep, long-term preferential pricing from a group of companies that together offer complete solutions for interactive media technologies.</P>
<P>
There are several benefits to this strategy for participating educational institutions. First, it provides the best possible pricing on the products that are essential for professional quality work in multimedia. Second, it greatly simplifies purchasing negotiations. Third, because the preferential pricing guarantee extends over time, universities can more readily afford to upgrade their media technology and keep their New Media Centers on the leading edge. As a result, universities can build a more complete base for interactive media computing (in contrast to the piecemeal assemblages of equipment and endless purchase-price negotiations) more economically and more conveniently than before.</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the New Media Centers program hold promise as revenue producers for participating universities. Workshops and seminars for nonuniversity audiences could generate a return on the initial investment. And new-media-based curriculum materials, created by faculty and students and disseminated to other campuses or in the commercial marketplace, could produce a stream of royalties.</P>

<LI><P><I>Powerful?  model for integrating interactive media into academia.</I> While there are pockets of achievement, interactive media have not made sweeping inroads on most campuses. Few schools offer degree programs in multimedia applications, interactive telecommunications, and the like. Only a handful of academic disciplines use interactive media in teaching. Many faculty, staff members, and students are not aware of what they can do with interactive media. Many find that the facilities for using them are still relatively inaccessible or incomplete.</P>
<P>
The underlying economics of the program plays an important role in making new media available to academic endeavor. The financial commitment by universities and the preferential pricing by vendors make inviting, well-equipped facilities practical for the first time.</P>
<P>
The New Media Centers are inclusive in scope, another departure from many existing multimedia projects. By charter, they serve the varied interests of the whole academic community, not just a few departments. Conceivably, professors and students of forensic anthropology, journalism, linguistics, business management, constitutional law, and other disciplines can all use the centers to learn new-media technologies and use them to enhance the curriculum for their own academic fields.</P>
<P>
Each participating campus is free to interpret the overall training and support goals of the program in its own way. Some might focus on basic skills for working with interactive media: searching multimedia databases, combining different data types, and annotating them to compose something new-a new kind of term paper or scholarly article, dynamic course materials, and the like. On a more conceptual level, some might explore issues in repurposing content from one medium to another, in terms of legal constraints or instructional design. Others might teach particular software packages or specific techniques for interactive presentations, graphic design, desktop publishing, or desktop video production.</P>
<P>
For faculty, the New Media Centers program provides abundant resources for acquiring the skills of interactive media plus the collaborative assistance needed to integrate new media into their teaching. Students also benefit in several ways. They can gain new insights into their academic studies from new-media course materials. Through hands-on experience with professional tools, they can master skills beyond those associated with specific disciplines, skills that can be hard to acquire in traditional academic settings but that can be vital in the job market.</P>

<LI><P><I>Effective model for extending the benefits of new media beyond the campus.</I> The centers are an ideal resource not only for matriculated students, faculty, and staff but also for nonacademic "students"-from artists and business professionals to alumni and publishers. According to <I>Digital Media</I> (September 20, 1993), "The growing need for focused education in multimedia technologies transcends the university setting; professionals in the industry [need] a chance to brush up in a specific technology area or forge new relationships with others who share their interests." By leveraging their investment in new-media technology and the relationships they forge with industry partners in the NMC consortium, the New Media Centers are well positioned to serve the needs of this broad community.</P>
<P>
Extension programs could offer workshops for business executives who want a basic introduction to the techniques of interactive multimedia for presentations or corporate training programs. They could also offer seminars on the impact of new media in publishing, telecommunications, or entertainment and hands-on classes on various multimedia tools. These activities not only could communicate the value of new media to a broader audience but also could generate an income that would help the New Media Centers be self-sustaining.</P>
<P>
The New Media Centers can also serve to link participating universities and their media-based endeavors with the large, active community of developers who have been attracted to interactive media. This connection could prove useful to both universities and developers. For instance, developers may be helpful in suggesting creative ways of resolving technical challenges that the New Media Centers may encounter and offer their talents as teaching resources. In addition, the centers could host developers through artist-in-residence programs and provide venues for beta testing their prerelease software and hardware, which would provide the technology partners with a larger pool of solid, quality-assurance resources.</P>

<LI><P><I>"Laboratory" for new approaches to creating and disseminating media-based publications.</I> As print becomes just one of many media used to teach and learn, the textbook publishing industry is in the throes of change. Intrigued by the educational benefits and economic potential of multimedia, many leading publishing houses have begun to extend the reach of their product lines by adding new-media enhancement to their textbooks. Some have begun to distribute traditional textbooks electronically to campus bookstores for on-demand printing. Others offer custom publishing services to professors, creating tailor-made anthologies consisting of excerpts and graphical material selected from the texts they publish. Still others provide software tools with their texts so educators can create study aids and presentation materials that dovetail with assigned textbooks.</P>
<P>
The New Media Centers offer a proving ground for even more fundamental changes. Program members-be they scholars, authors, editors, publishers, librarians, distributors at campus bookstores or copy shops, software developers, or hardware vendors- have a congenial forum to develop and refine approaches to multimedia production, publication, and distribution. Consortium members hope a broad range of publishers will look to New Media Centers as laboratories where, together with educators, they can work to forge guidelines on such crucial matters as
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>repurposing existing content for deployment in different media;
<LI>pricing and distribution of new-media productions through new channels and developing new methods of tracking these transactions;
<LI>extending copyright protection to electronically distributed multimedia; and
<LI>marketing university-created new-media products.
</UL></P>
<P>
As <I>Digital Media</I> observed, "It is only in understanding all the dimensions of distribution, production, and funding across all the industries touched by multimedia that we will move successfully into the new world. . .this technology will create."  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<HR>
<H2>Committee on the Quantity and Sources of Excerpted Materials</H2>
<P>
<I>Report by Jan Sichel</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he committee comprised sixteen participants. Five represented trade interests: the Association of American Publishers, the Picture Agency Council of America, a music company, the Goals of America and Artists' Rights Foundation, and the Global Village Schools Initiative. Five represented professional associations: the National Association of Secondary Schools, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and the Association of Educational Communication and Technology (AECT). Six were media directors and specialists representing various universities. The group lacked representatives of software publishers, the telecommunications industry, and students.</P>
<P>
The committee first discussed abuses of copyrighted materials, particularly by students who seem to have the idea that anything in the commercial world is accessible to them to take and use as they choose. Clearer and more definitive guidelines might help librarians, media specialists, teachers, and administrators provide a better model of correct use. The members emphasized the ethical importance of having faculty members model respect for law, regulation, and fair use.</P>
<P>
Participants pointed out that the international community is guilty of greater abuses against American copyright than are academics. Ignorance of fair-use criteria is probably a greater cause of abuse than real intent to flout regulations. In some cases, observance of fair use of copyrighted materials may conflict with freedom of speech.</P>
<P>
The committee spent considerable time trying to define the term <I>multimedia</I>, finally arriving at the following working definition:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Multimedia is a work that combines audio, text, and/or visual materials by means of a computer or similar device.</I></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>
Members of the committee from the academic community differed with those from industry and professional organizations. Some agreed with AECT's recommendation to apply the current print guidelines' ten percent rule with the additional limitation that the resulting work may contain no more than ten percent of such excerpted audio and visual material. Others argued for a fifty percent rule in which fifty percent of a work could be made up of a combination of excerpts, as long as each excerpt was no more than ten percent of an original work.</P>
<P>
Trade associations, particularly the Picture Agency Council of America, suggested the possibility of site licenses for still photographs in which universities could take responsibility for a licensing process.</P>
<P>
A representative of the Association of American Publishers said the group might be willing to pursue pilot projects in developing materials.</P>
<P>
Although the committee concluded in some frustration at being unable to reach any closure in the short time available, members felt that if they continued to work together, eventually it would be possible to write fair-use guidelines that would be acceptable to everyone.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<HR>
<H2>Committee on the Presentation, Utilization, and Duplication of Copyrighted Materials</H2>
<P>
<I>Report by Lisa Livingston</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he committee comprised several people from the educational community, media managers, instructional technology people, and computer people. Proprietary interests were also present. The committee decided that digitalization was the key to <I>multimedia</I>, defining the term as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Multimedia is a medium or any combination of media that is or are driven, accessed, or manipulated by a computer.</I></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>
Members argued that while electronic technology is central to multimedia today, future means of communication are likely to be portable, and multimedia may move into nonelectronic technologies.</P>
<P>
The committee discussed the issue of fair-use environments for the presentation of copyrighted multimedia materials. The members reviewed common learning environments that extend the concept of "face-to-face instruction." Self-paced learning programs, networks involving one or more academic institutions, and learning at home all create difficulties for fair-use regulation and possible threats to the profits of the proprietors.</P>
<P>
Spontaneity is important in the student's navigation through a multimedia program, whether it's on a network or whether it is an individual unit. Spontaneity is also important for the student developing a digital term paper, for example, or doing a digital assignment at home.</P>
<P>
The committee concurred that the definition of the term <I>learning environment</I> needed to be expanded.</P>
<P>
In considering issues of utilization, the committee members again discussed self education and home uses of materials. One issue is the distinction between education and entertainment. In a film class, for example, a teacher or student might have reasons to put together a multimedia presentation with clips of many films in them, but films are highly protected and producers demand that their profits be protected. The committee felt that there may be a significant difference between students developing a multimedia production that includes film clips and teachers doing the same thing. All agreed that if a faculty member developed some sort of media production and then tried to sell it, use rights had to be arranged. Many participants thought, however, that faculty members who spent a lot of time developing multimedia presentations for their own classes should be able to use film clips and that they should be able to incorporate some of these clips in their own term "papers" as well. It was suggested that it might be possible for limited-use rights to be acquired by an educational institution that would extend to such teacher and student uses.</P>
<P>
Duplication is an issue closely related to utilization. Committee members debated the effects of having one media presentation used again and again for some kind of campus multimedia teaching program. Vendors were concerned about loss of profits, if duplication of such frequently used programs were permitted. It was suggested that some academic uses required multiple copies of materials. Vendors might find it profitable to make an arrangement with academic institutions to provide for these uses.</P>
<P>
The committee concluded its deliberations by discussing the rapidly changing marketplace and by emphasizing the importance of vendors and users working together to find a way of meeting their respective needs.</P>
<P>
Further discussion dealt with the difficulty of obtaining copyright release, or of even tracking down the copyright holder. The concept of <I>intellectual value</I> as something separate from monetary value came up. There was debate about the need for a clearinghouse as a way to provide convenient access to copyrighted material but also to get players to work together.</P>
<P>
One committee member suggested that there be something created called an <I>educational domain</I>, which is somewhere in between public domain and public performance. Another member suggested the need for a "school/home site license" for institutions where students may need to take mulltimedia materials home for study.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<HR>
<H2>Committee on the Retention, Access, and Storage of Multimedia Materials</H2>
<P>
<I>Report by Carol A. Race</I></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he committee comprised nine people, including three producers, two media directors, a few academics, and a representative of computer services. The committee adopted the definition of the term multimedia of the New Media Centers, which reads as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Multimedia is a strategy for fostering interactive media through fusion of technologies and solutions for uniting text, illustrations, photographs, sound, voice, animations, and video in a dynamic new form.</I></BLOCKQUOTE></P>
<P>
Members felt that interactivity was the key characteristic of multimedia.</P>
<P>
Members first discussed the issue of retention. They agreed that short-term retention is covered by fair-use guidelines and that even long-term retention is usually permitted as long as it causes no economic loss to the copyright holder.</P>
<P>
Participants pointed out the need to attach credits citing the copyright holder to all multimedia materials in such a way that they would be embedded in any fragments or parts of a work that were included in another work. It was suggested that evolving technologies may soon solve this problem.</P>
<P>
As far as access is concerned, committee members agreed that the current fair-use guidelines cover most instances where access is desirable, as long as such access does not cause economic harm to the copyright holder. There was a need for an exemption to cover presentation of a product developed by a member of the faculty at conferences of education professionals.</P>
<P>
Committee members representing higher education argued against an arbitrary numerical quantification of amounts of material excerpted from copyrighted materials or forming part of a teacher- or student-created work. Representatives from the K-12 teaching environment, however, argued that guidelines such as the "10/10 percent" upheld by the AECT were necessary.</P>
<P>
Rosemary Talab, from AECT, called attention to a 1992 publication of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) called <I>Finding a Balance: Computer Software, Intellectual Property, and the Challenge of Technological Change.</I> (She was a reviewer and had contributed to a section that dealt with mixed media.) She called for a new OTA report on the issues discussed at the present conference and said there is particularly a need for investigation and report on digitized media.</P>
<P>
Conference chairperson, Ivan Bender, announced that the sponsors of the conference intend to present the recommendations of the conference participants to such primary government agencies as the Patent and Trademark Office and the Copyright Office.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

J<SMALL>UNE</SMALL> 17, 1994<BR>
I<SMALL>VAN</SMALL> R. B<SMALL>ENDER</SMALL>, C<SMALL>HAIRPERSON</SMALL></P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>C</BIG></BIG>hairperson Bender began the discussion by commending conference participants on the presentations and committee work done the previous day. He thanked the committee chairpersons for their reports and recognized the first speaker.</P>
<P>
<B>C<SMALL>HILDREN'S</SMALL> U<SMALL>SE OF</SMALL> S<SMALL>OFTWARE AND</SMALL> M<SMALL>ULTIMEDIA AT</SMALL> H<SMALL>OME</SMALL></B><BR>
Ken Komoski, representing the Educational Products Information Exchange and the Learning and Information Network for Community Telecomputing (LINCT), reinforced the need for having the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) look into the issues discussed at the conference. He urged participants to talk to their members of Congress and to request a new report on the important issues raised at this conference and also suggested talking to Kathleen Fulton, who is the senior analyst at OTA.</P>
<P>
As a representative of LINCT, Komoski explained that there needs to be a realization that media will not just be going to the homes of individual students on the school bus, but also on "the computer bus. . .going home on a community telecomputing network." There will soon be a need not just for a school-based site license, which participants have discussed, but for a "community-based site license with particular attention being paid to this as a way of getting to the growing numbers of electric access have-nots." He pointed out that many parents spend "$350 to $1,250 a year on software that their kids use for ten or more hours each week at home, but that poor kids and struggling middle-class kids get only an hour or two a week of computer use in schools."</P>
<P>
Chairperson Bender asked whether fair-use guidelines would extend to the child who took a multimedia program home for his own use and then put it on the Internet where any subscribers could access it. Komoski responded that no one could answer that question, but it needed to be addressed, as the "floodgates" of potentially "42 million K-12 youngsters" with access to networks were on the verge of being opened. Bender commented that the prospect of such numbers is a quantum leap beyond the previously discussed ideas of broadening the face-to-face teaching restrictions on fair use.</P>
<P>
Komoski agreed, clarifying his remarks by adding that he was thinking particularly of computer software with high instructional value. In lower-income families, children have access to such products for limited and scheduled hours at school. The children of higher income families, who have bought such programs, have virtually unlimited opportunities to explore the software and learn from it. He reiterated his concern that society was increasingly divided between technological haves and have-nots, and there needed to be a concerted attempt to deal with the problem.</P>
<P>
<B>A<SMALL>CADEMIC</SMALL> D<SMALL>OMAIN</SMALL></B><BR>
Gregg Mathis of Carnegie Mellon University raised the issue of defining academic domain. He takes academic domain to be between fair-use situations and the public domain. He argued that products have an economic life span, during which creators are entitled to full economic benefits and fair-use restrictions should apply. After such a period, however, the concept of academic domain might come into play. In this period, the product might be made available for free use by the academic community.</P>
<P>
Carol Risher, of the Association of American Publishers, responded that the marketplace already has such a sequence in place. She gave examples of earlier versions of several software programs that were sold for nominal prices to homes and schools when new, revised editions were released. She also pointed out that a similar "after-market" exists for computer hardware, as offices update their equipment and donate or sell the old hardware to schools. She protested, "Schools are seen in fact as the next market after the prime commercial area, and I don't think you have to impose on copyright proprietors and vendors and creators something that they are now doing anyway." She said she was "not wild about an educational domain."</P>
<P>
<B>N<SMALL>EED FOR</SMALL> F<SMALL>AIR</SMALL>-U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> G<SMALL>UIDELINES</SMALL></B><BR>
James Schmidt, university librarian at San Jose State University, argued that seeking new guidelines may not be necessary or advisable. Because guidelines do not have the force of law, they are subject to litigation whenever some party or interest feels that its needs are not accommodated. As a result, guidelines are likely to be continuously evolving though case-by-case accretion.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>There will soon be a need for a community-based site license with particular attention being paid to this as a way of getting to the growing numbers of electric access have-nots.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Ken Komoski</I></P>
<P>
Schmidt spoke of a case under adjudication involving the uploading of copyrighted material to a computer network bulletin board service. He did not know whether fair use claims formed any part of the defense, but he pointed out that one of the things computers "do very well is to count things and keep track of where they come from." Anonymity is very difficult.
Chairperson Bender then made four points:
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>The prevailing viewpoint of conference participants is that most educators, those at the K-12 level as well as those in higher education, would prefer more specific guidelines to help them define and interpret fair use.
<LI>The problem with any guidelines covering new media is that they can quickly become outmoded.
<LI>The preamble to the existing fair-use guidelines, which appear as Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Law, "reflect the viewpoint that the guidelines are not necessarily carved in granite, so to speak, and can be looked at again by the parties."
<LI>Some educational organizations regard fair-use guidelines as a "safe harbor." As long as they stay within the confines of the guidelines they are secure from concerns about copyright infringement. But even if they stray beyond them, they may not be sued because the guidelines "are minimum rather than maximum."
</OL></P>
<P>
<B>T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> H<SMALL>OME</SMALL> "A<SMALL>FTER</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKET</SMALL>"</B><BR>
Ken Komoski, responding to Carol Risher's comments about the "after-market" of educational and home sales, said, "The educational market is being transformed by the home market right now. Sales of computer software, including CD-ROM and multimedia, to homes will far outstrip all sales to schools within the next two years. As we speak, they're going neck and neck. The home market for these products increased by 69 percent, I believe, last year, and probably will hit that or better again this year." He then reiterated his concern that these sales will go largely to higher income families, further dividing the haves from the have-nots. That's why, he said, "Fair use to low-income kids and adults is very important, and that's why we need to have community telecomputing cooperatives paying a community-wide site license and working with schools to be able to get good software on their networks and into the homes, hands, heads of low-income families."</P>
<P>
Komoski further spoke of the BET Program-Businesses for Equity in Telecomputing-that encourages agencies that are considering giving computers to schools also to make them available to families. The families would sign up for training at community centers and earn a computer as they learned to use it. He mentioned the Buddy Program in Indiana, which also works to get computers into homes.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>An academic domain could be between fair-use situations and the public domain, where a product might be made available for free use by the academic community.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Gregg Mathis</I></P>
<P>
<B>N<SMALL>EEDS OF THE</SMALL> D<SMALL>ISABLED</SMALL></B><BR>
Cindy King of Gallaudet University spoke on behalf of the needs of disabled populations. She said that current copyright law leaves unclear whether she has the right to transcribe audio tracks into texts that are accessible to deaf populations. Blind users could make use of texts converted to speech, but no one knows whether the conversion is permitted under copyright law. Most multimedia developers have a written text. Ideally this text, digitized, should be available to the disabled population for conversion into accessible forms, but the accessibility becomes a problem because everybody else would want it. In England there have been experiments with making text fields available to blind populations for conversion to speech in ways that ensure that publishers do not lose their rights and that copying does not become universal.</P>
<P>
<B>M<SMALL>ARKETPLACE</SMALL> N<SMALL>EEDS</SMALL> C<SMALL>ONVEYED</SMALL> T<SMALL>HROUGH</SMALL> P<SMALL>ERMISSIONS</SMALL> R<SMALL>EQUESTS</SMALL></B><BR>
Carol Race, from Northeast Missouri State University, also representing CCUMC, observed that the process of requesting permissions from publishers and copyright holders is a form of communication between these groups and the marketplace. As a result of this communication, publishers are learning of new needs and problems of their buyers and are led to begin wrestling with some of the emerging problems, such as using materials on distance learning networks.</P>
<P>
<B>P<SMALL>RODUCER'S</SMALL> P<SMALL>ERSPECTIVE</SMALL></B><BR>
Charles Benton of Public Media Inc. challenged remarks in Fred Hofstetter's presentation about the Howard Community College Faculty Copyright Manual. The frequency-of use proviso, requiring that off-air taped material can be repeated once for teaching reinforcement and then, after 45 days, must be erased, is constantly being violated, resulting in "the erosion of public performance rights that we've seen." According to Benton, repeated showings of broadcasts in classes deprives program-rights holders of profits and cuts severely into the after-market. "The fact is if people were living up to this guideline there might still be a market here, and some of the companies that have gone out of business would not have gone out of business."</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>The prevailing viewpoint of conference participants is that most educators those at the K-12 level as well as those in higher education, would prefer more specific guidelines to help them define and interpret fair use.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Ivan Bender</I></P>
<P>
Benton also spoke about the 10/10 rule relating to use of excerpts, arguing that sometimes a very brief amount of footage is "the essence of the film" and using such an excerpt is prohibited by fair use, even if it is less than ten percent of the original production and constitutes less than ten percent of the new production under development. As examples, he cited the footage showing the Tacoma Bridge collapse and a clip showing the metamorphosis of a butterfly from Encyclopedia Britannica films.</P>
<P>
Benton supported the idea of having OTA issue a report on fair-use issues and suggested that Senator Kerrey, who sponsored the Electronic Education Act, might request such a study. With the National Information Infrastructure Task Force sponsoring a conference in 1994, progress will be made, probably incrementally, case by case. He said it may be premature to search for new guidelines right now, but it would be good if the conference established an ongoing steering committee to continue to work on the issues raised.</P>
<P>
The most constructive thing to do right now, according to Benton, is to "focus on setting up models." He said, "CCUMC could apply research on where things are working and where you do have a public/private sector cooperation that is making progress and that is helping to make definitions. Let's attack this problem inductively from the ground up as opposed to deductively, from the guidelines down."</P>
<P>
Ivan Bender, conference chairperson, responded that in his experience in visiting campuses and discussing fair use, most people are very eager to know just what they can and cannot do. The actions of the Maricopa County Community School District, where volunteers give their time to an intellectual property rights committee to police copyright at their own campuses, are exemplary, and Professor Hofstetter's views may be those of a small minority only. Bender doubted that many of the participants thought that the time was premature for new guidelines, but he commended the idea of an ongoing committee to work on guidelines.</P>
<P>
Mike Wood, director of the Media Resources Center at Wichita State University, engaged Benton in further discussion regarding the Tacoma Bridge footage example as demonstrated by Fred Hofstetter. Wood asked about the conditions under which he would be permitted to use the bridge footage and an Ella Fitzgerald Memorex clip in the classroom. Assume that he had purchased both pieces and had shown them both, in their entirety, to his physics class; and assume, to make a point, that he wished to juxtapose two short segments. Could he use capture-and-edit technology to "clip" the two pieces, or must he show them on two projectors, side by side? What intellectual or economic damage would be done to the filmmaker or the distributor in this instance? Carol Race and Carol Risher explained that the clips that Wood had acquired were on a commercial videodisc and later issued on a CD-ROM created by John Wiley and Sons. Benton replied, "Whoever is the copyright owner of those two clips ought to have a say in how they are used to get a fair return on those investments."</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Blind users could make use of texts converted to speech, but no one knows whether the conversion is permitted under copyright law.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Cindy King</I></P>
<P>
At a later point in the discussion, Race returned to this question, saying that when the clips are on a laserdisc using CAV technology, which is marketed for its random access capability, "If they didn't want clips to be able to be used independently, they wouldn't put them down in a CAV random-access disk. That's what they're there for and that's what they encourage educators to do."</P>
<P>
Bender added, "Those are very valuable clips and very valuable property. They shouldn't just be repurposed because they meet needs that are not foreseen by the publisher without some permission and without some relationship between the publisher and the user."</P>
<P>
<B>F<SMALL>AIR</SMALL> U<SMALL>SE OF</SMALL> F<SMALL>ILM</SMALL> C<SMALL>LIPS IN</SMALL> M<SMALL>EDIA</SMALL> S<SMALL>TUDIES</SMALL></B><BR>
Charles Benton said that he had recently had several discussions about the use of film clips of Hollywood movies for film studies. "I have actually been trying for decades to beat some sense into the heads of the Hollywood studios to allow access to clips for film studies for 'media literacy,' which we really need, and, unfortunately, the publishing community has been stymied because it's very difficult to get clearance for these clips from the Hollywood studios and/or commercial television just to study the media." He added, "Hollywood goes berserk with the idea" of picking up clips from feature films and defining the practice as fair use. He hoped that continuing pressure might bring about some progress on this issue. He argued, "We should be able to study the literature of our timefeature filmsso that kids can develop some standards, some critical thinking, around films and television as they are with literature, which of course is traditional and entrenched."</P>

James Schmidt announced that in 1986 or 1987, Representative Kastenmeier's subcommittee requested a study by OTA. A report was issued by the Library of Congress Network Advisory Committee under a title on the order of "Intellectual Property Rights in the Electronic Age." Robert Cost was the analyst. Although the Internet has expanded since the time the report was written, the participant said that Cost had been aware of the emerging network environment.</P>

The same participant also identified himself as a person responsible for a media center operation with television distribution responsibilities. He said, "The current guidelines are an administrative headache, a nuisance, a piece of overhead that I wish we could do without, and if I can figure out a way to do that, I will."</P>

<B>E<SMALL>DUCATION AND THE</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKETPLACE</SMALL></B><BR>
Lynne Crandall, media consultant at the Language Resource Center of the University of Michigan, spoke as a representative of the International Association of Learning Laboratories. She pointed out that educational institutions have budgets targeted toward education and research. Because they cannot spare resources for defending lawsuits involving copyright infringement, they tend to require their faculty members to be very conservative, inhibiting teaching, academic freedom, and creativity. In the end, she argued, the marketplace suffers; materials that could be purchased and used in the class are not bought because the faculty members are afraid to use them in the way that is most useful and, additionally, they are not creating things. They are not going to go out and pursue making a derivative work because the process looks too complicated.</P>
<P>
She added that educators are urged to confront the educational crisis and prevent students from falling behind: "Well, then, let people teach them in the manner which is best suited to their teaching and learning styles by providing materials in the manner in which people want to use them." She argued that schools require that materials be licensable at very reasonable cost.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Sometimes a very brief amount of footage is the essence of the film. Using such an excerpt is prohibited by fair use, even if it is less than ten percent of the original production and constitutes less than ten percent of the new production under development.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Charles Benton</I></P>
<P>
Crandall and Chairperson Bender discussed various educational "uses," specifically a case in which students are required to view a film as homework for a class in which it will be discussed. Crandall would like to see the classroom exemption extend to all instructional viewing (i.e., restricted to students enrolled in a course), regardless of whether the teachers are present or where the viewing takes place. Bender said that producers would view such a situation as an attempt to avoid the higher cost of performance fees compared to videotape copies. He said that under fair-use guidelines, home video rights are restricted to the classroom, but with public performance rights, the film could be shown anywhere. He further explained that when the 1976 Copyright Law was written, the home video industry was in its infancy. As a result, the law does not address the distinctions between two markets, the commercial market and the educational market.</P>
<P>
Frank Connolly of American University argued that it would be more productive to stop looking back at the traditions of educators and publishers and the way they affect copyright law, but instead look ahead to the future and think about the ideal world in 2006. "After we understand what the ideal will be in the future, let's back off and ask where are we now and how do we go from where we are to there."</P>
<P>
As the discussion continued, Rosemary Talab of AECT pointed out that texts printed on paper are swiftly being replaced with digitized formats, including several refereed journals published on the Internet. There needs to be a hard look at the problems of networked uses of copyrighted materials. She quoted John Seeley Brown of Xerox, who said that "in the future, paper will be for transitory use." There are many unanswered questions with regard to large-scale uses of digitized works.</P>
<P>
In addition, Talab said that portfolios and projects are increasingly a part of K-12 education. Students have to present their portfolios and their projects for review. Teachers in a growing number of school districts must submit portfolios for professional teaching evaluations. Many of these are likely to contain clips from video, compact discs, and other formats, creating yet more copyright and fair-use issues.</P>
<P>
<B>A<SMALL>PPEAL FOR</SMALL> C<SMALL>ONTINUING</SMALL> A<SMALL>CTION</SMALL></B><BR>
Chairperson Bender reiterated the need to look at issues that are likely to develop in the next five or ten years relating to multimedia and fair use. He said that these issues will need to be examined in a more relaxed way over some time. He appealed to participants to indicate their interest in pursuing the questions raised at the conference. He warned, however, that the government seems to be moving quickly, and it is necessary to make views known soon.</P>
<P>
<B>S<SMALL>TREAMLINING</SMALL> P<SMALL>ERMISSIONS</SMALL> R<SMALL>EQUESTS</SMALL></B><BR>
Robert Kern of Paramount Publishing warned that during the transitional period technologies are evolving and new guidelines are being hammered out, and it will be important to find ways to have complete copyright and permissions information travel with digital information and products.</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>The current guidelines are an administrative headache, a nuisance, a piece of overhead that I wish we could do without, and if I can figure out a way to do that, I will.</BIG></BIG> - <I>James Schmidt</I></P>
<P>
Bender commended this idea, suggesting that if access to copyright holders by educational users was improved, a new fair-use definition might be less urgent.  He said that all parties bear some blame for the current situation.  The proprietary community is often slow in responding to requests for permissions and sometimes does not even know how to contact the copyright holder.  The educational community, on the other hand, often goes about requesting permission in ways that make the process more difficult than it needs to be.</P>
<P>
There is the possibility that the Copyright Office may try to implement some kind of prototype of a licensing mechanism.  The problem is particularly complicated in the case of audiovisual products, which may involve many separate copyrighted materials so that producers need to negotiate music rights, directors rights, rights of the author of the script, and performers rights, directors rights, rights of the author of the script, and performers rights.  There needs to be a way to make all of these rights negotiable at the same time.</P>
<P>
M<SMALL>ORE ON</SMALL> A<SMALL>CADEMIC</SMALL> D<SMALL>OMAIN</SMALL><BR>
Gregg Mathis from Carnegie Mellon made two points.  First, he asked if any dollar value could be calculated for academic uses of materials under fair use; and, if so, could some kind f payment be made in return for release of materials to the academic domain?  Second, he pointed out that proprietors would be able to decide whether or not to release materials into the academic domain.</P>
<P>
N<SMALL>ONGEOGRAPHIC</SMALL> E<SMALL>DUCATIONAL</SMALL> E<SMALL>NVIRONMENTS</SMALL><BR>
Jim Mecklenburger, a journalist and representative of Global Village Schools Institute, pointed out that the representation at the conference and the issues discussed were informed by traditional players and "well-entrenched enterprises - government, legal, schools operations, and publishers of many kinds of media."  He said there is a need to bring in some interests who will be important players in the future.  Among these are "the world of telephony" and video producers such as Turner Broadcasting, which has become "an enterprise that is increasingly becoming an educating institution, drawing some of its revenue and some of its activity and some of its talent into being a direct instructor, not merely to a group of folks in one lace, which is largely the context of most of our conversation, but to groups of folks in many, many places."  Because of enterprises like these, educational environments may come to be defined in ways that are not geographic at all.  He mentioned the National Geographic Kids Network and described it as "a schooling community with no locus, but rather a community of folks tens of thousands large that are orchestrated technologically to do some work."</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Materials that could be purchases and used in class are not bought because faculty members are afraid to use them in the way that is most useful and, additionally, they are not creating things.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Lynne Crandall</I></P>
<P>
Mecklenburger said, "We need a very new set of rubrics, whether its academic domain or some other kinds of ways to think about these matters that arent tied to geography, arent tied to classrooms, arent tied to libraries and arent tied to media centers, but have a much broader context."  He also said that the people who are now pushing the limits of education, publishing, and distribution needed to be brought into the conversation.</P>
<P>
Finally, Mecklenburger stated that OTA is currently working on a study called <I>Teachers and Technology</I>, which is due for release in January 1995.  Kathleen Fulton would know about it.</P>
<P>
Chairperson Bender responded that a number of participants who were invited did not come, but they would be sent a report of the conference.  The sponsors had attempted to include all primary organizations.</P>
<P>
F<SMALL>UTURE</SMALL> D<SMALL>IRECTIONS</SMALL>
Cynthia Rosso with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics called for focus groups to look at where education, the publishing industry, and the communications industry is heading.</P>
<P>
Chairperson Bender agreed, adding that it was becoming very likely that increasingly the academic community would become a major producer of multimedia programming, to the point that academic institutions might be suppliers of materials that would be disseminated by commercial vendors or distributed in competition with them. The development of university presses is a precedent for this process, as they were first formed to disseminate information that did not interest commercial publishers and then many of them became strong, more general publishers themselves. When academic institutions become producers and distributors, either commercially or nonprofit, an entirely new set of questions will arise.</P>
<P>
<B>C<SMALL>ONCLUSION</SMALL></B><BR>
Lisa Livingston, from City College of New York and a representative of CCUMC, offered parting words to participants representing proprietary interests. She said, "The technology that is being integrated and used in the classroom today might not need to be considered or should not need to be considered the way technology was used in the past. We are talking about technology changing the way we educate and changing the way kids learn. We're talking about linear and nonlinear integration, and we're talking about for the first time maybe in our entire lifeteaching the entire community. If we consider that as a reality, then that means that we all have a tremendous responsibility to try to work together to come up with some sort of solution so that we don't leave behind people that are disabled, people that do not have the money to purchase, and people that are making and working hard to create for us in education."</P>
<P>
<BIG><BIG>Texts printed on paper are swiftly being replaced with digitized formats, and there are many unanswered questions with regard to large-scale uses of digitized works.</BIG></BIG> - <I>Rosemary Talab</I></P>
<P>
Ken Komoski extended Livingston's remarks by referring to "the ecology of learning." He pointed out that children typically spend nineteen percent of their time over a year in school, and traditionally this time has dominated their learning experience. "But now that we've got this enormous activity going on in homes, it's increasing and forcing us to look more broadly at this ecology." He mentioned a commentary he had published in <I>Education Week</I> (January 25, 1994) called "The 81-Percent Solution to Educational Problems."</P>
<P>
Chairperson Bender then thanked the sponsors, the Consortium of College and University Media Centers and the Agency for Instructional Technology, as well as National Video Resources, which had underwritten some costs of the conference, and Dynacom, which had also contributed. He acknowledged the important contribution of the presenters and all the participants.</P>
<P>
Bender then affirmed that the effort will continue, especially in working with government agencies. He hoped to pull together a "small core of individuals" to keep up the dialogue.</P>
<P>
Charles Benton joined Ken Komoski in thanking Bender for his leadership role in the conference and expressed great satisfaction in having been able to attend.</P>
<P>
Joann Stevens, from the Association of American Colleges and Universities, added that new media will provide a voice and images for "different kinds of people, cultures, and women who have not been fairly represented or accurately represented in our education within the past." She said that technology will make "what we learn more accurate and broader than it has been."</P>
<P>
Bender expressed appreciation to American University for hosting the conference.</P>
<P>
The Educational Fair Access and the New Media National Conference concluded at 11:30 a.m., June 17, 1994.  <IMG SRC="/images/micro_ait.jpg"></P>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>shall have the right -
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>to claim authorship of that work, and
<LI>to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of visual art which he or she did not create;
</OL>
<LI>shall have the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of visual art in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; and

</OL></OL>
<LI>Scope and Exercise of Rights-Only the author of a work of visual art has the rights conferred by subsection (a) in that work, whether or not the author is the copyright owner. The authors of a joint work of visual art are co-owners of the rights conferred by subsection (a) in that work.
<LI>Exceptions -

Such instrument shall specifically identify the work, and uses of that work, to which the waiver applies, and the waiver shall apply only to the work and uses so identified. In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors, a waiver of rights under this paragraph made by one such author waives such rights for all such authors.

<HR>
<H2>Fair-Use Guidelines for Books and Periodicals</H2>
<P>
In a joint letter to Chairman Kastenmeier dated March 19, 1976, the representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee of Educational Institutions and Organizations on Copyright Law Revision, and of the Authors League of America, Inc., and the Association of American Publishers, Inc., stated:</P>
<P>
You may remember that in our letter of March 8, 1976, we told you that the negotiating teams representing authors and publishers and the Ad Hoc Group had reached tentative agreement on guidelines to insert in the Committee Report covering educational copying from books and periodicals under Section 107 of H.R. 2223 and S. 22, and that as part of that tentative agreement each side would accept the amendments to sections 107 and 504 which were adopted by your Subcommittee on March 3, 1976.</P>
<P>
We are now happy to tell you that the agreement has been approved by the principals and we enclose a copy herewith. We had originally intended to translate the agreement into language suitable for inclusion in the legislative report dealing with section 107, but we have since been advised by committee staff that this will not be necessary. As stated above, the agreement refers only to copying from books and periodicals, and it is not intended to apply to musical or audiovisual works.</P>
<P>
The full text of the agreement is as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>Agreement on Guidelines for Classroom Copying in Not-for-profit Educational Institutions with Respect to Books and Periodicals</B><BR>
The purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of educational fair use under Section 107 of H.R. 2223. The parties agree that the conditions determining the extent of permissible copying for educational purposes may change in the future; that certain types of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be permissible in the future; and conversely that in the future other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may be permissible under revised guidelines.</P>
<P>
Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107 of the Copyright Revision Bill. There may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.</P>
<P>
<B>Guidelines</B>
<OL TYPE="I">
<LI><I>Single Copying for Teachers</I><BR>
A single copy may be made of any of the following by or for a teacher at his or her individual request for his or her scholarly research or use in teaching or preparation to teach a class:
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>a chapter from a book;
<LI>an article for a periodical or newspaper;
<LI>a short story, short essay or short poem, whether or not from a collective work;

<HR>
<H2>Fair-Use Guidelines for Music</H2>
<P>
In a joint letter dated April 30, 1976, representatives of the Music Publishers' Association of the United States, Inc., the National Music Publishers' Association, Inc., the Music Teachers National Association, the Music Educators National Conference, the National Association of Schools of Music, and the Ad Hoc Committee on Copyright Law Revision, wrote to Chairman Kastenmeier as follows:</P>
<P>
During the hearings on H.R. 2223 in June 1975, you and several of your subcommittee members suggested that concerned groups should work together in developing guidelines which would be helpful to clarify Section 107 of the bill.</P>
<P>
Representatives of music educators and music publishers delayed their meetings until guidelines had been developed relative to books and periodicals. Shortly after that work was completed and those guidelines were forwarded to your subcommittee, representatives of the undersigned music organizations met together with representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee on Copyright Law Revision to draft guidelines relative to music.</P>
<P>
We are very pleased to inform you that the discussions thus have been fruitful on the guidelines which have been developed. Since private music teachers are an important factor in music education, due consideration has been given to the concerns of that group.</P>
<P>
We trust that this will be helpful in the report on the bill to clarify Fair Use as it applies to music.</P>
<P>
The text of the guidelines accompanying this letter is as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>Guidelines for Educational Uses of Music</B><BR>
The purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of educational fair use under Section 107 of H.R. 2223. The parties agree that the conditions determining the extent of permissible copying for educational purposes may change in the future; that certain types of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be permissible in the future, and conversely that in the future other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may be permissible under revised guidelines.</P>
<P>
Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107 of the Copyright Revision Bill. There may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.</P>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><B>Permissible Uses</B>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>Emergency copying to replace purchased copies which for any reason are not available for an imminent performance provided purchased replacement copies shall be substituted in due course.
<LI>For academic purposes other than performance,
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>single or multiple copies of excerpts of works may be made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a part of the whole which would constitute a performable unit such as a selection, movement or aria, but in no case more than ten percent of the whole work. The number of copies shall not exceed one copy per pupil.
<LI>a single copy of an entire performable unit (section, movement, aria, etc.) that is,
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>confirmed by the copyright proprietor to be out of print or
<LI>unavailable except in a larger work
</OL>
may be made by or for a teacher solely for the purpose of his or her scholarly research or in preparation to teach a class.
</OL>
<LI>Printed copies which have been purchased may be edited or simplified provided that the fundamental character of the work is not distorted or the Iyrics, if any, altered or Iyrics added if none exist.
<LI>A single copy of recordings of performances by students may be made for evaluation or rehearsal purposes and may be retained by the educational institution or individual teacher
<LI> A single copy of a sound recording (such as a tape, disc, or cassette) of copyrighted music may be made from sound recordings owned by an educational institution or an individual teacher for the purpose of constructing aural exercises or examinations and may be retained by the educational institution or individual teacher. (This pertains to the copyright of the music itself and not to any copyright which may exist in the sound recording.)
</OL>
<LI><B>Prohibitions</B>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Copying to create or replace or substitute for anthologies, compilations or collective works.
<LI>Copying of or from works intended to be "consumable" in the course of study or of teaching such as workbooks, exercises, standardized tests and answer sheets, and like material.
<LI>Copying for the purpose of performance, except as in A-1 above.
<LI>Copying for the purpose of substituting for the purchase of music, except as in A-1 and A-2 above.
<LI>Copying without inclusion of the copyright notice which appears on the printed copy.

<HR>
<H2>Fair-Use Guidelines for Off-Air Videotaping</H2>
<P>
In March of 1979, Congressman Robert Kastenmeier, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and Administration of Justice, appointed a Negotiating Committee consisting of representatives of educational organizations, copyright proprietors, and creative guilds and unions. The following guidelines reflect the Negotiating Committee's consensus as to the application of "fair use" to the recording, retention, and use of television broadcast programs for educational purposes. They specify periods of retention and use of such off-air recordings in classrooms and similar places devoted to instruction and for homebound instruction. The purpose of establishing these guidelines is to provide standards for both owners and users of copyrighted television programs.</P>
<P>
<B>Guidelines for Off-Air Recording of Broadcast Programming for Educational Purposes</B>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>The guidelines were developed to apply to off-air recording by nonprofit educational institutions.
<LI>A broadcast program may be recorded off-air simultaneously with broadcast transmission (including simultaneous cable retransmission) and retained by a nonprofit educational institution for a period not to exceed the first forty-five (45) consecutive days after date of recording. Upon conclusion of such retention period, all off-air recordings must be erased or destroyed immediately. "Broadcast programs" are television programs transmitted by television stations for reception by the general public without charge.
<LI>Off-air recordings may be used once by individual teachers in the course of relevant teaching activities, and repeated once only when instructional reinforcement is necessary, in classrooms and similar places devoted to instruction within a single building, cluster or campus, as well as in the homes of students receiving formalized home instruction, during the first ten (10) consecutive school days in the forty-five (45) day calendar retention period. "School days" are school session days not counting weekends, holidays, vacations, examination periods, and other scheduled interruptions within the forty-five (45) calendar day retention period.
<LI>Off-air recordings may be made only at the request of and used by individual teachers, and may not be regularly recorded in anticipation of requests. No broadcast program may be recorded off-air more than once at the request of the same teacher, regardless of the number of times the program may be broadcast.
<LI>A limited number of copies may be reproduced from each off-air recording to meet the legitimate needs of teachers under these guidelines. Each such additional copy shall be subject to all provision governing the original recording.
<LI>After the first ten (10) consecutive school days, off-air recordings may be used up to the end of the forty-five (45) calendar day retention period only for teacher evaluation purposes, i.e., to determine whether or not to include the broadcast program in the teaching curriculum, and may not be used in the recording institution for student exhibition or any other non-evaluation purpose without authorization.
<LI>Off-air recordings need not be used in their entirety, but the recorded programs may not be altered from their original content. Off-air recordings may not be physically or electronically combined or merged to constitute teaching anthologies or compilations.
<LI>All copies of off-air recordings must include the copyright notice on the broadcast program as recorded.
<LI>Educational institutions are expected to establish appropriate control procedures to maintain the integrity of these guidelines.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Judith A. Billings</I></H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>
Superintendent of Public Instruction<BR>
Washington State<BR>
Biographical Information</B>
</P>
<HR>
<P><BR>
Born in Kalispell, Montana, Judith attended schools in Libby, Montana, until a family move took her to Portland, Oregon, where she graduated from high school. Her college experience was at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma where she graduated with a B.A. degree in education.
</P>
<P>
After two years of teaching in the Franklin Pierce School District, Billings moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she earned her master's  degree in communications from the University of New Mexico. Her classroom teaching career continued in Fresno, California, and Puyallup, Washington, and eventually totaled 13 years.
</P>
<P>
While at Puyallup, Billings developed an interest and concern for the students who were not making progress or graduating from the public school system. This inspired her to become involved in the formation of Puyallup Continuation School where she eventually served as program coordinator. Her Principal's Credentials were obtained from Western Washington University. In 1972 she married teacher-colleague, Donald Billings.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Judith's career took another turn as she took a position with the Office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction. As state director of the federally funded program for disadvantaged children (Title I), Judith visited almost every school district in the state, gaining an understanding of the vast differences in Washington's urban, suburban and rural schools. Supervision of the state Remediation Assistance Program was added to her responsibilities in 1984.
</P>
<P>
During her tenure as state Title I director, Judith provided leadership in the process of writing a federal audit handbook and serving as legislative committee coordinator from 1984 - 1987. This piqued her interest in the legal aspects of education administration, and while continuing to work at the state agency, she began attending the University of Puget Sound Law School evening classes.
</P>
<P>
Her knowledge of the state and federal programs led to a legal internship with the U.S. House of Representatives Education Committee in Washington, D.C., where she prepared a subcommittee report on compensatory education programs. Returning to Washington State, she completed law school, graduating with a Juris Doctorate, Cum Laude in 1987. She was admitted to the Washington State Bar in December 1987. She transferred to the Legal Services Section of the State Education Agency upon her return from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The reauthorization of the federal Chapter 1 program prompted another request for federal service. Judith was asked to provide guidance to the U.S. House of Representatives congressional subcommittee on elementary, secondary and vocational education with the reauthorization process. She assisted in negotiating much of the legal language in the Stafford-Hawkins Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988.
</P>
<P>
While in Washington, D.C., for the second time, a write-in campaign began in Washington State. Educators from across the state were mounting a campaign to place an educator on the ballot for State Superintendent of Public Instruction.  Judith A. Billings was the target of that campaign. She was elected to that office by the voters of the state of Washington on November 8, 1988, becoming the state's 13th Superintendent of Public Instruction on January 11, 1989.
</P>
<P>
During her first term, Superintendent Billings emphasized the need for the education system to improve the programs and systems that support successful families and children who come to school prepared to learn. Her advocacy has helped impel improved funding for early childhood education programs, improved counseling and testing and expanded school based child care programs. A leader in interagency programs, by working with five state departmental secretaries, Superintendent Billings also has helped establish and lead the Family Policy Initiative, an effort to coordinate family and children policies across agency and departmental lines.
</P>
<P>
She has also supported new initiatives in technology, making Washington a participant in the Star Schools program. New proposals also have resulted in better funding for school construction projects, improved teacher salaries and reduced class size in early grades.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 Judith was appointed to the Governor's Council on Education Reform and Funding. This 21-member Council of education, business and legislative leaders worked over an 18-month period to produce recommendations which would lay the groundwork for education reform in the state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
As her second term of office began in 1993, she worked closely with the Legislature to support the passage of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1209, Washington's comprehensive systemic education reform bill. Judith is vice chair of the Commission on Student Learning which is establishing essential academic learning requirements and assessments that will shift Washington's schools to a performance-based system by the year 2000. She established a Center for the Improvement of Student Learning at the state agency to disseminate the work of the Commission, provide technical assistance to school districts on restructuring &quot;best practices&quot; and to involve parents and community members in the education change process.
</P>
<P>
Judith's work at the national level continues as the Vice President of the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) for the 1996 term. Judith served as the President of CCSSO for the 1995 term.
</P>
<P>
Judith also serves as a member of the Board of Natural Resources, the Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board, the School to Work Taskforce, and numerous other boards and commissions dealing with technology, environmental, arts, and partnership issues.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Schools, Houses, and Ice Cream: The Choices We Make</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By<A HREF="../bios/mmarcus.htm"> Morton J. Marcus</A></H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I>Are American schools as bad as we've been led to believe?  And if they are, will a program of choice subsidized by vouchers solve the problem? Economist Morton Marcus argues that it may be a misallocation of resources within our education system that needs correcting&#151;not the system itself.</I></B></P>


<P>We all have choices. But in order to choose, we must have options, some of which may be too expensive for us to afford. An ice cream shop, for example, may offer 100 different flavors, but it will be successful only if the cost of those options is minimal and the demand for them warrants the asking price. So, too, a community may offer a wide diversity in its mix of housing, education, and other services, if the effective market demand is present.</P>

<P>But, what if consumers at a given ice cream shop do not support 100 different flavors? Perhaps there are too few consumers, or their income is too low for them to spend a lot on ice cream, or they may not have much of a taste for ice cream. We would think it silly for the government to step in. But this is just what we do with education today because we do not consider it the moral equivalent of ice cream. We believe that citizens should have certain basic services<BR>
 &#133;even if they cannot afford it,<BR>
&#133;even if there are not enough of them to make it &#147;efficient,&#148;<BR>
&#133;and even if they would not choose to have those services.</P>

<P>In the past, this was the accepted belief of our nation about education and the system that provides it to our children. But that consensus has been undermined as we have been led to believe that our public schools are not doing the job they were created to do. One of the solutions currently being espoused is that of &#147;choice,&#148; a program to treat education like other services in the private marketplace but with the benefit of a government subsidy, or voucher.</P>

<P><B>Existing Choice in Education</B></P>

<P>What choice is there now in American education? A standard practice among the wealthy for generations has been to send their children away to schools offering distinguished programs. Less wealthy persons have exercised choice by moving to a school district or parish that offered programs consistent with their desires as parents.</P>

<P>This is the essential relationship between education, transportation, and the community. If education is not in the home, it involves transportation. And here is the central choice parents make, within the limitations of income: They choose a place to live. That decision, for more than 100 years, has linked education and residence as a package.</P>

<P>How far do you want your child to travel to attend school, and how frequently do you want that trip made? If you do not mind being separated from the child and can afford it, you can send her hundreds or even thousands of miles away, and she can come home infrequently. If you are of more modest means, you will have your child walk to the nearest school, daily.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>Racial integration of the schools by busing was mainly an attempt to bring about desirable change without addressing other factors we did not have the courage to approach. We would not face discrimination in the housing market or in the workplace, so we put the burden on our schools and our children. Is it still appropriate to ask the schools to do the job?</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>In the latter case, the community becomes important. If your child is to walk to school, then you must choose a residence that offers what you want (and can afford) in combination with a school that offers what you want (and can afford). Choosing a home and choosing a school is a combined decision for most people with children. The attributes of a home include those on the site (bedrooms, baths, view) and those in the community (neighbors, shopping, schools). Just as a home comes with certain operating costs (garden, heating, maintenance), it also has certain transportation costs (to work, to shopping, to schools).</P>

<P>The quality of the schools in an area depends on what people want from education, their ability to pay for what they want, and the costs of providing education. If the schools are supported by parents alone, then the programs are determined by their preferences and their resources. But if the community (in the form of the state or the church) contributes as well, then the ideas, desires, and funds of a wider group come into play. Hence, the community (geographic or religious) has a bearing on education as long as parents accept the community's financial support for their children's schooling.* Even if all schools were private, the community probably would not allow schooling to take place without some form of regulation.</P>

<P><SMALL>(*The words &#147;education&#148; and &#147;schooling&#148; are used interchangeably here, although the difference is recognized.)</SMALL></P>

<P><B>Government and Our Schools</B></P>

<P>Governments provide education services for historical reasons. Diverse private schools were not feasible in areas with small enrollments where only one school could be justified. When much of America was rural and transportation costs were relatively high, schools were organized to minimize travel. Thus we have a geographic basis to our school corporations. As neighbors got together to form school corporations, they wanted to ensure that all beneficiaries&#151;all citizens&#151;would participate in funding education. For that reason, school corporations were recognized by legislatures and given governmental powers to levy taxes. In addition, it was believed that accountability would be greatest if the managers of the schools were subject to popular recall by their neighbors through the ballot box.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>The current drive for choice in schooling is a mutation of the healthy skepticism about government that is part of the American psyche. But the campaign to separate public funding from government provision of educational services has a virulence that makes improvements in existing public programs difficult, if not impossible. Few people want to fix something they are told is irretrievably broken.</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>But education is not what we call a &#147;pure public good&#148;&#151;that is, a service from which consumers cannot be excluded. If you cannot exclude would-be consumers, you cannot get people to pay for the service. We can easily keep would-be students out of class, so education can be provided by the private sector quite readily. And we could have government subsidies of a purely private education system. This is the solution offered by some advocates of the voucher system.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the schooling of an individual is not a purely private matter but is one that affects others in the community. Universal literacy and basic common sets of knowledge create a more efficient society. The educated person imposes fewer costs on society and contributes to the well-being of the community via non-market mechanisms.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="1cartoon.gif" align=left hspace=10>Ice cream, by contrast, is a private good. The kind of ice cream you eat has such little influence on my life that we can both treat your choice of flavors as an event that is of interest to you alone. There are no externalities in the consumption of ice cream. But there are externalities to schooling, particularly at the primary and secondary levels. If education were a private good similar to ice cream cones, though, no one would object to privatization. Poorer children have fewer cones of lesser quality ice cream, while wealthier children enjoy deluxe treats to the limits determined by their parents. The same would work for schooling. But the education of all children is a matter of legitimate and considerable concern to our society.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>The Parents' Role</B></P>

<P>If a voucher system were to be put into place, parents would be free to choose the school&#151;public or private&#151;their child attends. The success of such a system is based on the flattering assumption that parents are informed consumers who will seek the &#147;best&#148; education for their children. But are they? How much of their time or money do parents spend to acquire information about the education of their children? From the discouraging news about collapsing parent-teacher organizations, from the dismal attendance at open houses, and from reports of parental indifference to homework assignments, we can only assume that limited numbers of parents are investing their own resources in education.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>Education does not appear to have the significant economies of scale that would lead to the formation of education monopolies from which society must be protected. Hence, public provision and regulation of education services must be founded in some other principle of public interest.</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>If parents really wanted the &#147;best&#148; education for their kids, they would be willing to make significant sacrifices. In truth, they want only the attainable&#151;given all of their other wants and the constraints of their resources. </P>

<P>How many parents or grandparents will give up their fine homes, their new cars, their cable TVs, or their pension rights in order to educate their children or grandchildren?</P>

<P>What will assure us that there will not be a deterioration in the quality of education? Given the choice, parents may well opt for schools which provide less homework that challenges their children's knowledge, which offer extended hours of child care but little instruction, and which demand unquestioned acceptance of parental and social authority. Well-behaved but ignorant children may be the preference of some parents.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>The education of the poorest child is as important, or perhaps more important, than that of the wealthiest, for when the endowment of environment (home and neighborhood life) is deficient, the additions of education may be of greatest value to the person and to society.</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>If parents do not place a high value on education, they may underinvest (from society's point of view) in the education of their children. Because society is concerned that parents will not devote sufficient resources to their children's education, it has instituted mandatory attendance laws and provided substantial subsidies for education in America. We presume government will continue to license and regulate schools in such ways. But a free market ideologue would argue that such regulation is unnecessary. Parents as consumers, this argument says, will quickly assess whether a school meets their educational expectations. Those schools that do not win consumer approval will quickly disappear.</P>

<P>This drive to reduce the government's role in the provision of education and the regulation of its content requires a determined effort to discount society's stake in education. That's why we hear more today of the private benefits of education&#151;in the form of income earned&#151;than we hear of the public concerns about an educated populace. There is an effort to advance the idea that schooling is for vocational training rather than for developing children with the values of civilization and the capacity for expanding human capabilities.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>Government is engaged in financing education because we believe that parents&#151;particularly, but not exclusively, poor parents&#151;left to their own resources would not consume (or produce) as much education as we think would be to the benefit of their children and our society.</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P><B>Misallocation of Resources</B></P>

<P>The modern American public education system is over-used by society to address non-education problems. In addition, distrust of local administration has given us a proliferation of strangling regulations and stultifying standardization. This trend has denied schools their flexibility and their capacity to meet local and changing circumstances.</P>

<P>America, in its drive to improve itself, turned to the schools as the instrumentality of that improvement. Racial inequities were to be solved by integrating the schools. Dietary deficiencies were to be corrected by school nutrition programs. Juvenile delinquency was to be ended by school-based programs. Flab was to be fought and culture nursed by the same system that was charged with teaching chemistry and language. In some future time it will be written: &#147;And Americans so loved their schools that they sacrificed them to rid the world of sin and evil.&#148;</P>

<P>The time has come for improvement, but not necessarily the dismemberment of the public schools sought by the pirates of privatization. Rather, we should seek to reduce the impediments to the successful operation of the system that is in place. Much of the problem may be the result of a very ordinary reluctance to change and too much pride to admit deficiencies.</P>

<P>The current system of schooling is not, however, irretrievably lost and in need of wholesale replacement. The first order of business is to determine what our schools are to do. Next, they should be liberated to do that job; and finally, teachers and administrators should be rewarded appropriately for their performance. This probably will require extricating our schools from those lines of business in which they do not have a comparative advantage.</P>

<P>Let's start with a basic fact: If education is not in the home, it involves transportation. In this country, most housing developers could advertise: &#147;Buy this remote rural home. It may be way out in the country, but the taxpayers of this county and state guarantee the transportation of your child to school.&#148; Why do we do that? Why can the wealthiest citizens move to suburban estates and have their children bused to school at the expense of retirees on fixed incomes?</P>

<P>Parents have choice in residential location and should bear the full costs of their choice. They should not pass that cost along to others through the school corporation's power to tax citizens. This means ending &#147;free&#148; (tax-subsidized) school transportation services. Some parents will find the transportation charge is a burden. For those who are poor or have special transportation problems, we can provide vouchers similar to food stamps. (If you want to privatize school transportation, do so! What educator has a comparative advantage as a school-bus schedule maker?)</P>

<P>Some parents will continue to choose remote locations because they are willing (and able) to bear that cost. Others will choose residential locations that allow their children to walk to school. Parents will demand sidewalks and crossing guards for the safety of their children. And none of this will happen instantly. But perhaps it will lead to smaller schools that will serve more compact areas.</P>

<P>Smaller schools with a community focus have been out of fashion for a generation or more. We have had waves of school consolidations because we believed that there were significant education options and economies at larger schools. That may have been true with the technology of the 1950s and earlier; it may no longer be valid. We have done little to change our methods of teaching since the introduction of the textbook. We have failed to employ with vigor the options that computers, videotapes, videodiscs, and live, interactive television offer educators and students.</P>

<P><B>Transport Education, Not Kids</B></P>

<P>The effectiveness of schooling could be increased by reallocating the tax money now spent on transporting students and using it to bring the modern world to education. We could use those funds to make our classrooms and teachers more productive by giving them superior complementary educational resources. We could help break down the school walls by freeing education from the tyranny of place and allowing students to learn at home or elsewhere if that works for them.</P>

<P>I believe that I learned certain subjects better from the textbooks I carried home each evening and back to school the next day than I did from in-class presentations by the teachers. Other topics, for me, however, required the explanation and encouragement of the teacher. Today, through television, we could have students learning at home if we made more materials available to them for that purpose. Homework the whole family could watch might be more interesting than some of the current game shows in reruns.</P>

<P>In addition, we can have classes made up of students in different locations, all being instructed by a teacher of superior quality through interactive TV. Schools that are too small for specialized courses can offer diversity (i.e., choice) through electronic media. We do not use these options widely today because they are costly and because many teachers and students have not developed the skills to teach or learn in this manner. Education can be transported without transporting children.</P>

<P>But let's not stop with transportation. Look about the school and ask, &#147;Why is this program supported by the education budget?&#148;** Sports, marching band, drama club. Are we again asking the schools to do jobs that are the rightful responsibility of other organizations? These are each worthwhile activities, but why are they supported with tax funds? Does music instruction require a marching band complete with uniforms and an extensive schedule of competitions? It is inappropriate to make such efforts part of the public's responsibility.</P>

<P><SMALL>(**Note I did not ask, &#147;Why is this program in the school?&#148; That is a different legitimate question.)</SMALL></P>

<P>There is no question that young people should engage in physical activities and learn the skills of play and cooperation that sports involve. But couldn't these efforts be financed through voluntary organizations, rather than through the compulsory use of tax funds? If parents and neighbors believe in the value of rooting for old Hopped-Up High at the Friday night football game, couldn't they prevail upon the local Rotary Club or Chamber of Commerce to provide monetary support for the team?</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>Schools are very much like other organizations in society. We have seen that some of our giant corporations have lost their ability to adapt to changes in their environment. Some of our schools' inflexibility has been imposed by added state and federal regulations. These often result from the distrust we have of our governments and our demand for their accountability. Some of the problems in schools are due to hostile labor-management relations where unions and administrations have become petrified partners in a destructive dance.</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>Funds now used for such purposes, including the capital funds for the stadium and the Olympic-size swimming pool, could be released to enhance educational productivity. It seems time to withdraw the schools from their role as multipurpose social-service organizations and return them to their role as teaching institutions. Before we attempt to remake the education system of the nation, we might try letting the one we have do its job.</P>

<P>Vouchers, competition, and privatization will not resolve our problems if we still do not have agreement on what we wish an education system to produce. Adults are more capable of describing the desired features of a home or an ice cream cone than of the education children should receive. We tend to view education as a means of enriching our own angelic offspring while civilizing the neighbors' little devils. We also want our children to learn their place in the history and culture of our diverse world while simultaneously being prepared for gainful employment by age 17.</P>

<P>Presumably, government regulation of schools will continue, even if we go to full privatization. But will we know what outputs to monitor, or will we just measure inputs, as we have in the past? All of the contemporary furor over choice and control is hindering us from rediscovering education's appropriate mission and renewing the will to support that mission. Until we do those things, offering even 100 options won't solve the problems in American education.</P>

<HR>

<P><B><I>Assessment is a hot topic an American education today, especially when national standards are included in the discussion.  UCLA's Eva Baker is at the forefront of research into student assessments that will support educational reform in this country.  But, before we find new ways of testing U.S. students' capabilities, Baker warns, we must address some basic questions, one of the most important being that of the quality of schooling.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>Although the autumn of an election year is usually not the optimal time for national unity of spirit, the Presidential candidates agreed on at least one (and perhaps only one) educational issue. Both (even all three) went on record in support of a &#147;national system of examinations.&#148; In effect, this year's candidates for President said: Let's see what our kids can do.</P>

<P>To those in schools, the idea of a national system of assessment may seem redundant. American children already are tested frequently by standardized and other tests, some claim more than children in other countries. Various assessments and tests are required by school district boards, by states and by federal programs. Classroom teachers also make their own tests to evaluate student achievement. These tests are purportedly used to monitor system progress, to communicate goals, to enforce accountability, and to diagnose student needs. Why are we focused on testing again, and why now?</P>

<P>The answers reside in two facts: first, the perceived failures of the present American system; and second, the complexities of trying to reform all at once a national education system that has at its core local educational responsibility.</P>

<P>Let's start with the premise that many Americans are dissatisfied with their educational system. With only minor dissent, a large number of policymakers, business leaders, and educators assert that American students are not sufficiently challenged intellectually and that an across-the-board elevation of academic standards is required. They think school should do a better job with their children, and they are right. But there is no consensus about exactly how to fix education.</P>

<P>People also differ on who should be the prime beneficiaries of reform. Many contend that demography and morality require us to place most of our attention on children who are poor, who also may be members of minority groups, or non-native speakers of English. Others believe that our focus should be on teachers, and we must not neglect children disabled in different ways or the specially talented and gifted. Platforms for change splinter even more when individuals argue for educational reform for specific emphases, for work-force skills, for foreign languages, for the interpretive and performing arts, for interdisciplinary learning, for multiculturalism, for new curricula, and of course, for technology.</P>

<P><B>Great Expectations</B></P>
 
<P>What makes assessment so appealing is that it apparently can be applied across the board to all students and to all subject matter emphases. In January 1991, the National Council on Education Standards and Testing, a group sanctioned by the Bush administration, Congress, and the National Governors Association, released its report, <I>Raising Standards for American Education</I>. This report presented a proposal to reform education by focusing on national standards and a national system of assessment.</P>

<P>The envisioned assessment system attempts to support local educational control and to avoid a single national test. These goals would be accomplished by states or consortia in their development of assessments of national standards&#151;a strategy used with success in the Federal Republic of Germany. In the full Council's deliberations, in the heated debate of the Council's Assessment Task Force, and in an independent report released by the Office of Technology Assessment, &#147;<I>Testing in American Schools: Asking the Right Questions,</I>&#148; it is clear that the public, educators, and policymakers have multiple expectations for assessment and make many assumptions about the validity of the information that tests and assessments provide.</P>

<P>The list of expectations is a long one:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Communication of standards</LI>
<LI>Impetus for curriculum reform</LI>
<LI>Diagnostic information to help students</LI>
<LI>Motivation of all participants</LI>
<LI>Clear benchmarks for progress</LI>
<LI>Management and accountability strategy</LI>
<LI>A basis for individual, teacher, school, and state comparison</LI>
<LI>A route to renewing confidence in the schools</LI>
<LI>A method to make good selections of students for jobs or higher education.</LI>
</UL>

<P>On the other hand, skeptics about assessment argue that its benefits are largely illusory. While they may support the claim that required multiple-choice tests lead to a fragmented, unchallenging curriculum, they also decry the jump in logic that assumes high-quality assessments inevitably will have a positive impact on teaching and curriculum. And they counter with uncomfortable questions about the quality of knowledge we have to achieve these goals. Do we know how to teach challenging tasks to most or to all of our students? If teachers could do so, critics of assessment believe, surely they would be doing so now.</P>

<P>Although the different sides argue with varying levels of passion and reason, very few proponents see assessment as the single cure for educational ills. Even fewer would suggest that any particular assessment can serve adequately all the assessment purposes (or, depending on your view, fantasies) set forth earlier. But assessment is a seductive policy option, since it appears to be less expensive than most alternatives. Its very indirectness is its particular charm. Better to use assessments to pull teachers toward appropriate instruction, materials toward appropriate content, children toward motivated learning, than to work on the relevant processes themselves. No one can fault the desire to be efficient in this period of tight resources. But there is as yet no evidence that assessments will have the impact desired. In fact, there is relatively little research information on a number of key assessment issues. However, progress is being made.</P>

<P><B>Important Issues</B></P>

<P>A case in point is the national attention to new forms of assessments of student performance, assessments that use projects, experiments, essays, and portfolios rather than more familiar types of answer-sheet testing. These assessments require complex thinking, tasks with many steps, open-ended and creative answers, and reliance on the best ideas of subject matter and interdisciplinary experts. My colleagues at the National Center for Research and Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) will provide information on how valid some of these tests are for different uses. They also will provide guidelines to develop and validate similar measures. Already, we have results on history and science assessments that we believe will make performance assessment significantly more cost effective and valid.</P>

<P>But to begin to achieve the aspirations of the public for test information&#151;and to assure for ourselves and others that testing supports rather than impedes student learning&#151;additional questions require sustained attention. Questions such as:</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  How fair are performance assessments to children of different backgrounds? How do we assure that economically disadvantaged or limited English proficient, or other special populations, such as the learning disabled, are fairly treated?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  How is fairness influenced by different administrative and scoring procedures? How should comparability of assessment design, administration, and test results be determined?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  What is the impact of various kinds of instruction on these new assessments? Do they measure the things we wish to teach? What kinds of important learnings can be measured? How general or transferable is performance from project to project or assessment to other important accomplishments? How do these assessments predict readiness for the work force or postsecondary education?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  Are such assessments less or more corruptible than traditional tests? How trustworthy are our findings, and what steps can increase our confidence in test performance?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  Which, if any, multiple purposes of assessment can be served simultaneously with validity? Can an assessment contribute to teaching and learning and accountability? What is the impact of new assessments on students and the quality of life in school?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  What are the best ways for teachers to be involved in the design and use of new assessments? What ways are cost-effective? What ways contribute directly to student learning? How can the design of new assessments build upon our knowledge of thinking and learning?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  How should we measure students' ability to integrate across subject-matter areas? How should we measure their efforts, thinking processes, and habits of mind?</P>

<P><B>Q</B>:  How should we combine the range of assessment options before us to provide the best information, with the most positive consequences, and with reasonable costs?</P>

<P>Beyond the solutions to these problems, we must develop improved ways to communicate the results of student assessments to parents, to teachers, to the students themselves, and to the public at large. Some researchers believe that testing has developed in the manner it did in part because of reporting issues. Policymakers became used to easy, seemingly clear answers that depended on numbers such as an average score, a specific percentile, a grade level. Changing the basis of assessment to more concrete analyses of children's performance will change as well the kind of information policymakers and the public will be given.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT COLOR="0000FF" size=+1>The National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) is one of 25 national education research centers funded through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement. CRESST's mission is to improve methods of measuring student performance, focusing primarily on performance-based assessments such as portfolios, self-evaluations, student projects, student journals, and a variety of other non-standardized assessment techniques. The concept behind these new prototypes is to see how students actually perform, not just how well they test. For more information, write to CRESST/UCLA, Graduate School of Education, 405 Hilgard Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90024-1522.</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>Research on how to communicate complex information to the public is essential if real improvements in assessment are to be possible. We need to find ways to show details and realities of what children can do, rather than to rely exclusively on abstractions such as scores and averages. We must find ways to reach out to parents who need to have good information about their schools in a form that can support their children's growth and accomplishments.</P>

<P><B>Quality Control</B></P>

<P>Most of the research questions I've listed here are under study now; some of them will take considerable time to answer. All share a focus on student outcomes. I believe we must make a substantial effort to address still another class of questions about educational reform. We must focus the attention of scholars and talented practitioners on how to assess the quality of schooling itself. Clearly, under certain conditions, we can infer something about the quality of instruction from student performance.</P>

<P>But many of us worry that we have not paid enough attention to the quality of description of student experiences. Why should we expect children to do well in school&#151;and have high test scores or sparkling accomplishments&#151;if their schools are not safe places, or if they must worry about the security of the route they take on the way to and from school? Why should we expect children to excel, when they do not have challenging textbooks or enough of them to go around? How can students do homework without enough paper or technological support? To understand the results from any tests, whether multiple-choice or performance-based, we need to be able to make accurate statements about what school experiences are like. We need to look at school quality in a number of ways, to document excellence where we find it, to condition our understandings of student performance, and to identify the expectations of quality for all schools.</P>

<P><B>Contextual Considerations</B></P>

<P>During the 1991 meetings of the National Council on Education Standards and Testing, issues of school experiences and environments were discussed in at least two different ways. First, they were cast as school and system &#147;delivery standards,&#148; a framing which implied that agreement is possible on certain attributes of schools. In this role, standards would be set for educational institutions parallel to those expected for individual students. Second, school experiences were emphasized through descriptive information about school contexts (such as transiency), inputs (such as resources), and processes (such as time for learning). These were discussed as part of needed conditions before assessments were used for high-stakes purposes, such as promotion or graduation.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="4baker.gif" align=left hspace=10>Not surprisingly, the assessment of school processes was an extremely controversial topic during the Council meetings. To some, it implied a prescriptive or controlling function, a way to homogenize schools and classrooms from inside the beltway. To others, it conjured up horrors of more checklists, paperwork, and mandated but unread reports. But in intent&#151;the need to link explicitly school processes with student outcomes&#151;the direction of the discussion seemed appropriate to me. Both student outcomes and school processes must be documented: the first, to show the effects of our efforts; the second, to begin to assess responsibility for performance. Without a dual system, educational equity&#151;a major goal of all reform&#151;has little chance of success.</P>

<P><B>Technological Implications</B></P>
<P>
Where does technology fit in the standards and assessment reform efforts? Technology offers us more than the chance to make our assessments efficient. Even beyond the use of sophisticated multimedia projects to stimulate student thinking or to create products as we have seen in some of the Apple Classroom of Tomorrow research, technology has a special role to play in assessment. It may be the only means we have available for exploring certain capabilities of students. For example, at UCLA with Apple Computer, Inc., support, we have been working on computer-based assessments that attempt to get at students' conceptual understandings without exclusively relying on their ability to write. Students construct HyperCard databases or concept maps to illustrate the relationships among principles, facts, and conclusions. Other studies focus on database search strategies used by students as a measure of their familiarity with subject matter. Such strategies are potentially extremely important for students who don't have a firm grasp of English language skills but who, nonetheless, know a good deal about particular content areas.</P>

<P>Research is also under way in a variety of settings to explore the limits of automated scoring of students' work, including maps and essays. Looking at team simulations in the work force readiness area provides another example of how technology can further new opportunities for assessment in exciting ways. We also are exploring the use of authoring systems to develop performance assessments as a means of allowing greater teacher participation.</P>

<P><B>What Now?</B></P>

<P>If rhetoric and political interest is the standard, the prospects for improving our educational performance have never been more encouraging. But our transformation still has a way to go. To punch through rhetoric, to create world-class student performance, we need to design world-class schools-schools with commitments to technology, high-quality teaching, engaging materials, and sensible assessment. The assessment enterprise seems to many like the best place to start; but the challenges we have are so complicated, we probably need to start anywhere we can find energy, commitment, and enthusiasm. The fundamental message of new assessments is one that is essential to our future. We now say to our schools, our teachers, our kids: Show us what you can do.</P>

It was the third day of the CD-ROM Expo &#146;93 in Boston, and this 20-year veteran of instructional TV settled back in his seat to hear yet another presentation on the promise and growing profitability of CD-ROM technology. As in previous sessions, the panel presenters all seemed to be under 30 years of age and able to speak glibly of the arcana of cross-platform compatibility and asymmetrical CODECs. One in particular looked to be a clone of the ambiguous Bob Roberts character in the recent film of the same nametall, athletically lean, and clean shaven in a blue blazer and a conservative tie. The only off-key note was his sunglasses, which he never doffed, not even when the lights were dimmed to show his latest creation, a CD-ROM-driven interactive game titled &#147;Jump Raven.&#148;</P>

<P><B>This is Progress?</B><BR>
As the small silver platter began to spin, the projection screen exploded with energized pixels, and the stereo speakers pulsated with a techno-pop soundtrack. Immediately the audience was transported to a future urbanscape populated by gangs of vicious skinheads. To play in these mean streets, we were invited to join the local security force, which uses ground-skimming jet craft equipped with an arsenal of high-tech armaments. Up to this point, &#147;Jump Raven&#148; may sound like just another arcade game, but that is purely a fault of the shortcomings of prose. The product was a quantum leap from the quarter swallowers at the local mall, and no doubt it soon will dispatch the current generation of electronic games to the &#147;Donkey Kong&#148; scrap heap.</P>

<P>The instant interactivity of the disc permits players to communicate with a host of cyber puppets, sophisticated computer-animated characters that speak with the voices of actors. A click of the mouse or similar interface showers users with an initial battery of questions, sprinkled with profanity, concerning their suitability for the assignment; invites them to choose a copilot by interviewing a batch of &#147;A-Team&#148; wannabes&#151;including one woman, a bubble-headed valley girl (&#147;for sure&#133;&#148;); and transports them to the armory where they use an electronic catalog to shop for the perfect mix of powerful weapons. Just gearing up to play the game seemed to take a good six minutes.</P>

<P>Once the mission started, we soared past and around 3-D buildings, keeping perfect perspective, and blasted away at villains who appeared to have a similar arsenal at their disposal. The developer was proud to point out that, unlike other games on the market, these weapons and their destructive aftermath obeyed all the laws of physics, especially regarding shrapnel spread and secondary damage to buildings. It was at this point that my blood began to boil.</P>

<P>Here we were, on the threshold of a whole new generation of interactive technology, and we hadn't come all that far from the shoot-'em-up script of the very first film, 1903's <I>The Great Train Robbery</I>. The only key differences were color, sound, the interactive nature of the medium, and today's unstanched flow of blood in our streets and school yards. This is not progress.</P>

<P><B>The Return of Cynicism</B><BR>
While I don't subscribe to the magic bullet, cause-effect school of thought regarding violence in the media, I do believe that the media, from comic books to video games, share responsibility for the fearsome state in which we find ourselves. Adding easily modeled and realistic, violent enactments to the myriad pathologies born of poverty and fractured family life too often is like striking a spark to tinder.</P>

<P>On my return trip from Boston, I read in <I>USA Today</I> an FBI report that the number of youngsters under 18 arrested for homicide had soared more than 128 percent since 1983. Arrests for violent crime overall were up by 57 percent in the same 10-year period. The impact of this on education rattles through a recent Metropolitan Life study that reports 10 percent of teachers and nearly 25 percent of their students have been victims of violence in or near their public schools. If this trend isn't reversed soon, we'll someday feel like the time-tripping Jimmy Stewart character in <I>It's a Wonderful Life</I>. However, the nightmarishly brutal town we try to make sense of will be more like <I>Blade Runner's</I> decayed Los Angeles than the wanton Bedford Falls.</P>

<P>Beyond violence in the media, our seemingly endless propensity to take every new communications technology and warp it to serve the basest of motives looms large. David Sarnoff, one of the founders of RCA, had the hope in 1916 that the &#147;radio music box&#148; would be used for transmitting music to parlors or living rooms and for &#147;receiving lectures at home which can be made perfectly audible&#133;to farmers and others living in outlying districts removed from the cities.&#148; What a noble thought. But in 1994, our ears are assaulted by Howard Stern's broadcasts.</P>

<P>In 1925 Thomas Edison wrote of his invention, the motion picture projector: &#147;It may seem curious, but the money end of it never hit me the hardest. The feature that did appeal to me about the whole thing was the educational possibilities.&#148; Edison would have been hard put to glean any educational value from the multimillion-dollar hit, <I>RoboCop 3</I>.</P>

<P>In the early days of television, legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow remarked, &#147;This instrument can teach, can illuminate&#151;yes, it can even inspire&#151;but it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise, it is merely lights and wires in a box.&#148; What would Murrow have thought of MTV's &#147;Beavis and Butt-head&#148;?</P>

<P>Now we've done it again with CD-ROM technology, even before anyone of note has had time to wax poetically about its educational promise. Maybe cynicism has finally won out.</P>

<P><B>Whose Vision Is It, Anyway?</B><BR>
I don't mean to overreact. I know libraries already have exploited the capabilities of CD-ROM and use it for everything from an electronic card catalog to storage of full sets of encyclopedias.  And I know that there are some new educational applications, such as &#147;Who Built America?&#148; and &#147;Global Explorer,&#148; which combine video, audio, and graphics in exciting ways that are instructionally sound.</P>

<P>My point is this: Here we have the opportunity to shape a new medium, as in the early days of radio, film, and television. What we don't need are cyber puppets representing the worst stereotypes or breakthroughs in simulating on-screen explosions that obey the laws of physics as we learn how to kill and maim efficiently. Instead, our best and brightest techno wizards should be worrying about such things as how to teach children new ways of knowing and of constructing meaning by using transparent interfaces. Only in this way might pure content be manipulated, unhindered by the programmed limitations of mouse and icon.</P>

<P>Another thing we don't need is censorship. Grandstand plays like the December 1993 Senate hearings on violent video games rarely amount to much&#151;and I don't welcome the chilling effect they have on First Amendment rights.</P>

<P>Perhaps a partial answer to the problem lies in the Software Publishers Association's January 1994 proposal that they implement a four-tier rating system for games. Like Hollywood's movie ratings, this would put the onus on parents and ethical store owners to keep violent and sexually explicit software out of the hands of children age 17 and under.</P>

<P>However, a ratings system still begs the question. At this pivotal juncture in technology development, we require more from an industry than a defensive flanking movement. We need inspired leadership. For this generation of nascent Gutenbergs, we need a new Plato to sum them from screens of dark shadows to those of real substance and a new McLuhan to give them the vocabulary and the vision to understand the power and the promise of multimedia.</P>

<P>Film, video, and animated computer graphics fire still picture upon still picture in rapid sequence at our eyes and thus trick the mind into perceiving continuous movement. This phenomenon is known as &#147;persistence of vision.&#148; Would that Sarnoff's, Edison's, and Murrow's vision had been equally as persistent. </P>

<HR>

<P><B><I>Equity issues surrounding the use of technology in our schools go beyond just counting who has access to how many machines.  What good will it do to supply schools with the latest technological wonders if their potential isn't realized?  Sociologist Henry Becker says Americans can't afford the price we'll pay if we don't address quality of use as well as access&#151;and soon.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>It began with the telephone and the radio. Then the television. Then photocopiers, videotape recorders, personal computers, videodisc players, fax machines, CD-ROMs, and computer networks. A seemingly never-ending panoply of electronic devices exists for everyday people to receive and share information, ideas, attitudes, and emotions. Such devices are transforming not only our lives but also our consciousness itself&#151;what we think about ourselves and our world and, more important, how we think, learn, and communicate. It seems apparent that our lives are structured ever more closely around activities that derive at least part of their essential character from these information and communication technologies.</P>

<H4>Equity Is Elusive Everywhere</H4>
<P>Yet all societies, and the various social strata and social institutions within American society, are not equal participants in the cultural transformation that is occurring. On an international scope, televisions and telephones are still luxury commodities in the overwhelming majority of the world's communities. Indeed, we use our access to visual and print technologies to learn and in some sense to experience the limited resources and perspectives of other peoples in faraway parts of the globe. And although our own society provides nearly universal access to an immense variety of visual entertainments through electronic media, most consumers are largely passive participants. They use primarily one-way, receive-only technologies and select only marginally enriching content.</P>

<P>Unequal participation in this cultural transformation is also illustrated by the contrast between Western economies and formerly Soviet-dominated economies. During the last two decades, computer, telephone, and xerographic technologies have unmistakably transformed the operation of private and public enterprises in the West. In sharp contrast, the use of these technologies was carefully confined and restricted in Eastern European countries. This tight control may have been partly responsible for those nations' declining economic competitiveness as well as a widespread belief among their citizens that their societies were falling irreversibly further behind the West. As we now witness the loss of legitimacy of the existing regimes and the political collapse of the Soviet Union, we are seeing, in part, the result of withheld and unused capacity to use modern information and communication technologies.</P>

<H4>Economics, Communication, Education</H4>
<P>A similar contrast could be drawn between the extent to which information and communication technologies have affected the operation of government and business in the &#147;modern&#148; nations of America, Europe, and the Far East and the extent to which they have affected the operation of teaching and learning in schools in those countries.</P>

<P>In all of these countries, including the United States, a fair description of technology use by teachers and students would report that few classrooms have direct access by telephone to the outside world and only a small minority of classrooms have regular and sustained access to full-motion video or television. Furthermore, although much has been written about the invasion of microcomputers and the spread of computer laboratories in schools, a typical classroom where students get most instruction still lacks any computers at all. Where computers are present inside the classroom rather than in a separate computer lab, there are so few that students must take turns over a course of a day or week or be content most of the time to watch others use the computer keyboard.</P>

<P>We will be more likely to understand the impact of technology if we ask the right questions. Rather than asking how many schools have VCRs, we should ask, &#147;At any one time, what portion of students are engaged in learning based on the material viewed through video?&#148; I expect the answer would be a very minimal fraction. The same could be said for computers, televisions, and, of course, telephones.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="1becker2.gif" align=left hspace=10>It would not be an exaggeration to say that, based on any statistical snapshot one might take of activities that occupy students and teachers at any one time, as an institution the American school is about as much based on the use of 20th-century technologies as are the economies of Eastern Europe. And that raises what may seem at first to be an absurd question: Will the same fate happen to our schools as befell the polities of Eastern Europe? Will they become seen as structures that are hopelessly outdated and uncompetitive for providing the kinds of educational experiences needed to prepare our youth for the next century?</P>

<H4>But, Can They Use It?</H4>
<P>Of course, the parallel cannot be drawn too far. In contrast to the leadership of the communist states which feared disbursing information technology throughout their economies and societies, administrators of schools and school districts dearly desire to have their organizations become modernized through technology. Indeed, the presence of such media serves as a public indicator of &#147;up-to-dateness&#148; important in the school administrator's political context. More defensibly, technology's presence appears to be useful as a focus of school pride and as a motivator to students and teachers alike.</P>

<P>But whether schools will survive the challenge to their competitiveness as educational institutions depends on more than the &#147;show&#148; value of their technology apparatus. The real question is whether technologies are providing distinct academic benefits to the students in school. Are they focusing students' attention and effort on intellectual questions? Are they helping them understand ideas or create intellectual products? Are they providing a medium through which they can develop the skills needed to function in an organizationally complex world?</P>

<P>No doubt, part of the problem is one of numbers. Without a density of technology that is sufficient to support classrooms of students in systematic and frequent work, what we have is merely a taste of what is possible with technology. But even with enough equipment and high quality software and programming, it is quite possible for teachers to use technology without any academic benefit. They may show videos or have students use computers simply because it is a manifestly &#147;educational&#148; activity. Whether or not they have important consequences for student learning, such activities occupy a good bit of time and can be done with little preparation or effort. The impact of computer or video use on student understanding and competence is likely to be minimal if that use is not related to ongoing organized lessons and other learning activities.</P>

<H4>Transforming Culture Through Technology</H4>
<P>It is only when technology becomes a seamlessly integrated part of organized lessons that a cultural transformation within schools will be accomplished. This cultural transformation is now under way in some classroom settings where teachers use video materials to introduce and to structure subsequent active learning tasks and where computer software is used as a tool in a larger non-technology-centered effort to help students accomplish understanding or to produce a shareable intellectual product. But such integral uses of technology are hardly the norm.</P>

<P>From this point of view, the question of equity of access to technologies is not adequately addressed merely by examining whether black and white children or rich and poor adolescents are equally likely to be schooled where computers or televisions or video recorders are present. The critical questions about equity are about equal access to effective uses of technologies.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="1becker.gif" align=right hspace=10>We know, for example, that U.S. schools in poor districts or schools with a majority-black student enrollment have 10 to 12 percent fewer computers than other schools. We know that high school vocational classes in those schools are less likely to involve computer use. And we know that elementary and middle school teachers in poor-district/majority-black schools focus more student effort on math facts and language arts mechanics and spend less time teaching students word processing or how computers work.</P>

<P>Even more significantly, perhaps, a 1989 Center for Social Organization of Schools survey of school computer coordinators found that only half as many elementary teachers in poor district/majority-black schools were judged to be &#147;expert in using instructional software&#148; as in other elementary schools. In addition, at the high school level, only half as many teachers were reported to be &#147;competent at using software for their own professional use.&#148; The greatest discrepancy in this survey data was that at the elementary level, a truly &#147;exemplary&#148; computer-using teacher could be found among teachers in poor-district/majority-black schools only one-third as often as in other elementary schools. No data gathered since has refuted these findings.</P>

<P>But the more critical fact is that this survey of computer use found only 3 percent of all elementary school teachers to be &#147;exemplary&#148; computer users at all&#151;and that was using a fairly liberal set of criteria. Should we worry that the percentage in predominantly black or poor elementary schools was only one-third as much? Isn't it more important to be concerned that the overall percentages are so low? Perhaps we should be satisfied that the percentage of &#147;exemplary&#148; computer-using teachers among secondary science teachers was actually a bit higher in poor and majority-black schools than it was overall. But how can we be unconcerned when the overall level, a disappointing 2 percent, was so low?</P>

<H4>Making the Case</H4>
<P>We must remember that the vast majority of schools are yet at a very early stage in their ability to make information and communication technologies an important tool in teaching and learning. Few teachers and classes have access to information-rich technology-based resources such as huge libraries of videodisc compendia of 20th century events, encyclopedias on CD-ROM that are searchable at comparatively lightning speeds, or national and international linkages for conducting cooperative learning projects in which real-world data are used. Even more important, efforts to build useful lesson plans and curriculum units that profitably make use of all of these information and communications resources&#151;as well as the staff development efforts required to demonstrate to teachers how this can all be used with clearly beneficial effects on student learning&#151;have hardly begun at all.</P>

<P>It is certainly true that there are major resource inequalities among schools in the United States and that these inequalities are reinforcing rather than ameliorating the differences in private wealth that exist among different groups in this country. Indeed, the likelihood is that these differences will grow even larger in the current political climate which favors private aggrandizement and narrowly defined communities of common interest over a concern for the less educated and less viable segments of our society, such as the poverty-stricken older inner cities of the Midwest and Northeast.</P>

<P>But the most important issue confronting the technology advocacy community is to demonstrate&#151;with the kind of strong evidence that would convince a skeptical audience&#151;that these exciting media do have important consequences for student competencies when they are intelligently used in schools. Yes, it is important for schools to become more active participants in the technological revolution imbedding itself in our culture. Yes, it is important to attend to issues of inequality of opportunity that differential access to technology brings. But it is most important that we build and demonstrate successful consequences for investing in technology. For it is that demonstration and proof that makes the other two concerns significant.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>A Matter of Respect: Copyright Law and New Technologies</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Ivan R. Bender</H3>
<HR>


<P><I><B>New technologies such as multimedia, interactive video, and satellite transmission are exciting tools that allow students and teachers to produce their own educational materials. By borrowing text and photos from printed books, motion video from film and television, and audio from recordings, today's educators can provide custom-made classroom materials. But these capabilities raise new issues concerning copyright. What's a media specialist or teacher to do? Copyright attorney Ivan Bender explains the law and points out the necessity for respecting it in this era of technological wizardry.</B></I></P>
<BR>

<P>Copyright&#151;the body of federal law that protects intellectual property&#151;is mostly misunderstood by the group of people who should have the greatest understanding and appreciation of the subject. That group is educators, from heads of colleges and universities to media specialists, librarians, and classroom instructors.</P>

<P>This situation is probably the principle reason why the demand for copyright workshops, articles on the subject, and copyright information services has increased over the past few years. Add another ingredient&#151;the burgeoning of new technologies&#151;and you have all that's necessary for a piquing of curiosity.</P>

<P>Let the reader beware: The issues raised in this article are only a selected few involving copyright law. Many other complicated problems of copyright are beyond the scope of what is discussed here. This article attempts to begin the process of better understanding, but the author takes no blame if it raises more questions than it answers. For in truth, there may be no clear answers for many of the questions, no matter what degree of expertise one may possess.</P>

<P><B>Rights</B></P>

<P>To begin any discussion of copyright, we must understand the rights granted under the present law to the person or entity that claims ownership in a copyright.</P>

<P>These rights, simply put, are as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>The right to make copies or authorize others to reproduce the work</P></LI>

<LI><P>The right to revise, abridge, translate, or otherwise create derivative works based upon the original</P></LI>

<LI><P>The right to distribute the work by any means, such as selling, licensing, or other methods of distribution</P></LI>

<LI><P>The right to perform the work publicly</P></LI>

<LI><P>The right to display the work publicly.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P>Although fairly straightforward, all of these rights can lend themselves to extensive discussion. And there are several exceptions to these sole rights that are of interest to educators. Indeed, many of the exceptions are not readily available to persons engaged in activities outside the educational community.</P>

<P>When the present law was debated by Congress during the 1970s and lobbied extensively by representatives of both authors and users (principally educational users), advanced technology was not much of a factor&#151;certainly not by today's standards. Videotape was in its infancy; audiotape was just beginning to emerge as significant when the manufacturers settled upon a single standard; and computers, too, were products of an infant industry. The law became effective on January 1, 1978, and all of us who were involved in the revision process patted one another on the back and felt that, at long last, we had a law with which we could live for many years. Indeed, we thought we would have to live with it for a long while, considering that the last prior total revision of the copyright laws of the United States had been completed in 1909.</P>

<P><B>Challenges</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="3bender.gif" align=right hspace=10>Distance learning, interactive video, laserdisc combined with computer programming, the combination of motion video and text with statistical data, and the storing of these materials together for later use are among the new technologies that now pose challenges for us. The 1978 law may or may not address all of these challenges directly. But it is law, and it must be complied with, just as it must in the case of older technologies.</P>

<P>Distance learning perhaps has existed in some form or another since the development of the means of transmitting images for specialized purposes from one point to another. Today, however, the term is applied to the control by an educational institution or other entity of what is transmitted and to whom it is transmitted. What really makes it distinct from the older methods is technological advances in transmission opportunities. Many states now have divisions in their departments of education that control the transmission of classroom sessions to various points within the state. In addition, many colleges and universities have expanded and modernized their transmission capabilities in order to provide services to students off campus and at auxiliary campuses.</P>

<P>It does not matter, from a copyright standpoint, which distance learning technology is utilized. Rather, if material copyrighted by another party&#151;with the exception in certain instances of nondramatic works&#151;is used for transmission purposes, a license from the copyright holder or its agent is necessary for the transmission containing the material to be lawful. The method of transmission does, however, affect the license fee, since many factors must be taken into consideration&#151;open versus closed circuit, satellite delivery, and size of the viewing audience, for instance.</P>

<P>That exception for nondramatic works is important to distance learning. If a transmission involves the performance or display of a nondramatic literary or musical work&#151;something other than a play, opera, musical, or other work that is designed to be publicly performed&#151;and if no reproduction is involved, the performance is lawful without a license. Such a performance would be a case in which a teacher, acting as a lecturer, reads from the work or displays it in the form of illustrations or charts on an overhead projector. To qualify for this exemption, the entity responsible for the transmission must be a nonprofit educational institution, and the transmission must be part of the regular instructional activities of the institution. Also, the transmission must be made primarily for reception in classrooms.</P>

<P><B>Fair Use</B></P>

<P>One of the most important exceptions to the right of a copyright owner is fair use. When the copyright law was enacted, groups of educators&#151;particularly librarians, classroom teachers, and music educators&#151;were able to agree on fair use guidelines for the photocopying of print materials and music for classroom purposes. In addition, after the law was enacted, Congress successfully convened interest groups to develop guidelines for off-air videotaping for classroom use, again under the fair-use umbrella.</P>

<P>One new technology in need of fair-use guidelines is multimedia, in which educators and students develop materials utilizing motion pictures in computer-based programs at schools and colleges. The user is able to view the combined product as part of an entire instructional program. This technology, especially with digital compression becoming more highly developed, puts additional pressures on the interests of copyright owners of the video material. As technology continues to improve the images that are retrieved, the need for legal access to copyrighted works will increase.</P>

<P>The term multimedia can mean several things, but the one element common to the concept is that it can bring together a variety of intellectual properties. For example, a program may utilize text, still pictures, sound, and video that can be called up on the computer by selecting the appropriate stored portions. The term applies not only to interactive video but also to other computer-based instructional materials.</P>

<P>Rather than seeking a revision in the law at this time to cover these new capabilities, one prominent educational organization, the Consortium of College and University Media Centers, is embarking upon a project to develop guidelines that would provide ground rules for access. These guidelines would further define the limits of fair use, beyond which permission from copyright owners would be required. The primary goal is to remove doubts about the legalities of the use of motion pictures or video in multimedia instructional materials, but the guidelines also will protect the interests of copyright owners.</P>

<P><B>Responsibility</B></P>

<P>In my professional life as counsel to media producers and as a representative of educational institutions, I have seen dramatic change over the years in both technology and the law. The technology has expanded from textbooks, films, and captioned filmstrips to computers, video-recorders, CD-ROM, and other sophisticated means of transmitting information.</P>

<P>One thing that hasn't changed is the fact that copyright is a property right, and those engaged in the business of buying and using copyrighted works must always remember that the acquisition of such works does not carry with it the right to infringe. Those who assume the mantle of administrator of educational institutions and those who assume the burden of teaching cannot abrogate their responsibility to perform those roles with a strong sense of ethics and morality. Respecting copyright is an important part of that responsibility.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/bios/eboyer.gif" align=right hspace=10>
<B><I>Ernest Boyer has been President of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching since 1979, having served previously as U.S. Commissioner of Education under President Jimmy Carter. Prior to that appointment, he was Chancellor of the 64-campus system of the State University of New York. A fellow of the American Academy of the Arts, Boyer was awarded the Charles Frankel Prize in the Humanities, a Presidential Citation, in 1994. During his tenure at the Carnegie Foundation, Boyer authored landmark research reports, most notably:</I> High School: A Report on Secondary Education in America <I>(1983);</I> College: The Undergraduate Experience <I>(1987); and</I> Ready to Learn: A Mandate for the Nation <I>(1991). His most recent book, The Basic School: A Community for Learning (1995), which has a wide range of recommendations for strengthening elementary schools, has met with an 'overwhelmingly positive national reaction.'</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><B><I>So much of </I>The Basic School <I>is common sense and not terribly expensive to implement.</I></B></P>

<P>Well, that's true. I really do think that, while certainly we should have research and development in education as in all other fields, the reform movement has been inclined to act as if we don't know what works, and if we're only successful and clever enough, we'll find by the year 2000 some panacea that will answer the problems&#151;when, in fact, educators, school teachers, and others know what can be effective in the classroom. We've tended to ignore what are common sense approaches that we really do understand can lead to effective education. The exciting part of the report, at least for me, is that when we spent several years in schools, we kept discovering these practices at work&#151;not always in a comprehensive way&#151;but every proposal we make in this report is drawn from something that we observed and some practices that we saw were effective in local schools.</P>

<P><B><I>Is there going to be something coming out of the Carnegie Foundation called the Basic School effort?</I></B></P>

<P>We're not typically in the business of following up reports in an implementing fashion&#151;we're a policy center; we're not an action center. But we've been asked to stay with it now that we've proposed the idea. So we followed our report with the establishment of a Basic School Network. At the moment, we have 15 schools that are working together; we selected them very carefully to make sure they represented the broadest cross section of elementary schools in the country. We have a New York City school, an Indian reservation school, a school that's primarily Hispanic in south Texas, and several non-public schools. And they're working together intensively to try to implement in a comprehensive way the elements of the Basic School. We've had such an overwhelming response to the report, even in the advance copy stage, that we've established an office at Princeton University to accommodate what appears to be a national commitment to this report that we want to serve as well. So, in addition to this core group of schools, we're going to be developing a program to provide services&#151;including perhaps newsletters and videotapes&#151;to respond to other schools that literally by the hundreds have been calling to ask how they can participate&#151;including several states that have already indicated they want to go statewide. One of the requests they make more frequently is how they could stay in touch with other schools that are working together on the priorities of the report.</P>

<P><B><I>Have you considered setting up an electronic network for the Basic Schools?</I></B></P>

<P>That's one of the first steps we're taking. We've established  through the National Association of Elementary School Principals office in Arlington, Virginia, a Basic Schools access point through America Online. Anyone in the Network, in fact, anyone nationwide who wants to know more about the Basic School and participate in a conversation, will have access to that. We'll be putting in information on a regular basis to tell about new developments, but more importantly, schools can communicate directly with each other. The electronic network will probably be one of the most effective ways in which this conversation about the Basic School can move forward on a rapid, daily basis. One of the first steps we took was to make sure the schools have modems and access. Last summer, we met with administrators and teachers from our core network, and one part of that workshop was to instruct them on how to use the Basic School electronic network. We've helped them purchase the technology that will make it possible for each school to be electronically connected.</P>

<P><B><I>What about the high cost of implementing technology? Is that something the Foundation is prepared to subsidize?</I></B></P>

<P>Each school in the Network is given a small grant each year from us. Actually, the idea of establishing the Basic School Network is supported by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Missouri, which gave us a generous grant because it believes in the comprehensiveness as well as the priorities of the report. As a result, we were able to give each school a small grant to be used in any way. Some have used it for teacher development, and some have used it to purchase the technology hardware that they needed in order to be a part of the Network.</P>

<P>But the Basic School is not a high-cost institution. It's an idea. And many of the best practices we talk about in the report are common sense approaches and can be done without a major financial investment. The one area that, over the long term, would call for some investment is that of technology. We strongly stress building schools that for the 21st century are prepared to take advantage of the absolutely marvelous capacity that technology teaching provides. We know that many of the schools are not there now, although several schools in our Network are using state-of-the-art technology. Moving to make technology very much a part of teaching will take resources, but the first step is to develop a plan to get there and not try to do it all at once.</P>

<P><B><I>What are your thoughts on the recent federal budget cuts in the area of funding for the arts and humanities?</I></B></P>

<P>In <I>The Basic School</I> we define the arts as one of the essential languages. It seems absolutely clear to me that the arts represent one of our most effective ways of communicating with each other. Every culture throughout human history has been defined as civilized to the extent that it has sustained language and the arts and the beauty of ceramics, of painting and drawing, of music and dance. So we know it's fundamental to a civilized society; we know it's fundamental to the quality of our own lives. And yet, we continue to view it as a frill. Why we deny it to our children is incomprehensible to me because if it's denied, children are impoverished. In <I>The Basic School</I> we say that language includes the words we use, the numbers we use, and the arts we use, and these are simply variations of symbol systems that allow us to communicate with each other. So, the school we're proposing is a school where the arts are basic. Incidentally, this means that it should be woven through the entire school and not something you tack on an hour at the end of the week. Every lesson can be artistic.</P>

<P><B><I>Won't we have to teach our teachers to teach differently? Isn't it like writing across the curriculum&#151;arts across the curriculum?</I></B></P>

<P>Exactly. This is true. I think one of the reasons the arts have been diminished is that teachers themselves have not felt comfortable. Their inclination is to feel that they're not artists, and frankly very few teacher-training programs indicate the arts as a language, so teachers are taught in a more formal content way and don't see the arts as having this power and potential. But I believe every elementary teacher can be an effective teacher in the arts, just as we expect every elementary teacher to be an effective teacher with language or with mathematics.</P>

<P><B><I>As a former U.S. Commissioner of Education, what do you think of the talk about abolishing the Department of Education?</I></B></P>

<P>There's an interesting irony to this, because I was the last Commissioner before it became a department, so I went through the debate in the 1970s as to whether it <B>should</B> become a department. At the time, I was Commissioner within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under Secretary Joseph Califano. When President Carter proposed that education become a separate department, I thought it was a good move because it gave education&#151;in the best sense&#151;a symbolic status as having as much importance as health or agriculture or commerce or labor or all the other major national interests that had status at the Cabinet level. And as I thought about education in our society, it seemed to me that it clearly was as consequential to our future as were those other Cabinet-level posts. Now, that doesn't mean that I think the federal government can or should take over education, any more than it should take over labor or commerce or the environment or housing. In fact, I don't think federal government should become engaged directly in running education. Rather, it should make sure that education is continuously brought to the national attention as a part of the national public debate. It would be a step back to abolish the Department, to remove that voice from the Cabinet level, and to dismantle these programs and scatter them around in pockets of departments here and there, which would make the administration of them less effective.</P>

<P><B><I>You wrote about what you called 'good corporate citizenship' in</I> The Basic School<I>. What responsibility do you think business and industry have to help American education?</I></B></P>

<P>First, the business community has been an important part of the school renewal effort of the past decade. I'm amazed and deeply satisfied that in the past 10 years the CEOs of some of our largest corporations have become some of the strongest voices for public education and for some of the programs to enrich the schools. They've testified before Congress; they've supported Head Start; they've understood the need that if we don't have good schools, we can't have strong industry and strong business. Their voices have mattered more than school superintendents and others in the education field. So I'd like to celebrate the leadership that The Business Roundtable, the National Alliance of Business, and others have given&#151;their voices have been powerful, and they've been heard by politicians at the highest level.</P>

<P>At the same time, I think businesses have to recognize that they have another role to play. They must realize that they're part of the partnership with local schools because their employees are also parents. We talk a lot in our report about parents as partners&#151;there's just no way to build a good school without family and parental engagement, since parents are the first and most effective teachers. And if we don't build that partnership, schools can't do it alone; you can't have an island of excellence in a sea of community indifference. That means, however, that parents have to have time periodically to meet with teachers and to be with schools. So we're suggesting in this report that employers have to consider that they need a family-friendly work policy that allows parents periodically to be engaged with children.</P>

<P>One suggestion is that the first day of school should be a time of national celebration. Parents should be with the child all day to show that the partnership is going to be strengthened and not weakened. I think it's appropriate to suggest that employers give parents time off with pay that first day of school to spend time with their children. Not all employers could do this. But what is encouraging is that some businesses are doing it. And some states, such as California and Massachusetts, allow workers several days off each year to work more closely with the schools.</P>

<P><B><I>Dr. Boyer, what do you think the purpose of education is? Is it just to train people for the workplace?</I></B></P>

<P>Historically, education in this country has had a civic function, before it had an economic function. We saw that if we hoped to build a democracy, we needed to have an education that was broad-based, and we determined it had to be universal. Every one of our Founding Fathers knew that if we wanted to move toward a government that was run by the people, they had to be enlightened. Surely, they have to work; surely, they have to be responsible as producers as well as consumers. But the larger purpose of education in this country is always driven by the fact that we need people to be civically engaged, intellectually and educationally well informed, or else we were opening the doors to tyranny. That's what Jefferson was talking about and why, in 1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony said every town or village of 50 or more citizens had to hire a school teacher to teach children to read and write.</P>

<P>Certainly we want a well-trained workforce, but it would be a total miscalculation to say that schools simply drive the economic engine. Our economy can't survive if we don't have the structures of good government to keep it sustained. Education has both civic and economic&#151;and ethical and moral&#151;dimensions. Those would be the three legs on the education stool that I feel are absolutely crucial, and one should not overshadow the other.</P>

<P><B><I>There's a great deal of emphasis on values in your book. Do you feel you're walking a tightrope between the Right and the Left about whether the schools should be teaching such things?</I></B></P>

<P>No. I felt strongly that we could not write a report about the elementary school without talking about the virtues that are critical to a good life. I've felt for years that schools have been intimidated and therefore too timid about recognizing the obvious: that you cannot give information without knowledge and knowledge without wisdom. There is throughout history abundant evidence that people who are well informed but not driven by a sense of ethics can do mischievous and heinous things, so that maybe the most dangerous condition is to be well-educated but ethically misdirected. That's giving power toward tyranny. We have tragic examples in recent history of how knowledge has led to human devastation. So education has to be concerned about its ethical and moral dimensions. I couldn't write a report about schooling without dealing with that, but as you say, this most essential issue has been somehow so politicized that people are uncomfortable even talking about it. But the more we worked on the issue, the more I thought this timidity was unfounded. There is in our society almost universal consensus around what we identify as the seven core virtues, which we think are appropriate for every school and every child; these are consensus values that no one finds unacceptable, such as honesty, respect, responsibility, and perseverance. There might be variations on these themes&#151;I don't mean that the ones that we've chosen are the exact words or the only ones. We do recognize that there are contested values in our society&#151;we don't agree on everything. So we caution against a school moving into the contested areas, if it doesn't have some support in the community that surrounds it. Schools can't resolve these issues that the larger community hasn't resolved.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/3boyerbook.gif" align=left hspace=10>

<P><B><I>How would you suggest the Basic Schools maintain contacts with the outer world as they look toward themselves and their own communities to determine their values?</I></B></P>

<P>We've organized a curriculum around the eight characteristics that make us truly human. And we say that the content typically taught through the subjects and the academic fields in schools today can be fitted within these eight integrative themes. The value of this would be that children could not only study the content of the disciplines but also understand that what they're learning relates to their own lives. And third, they'd be able to think about what the human community is beyond themselves. The human commonalities allow students to study their own specific location and to make comparative studies with other cultures that have similarities in the large sense but have differences in the way they apply them. So while we might all share the life cycle, for instance, the way that it's lived out in different societies will vary. While we're all connected to nature, the way children in Manhattan are connected to it is not the same way that my grandchildren in Belize are connected to it. In this way, students are able to study locally and globally and to gain a perspective about the human experience that's not built around governments but around the way people actually live.</P>

<P>Incidentally, as our own nation becomes more diversified, that sense of differences within commonalities is crucial. I can't stress enough my belief that while we need to understand diversity in this culture, and diversity around the world, we need also to understand that we're sharing an experience together and to reinforce our connections to each other&#151;or I don't think we'll be able to hold ourselves together, or as part of a global community. That is a centerpiece of what the Basic School is all about.</P>

<P><B><I>And to help the child in New York City learn what it's like in Belize, technological connections can help.</I></B></P>

<P>Well, that is almost a benediction. One of the marvelous potentials of this new electronic capacity is the way we can create a global network, where children who are studying in Manhattan can also be communicating instantly with children in Australia. For the first time in human history, we can create a global classroom. Nothing could be more exhilarating in building a sense of international relationships than to take advantage of this new capacity to communicate with each other. And that is one of our greatest prospects for not only better education but also better human understanding.</P>

<P>I do believe one of the most important, unfinished agendas&#151;and the urgency is increasing&#151;is to find a better way to utilize the new technologies effectively. They should become so embedded in the work of teachers and students that they enrich and extend the curriculum naturally. And that, to me, is one of the great unmet challenges. If we could make that connection, we'd have the best educated generation within a decade. The failure to do that, I think, will cause schools to be increasingly obsolete. There's nothing more urgent than to find a way for the enrichment that can come through the new electronic tools to be  embedded authentically within teaching and learning. If that happens, I think we'll see excitement and motivation and knowledge exponentially expanded, always guided by insights under the direction of a wise and sensitive teacher.</P>

<P><B><I>You mentioned your grandchildren&#151;what would you like them to think of as your legacy?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, I'd have to start at the family level. Will Durant said that the family is the nucleus of civilization, and I agree with that. So, I would hope that I would be seen by my grandchildren as a loving family member. As to my professional work, I would hope they would see this work as caring profoundly for children above all else. I'm concerned not about schools, but about children, and I think that our most important challenge in America is to try to create a public love for children. I would hope they'd also see my deep belief that schooling, public education, is one of our most important social institutions and that it's never perfect but that we should give our time and effort to sustain it for the sake of the children and our future. And finally, I would hope that growing out of our report, they would see that I believed education meant more than knowledge&#151;that it meant moving from information to knowledge and from knowledge to wisdom and from competence to conscience&#151;and that in the end, it's not simply becoming more informed but becoming capable of living a better life and directing your energy toward humane ends. I want them to know that our purposes here are to be of service to others and not just to be selfishly directed.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>From Lean-and-Mean Times to the Millennium</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="/ait-bin/final_exam.htm">Gerald W. Bracey</A>, Ph.D., AIT Distinguished Fellow</H3>
<HR>

<P>I am honored to be here today and to be named the first AIT  Distinguished Fellow. I hope the book which the Fellowship has commissioned will be worthy of AIT's faith. I am pleased to be here today because I am pleased to be anywhere where I see progress in the use of information technology in education. For the most part, I do not see much progress&#151;and that is depressing&#151;but there are small signs that I think are noteworthy.</P>

<P><B>Lean, Mean Times</B><BR>
Why are things moving so slowly? There are several reasons.</P>

<P>One reason is simply the age of people who run school districts. I learned how to program computers in 1961, but that is rare for my age group. I recall that in the well-regarded school district where I recently worked, all the senior administrators had powerful machines on their desks that were usually turned off. Administrators feel too harried to take the time to learn what technology offers and so make weak advocates. Progress will occur when people my age and older retire.</P>

<P>And then there is the sad history of previous technologies in education. Despite the efforts of pioneers such as AIT, many teachers failed to understand the potential of technology to support instruction. The use of any technology in the classroom has always been marginal, and some have argued that computers would be just another gimmick that would end up in the closet. Into this decade, one systems-analyst friend of mine referred to Apple machines as &#147;Fisher-Price computers.&#148; I was no great fan of technology until the late 1970s, when personal computers arrived. All previous technologies had put children in a passive role, but these new ones offered the possibility of interaction, of active learning. These machines are a technology precisely for learning.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/4bracey.gif" align=right hspace=10><I>Technology-based instructional materials can be used to motivate students to learn and to help them develop critical thinking skills.</I></P>

<P>Then there is money. These are lean times. Although the United States bought into information technology much more quickly than other nations, that technology remains peripheral and thin in many schools. Using grocery receipts to obtain computers is not the best way of making them central to the budget or to instruction. And, as happens with technological adaptations, those who are on the leading edge initially find themselves behind later. So it is that most of our hardware is obsolete. We have not built into budgets the process for acquiring technology, much less for replacing a technology that ages rapidly.</P> 

<P>Money has also hindered software development. Until recently, software producers did not see the market for educational programs that they could envision for, say, a word processor or a spreadsheet. Educators, not seeing good software, stayed out of the market. That vicious cycle, happily, is coming to an end.</P>

<P>There is also a conservative tenor of this age that is depressing the sense of progress. These are mean times. Everyone is declaring war and using precisely that phrase: &#147;declare war.&#148; Pat Robertson and his Christian Coalition have declared war on the larger culture. Jerry Falwell has emerged from relative seclusion to declare war on the anti-Christians among us (and to predict the end of the world soon). At the secular level, some feel that Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, with the publication of their book, <I>The Bell Curve</I>, have declared war both on the poor and on social reform, perhaps even on the notion of universal education. The Hudson Institute has declared war on those who do not share its conservative ideology. Said Institute fellow and former Assistant Secretary of Education Chester E. Finn, Jr.&#151;who was described in <I>The Washington Times</I> as the Hudson Institute's &#147;bombthrower&#148;&#151;&#147;It is an intellectual, conceptual, and ideological war.&#148; An age that welcomes innovations requires more optimism and civility.</P>

<P><B>Progress Toward the Millennium</B><BR>
So the millennium is not at hand. Still, there are hopeful signs.</P>

<P>For the first time ever, the U.S. Department of Education has appointed a special assistant for information technology, a result, no doubt, of the youthfulness of the administration and its technological with-itness.</P>

<P>In San Rafael, California, the George Lucas Education Foundation is working to produce educational materials and programs. A friend of mine who is on the advisory board of the Foundation says that the group is just the kind of young, bright, creative bunch that might produce some breakthroughs.</P>

<P>The Mecklenburger Group, a loose national coalition of technologically oriented consultants founded by former National School Boards Association Director of Technology Transfer James Mecklenburger, is developing the concept of Global Village Schools, with deliberate allusion to Marshall McLuhan. This group, with which I am affiliated, has held one conference on the topic, which was attended by some 500 educators&#151;including Michael Sullivan, AIT's executive director. We have a second conference scheduled for April, and Jim is predicting more than 1,000 persons will attend. If we could get that kind of geometric expansion at each meeting, we'd see things happen soon.</P>

<P>Finally, a number of research studies have shown that, even when teachers and students use the relatively dated computers that we have in schools, over time the use of these computers alters their behavior in ways that many reformers favor. The results, obtained by different researchers using different methodologies, are remarkably similar. Teachers become more like coaches; students become more independent. Teachers take more risks; students get more involved. Teachers do less whole-group lecturing; students collaborate more. We can expect this good news to spread.</P>

<P>So progress is being made. We simply need for organizations such as AIT and individuals such as yourselves to ensure that it continues.</P>

<P><B><I>Your teenager can program your VCR for you.  But he can't get an acceptable SAT verbal score to be admitted to the college of his choice.  Sound familiar?  These are just two manifestations of a new generation gap, one that owes its existence to the swift technological advances of this century.  But Jerry Bracey's not surprised.  He predicts even lower SAT verbal scores than those of recent years, unless we amend our definition of literacy to include icons and images rather than just printed words.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>A prediction: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) verbal scores will continue to fall.</P>

<P>An assertion: It won't matter.</P>

<P>Yet another assertion: Our current definition of &#147;literacy&#148; is inadequate.</P>

<P>And finally: What we are seeing in lower SAT verbal scores is not the decline and fall of American education but yet another technology-induced transformation of consciousness. The technologies involved this time are multimedia, hypermedia integrated learning systems.</P>

<P><B>Laboring Toward an Explanation</B></P>

<P>The fall of average SAT scores has been front page news since the report of a panel headed by former U.S. Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz that studied the decline that had taken place between 1963 and 1977.* The Wirtz panel attributed about three-fourths of the decline up to 1970 to changes in the demographics of who was taking the test, then found dozens of reasons for the later decline: television, family breakup, Watergate, Vietnam&#151;generally what it termed a &#147;decade of distraction.&#148;</P>

<P><SMALL>(*See <I>On Further Examination: Report of the Advisory Panel on the Scholastic Aptitude Test Score Decline</I>, Willard Wirtz, Chairman of the Panel, published by The College Entrance Examination Board, New York, 1977.)</SMALL></P>

<P>I have argued elsewhere that the more recent decline has been caused largely by continuing changes in who is taking the test. The average scores on the SAT were set at 500 using an elite group of all-white, mostly male students in the Northeast. As the baby boom passed, colleges switched from selecting students to recruiting them and now are digging ever more deeply into the talent pool. While the number of high school seniors has declined every year since 1977, college enrollment has risen from 11 million to 14 million. Women, who average about 40 points lower than men on the math section, now make up 52 percent of white test takers, and a substantial portion of test takers come from low-income families. In addition, minority students now make up 28 percent of the test takers.</P>

<P>I am convinced, however, that there is something more at work in the decline of the SAT verbal scores than just demographic shifts. The percent of students scoring above 600 on the SAT verbal also fell in the mid-seventies from 11.4 to 7.2 percent. Since the number of test takers has remained virtually constant, this fall cannot be the result of adding more students at the low end of the scale. Moreover, scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading tests corroborate the SAT results: The percentage of students scoring high on NAEP reading has also declined somewhat.</P>

<P>The lay public, abetted, even led by the media, have taken the SAT decline as an indictment of schools. I have even seen it written that the decline constitutes a threat to civilization as we know it. When the SAT was introduced in 1926, its developers ascribed modest goals for it, given the difficulty of predicting anything about human beings. In the years since, it has somehow evolved into a platinum rod, the immutable standard by which schools are evaluated. This is foolish, even dangerous.</P>

<P>Moreover, analysts have generally ignored the fact that SAT math scores have fallen little at all. Most of the decline is in the verbal section. Looking at only the aggregate averages, the verbal score has fallen three times as far as the math score. If the schools are at fault for declining SAT scores, is it likely that mathematics, considered by many the worst-taught subject in education, is holding up while reading skills scores decline? After all, the international studies of psychology professors Harold Stevenson of the University of Michigan and James Stigler of UCLA find that in comparison to Asian teachers, American teachers spend much more time teaching reading than teaching math.</P>

<P><B>A New Generation Gap</B></P>

<P>A comment by <I>Boston Globe</I> syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman provides the major clue to what's up here. During the period when virtually every columnist in the nation was fulminating over the movie JFK, Goodman observed that their howls of anguish were simply attempts by a generation that reads and writes to reach a generation that watches and rewinds.</P>

<P>But, of course, there is more to it than just videotape. We are moving toward a more iconic, oral society of which videotape is only one prominent feature. Consider the following scenario, one that I have enhanced somewhat from its original appearance in an article by Teka Perry published in the November 1987 issue of <I>IEEE Spectrum</I>.</P>

To help plan a trip to France, you rent an optical disc from your travel agent. When you drop it into your home hypermedia system, which links your computer with your stereo and television, a map of France appears on the TV screen. Using the remote, you highlight Alsace and a video begins. Spotting an imposing castle, you freeze the video and choose between text and auditory descriptions of the castle and its history. Noting that the castle contains a painting of some interest, you stop the text and another video begins, wherein an official of the Louvre explains the nature and significance of the painting. Continuing, you highlight the name of the town nearest the castle and also obtain information about a summer festival there. An audio track plays music from last year's program. What about other festivals? You get that too, then select information about various hotels and restaurants in the areas. After planning your itinerary and booking your reservations, you will use the same disc to decide what clothing and accessories you will pack, review road maps and plan your auto route. While examining restaurants, you begin to worry about the state of your menu-reading skills, and use the audio and video to brush up on some basic conversational French.
</DD>
</DL>

<P><IMG SRC="3bonjour.gif" align=right hspace=10>What's wrong with this picture? Only that the travel agent mentioned in the beginning is likely superfluous. You would probably get your information by connecting to some on-line data bases rather than doing something so antiquated as stopping off at a travel agency. With digital tape, laser discs, and high definition television, you might even find everything so real, thorough, and satisfying, that you decide an actual trip would be an expensive anticlimax. Given the current state of technologies, this would leave you unable to experience <I>choucroute garni</I>, <I>gew&uuml;rztraminer</I>, and other Alsatian culinary delights, but no doubt your local wine merchant has both domestic and Alsatian gewurz-es and another of your data bases contains a microwave recipe for sauerkraut and sausage. The point is that linking into a hypermedia production is quite different from curling up with a <I>Guide Michelin</I> or <I>Europe on $3,000.00 a Day</I>.</P>

<P>What's really wrong with this picture is that the disc described represents only a modest application of existing technologies. The range of what writer George Gilder, author of <I>Life After Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and American Life</I> (Norton, 1992), calls &#147;the telecosm&#148; has not yet been deeply plumbed. By way of other examples, though, the Smithsonian Institution has linked up with the National Gallery of Art to provide hypermedia discussions of the Gallery's collection. The National Geographic Society has produced GTV, a hypermedia package to teach geography and history in the United States.</P>

<P>Eighth graders at Exeter/West Greenwich High School in Greenwich, Rhode Island, used hypermedia to produce &#147;The Search for the Titanic,&#148; which includes text, stills, videotapes, and excerpts from the movies <I>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</I> and <I>A Night To Remember</I>. This hypermedia system explains to other students what the world was like at the time of the Titanic and what submarine technology was needed to find it after it sank. Their project also included a visit to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to interview&#151;and videotape&#151;senior scientist Robert Ballard, the man who directed the expeditions that located the Titanic.</P>

<P>I have not visited Exeter/West Greenwich, but I have viewed tapes of the project and talked by phone with the students and their teachers. While the teachers may have gotten more out of it than the kids, it would be hard for me to say that the students' multimedia, hypermedia experience was any less intellectually rich and deep than it would have been had their activities been limited to the printed word. But since the SAT is predicated on the symbols of books, the Exeter students' scores may be in jeopardy.</P>

<P><B>Democratic Definitions</B></P>

<P>The question, therefore, that these multimedia efforts raise is, &#147;What is literacy?&#148; In their thoughtful book <I>Literacy in the United States</I> (Yale University Press, 1991), Carl Kaestle and his colleagues define literacy as &#147;the ability to decode and comprehend written language at a rudimentary level&#151;that is, the ability to say written words corresponding to ordinary oral discourse and to understand them.&#148; As hypermedia and multimedia experiences become more common, will such a definition lose much of its potency, adequacy, even meaning?</P>

<P>We should take a moment here to explain two terms: hypermedia and multimedia. The latter simply means the incorporation of text, pictures, and sound into a single presentation. Hypermedia is an extension of &#147;hypertext,&#148; a word invented in the sixties to describe nonlinear text. Computerized hypermedia applications such as Hypercard for the Macintosh and Linkway for IBM and compatibles allow the filing and retrieval of items in nonlinear fashion.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3gbracey.gif" align=right hspace=10>Those who grew up on books that had beginnings, middles, and ends and movies that presented storylines in linear fashion sometimes have trouble adapting to nonlinear modes, although the success of director David Lynch's movies and others suggests we find such modes pleasant.</P>

<P>Hypermedia, multimedia, interactive videodiscs, synthesizers of various sorts, virtual reality, and other computer games are not just replacements for books; they are technologies that will alter qualitatively and perhaps fundamentally the nature of consciousness. Can democracy survive?</P>

<P>I do not ask this question flippantly. Some people have argued that the written word is essential to independent thinking and dissent. Others, however, have argued that writing is more often used to assimilate and to induce conformity. Still others point to the accomplishments of pre-literate Greece as definitive proof that literacy is not necessary for societal success or sophistication. In fact, Socrates, an illiterate, argued against mass literacy on the grounds that it would destroy memory. He was right, of course, but did society suffer because of it? Sometimes when I mention Socrates in this way, someone will say, &#147;Yes, but you wouldn't know that, if Plato hadn't written it all down.&#148; Maybe, maybe not. If Socrates had won the day, maybe Gutenberg would have invented the Victrola. In any case, the intellectual progress of mankind seems to be characterized by developing technologies to get stuff out of individual intellects and into external, publicly accessible places.</P>

<P>The Greek experience argues against reading as necessary for thinking. So do self-descriptions people provide. Einstein said he seldom thought in words. An artist friend of mine claims that he thinks mostly in images. I cannot verify this, of course, but conversation with him takes some practice. It has less of the usual flow because it often takes him some time to find the words to describe his images. When he does find the words, they are usually colorful and vivid, which would seem to provide evidence for his contention.</P>

<P>Psychologists Jean Piaget in Switzerland and Jerome Bruner, then at Harvard, engaged in a drawn-out battle over whether language causes changes in thinking in the developing child or whether the changes in thinking come first. Piaget argued thinking. Today, most people would agree with him. In some engineering work, a picture is not only worth a thousand words, it is worth an infinite number of words because no number of words can adequately describe the situation. It must be viewed on video or computer simulation to be understood.</P>

<P>Currently, though, universal literacy is the holy grail in this country. Reading researcher Frank Smith, who lives in British Columbia, called attention to this religiosity in a January 1989 <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I> article: &#147;Let me stress at the outset that I'm in favor of literacy. I think that people who don't read and write miss something in their lives. But I think the same about anyone who doesn't appreciate some form of music. Nevertheless, people who aren't musical aren't usually regarded as failures or social outcasts. They are not blamed for poverty and unemployment. I don't see buttons or bumper stickers saying &#145;stamp out unmusicality,&#146; and I don't hear lack of musical ability referred to as a national disgrace. Furthermore, I don't think music would be helped much if war were declared on tone deafness. But&#133;literacy is promoted as the source of just about everything good in this world, and illiteracy is cited as the cause of widespread evil.&#148;</P>

<P>Judging by some reactions I heard to Smith's article, it's a good thing he already lives in Canada.</P>

<P><B>Shifting into Another Cycle</B></P>

<P>In a multimedia society, literacy defined solely in terms of reading may cease to be meaningful. We need a view of literacy that incorporates our new technologies and incorporates a broader examination of what is happening in the larger society. I have read reports, for example, of children learning to play complex computer games that require a great deal of imagination. When interviewed, these children are found to have constructed, with little effort, a geometry and mental space that is different from what adults have and which most of us adults find very difficult to imagine.</P>

<P>Still, all these multimedia experiences, rich though they may be, do not provide as much time for reading printed symbols as does a book. Thus, it may well be that SAT verbal scores and other indicators of &#147;literacy&#148; will continue to fall, but, rather than signaling the collapse of the nation, it may simply be a small sign of a paradigm shift. It is in the nature of paradigms, though, that people living in the old one have difficulty seeing the new one and vehemently reject it when at last they can. I would say that the current alarums over the state of verbal skills in this country may be coming from those who will lose control, unable to function in the new paradigm.</P>

<P>So, if upcoming generations lack appreciation for a well-turned phrase or a beautifully crafted paragraph or the near-perfect metaphor, I, like Smith, will feel that they are missing something. At the same time, I will recall that as students my generation took the infliction of <I>Silas Marner</I> on us as strong evidence that teachers hated kids. And, just as I felt sorry for my parents' generation, which had little appreciation for some authors I loved, I expect my grandchildren to feel a pang of sympathy for me as I sit down to watch a golden oldie linear movie while they suit up for some new adventure in virtual reality.</P>

<P>There seems to be a cycle about these things, doesn't there?</P>

<HR>
<P><IMG SRC="/journal/bios/bbracey.gif" align=left hpsace=15>
<P><STRONG><I>The author, an elementary schoolteacher, is an outspoken advocate for American teachers,
especially when technology is the topic.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>


<P>For more than a year, the members of the Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure (<A HREF="sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A>) have worked together to create a framework that will enable us to reach consensus and make recommendations on many issues related to the development and deployment of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).</P>

<P>The <A HREF="sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A> has organized its activities into three Mega-Projects:
<OL>
<LI>Vision and Goals for the NII</LI>
<LI>Access to the NII</LI>
<LI>Privacy, Security, and Intellectual Property and the NII</LI></OL></P>

<P>The Mega-Project teams have been working together since March 1994, examining the current NII and reviewing relevant articles and judicial opinions. In addition, they have had regular consultations with the Clinton Administration's Information Infrastructure Task Force, other government officials, and outside experts.</P>
<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbface.gif" align=left hspace=10>
<P><B>What Is the NII?</B></P>

<P>The phrase"information infrastructure" has an expansive meaning; the NII includes more than just the physical facilities used to transmit, store, process, and display voice, data, and images. It encompasses a wide and ever-expanding range of equipment that includes cameras, scanners, keyboards, telephones, fax machines, computers, switches, compact disks, video and audiotape, cable, wire, satellites, optical fiber transmission lines, microwave nets, switches, televisions, monitors, printers, and much more.</P>

<P>The NII will integrate and interconnect these physical components in a technologically neutral manner so that no one industry will be favored over any other. Most important, the NII requires building foundations for living in the information age and for making these technological advances useful to the public, business, libraries, and other nongovernmental entities.</P>

<p>That is why, beyond the physical components of the infrastructure, the value of the NII to users and the nation will depend in large part on the quality of its other elements.</P>

<ul>
<LI>The information, which may be in the form of video programming, scientific or business databases, images, sound recordings, library archives, and other media. Vast quantities of information exist today in government agencies, and even more valuable information is produced every day in laboratories, studios, publishing houses, and elsewhere.</LI>
<LI>The applications and software that allow users to access, manipulate, organize, and digest the proliferating mass of information that the NII's facilities will put at their fingertips.</LI>
<LI>The network standards and transmission codes that facilitate interconnection and interoperation between networks and ensure the privacy of persons and the security of the information carried, as well as the security and reliability of the networks. </LI>
<LI>The people&#151;largely in the private sector&#151;who create the information, develop applications and services, construct the facilities, and train others to tap its potential. Many of these people will be vendors, operators, and service providers working for private industry.</LI></UL>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbidea.gif" align=right hspace=10>
<P><B>The Role of Teachers</B></P>
<P><A HREF="sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A>'s finished focus project, KickStart, zeroes in on K&#150;12 education, libraries, and community centers. We want to involve stakeholders in the deployment of the NII, and we picked K&#150;12 as a target area. We have worked together to develop a plan to share stories, much like the campfire model.</P>

<P>We've been attempting to answer a number of questions: What pioneering initiatives are models of success for lifelong learning in schools, libraries, and communities? What options are available to these sites? What about access? What concerns will these sites have about fair use, intellectual property, and other questions that will develop as we embrace the new ways of pedagogy?</P>

<P>When introduced to the concept of the information highway, many teachers will say that they don't know how we can add another thing to the school day or give them yet another responsibility.</P>

<P>Here is a letter from a teacher to an electronic bulletin board that posted criticisms about teachers.  The remarkable thing about this letter is that many of us sing the same tune.</P>

<P><CITE>This is a topic that is quite near and dear to me. I teach in a public school system that requires that we teach the fine arts (dance, drama, visual arts, and music) as well as drug education, health/fitness, AIDS awareness, and the so-called "feel-good" topics such as self-esteem and good citizenship. Somewhere in an extraordinarily short work day we also have to teach math, science, language arts, and social studies (basically American history). My students arrive at my door eager and excited to learn despite the harsh realities of their everyday lives. Some have adults in their lives whose energies are focused on scoring drugs for the day, doing what it takes to get through the day alive. Many have witnessed murders of family and friends, and nearly all of these children live in truly abject poverty. I simply cannot meet all of their emotional/psychological needs, teach reading (most of my eighth-grade students read well below the national norms), mother them, and sometimes feed them and put clothes on their backs with the few resources I have. Somehow, I manage to save a few kids every year and spend an enormous portion of my salary making sure that these kids go on weekend trips to gain exposure to the opportunities available to them if they don't give up. So, forgive me if I feel a bit resentful of those people who have nothing but criticism to offer us.</CITE></P>

<P>There are many teachers who simply want to help kids as best they can. What is the motivation for the change from chalk and talk to the use of technology as a tool? In American education, the textbook remains the basic unit of instruction. Absorption of its contents tends to be the measure of education. How can we change that? What motivation is there to take on the task of change?</P>

<P>Teachers and instructors use chalk and talk to convey information. Students are often recipients of instruction rather than active participants in learning. When teachers upset the industrial model, what are the predictable differences? How do we convey to the public the models of this change and the reasons why U.S. education should change?</P>

<P>In the past, even the most dedicated, skilled, and caring educators needed paper, pencils, and books to ensure that their students got the knowledge they needed to succeed in the society they were being prepared for. To succeed in the society of the 21st century, however, today's students must graduate with more than the memorized knowledge of the past. They must be able to synthesize and analyze information, not just memorize it. Today's students must learn to think for themselves. And they must be able to adapt to a world in which the only constant is rapid change.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbhand.gif" align=left hspace=10>
<P>Most schoolteachers work largely in isolation from their peers, and many interact with their colleagues only for a few moments each day. In contrast, most other professionals collaborate, exchange information, and develop new skills on a daily basis. But teachers are often in the classroom, where the bell and the loudspeaker or PA system are the most significant technology. Although half of this nation's schoolteachers use passive video materials for instruction, only a small fraction have access to interactive video, computer networks, or even telephones in the classroom. And these technologies offer opportunities for collaboration in spite of distance.</P>
 
<P>While computers are a frequent sight in America's classrooms and training sites, they are usually used simply as electronic workbooks. The interactive, high-performance uses of technology that the NII will allow&#151;such as networked teams collaborating to solve real-world problems, retrieving information from electronic libraries, and performing scientific experiments in simulated environments&#151;are all too uncommon in our schools. U.S. schooling is a conservative institution that adopts new practice and technology slowly.</P>

<P>So how do we teachers make the change? We have a variable set of needs: access to hardware, some familiarity and training, on-site permission, and patience and support within the educational setting. The support should hopefully be systemwide and involve all of the layers of funding; parents and community members; and&#151;to effect significant national change&#151;teacher inservice and training. And, finally, time: teachers need time to learn technology, to understand the applications, to synthesize ideas so they can use technology as a tool that will enhance the teaching process. All of these ideas are considered in detail in the <A HREF="/journal/volume4/sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A>'s KickStart Project.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbintnet.gif" align=right hspace=10>
<P><B>Oyez! Oyez!</B></P>
<P>I believe that if the teachers of America could speak of their dreams and hopes for the future, they would cry out to be a part of the age of information. Sadly, it is hard to ask for computers when we have such a hard time just getting phones and dedicated lines into our classrooms.</P>

<P>In medieval times, the scripters, the careful monks who painstakingly copied books, had most written knowledge in their hands. The monks and priests had a network even then to disseminate knowledge to the capitals of the countries that the Jesuits served. The "knowbots" of medieval times were the intellectuals who could read, write, and discourse, and they made decisions or were able to influence the decision making of that era. In those dark ages, information was available, but very few were privileged to be a part of the sharing of knowledge. Once the printing press was invented, the industrial secrets of that world and global niches of specialization were quickly shared. But even then, the movement of ideas was based on a person's ability to read and to purchase or have access to a book. It took a long time to bring the cost of books down to a level that the general public could afford. Hence, the town criers. Oyez!</P>

<P>Teachers are not far removed from those primitive ways of communication. We are still using the book for our basic teaching and the voice for the delivery of the program with a little help from some current technology, some hands-on projects, and a few field trips.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbshell.gif" align=left hspace=10>
<P>The good news is that many teachers are using the new cells of virtual communication and networks that exist on the Internet to reconstruct and improve their teaching practices. The number of people involved in network communications is larger than the cable and television viewing public. Teachers are learning multimedia and using platforms to create learning environments that are rich in motivation and interest and cater to different learning styles. Our link is the computer, online telecommunications, and our virtual communities of thought, conventions, and teacher organizations.</P>

<P>We are just beginning to develop new ways of learning. Unfortunately, we are like the monks. Most people outside our sphere do not understand our words when we talk about the information highway, any more than the peasants understood Latin from the monks. There are more people who do <I>not</I> understand this hue and cry about the information highway than those who do.</P>

<P>It is not that our current school systems are in error; it is that a whole national initiative is a crying need. The world has changed&#151;but some do not know it. I am concerned that some in education may not <I>want</I> to know it.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbmega.gif" align=right hspace=10>
<P><B>Whose Job Is It?</B></P>

<P>The members of <A HREF="sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A> are striving to include teachers&#151;those who are technologically aware and those who are not&#151;in the discussion about and planning for the implementation of technology into America&#146;s classrooms. I am privileged to be one of the voices, and I think that the release of the KickStart Project report will demonstrate the serious commitment of the other <A HREF="sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A> members.</P>

<P>In talking, thinking, and writing about education, it occurs to me that no one agrees on everything and that many people are only passively involved in education. I know, though, that many of us have a real passion for what goes on in schools. What action are you taking? If you care at all about the use of technology in the schools, now is the time to get involved.</P>

<P>Here's an idea: The same Congress that funded the military knows that it secured a 70 percent increase in the ability to train the military through the use of technology. What if half of that increase were transferred to the learning population? What if the people who created the infrastructure within the military championed our cause? We send them our students, after all&#151;what if those students were already technologically aware before they joined the military?</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/4bbrecord.gif" align=left hspace=10>
<P>Everyone says that money will not solve the problem, and that is true. But teachers cannot finance the technology revolution on their own. Parents are trying to help, but saving Safeway receipts to purchase computers won't solve the problem either. The leaders of business and industry are aware of the problem, but agreement on the problem fragments when we discuss solutions. Must the progress of the schools and education be tied to a political agenda? What can you personally do? I suggest a phone call, letter, or email message to your congressperson, urging him or her to support funding for the implementation of technology in our schools.</P>

<P>The members of the <A HREF="sb4bracey.htm">NIIAC</A> feel that visionary leadership is essential and that leadership may come from a single person at the head of a school system, library or community center or from groups with special knowledge and skills, such as teachers, principals, librarians, community members, parents, and business people.</P>

<P>We are working to ensure active participation for all segments of the American population in the deployment of the NII. With the KickStart Project report, education will have a proper place at the table&#151;just as I have had, as an elementary schoolteacher. But mine is only one voice. I hope others will join in the discourse, and soon.</P>

<P><B><I>Imagine&#133;No walls, no desks, no teacher lecturing at the front of the room.  Our little red schoolhouses have changed over the years.  But, as they say, you ain't seen nuthin' yet!</I></B></P>

<P><A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer.htm"><IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/3apollo.gif" align=left hspace=10 vspace=15>

<B>10075248.jpg</B></A> is a wormhole bored across space and time. It's a photograph, taken by the first humans to walk on the moon, and it shows our planet rising over a bleak plain pocketed by craters. My 10-year-old son, Max, downloaded the image from a NASA Internet server with our home computer. He spent an afternoon lost in space, looking at photographs from the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs for an independent project. Max found himself so engrossed in his on-line research that my wife finally had to drag him to dinner&#151;which testifies to the changes technology brings to learning.</P>

<P>In the 19th century, as wagon trains moved west, we envisioned schools as community centers for athletics, plays, concerts, and town meetings. Families contributed labor and money to build the simple, one-room structures that have ingrained themselves in our imaginations. Education historian Lawrence Cremin observed that schools inspired such support because people believed "a school common to all, teaching a body of materials considered necessary to all, was vital to the maintenance of a healthy republic."</P>

<P>Today America is dotted with abandoned rural schoolhouses, faded to the color of moldering bones, broken windows staring like empty eye sockets. In all too many communities, the schools that remain open stand in need of repair. Some are even health hazards. Even as it faces indifference and lack of finances, American education finds itself coping with technology and the challenge presented by resources like NASA's National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC), where the "Earth Rising Over Moon" photo can be accessed.</P>

<P>Through the Internet, my son can access more learning resources at home than he could in most schools. This morning he can visit the Louvre, and after lunch he can access science experiments, classical music, and <I>The Congressional Record.</I> With a click of his mouse, he can view comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, review data on the Mount Pinatubo eruption, and take a virtual tour of Ireland. If he wants to discuss pressing topics, he can e-mail a question to a Nobel Prize winner.</P>

<P>On the Internet, no one knows your title, age, grade, or test scores. Students can learn at their own paces, in their own learning styles, using primary source documents unfiltered by some textbook's idea of what to learn. The Internet allows them to follow their curiosity unencumbered by bells, rigid curricula, class schedules, or the limitations of the teacher.</P>

<P>To access resources like NSSDC, the only requirements are a $100 modem; a dial-up account, the cost of which is comparable to a monthly cable television fee; and an innate curiosity. Even for adults, the Internet has resurrected the joy of learning.</P>

<P>Kathy Rutkoski, who edits an on-line newsletter for K-12 teachers, says, "The greatest contribution of computer networks will be their seemingly magical ability to encourage teachers to learn and remember the wonder and excitement of their own childhood."</P>

<P>My son and others fortunate to have access to the Internet testify that the very foundations of schooling are shaking beneath us, as if in the throes of an earthquake. What students learn, how they learn, who they learn with, and where they learn are shifting, moved by the cultural equivalent of plate tectonics. Bill Crocoll, superintendent in Chittenden, Vermont&#151;a school district nationally recognized for technology use&#151;says technologies like the Internet will force us to stop thinking of school as a place and focus on schooling as a concept.</P>

<P>Click to <A HREF="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/scripts/JASON.html"><B>http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/scripts/JASON.html</B></A>, the home page of the JASON Project. The graphic interfaces and point-and-click access of such resources have made the Internet user friendly to any school-aged child. From February 27 through March 11, 1995, JASON Project Voyage VI offered students a visit to Hawaii with a team of scientists. Bonnie Bracey, a former teacher at Ashlawn Elementary in Arlington, Virginia, says an earlier JASON Project so enthralled her class that "there are no bored students." She compares her students' involvement in learning to her own involvement in an earlier exploration. "Most of us had the experience of landing on the moon with the astronauts 25 years ago&#133;and did it make an impression? You bet!" Today, through hypertext links, a simple query can become a fascinating quest that can lead in many directions.</P>

<P><BR clear=left>
The JASON Project is one example of the wide array of learning opportunities already offered by schools, colleges, and others on the Internet. Click to <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu"><B>http://web66.coled.umn.edu</B></A> and find a long list of educational opportunities: a home page on African Americans in the sciences from the Louisiana State University Library, research on El Ni&ntilde;o from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, an exhibit of Dante in Print from the Newberry Library, and resources on science education from the University of California at Irvine.</P>

<P>The point about these entries is that at the moment they are totally unregulated. Anyone can offer any kind of learning opportunity on the Internet. All it takes is a minimal amount of money to set up a server. A leased 56 kilobyte or T1 line, a server, router, modems, software, and installation can run from $20,000 to $30,000 of initial investment plus yearly upkeep&#151;a fraction of the cost of a classroom.</P>

<P>In states with open enrollment policies, students can register in any district. With the Internet, they could get a diploma from anywhere in the nation. <A HREF="http://uu-gna.mit.edu:8001/uu-gna/index.html"><B>http://uu-gna.mit.edu:8001/uu-gna/index.html</B></A>&#151;the home page of the Global Network Academy-represents this possibility. It includes hypertext links to the Virtual Online University, Ta-Ming Virtual University, and the Global Electronic Multimedia University. All offer learning opportunities on line.</P>

<P>In Seattle, Puget Community School is one of several "virtual schoolhouses" in America that connect home schoolers. Anyone who has any inclinations toward home schooling can find books, lessons, laboratories, videos, and music on line. At <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com:80/~jhs"><B>http://www.teleport.com:80/~jhs</B></A> is the Johnson Home School's home page. There we learn about Stephen, Heather, Kathi, and Kirke. Heather's page has a picture of her playing the harp along with information that she studies harp with Sister John Therese and flute with Anna Peterkort.</P>

<P>From such family ventures, it is but a small step for someone to start a school that exists only on the Internet. Put the curriculum and resources on a file server, add interactive video, chat areas, and e-mail, and you have a virtual schoolhouse. It won't be long before some community strapped for space and cash will set up an electronic school, rather than build a brick one.</P>

<P>This leads to some difficult questions. What if students can get a better education from a district a thousand miles away through an Internet server? How can local school boards control how children will be educated in such an environment? The answers to these questions could cause the American education system to topple like a row of dominoes. If the Internet threatens local school boards and superintendents, it also should cause state bureaucrats to fear for the future. What if students prefer Wisconsin's requirements to those of their own state?</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.turner.com/tesi/"><B>http://www.turner.com/tesi/</B></A> is the home page of Turner Adventure Learning. A Gopher server contains a wealth of materials on the Battle of Gettysburg coordinated with the Turner-produced movie, including battle photographs and the Gettysburg Address.  As multimedia conglomerates like Ted Turner's enter the doorway the Internet offers to the education market, the lines between K-12, higher education, and business will blur further, multiplying educational offerings on the Internet. Corporations already fund extensive training programs to make up for the educational deficiencies of their employees. Why not offer diplomas over the Internet? For-profit ventures like The Edison Project and Education Alternatives Incorporated could set up Internet servers and hire their own teachers. Expect the network to produce some questionable education offerings&#151;mail to school@edutain.org, for instance.</P>

<P>Click to <A HREF="http://www.ed.gov"><B>http://www.ed.gov</B></A>, the U.S. Department of Education's home page, which includes a wealth of information on national programs like Goals 2000. The Internet raises some questions about the federal government's role in the hyperspace education of the future. If the Internet makes it possible for students to receive degrees from anyone, anywhere, who will regulate this anarchy? One option could take us closer to a federal system. Certainly, higher education lobbies will not look kindly on Internet educational entrepreneurs. Washington could also choose to fund Internet-based national charter schools.</P>

<P>If the where of learning is changing, so also is the how. The old industrial system schooled children in assembly-line fashion. Treated like interchangeable parts, each student followed the same plan with little variation. We laid out classrooms in rows like factories, preferably in alphabetical order. The same structure used for the seating chart characterized grade books, lesson plans, report cards, and daily schedules. The curriculum became a bewildering grid of specialized subjects. Using tests with grids of multiple-choice questions, we sorted students like pieces of mail, filing them in the proper box to decide their future: Harvard or the unemployment line.</P>

<A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer3.htm">
<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/3frog.gif" align=left hspace=10></A>

<P><A HREF="http://curry.edschool.Virginia.EDU:80/~insttech/frog"><B>http://curry.edschool.Virginia.EDU:80/~insttech/frog</B></A> and <A HREF="http://beavis.cba.uiuc.edu"><B>http://beavis.cba.uiuc.edu</B></A>. These two home pages that my son discovered symbolize how the Internet challenges not only the political structure of American education but also its pedagogical structure. One is an on-line frog dissection, the other an assortment of products from "Beavis and Butt-head," including Windows icons, computer images, games, and even a screen saver. A network that can offer such variety argues against assembly-line learning. Anyone who goes on line can write his or her own curriculum.</P>

<P><A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer.htm"><B>10075248.jpg</B></A> offers the promise that technology can finally provide a way of teaching individuals. In 1986, the National Task Force on Educational Technology reported, "It is becoming clear that individual learners (and teachers) need no longer conform to one standard teaching/learning pattern for all. Programs can be custom-designed to serve each learner." Those programs exist now&#151;on the Internet. If a student is a visual learner, has special talents in art or music, or has an interest in dinosaurs or volcanoes, he or she can follow those inclinations. He's not restricted to the limitations of a textbook, the school library, or a computer disk. Of course, she may choose to play with Beavis and Butt-head.</P>

<P>No matter how hard we try to box in students, they will find a way around the box. This presents an acute challenge for educators and parents. Districts that might consider scrapping old buildings for electronic schools also may scrap textbooks. Producers of learning resources will have to be more imaginative to compete with the Internet. To keep up with individual learners will demand new feedback mechanisms that actively allow everyone to take part in constantly updating and redesigning learning tools.</P>

<P>lamda.parc.xerox.com.8888. Connect as "Guest" to LamdaMOO&#151;a MUD, or multi-user dungeon. These real-time, network-based, role-playing games allow users to create an identity and participate in an ongoing, on-line adventure. Although LamdaMOO is text-based, creator Pavel Curtis is working on a version with audio and video. MUDs represent a prototype of on-line, individualized learning because they can allow participants to control the game. As classroom becomes MUD room, this interactive ability will gather momentum. Learning resources will have no boundaries.</P>

<P>Check out the <B>k12.ed.math</B> or <B>k12.ed.music</B> or <B>k12.ed.tech</B> or <B>k12.chat.teacher</B> newsgroups. These are but a few of the many education newsgroups on the Internet. Here the specialization of our world is mirrored in abundance. There is a discussion group for every interest one can imagine. Yet something is happening here that has profound implications for schooling and the rest of our lives. The greatest minds in the world are but a mouse click away. Put a query on the Net, and you will quickly learn more than you ever wanted to know about any arcane subject.</P>

<P>Such developments argue for an increased need for teachers, rather than their extinction. However, the days when teachers stood in the front of rows of desks expounding on the multiplication tables or drilling students in the rules for placing a comma or reciting "i before e, except after c" are fading. My son can find an expert on any topic with a great deal more knowledge than any teacher merely by dialing up his modem.</P>

<P><A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer.htm"><B>10075248.jpg</B></A> points to the need for facilitators and guides who can help students navigate through the growing neuroverse of information, aligning their compasses, providing maps, and schooling them in how to steer through unexpected storms. These navigators will help students learn how to ask questions, analyze answers, evaluate data, access information. All are skills Socrates would not be uncomfortable with. Homer provided us another paradigm in the figure of Odysseus, the hero who lived by his wits rather than his brawn. Homer referred to his hero as a "man of many resources," an apt description of teachers in the next century.</P>

<P>Teachers who are comfortable with their disciplinary boxes, lecture notes, and canned drills will be poor Internet navigators. They are the equivalent of those medieval Europeans who traveled only where they could see the shore, relying on familiar landmarks and rote instructions. To show how obsolete such teachers are, one could propose an educational version of the famous Turing test for artificial intelligence. Pit a team of students with modems against a team of specialist teachers and quiz them, College Bowl style. Today the specialists might win, but as the speed and sophistication of networking technology increases, Team Modem will have the edge.</P>

<P>Facilitators who are skilled navigators will be in high demand; their reputations will spread quickly on the Internet. The charter school mechanism and technology will allow them to create their own schools with a network of like-minded colleagues across the country. Back in the time of Socrates, students such as the young Plato could study with learned masters. Why couldn't some modern Socrates advertise for students on the Internet?</P>

<P>If the Internet is changing where and how students learn, <A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer.htm"><B>10075248.jpg</B></A> promises that what they learn also will change. In the new world of the next century, our children will need entirely different skills from those that sufficed for their parents and grandparents. As the SCANS report and other projections testify, they will need to cope with sudden career shifts, comprehend increasing amounts of new information, and master rapidly changing technology in a world with constantly shifting boundaries and instantaneous communication.</P>

<P>Constructing a curriculum to meet these needs is at the center of the struggle over the emerging new technology-based education symbolized by <A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer.htm"><B>10075248.jpg</B></A>. When education focused on Carnegie units, letter grades, multiple-choice tests, and a common core curriculum, those well-defined outlines provided certainty and comfort. Now technology is undermining that structure.</P>

<P>Click to <A HREF="http://www.seti-inst.edu"><B>http://www.seti-inst.edu</B></A>, home page of the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Among other resources, it contains a life-in-the-universe curriculum. The SETI home page points to one of the major problems confronting schools, the obsolescence of information. Every learning resource we have other than the Internet is out of date the day it is issued. Today's new idea will end up in tomorrow's remainder bin. Today's new scientific discovery could be tomorrow's flat earth. Walk into a media center, pull a print-based encyclopedia off the shelf, and leaf through its pages. It won't take long before you start chuckling. Facts and contexts change so quickly that only a constantly evolving entity like the Internet can keep up. Like our brains, the Internet can create new synapses.</P>

<P>The second problem the Internet presents lies in its ability to make linkages. For generations, we hired college and K-12 teachers based on their credentials in a particular specialization. The Internet raises serious questions about this specialized knowledge. If the rapid pace of change makes textbooks obsolete, what does it do for their writers? One masters some arcane field only to find it is no longer relevant or its basic assumptions have changed. Specialized knowledge no longer has high value when it can be accessed so easily. Why should a student spend time memorizing facts, when he or she can easily access the latest data with a modem click? Why should such memorization decide who gets into Harvard? The Internet will present an even greater challenge to fact-based knowledge than the calculator did to traditional math.</P>

<P>In the 21st century the buzzword will be "connections." Constructing linkages has made Bill Gates of Microsoft fame a very rich man. If our children wish to become as successful as Gates, they will need to become just as adept at making connections, and this will require us to rethink the entire curriculum.</P>

<P>The Internet is an interactive medium. One cannot be a passive learner while surfing through cyberspace, for its organic, constantly changing form continually presents new challenges and opportunities. Today my son can get replies to his questions from dozens of people. Shifting through those answers teaches him a great deal more about learning than the memorization of rote answers ever could.</P>

<P>To cope with this environment, students will need a whole new approach to learning. They will need the ability to:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Understand systems&#151;the organizing principles of connections
<LI>Organize, analyze, and synthesize information&#151;the tools of connections
<LI>Recognize patterns&#151;the structure of connections
<LI>Appreciate and relate to diversity&#151;our potential connections to others
<LI>Understand and facilitate communication verbally, spatially, and mathematically&#151;the tools to make connections.

Here one can find copies of the student newspaper and examples of student writing projects. The most interesting section of this node on the Internet, however, is the students' own home pages. They can post anything they want on their home pages&#151;new projects, recent work, clever sayings&#151;and they do. Ask, "What did you do in school today?" and get an answer by modem.</P>

<P><A HREF="HTTP://rebelweb.anoka.K12.mn.us/rebel/champlin.html"><B>Rebel&#095;web</B></A> suggests that being able to see and evaluate a student's work will put pressure on our current credentiallers. Now our objective tests measure very little, if any, of the more complex reasoning the next century will demand. This has spawned a cry for more authentic assessments that require a student to demonstrate what he or she knows. In the world of the Internet, the system will become more accountable to employers, other teachers, and, most of all, to parents. The Internet will allow students and parents to intersect directly with network-based assessment instruments, thus providing instant feedback. This, in turn, will provide a monitor of local schools. Test preparation companies like Kaplan will also set up operations on the Net. Couple instant tests with instant test preparation, and the whole notion of standardized, multiple-choice tests may disappear. With artificial intelligence, one can construct an interactive test that presses students to explain the whys of their answers.</P>

<P>But, why have traditional tests at all? The Chittenden, Vermont, district is planning to provide every student a CD-ROM that contains actual examples of his or her work: art, music, plays, essays, videotapes of building a bookshelf. With a CD jukebox, parents and students can access these from home. If you can see actual examples of the student's work, why would you rely on an "A" grade to prove your knowledge of a subject? Another prediction: With each of us having a lifelong learning CD-ROM, clever programs will navigate through a student's disk and tag appropriate samples. Why rely merely on the disk? Using the Internet, admissions counselors or personnel workers will query prospective applicants on line, creating the virtual interview.</P>

<P>If we add up all the dimensions of the new schooling that <A HREF="/journal/volume4/pf3brauer.htm"><B>10075248.jpg</B></A> portends, it is clear education will be vastly different for our children. We forget that the American common school is a fairly new way of educating children. There is no preordained conclusion that the present system will survive the next century. Still, it would be tragic if America's tradition of local independent school districts disappeared.</P>

<P>Public schools and school districts can play a major role in this new universe, if they will accept it. If, instead of resisting or opposing the new learning the Internet promises, they embrace it, they can serve a critical function of facilitating our access to and use of these resources. Just as citizens in their little houses on the prairie needed schools to serve as their links to one another and the larger world, so in the Internet Age schools can perform a similar role. Schooling will become an infosection, fostering intellectual connections in every community. With links to the Internet, any community can be a doorway to the future.</P>

<P>The link of schooling to the community has provided the engine for our democracy during the last century and a half. If someone else&#151;a for-profit company, the federal government, entrepreneurs&#151;provided infosections for local communities, America would be changed profoundly in ways we can now only dimly perceive.</P>

<P>The problem our nation now faces is how to provide infosections for everyone. Those like my son, who are fortunate to have these links, are a giant step ahead of their peers. Adequate access to technology must not become a lottery system where those lucky to land a grant or pass a bond issue succeed while others lose. Not long after Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich proposed giving each American a laptop computer, members of his own party proposed the virtual elimination of federal funds for school technology and the abolishment of the Education Department's technology office. If we are to cope with 10075247.jpg, we should get our signals straight. We must provide every school in America with Internet access, give every classroom the technology it needs, and provide every teacher with the training and support to make it all work.</P>

<P>I once asked some teachers in Brainerd, Minnesota, about what skills they thought students would need in the next century. One of them turned to me and said, "They will need to be like cats. They will need to land on their feet." Let's hope we all land on our feet.</P>

<STRONG><I>In their search for the classroom of 2016, a team of fourth-graders found today's cutting-edge technology, a computer-centered curriculum, and an innovative idea for connecting aging classrooms to computer technology.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P>Our vision of a fourth-grade classroom in the year 2016 begins in a school that, at first glance, looks much like ours. While many newer schools will be built between now and 2016, most of the current school facilities will still be in use, so they will have to be upgraded to meet expanding technology needs. Once inside those classrooms, however, many dramatic changes will be apparent.</P>

<P>You will quickly notice there are many computers in every classroom. Each student has a notebook-size computer on his or her desk. The laptop computers of the 1990s have become the desktop computers of the twenty-first century. These computers are small, but powerful. They are easy and fast to use, and they connect to a variety of other electronic learning tools throughout and beyond the classroom and even beyond the school. The classroom's computers are networked into the teacher's master computer, which acts as a file server and a massive storage device. The computers are also connected to the library where thousands of CD-ROM disks can be &#147;borrowed&#148; to the laptops. CD-ROM disks in 2016 are made in the classroom. They hold text, color, sound, video, and camera-quality graphics.</P>


<P>To activate their computers, students reach up and pull down coiled cables that plug into their laptops. The teacher loads software onto the server, and all the students can begin working. The server is very powerful and can run several CD-ROM disks at the same time so that each student can work on materials that fit his or her needs, abilities, and interests. This server also helps do the record keeping for the teacher so she can tell at what level and on which skills each student is working. If a student has some difficulty, the server will both alert the teacher and provide the student with remediation and practice until a predetermined mastery level is reached.</P>

<P>The teacher in this classroom has to play many roles. She is part computer technician and part information highway tour guide. A big part of her job involves record management, thus her computer is larger and more expensive than the students' laptops. Although the computer has made her job easier, it has not replaced the teacher. She is still the resident expert on curriculum, learner behavior, and motivation.</P>

<P><B>Computer-Centered Curriculum</B></P>

<P>In our 2016 classroom, the computer plays a larger role in the learning process. Although there are still some books in use, more and more textbooks are on disks. These electronic texts include a broader range of materials than was available in printed books. The pictures, or graphics as they are now called, have sound, color, and motion. Some are three-dimensional and give the &#147;reader&#148; a virtual reality experience. The student plays an interactive role with this material, scanning barcodes to access options that can enhance learning with music, animation, charts, graphs, and simulations. The student can take notes, do calculations, or write questions for follow-up study while the books-on-disk are on the screen. The computer is a true multimedia workstation allowing the user to access related materials that include videos, laser discs, CD-ROM encyclopedias, online newspapers, and a full range of reference materials in the school's library.</P>

<P>Utilizing the modem, fiber optic cables, and a communication satellite, the student can reach beyond the walls of the classroom and contact other people on the Internet. The student can both hear and see the person to whom he is connected if he sits at the teacher's computer which has the necessary auditory and visual devices. Global communications on the World Wide Web enable the student to join with other students and mentors around the globe to discuss issues, share ideas, and solve problems. This gives the student nearly unlimited and immediate sources for data. More importantly, it connects the student with experts and leaders in the topic of most interest to the student. The flexible curriculum allows students to make choices about what and how they will learn.</P>

<P>The increased use of computer technology in the classroom of 2016 will change the way that classrooms are structured. Although students begin each day in homeroom grades, most of their time is spent in multi-age cooperative teams. Some teams include members from other schools within the district; a few teams connect students across the country. Students come together for instruction according to their needs and interests. These teams of students are flexible and change as the students make progress. There are greater opportunities for individualization. Adaptive devices allow special-needs students to participate on an equal footing with their peers.</P>

<P>When a student is home sick or hospitalized, a special laptop computer is lent to the student to keep him or her connected to the classroom as much as possible. The student dials the school on the modem and inputs a special code that provides access to the classroom's file server. From there, the student can access all books-on-disk, workgroup members, assignments, and notes. The teacher can activate both sound and video exchanges between this student and the classroom. During class discussions, the missing student is visible on the teacher's monitor, or an infrared beam can project the student's image onto a giant television screen set on the classroom wall. The student can ask questions or contribute ideas as if he or she were actually in class.</P>

<P>The increased use of computer technology in the classroom of 2016 makes other significant changes in the lives of the students. They do their homework on computers and download their work to the file server in their classroom. If the work isn't received at school by a certain time that evening, a warning message is sent to the student's home computer. If there are major errors in the home assignment, the file server may immediately ask the student to redo the task and resubmit it, or it may program remedial activities for the student and have these waiting on the laptop when the student arrives at his or her workstation the next day.</P>

<P>Parents can download progress reports, assignments, school bulletins, and teacher messages by calling the school from their home computers. They can even view their child's CD-ROM Portfolio, a collection of the student's work samples, video clips from musical and dramatic performances and grades and test scores.</P>

<P>Students still have to do paper-pencil tasks, but most tests, essays, reports, and worksheets are done on their laptops. Fast and accurate keyboarding is advantageous for the student. However, in some lessons, the student uses headphones and voice-entry responses. Other lessons are &#147;hands-on,&#148; and the student participates by touching selected areas on the screen. Finally, the power and flexibility of the computer make it the focal point of most lessons, rather than just a machine to use when the main work is done. Curriculum is written and teaching materials are selected to take full advantage of the multimedia capabilities of computers.</P>

<P><B>Breakthroughs</B></P>

<P>A number of developments and changes need to occur before our advanced computer classroom of 2016 can become a reality. Nearly all of the needed advances in computer technology are already developed and are available on the business-world market today. There are smart phones like BellSouth's &#147;Simon,&#148; a combination cellular phone, fax, video, and pager. There are talking modems and keyboards that speak and respond to voice, such as &#147;Vocalyst&#148; by Compaq. Every computer manufacturer is racing to put the latest models on the market, and each model is faster, more versatile, smaller, and more portable than last year's favorites. Many of these have related handheld information and communication devices like Apple's &#147;Pippin&#148; and &#147;Newton.&#148;</P>

<P>Multimedia display devices and digital connectivity are essential features in the competitive retail market. The growing range of peripherals includes photo-quality printers, color copiers, scanners, digital cameras, LCD panel viewers, big screen digital television, massive memory storage systems, and towers that access dozens of CD-ROM disks. Fiber optic cables carrying sound, video, and digitized signals can hook all these devices into a powerful and elastic communications network.</P>

<P>Why doesn't this level of technology exist in schools today, and particularly, in a fourth-grade portable classroom like ours? Money! In a survey of the 100 largest American districts, lack of funding is the most frequently mentioned obstacle to school reform and technological development (32.7%) (1994 National Survey for Education Reform, SIMBA). Insufficient time to plan and organize (28.8%) and lack of training (5.8%) were other factors that directly impacted technology acquisition. In a 1990 &#150;1994 study of the cost of network technology in its schools, the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona reported that the per-unit cost was $4,350 (with $250 for maintenance, $2,750 for capital, and $1,350 for training). Salary and energy costs were not included in the figures (see &#147;Three-Year Cost of Educational Computing&#148; by Daniel Kinnaman in the May/June 1995 <I>Technology and Learning</I>).</P>

<P>When technology funds are available, they reach high schools long before they filter down to the elementary classrooms. It will be 20 years before the cutting-edge devices of today's workplace appear in our classroom, and these devices will only appear if they are more affordable and we have access to funds. Enrollments are soaring in public schools and budgets are tight.</P>

<P>Achievement in math and reading is stagnant. Administrators are looking for new ways to boost productivity and quality without raising costs. Maintenance is being deferred. More and more students are housed in portables. Unfortunately, the technology budget is caught in a squeeze play between the high costs of investing in technology and increased demands on the overall school budget.</P>

<P>Another breakthrough related to funding is meeting the high cost of retrofitting existing school buildings to support evolving technology systems. It will be very expensive to install the wiring, cables, phone lines, and network connections in every school so that all students can use this technology to its fullest. We think there is a market for prefabricated linear panels that contain all the needed wiring. We call our idea &#147;Media-Links.&#148; Our product would be cheap, lightweight, and durable. It would come in a variety of lengths, curves, and angles, or could be made-to-order. It would snap together like toy train tracks, and could be attached at ceiling level to interior or exterior walls. Connectors would punch into classrooms, where smaller Media-Links would distribute the wiring around the rooms using the acoustical ceiling supports. Laptops would connect to these cables using pull-down bungee cords.</P>

<P>Finally, there must be a breakthrough in what and how students are taught. Our classroom in 2016 isn't designed for 25 students all doing the same thing at the same time! The technology we envision requires major changes in education. It can't just be an add-on to the way things are done today. Teachers and students will need to make more choices as they utilize the diversity of information the computers provide. The screens will be windows on the world, and because the media will be interactive, the students will have a global audience. The Internet will be the field trip bus of 2016. Parents, technologists, and educators will need to rewrite the curriculum so that it makes the best use of this dynamic technology. Then our equipment, in the hands of wonderful teachers, will work education miracles.</P>

<P><B>Consequences and Challenges</B></P>

<P>The use of computers in the future will have many positive consequences and present a number of serious challenges. Computers make learning fun, easier, and more interesting. The variety of software programs available encourages students to explore special interests and work at their own pace. Computers can save you time, and they allow you to access information from sources far beyond the school, the home, and the community library. Distance learning in cyberspace connects the classroom to the whole world, making the student-user a part of the global village. Computers with adaptive devices like touch screens and voice entry allow physically challenged students to participate more advantageously in regular classroom activities. As more and more computers become available in schools, other learning tools like books, televisions, videodisc players, cameras, and telephones will be modified to connect with this technology, allowing the creation of multimedia learning experiences. Ultimately, students working with computers will be better prepared for the workplace of the future.</P>

<P>The use of computers in the future will also pose numerous challenges. Even though computer costs are decreasing, they are still too expensive for all students to have adequate access to them. The expenses involved are not just for the hardware and software. Classrooms have to be modified to handle this equipment. Training people to use the computers takes time that people may not have, and it also costs money. The community that pays for increases in classroom technology will also expect proportional increases in student test scores, and this may not occur.</P>

<P>People may find computers to be too advanced for them. Some parents may not be able to keep up with their child's knowledge of educational technology. Many districts may not be able to afford this technological growth, and the public school system could break down along socioeconomic lines. Low-technology school systems might face legal actions on the grounds that they are failing to provide equal educational opportunities for their students. There could be a challenge to privacy as people make unauthorized entries into files. We will have to deal with the sensitive issue of censorship. Not everything in cyberspace is appropriate in the classroom, so guidelines for access will need to be set and enforced. Finally, there is a health issue. If students spend hours in front of a computer screen, what impact will that have on their fitness, vision, and social development?</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Interview with James P. Comer, M.D.</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Carole Novak</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I><IMG SRC="jcomer.gif" align=right hspace=10>Child Psychiatist Dr. James Comer is director of the School Development Program (SDP) at Yale University's Child Study Center in New Haven, Connecticut.  Before 'School-Based Management' was a buzzword, it was in practice in the Comer schools.  Beginning with two New Haven schools in 1968, SDP has spread to 200 schools in 19 states and the District of Columbia.  Comer's philosophy is based on his upbringing, which he recounted in his 1988 book about his mother's life, </I>Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family<I> (New American Library).  Comer is a member of the Atlas Communites design team  that received one of 11 grants from the New American Schools Development Corporation as a &#147;Break-The-Mold&#148; school project.  </I>TECHNOS<I> spoke to Dr. Comer in June 1992, after the riots following the Rodney King Verdict.  Sadly, Maggie Comer died in September.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><I><B>Is it true that when you tried to explain child psychiatry to your mother, she said it just sounds like &#145;common sense&#146;?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes, that's true.</P>

<P><I><B>If it's just common sense, why is it taking so long to figure out?</B></I></P>

<P>Because we are not really rational beings; we are insecure beings. We don't always do the reasonable thing. So we are always looking for ways to keep up our defenses. As a result, we act in ways that are not logical and rational.</P>

<P><I><B>Will we make things better someday?</B></I></P>

<P>I'm fairly pessimistic. Especially in this day and age when we are in crisis, yet&#151;given the ability to change public opinion on such a large basis&#151;we can't turn things around. But I'd say things are pretty bad right now.</P>

<P><I><B>There's this terrifying trend toward violence we're experiencing again.</B></I></P>

<P>Violence isn't the underlying problem, in my opinion. It's a symptom of social policy that's the problem. It's a breakdown of the social contract. We ask people to live a certain way in society and, in return, they should have certain rights and opportunities. When society violates that contract, then you can expect violence. The riots in Los Angeles are no different than the labor riots at the turn of the century. They occur after a basic social contract is broken, when people fight for basic opportunities. It is not an issue of simple violence, or of law and order, but an issue of economic opportunity.</P>

<P><I><B>Your School Development Program is based on understanding how children develop and offering them opportunities through education.</B></I></P>

<P>That's true. And yet, we already know how children develop. And we know that they have certain needs, and that if those needs aren't met, children won't develop and learn well, even in the best of circumstances. We know what children need. It's just that we don't provide it as we should.</P>

<P><I><B>Is it because we don't value education the way we should?</B></I></P>

<P>No. It's because we don't value certain groups of people. We don't value poor children; we don't value minority children. There was a time when we could get away with that in society because those children, as adults, could be absorbed into the economy into jobs that didn't require education. Today, we can't get away with it. Since the 1950s, education has become the ticket of admission to living in our society. And those jobs that offered the opportunity to provide for oneself and a family&#151;to develop high expectation through economic opportunity and the possibility of a sense of social and psychological well-being&#151;were lost.</P>

<P><I><B>Today, &#145;education&#146; means not just a high school diploma, but a bachelor's degree and in many cases, a master's degree.</B></I></P>

<P>Yes. And the other thing that's happening now is that we require children from families that are uneducated, poorly skilled, to become well-educated, well-skilled&#151;even sophisticated&#151;in one generation. Now, that's never been the way it has worked for most people. Most poor and minority families take three generations to complete the process, which parallels the three generations of change in the American economy.</P>

<P><I><B>But in your family's case, things were different, weren't they?</B></I></P>

<P>There are exceptions. In my family's case, in some ways we went from uneducated to highly educated in one generation. But that's unusual.</P>

<P><I><B>Your mother, Maggie, is a person who has a spark, something inside of her that absolutely will not be defeated. And she found a like person in your father. When the two of them got together, there was just no stopping them. How can we help the kids who don't have that spark?</B></I></P>

<P>That's what schools must do&#151;and can do, if they're willing to adjust. One of the problems is the assumption that education is an isolated activity, that there is a certain amount of information that we can pour into kids' heads. But education cannot be isolated from the environmental context, because it affects motivation and the kind of personal development and discipline that is necessary to enable a person to gain an education. So you've got to provide an environment that allows children to feel wanted, valued, and accepted, one that allows them to accept you.</P>

<P><I><B>So they can trust&#133;</B></I></P>

<P>That's right. And then you can encourage them and give them experiences that will help them develop all the skills necessary to gain an education. But, what we've done is write off kids who come to school underdeveloped, personally and physically, and undermotivated. And we write them off as if they're not able or they're bad&#151;as if they want to be bad or unable. We lose those kids.</P>

<P><I><B>Very early, apparently.</B></I></P>

<P>Yes. There are kids who are on their way out in kindergarten. You can tell. Veteran teachers know. And unless we can do something in the schools, beginning in kindergarten, to help those kids, we'll lose them forever.</P>

<P><I><B>What are some of things the Comer schools do to save these kids?</B></I></P>

<P>One of the things that people point out who've observed our schools is that our children feel comfortable, wanted, valued, and are secure in their environment. I still argue that&#151;while there are ways to teach that are more efficient, more effective, more pleasant, exciting, and so on&#151;children will learn, no matter what method you use, if they feel wanted, valued, and accepted in an environment in which they can interact with caring people they trust. So we've focused on creating that environment.</P>

<P><I><B>What happens to kids once they leave a Comer elementary school?</B></I></P>

<P>Our experience has been that there is a wash-out by the eighth grade if the program isn't continued. Some of the kids will do okay, though, even if they don't get the support of their parents.</P>

<P><I><B>That's true. Is it wrong to think that some people have a spark&#151;or some stubbornness&#151;that keeps them going, no matter what?</B></I></P>

<P>I think it's a combination of a spark and an innate intelligence. Bright kids who have it will make it through. But it also takes a problem-solving mentality. That's what my mother and father had; they were determined to hang in there for as long as necessary. With a problem-solving mentality, nothing can stop you. You meet an obstacle head on and deal with it. And my father said that to me very directly in regard to race issues: &#145;Never let your race stop you from doing what you want to do.&#146;</P>

<P><I><B>You've said that the advent of television changed the way people were educated and how they've thought about education since World War II. It seems you have ambivalent feelings about the medium.</B></I></P>

<P>Well, television itself is a two-edged sword. It gives information, but it also exposes us to things we may not be ready for, such as too much violence. Unless you use it as a stimulus for creativity, it can crush creativity, because people can get accustomed to having images presented to them and watching others use their imaginations, rather than using their own. On the other hand, in schools that use it as a stimulus, imagination and creativity are developed. So, television can be a benefit or a detriment.</P>

<P><I><B>Part of the problem may be that teachers don't know how to use television effectively.</B></I></P>

<P>Or they just are against it without thinking about how they might use it. A major problem in education is this notion that there's a certain body of information that we pass on, rather than setting it up for discovery and making certain that body of information is obtained. You set it up for discovery; you manage that discovery process. And it has to be managed at the building level on an ongoing basis by the staff and by the parents. This is not, for the most part, the set-up we're comfortable with.</P>

<P><I><B>It's harder to do, isn't it?</B></I></P>

<P>Sure it is. Because it's risky; it may not happen the way we want it to. Part of what schools of education could do to change the way they train teachers would be to make applied child development a core course in education. A teacher ought to know what a fight on the playground means. It could be an impulse control problem, or it could be a frustration management problem, or lack of negotiation skills. It could mean a lot of things. But you can help kids learn from an incident rather than punish them or call them &#145;bad.&#146; It's an opportunity to promote growth and development. It's also essential that teachers learn to manage the system of learning. When you do that, it creates an atmosphere where you can do your job; you can teach.</P>

<P><I><B>Would you term this &#145;school-based management&#146;?</B></I></P>

<P>Our governance and management systems are the basis of what's now being called &#145;school-based management.&#146; But we say that this system is not enough. Because when most people talk about it, they're talking about managing the school so the curriculum and the instruction interact. We're talking about the way you relate all of the stakeholders in the program and the school appropriately and enable them to interact well so that they can support the development of the children. And then you can make the connections to curriculum and instruction.</P>

<P><I><B>And the stakeholders are?</B></I></P>

The parents, teachers, the staff, the janitors, the kids&#151;everybody.<P>

<P><I><B>Your program is mostly about empowering the stakeholders, and that means that people like teachers and principals have to give up control.</B></I></P>

<P>That goes back to what people are basically like. People aren't decent, sharing beings, by nature. We want to be, we strive to be, but we're basically insecure and fearful. And we're always trying to create what will make us more secure.</P>

<P><I><B>People find their comfort zone and don't want to leave it.</B></I></P>

<P>That, again, is basic human behavior. The comfort zone is security. That's why change is so threatening to people. It means we must move out of our comfort zone. Change, then, is moving to a level of incompetence&#151;and we are uncomfortable there. But we must learn to move on.</P>

<P><I><B>It can be very exciting, but very scary, too.</B></I></P>

<P>Yet with courage, we can set up systems to manage change whereby we don't punish people for poor outcomes; we manage in order to obtain good outcomes. That's one way to deal with change so it isn't so scary.</P>

<P><I><B>You've said in the past that you &#145;don't like standardized tests&#146;&#151;assessments&#151;because teachers and others tend to focus too much on the tests and forget about the learning process.</B></I></P>

<P>Well, I guess some means of evaluation is necessary. That's why I like [Harvard professor] Howard Gardner's idea of the student portfolio. The kind of testing I value most and see as most useful is internal testing for the purpose of finding out what children know, so a curriculum can be developed that enables them to grow. I realize you do have to be accountable to the people who pay the bills, to parents, and to society at large, and so at some point external evaluation is needed. But it shouldn't be often, so that you're always testing the kids and worrying about the tests. You really should be worrying about evaluation for the purpose of adjusting your academic program.</P>

<P>I don't like the national standards because we know they will be misused. We know they're not for the purpose of teaching for better growth and development. Everything in our society, all of our history, tells us that what we'll do is compare poor kids and rich kids, and see which people do better, and then we'll say, &#145;See, these kids deserve it, and those kids don't.&#146; There is no question about it&#151;that's what will happen.</P>

<P>We will not develop an index of academic implementation. We won't ask whether there's a full-time teacher who is trained in a particular subject teaching every day in those classrooms. In poor areas, often only substitute teachers teach some classes. And there is tremendous turnover of both teachers and students because of the economic conditions, so there is very little school stability. In such situations, there is no way to evaluate those test results.</P>

<P><I><B>Without the context&#133;</B></I></P>

<P>Right. We'll have the results without the context. And that'll be used against poor kids. I know some people argue that they would use national standards and assessments to point out that kids aren't receiving proper care. But I don't believe it. We already know kids aren't receiving proper care, and nothing's being done. So, I'm opposed to it on that basis. Plus, it's just not useful anyway.</P>

<P><I><B>What is your opinion of using technology to keep track of students' progress?</B></I></P>

<P>I think that's valuable. Students should probably do that themselves also. That's part of the portfolio method wherein students become responsible for their own track records and progress through school.</P>

<P><I><B>Can a computer in the classroom help?</B></I></P>

<P>I think it has value. But there's a notion I want to get across of &#145;increments of gain.&#146; I think most learning is made possible by creating a climate in which kids can learn. And it's only a part of the total learning experience. The next thing is the quality of the curriculum and instruction, which helps to increase the amount of learning. The next element is technology and all the resources you can mobilize in support of the educational process.</P>

<P>Technology is important. It can increase your efficiency and effectiveness; it can reduce time spent; it can help you keep track of records; it can help you organize and manage the process. All those things are very valuable. But, if you have technology in the absence of good curriculum and instruction or in the absence of good relationships, then it is much less useful.</P>

<P><I><B>The computer is blind. It can't see if I'm black or white or if I'm male or female. Kids can take a chance on an incorrect answer.</B></I></P>

<P>That's very valuable. Kids need to be comfortable enough to take chances. But, again, a child has to be to that point to be able to take the chance and to be a manager for himself, which means you have to have relationships and conditions in which the student feels accepted.</P>

<P><B><I>In a November 1988</I> Scientific American <I>article, you called for the formation of a National Academy of Education. Do you still think it's a viable idea?</I></B></P>

<P>I'd like to see it, but I don't think we'll do it unless we get a change in administration. We're going to have to struggle over the next few years, as we privatize education, with a big-stakes atmosphere. In a free market, private enterprises don't have the same responsibility as public ones. If there's no money in it, they can pull up stakes and leave you high and dry. I don't think this country has the luxury or the time to experiment with our children's future. There are enough examples of what happens to poor people in private institutions. If you ask them to meet the same responsibilities as the public system, they can't do it, because they can't make money doing that. You can't provide for the children with the greatest needs and still make money. You can't do it. The reason we have ghettos is simply because there's no money to be made there. And the same thing will happen with education. We're just going to create a different ghetto. We have it already in the public schools. We have more public schools serving affluent areas than we have public schools serving ghetto areas and other troubled areas. One's a higher-cost education than the other.</P>

<P>The danger is that we can't stand as a society with a continued low level of funding for education among that group of children most vulnerable. We can't stand it in our society much longer, or we'll pay the price very soon&#151;it's already happening&#151;and it'll be terrible. There's a geometric progression of social problems, because the undereducated children can't be absorbed into the economy in unskilled jobs any more. So, one kid who doesn't do well in one generation means there will be five in the next generation, 25 in the next, and 125 in the next. That's a very real education problem in this country.</P>

<P>Actually, there are two kinds of education problems. We talk about them as if they were the same, but they aren't. One is the problem of middle- and upper-income kids: They aren't doing well because the culture is rather anti-intellectual. But they're going to make it, one way or another, because of their families or their contacts within the economic system. Then we have a second group of kids whose families are locked out of the economic, social, and educational mainstream&#151;and they're not going to make it, unless the educational system adjusts and brings them into the mainstream. If they don't make it, their failure can pull down the whole country.</P>

<P>We should worry about the others, but they're not the real problem. America will survive and can flower, even with scores that aren't the same as Japanese students' scores. The real problem is the kids who aren't being developed to the level where they can participate.</P>

<P><I><B>You've been at this since 1968&#151;here we are, in 1992. Will it happen?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, you've got to have leadership that fully understands the nature of the problem. Not only the educational problem, but how that's related to the economy and the future of the country.</P>

<P><I><B>That doesn't exactly answer the question.</B></I></P>

<P>We have to hope that it will happen. Right now, the vision is not there; the understanding is not there. But you can't say it won't develop. So you have to hope that it will develop, and you have to keep plugging away and helping people understand. The people who are voting against the policies that would make the education of all kids possible have got to understand what that means to their future.</P>

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/2ldarlin.gif" align=left hspace=10><B><I>Linda Darling-Hammond is professor of education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and co-director of the National Center for Restructuring Education, Schools, and Teaching (NCREST). She is a member of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and the National Academy of Education. Her current research involves school restructuring, authentic assessment, and accountability. Darling-Hammond is editor of the</I> Review of Research in Education <I>and co-author of</I> Assessing Teacher Supply and Demand <I>(1988). This interview is an adaptation of one conducted by Phillip Harris, director of the Center for Professional Development for Phi Delta Kappa (PDK). The original conversation is part of</I> Reinventing Our Schools<I>, a series of six video programs jointly produced by the Agency for Instructional Technology and PDK.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><I><B>How would you evaluate efforts to reform education during the past decade?</B></I></P>

<P>I think we've seen a realization that the demands on education are changing substantially from what they were when we invented the system nearly a century ago. I think the <I>Nation At Risk</I> report, released in 1983, was wrong in arguing that schools have gotten worse, which was much of the implication. In fact, schools have gotten a lot better, but the demands on schools have increased even more. We now have to educate every student for a kind of &#145;thinking work&#146; rather than for assembly-line or semi-skilled work, as we did years ago. Since 1983 we've gone from trying to make the present system more efficient to developing a set of initiatives to transform the system into something new that can carry us through the 21st century. We started out in the &#146;80s with a whole set of new mandates&#151;more course requirements, more tests. We tried harder to do what we had been doing. Now we're rethinking the whole design.</P>

<P><I><B>What role do you see technology playing in this process of rethinking the design?</B></I></P>

<P>Technology has several roles to play. The redesign of schools is in part intended to help us focus on active learning&#151;doing research, accessing information, using resources to answer questions and solve problems. Computer technology and databases can be enormously helpful in allowing students to look for information in a variety of ways. Computers can become real tools for making students capable and active learners connected to many resources, and laserdisc technology is extremely useful. For example, having a database, such as an encyclopedia, on disc allows students to ask questions and get answers or watch demonstrations. Students can solve complex problems by using interactive videodiscs that allow them to posit various solutions and then see the results play out on the disc. Student decisions get factored into the way the problem unfolds&#151;this represents another form of active learning. Videodiscs allow teachers to bring into the classroom experiences that otherwise might take many weeks of field trips to accomplish. Technology can also help us create broader communities of learners not only in the classroom but also with other people, both children and adults. Just as electronic bulletin boards and on-line conferences allow people in medicine and business to share information and pursue ideas together, linking schools to one another can allow students to create a community of learners. They are in contact with students in other states or countries, and their pursuit of answers leads them to communicate across cultural and geographic boundaries; they can pool different kinds of knowledge and resources. The same possibilities are true for teachers.</P>

<P><I><B>In school reform&#151;what are some of the promising practices that you have seen?</B></I></P>

<P>One encouraging sign has been the rethinking of warehouse schools, which were invented in the early part of this century to process large numbers of students. The Coalition of Essential Schools [CES] is a model for what I think schooling will become over the next century. The Coalition is reducing the size of high schools, personalizing education, and orienting it around ideas and understanding rather than superficial coverage of curriculum. It's ensuring that adults come to know the minds of students well. In New York City a new initiative is creating 50 small high schools that ultimately will replace large, comprehensive warehouse schools. The warehouses turn 50 percent of the students into dropouts and spend large sums of money on security guards and truant officers instead of teachers. Essentially it's a system of education that doesn't work, and we're in the process of reinventing it.</P>

<P><I><B>It almost seems as though we might be better off if we eliminated compulsory education.</B></I></P>

<P>Well, there are people who propose that. In that case, at least everyone in school would want to be there. However, I do not think this is good social policy, as it would exacerbate inequality. I think most young people want to be in a school where they are known and cared for. But relatively few young people, particularly in large urban school systems, are in such schools, where the goal is to find their talent and develop it rather than to use sorting mechanisms to decide who gets an education and who doesn't.</P>

<P><I><B>Are we seeing an end to the practice of using schools as sorting mechanisms?</B></I></P>

<P>I think we are&#151;not so much because people suddenly feel that everyone is entitled to the same quality of education, but because the demands of society have changed dramatically. We're moving from a manufacturing age, which needed a lot of semi-skilled workers, to an information age, where virtually everyone has to be prepared to think and solve problems and work on levels that were reserved for a few in the past. Schools have to prepare all students for thinking work. The task no longer is to sort out those who will get high-status jobs requiring education; the task is to develop the talents of every individual to meet society's needs.</P>

<P><I><B>Do we know enough to develop the talents of all children?</B></I></P>

<P>We know an enormous amount about how people learn, how they learn differently, how to help those who have different starting points and styles of learning. The problem is that the knowledge produced by educators, researchers, and others is not widely shared across the profession. It needs to be transmitted across the array of schools. Entering professionals&#151;teachers and administrators alike&#151;need to understand how to teach so that all people can learn.</P>

<P><I><B>Is the problem rooted in our training program?</B></I></P>

<P>We do not invest enough in preparation programs for school professionals. We can come up with new standards for teaching and learning, new ideas about curriculum, and new assessment mechanisms, but if we do not invest in helping educators understand how people learn and how to address their needs with a variety of teaching strategies, then everything will be in vain. We have never invested in teachers in this country. We've created a system in which we regulate heavily and tell teachers what to do. We create teacher-proof curriculum. We pay teachers relatively little, and then we spend enormous sums creating a superstructure of supervisors to look over their shoulders. We spend one out of every two education dollars outside the classroom. It's a huge waste, and we can't continue such a strategy and hope to improve schools.</P>

<P><I><B>You mentioned new assessment mechanisms. A major trend in alternative assessment is now taking place. Do you think this will continue?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes, I think there's a growing awareness that we have sacrificed a great deal by relying on proxies for achievement, such as those that can be measured by multiple-choice, norm-referenced tests. I think we now understand that, in the cause of efficiency and easy scorability, we have created incentives for &#145;dumbing down&#146; the curriculum, for focusing on low-level rote skills rather than on performance skills and abilities. We've created our own problems by producing students who cannot write and think analytically because they're not called upon to do that in assessments.  I think we will see a tremendous amount of energy spent in developing performance-oriented assessments. I suspect that in 20 years you will not see the use of norm-referenced, multiple-choice testing in this country to any significant degree.</P>

<P><I><B>Won't this require massive changes in curriculum?</B></I></P>

<P>Absolutely. We are beginning to transform the curriculum from a passive process of dumping information from one head into another&#151;information that is quickly forgotten&#151;to a process in which kids are engaged in actively looking for their own answers, cooperatively solving problems, accessing information, synthesizing it, analyzing it, presenting hypotheses, and testing them. This kind of learning is more sustained and useful. We must enable teachers to work this way with students and to demonstrate students' accomplishments with assessments that look for and capture powerful thinking. Changes in curriculum and assessment must go hand in hand if we hope to achieve widespread use of what has been called a &#145;thinking curriculum.&#146;</P>

<P><I><B>In what ways can technology support the changes you see coming in curriculum and assessment?</B></I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/2ncrest.gif" align=left hspace=10>I can think of several ways. Teachers on line can share ideas, debate issues, display authentic assessments to one another, work through scoring questions, evaluate rubrics, look at student work and what it represents, and talk over problems they've encountered and strategies to deal with them. Currently NCREST, in cooperation with CES, Foxfire, and Project Zero, is developing a project that involves 60 teachers, a national faculty for authentic assessment. The teachers, drawn from various school-reform movements, are on line with one another, creating assessment ideas and critiquing and supporting one another as development proceeds. This network has turned out to be an enormously powerful tool. Another use of technology in assessment procedures involves the development of interactive videodiscs and computers as devices for storing student portfolios and student demonstrations. Such discs, showing what a student has accomplished and what standards he has attained, can be sent from school to school, or from school to college as part of an application for admission. A project now under way in the state of New York has the CES working with state partnership districts to put individual student portfolios on disc to show a school's approach to instruction. These discs will provide useful tools as the process of reform moves forward. Another tool will be an assessment data bank that allows schools to call up the assessment prototypes of other schools to examine possibilities on which their own authentic assessments can be built.</P>

<P><I><B>Are there any barriers impeding the school-reform movement today?</B></I></P>

<P>For one thing, we have mixed policy messages. Teachers are being asked to teach in new ways and to develop new approaches to assessment, but at the same time they're being asked to continue to be responsive to multiple-choice, norm-referenced tests. As one teacher in California put it when they were implementing the new mathematics-curriculum framework, &#145;It's a Catch-22. They want me to teach in a way that they can't test, but they want me to continue to be accountable to the old tests.&#146; We have old models of instruction and teacher evaluation that were enacted under the assumption that teaching is standardized, that students are standardized&#151;as if to say that, if you just learn through a formula, it will all work out in the end.</P>

<P>Another barrier is the lack of investment in the preparation and development of teachers. We will never manage to teach all children well until teachers know how students learn and how to teach effectively with a variety of approaches that can reach students with different experiences, languages, cultures, and learning styles. We've assumed that knowledge can trickle down from a giant bureaucracy. We'll seek the single best way to do something, and we'll encode that in teacher-proof curriculum packages, textbooks, testing programs, and directives, and then we'll ask people to follow those directives. But if you look at Philadelphia, where teachers have had rigid lesson plans telling them what to do and when to do it every day of the year, you will see that kids simply don't learn that way.</P>

<P>A third barrier is the dramatically unequal funding that schools in rich and poor communities receive. One of the major ways our education system differs from those of many other countries is that theirs tend to fund schools centrally and equally. In the United States there is a 10-to-1 difference in spending between the richest and poorest districts. We have schools with enormous resources&#151;gymnasiums, computers, qualified teachers&#151;and we have places where the asbestos is falling out of the ceiling, the textbooks are 30 years old, no playground exists, and few teachers are qualified. Some schools in New York City have faculties on which 85 percent or more of the teachers are untrained and inexperienced. We'll never improve those schools with the present approach to funding. We have to equalize resources if we want to educate all students well.</P>

<P><I><B>Is there anything incompatible between alternative assessment and the movement toward a national curriculum and set of standards?</B></I></P>

<P>Standards that indicate ways in which a curriculum can better support learning can be very helpful when they're voluntary, when they're put forward as a tool for others to use and learn from and adapt. But if national standards are legislated&#151;if they become linked to national assessment&#151;we're in big trouble with the school-reform movement. This is because the standards contain a lot of contradictions that can't be worked out nationally. The current history standards are at odds with the proposed social-studies standards, which in turn are different from the civics standards. Such differences can't be resolved at the national level. You've got to let local people make sense of them in a curriculum. Some schools are trying to develop an interdisciplinary curriculum, but the current national standards are discipline-based. Tying national tests to discipline-based standards would destroy the interdisciplinary-curriculum work of CES and others. And if we try to create national tests and align those to national standards, we will eventually repeat what happened with the National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], which changed from an authentic approach to assessment to a multiple-choice approach. We'll slide backward in our quest for assessments that capture critical-thinking approaches to teaching and learning.</P>

<P>In 1969 the NAEP was a performance assessment. It had students singing, performing music, doing artwork, and writing compositions. Then it became clear that it was expensive to assess students doing these things, and, as the federal government withdrew some support, the assessment became increasingly a multiple-choice process until it began to measure only lower-level cognitive skills. Now we're trying to move in the other direction again. The way to get effective teaching and learning is not through national tests but through assessments developed by local communities, with teachers, parents, and community members involved, so that students are working toward more challenging standards and teachers are learning how to look at students differently, how to support their learning better, and how to think differently about standards. We can't achieve that with top-down national tests.</P>

<P><I><B>What advice would you give to educators who are interested in reforming their own schools?</B></I></P>

<P>Start by listening to students. Students know a lot about how they learn and what conditions they need in order to learn well. If we start by listening to students rather than throwing facts at them, we will evolve a set of ideas for changing schools that will have a certain authenticity and grounding that might not otherwise emerge. I'll never forget the time one of my daughters came home from school and said, &#145;You know, if the teachers would stop talking, we could get our work done.&#146; That's the kind of thing you learn every time you talk to students. If they're engaged in active learning, they're really understanding things in new ways.</P>

<P>Next, think holistically. If we're really reinventing schooling for the 21st century, we can't do it by changing one little thing while hoping to keep everything else the same. If you try to change the curriculum without changing school organization, grouping practices, testing procedures, and other things, the curriculum reform will die. If you change governance and don't change anything else, you don't get good results. You have to think holistically. You may not do everything at once, but you must consider how one piece affects the others so that, ultimately, the school revolves around the learner in every way it functions.</P>

<P>Finally I would say, stay in it for the long haul. Change is always difficult; it takes time; it seems threatening. Established ways of doing things are more comfortable. But don't be discouraged that the process creates conflict. There must be some conflict, and then you must find ways to resolve it. Listen to different points of view. New voices and new constituencies should become involved. Everything upsets the apple cart to some extent, but eventually, if the focus is on students and learning, those difficulties&#151;though they will never disappear completely&#151;will lead to a deeper conversation and a richer learning environment than we have today.</P>

<P><I><B>Are you hopeful about the future of education in our country?</B></I></P>

<P>I'm very hopeful. I'm hopeful because I've had the privilege to work with an enormous number of dedicated, committed teachers, school principals, and teacher educators who are willing to do whatever it takes to reach kids and to create a future for them that can maximize their potential. It's not going to be a piece of cake, obviously. But I think people are committed, and that's what will make it happen.</P>

<P><I><B><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/4schmid1.gif" align=right hspace=10>To the average viewer, not much is wrong. But some scientists and public health officials would say a great deal is wrong with it. Electromagnetic fields emitted by your child's computer screen could be hazardous to her health. Here's why and what to do about it.</B></I></P>
<BR>

<P>Ever since the late 1970s, when American epidemiologists began studying the 50- to 100-hertz electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by power lines and computers, debate has been ongoing over whether this extremely low frequency radiation can cause or promote cancer. In 1979, an epidemiologist in Denver observed that children who lived in homes located close to power lines had an elevated incidence of leukemia. More recently, some researchers have argued that the low doses of radiation emitted by computer visual display terminals (VDTs) could also be a potential health risk&#151;a risk that may depend, in part, on how much time we spend at our computers, how we position our computers relative to our bodies, and how far away from the screen we sit.</P>

<P>Today, according to a July 1993 survey by the National Education Association, 90 percent of public schools and 52 percent of classrooms have computers. Although students may still spend about six times as many hours in front of a TV set as they spend in front of a school computer every week, their contact with the universe of electronic information is accelerating. Multimedia CD-ROMs, a booming educational software industry, and the Internet&#151;with its data banks, library catalogs, and virtual classes&#151;are making the computer increasingly the center-piece of classroom learning.</P>

<P>One index of the rapidly growing technology and education market is a variety of new publications targeted at schools and young VDT operators. In May 1994, a consortium of Massachusetts software manufacturers in collaboration with education professionals released <I>The Switched-On Classroom</I>, a step-by-step guide to acquiring and implementing video display technology in the state's public schools. By September, several new magazines had begun wooing the estimated 15 million American households with both kids and computers.</P>

<P>From the technology how-to manual to the consumer publications, the dominant tone is one of boundless enthusiasm. There is little talk of any VDT health hazards. In <I>The Switched-On Classroom</I>, typical case studies include a Monson, Massachusetts, elementary school that rotates students through computer stations for daily course work in math, science, and language arts, and a Revere, Massachusetts, magnet school where each classroom is equipped with a multipurpose wall outlet that hooks up computers, cable TV, satellite programs, VCRs, and two-way broadcast video. The first issue of <I>Family PC</I>, a monthly that made its debut in September, tells parents how to make sure their kids are getting enough computer time at school and offers instructions on how to turn the family PC into a Halloween party game.</P>

<P><B>Health Hazards</B><BR>
But while the computer industry continues to supply schools and homes with indispensable new technology and to propose creative ways to use it, the rumblings over health hazards persist. There is a wealth of scientific data to consider before we plug in and switch on. All electrical equipment, including computers, produces EMFs of varying degrees of intensity. In most cases, the fields fall off rapidly with distance from the source, but when a person stands under a power line or close to an electrical appliance, a weak current is induced in the body. The 50- to 100-hertz fields emanating from power lines and VDTs fall into the extremely low frequency (ELF) range. And unlike radiation at much higher frequencies, such as x-rays and ultraviolet light, these fields have commonly been considered benign.</P>

<P>When the 1979 Denver power line-leukemia study was published, most scientists were skeptical of its conclusions. Surely, many believed, other factors such as air pollution or socioeconomic class could explain the elevated cancer rates. But by 1990, the Denver study had been replicated by several&#151;initially disbelieving&#151;epidemiologists, and new studies were under way to investigate cancer rates among electricians and telephone line workers, adults with high chronic occupational EMF exposure.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the connection between power lines and computers had been made in 1982 when Karel Marha, a biophysicist in Canada, announced that VDTs, like power lines, emit 60-hertz EMFs. Furthermore, he noted, these fields are pulsed&#151;the currency is turned on and off 60 times a second&#151;unlike naturally occurring sources of electric and magnetic radiation, such as sunlight. The pulsed fields from VDT monitors, Marha reported, produce potentially harmful biological effects.</P>

<P>As the number of computers in the workplace multiplied during the early 1980s, unusual clusters of health problems among VDT users cropped up repeatedly. The first documented complaints involved eye problems: blurry vision, nearsightedness, even cataracts. A second wave of complaints involved clusters of female computer workers in different parts of the country who reported high numbers of abnormal pregnancy results, including spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, and congenital birth defects. In 1984, after the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) investigated several of these cases, Dr. J. Donald Millar, the institute's director, testified before a congressional subcommittee on health and safety that, based on available scientific evidence, &#147;VDTs do not present a radiation hazard to the VDT operator or to the developing fetus.&#148; Nevertheless, Dr. Millar affirmed, plans were under way for a NIOSH study on the reproductive health of VDT workers. As it turned out, the United States was already lagging behind the rest of the computerized world. By 1987, two Swedish studies and one Spanish study had found significant malformations in mice and chick embryos that had been exposed to EMFs similar to those emanating from computer monitors.</P>

<P>The problem pregnancies and the animal fetus studies seemed to substantiate Karel Marha's thesis about the negative biological effects of EMFs from computers. But the official response to these findings was very different in Sweden than it was in the United States. Marha had insisted that EMF emissions could be controlled effectively without much effort. He suggested that computer manufacturers incorporate shielding devices into their monitors' basic design and that users sit farther away from the screens. In 1986, the Swedish government established an emissions limit for computer monitors in the public sector, called MPRI. But in this country, the findings were met with virtual silence from both the press and the government. In fact, the federally funded NIOSH study on reproductive health had suffered repeated setbacks and was still in the planning stages.</P>

<P><B>Yea or Nay?</B><BR>
Today, frustratingly little has changed. Sweden is on to its second, more stringent VDT emissions guideline, MPRII, while the U.S. government has yet to take an official stand on the issue. For <I>New Yorker</I> writer Paul Brodeur, who brought this issue to the public's attention in several long articles in 1989, the government's failure to take swift action on EMFs amounts to nothing less than a federal cover-up. For other experts, it is the inevitable result of working on an issue about which there is much scientific debate, no conclusive evidence, and considerable big business interest at stake.</P>

<P>A major problem with the epidemiological studies on power lines and childhood cancers and on VDT use and female reproductive health, for example, is that the relative risks (the increased probability of disease in the exposed population) are small&#151;often within a 1.5 to 2.5 range&#151;so their significance remains controversial. By contrast, studies on smoking and lung cancer obtain relative risks in the range of 20 to 30. Some experts fear that small positive effects could be the result of subtle bias in an experiment's design or could reflect the influence of other, unknown variables. A paper published in 1991 by David Jackson, a particle physicist at the University of California at Berkeley, for example, challenges the association between emissions and cancer. Jackson compared data on the consumption of electric power in this country with data on the incidence of cancer over the course of the century. He found that although per capita electrical consumption has increased by 2,000 percent, cancer rates (with the exception of respiratory cancers largely attributed to smoking) have remained stable.</P>

<P>To complicate matters further, no consistent dose-response relationship between emissions and health effects has been established. We still don't know how much radiation for how long is bad for us. In the Denver cancer studies, children's EMF exposure was not measured but only estimated according to the voltage of the power lines near their homes. Actual exposures would vary depending on one's location within the house and the amount of electricity in use at a given time.</P>

<P>Recently, however, several studies have emerged that support the existence of a dose-response relationship. In 1992, Finnish researchers found that women whose computers emitted fields between 4 and 9 milligauss (the unit for measuring magnetic fields) had twice as many miscarriages as women whose computer emissions were below 4 milligauss. The length of exposure was also a factor. The highest rate of miscarriages occurred in the group of women who used higher emission computers for more than 10 hours a week. The results of an important study from Sweden's Karolinska Institute released the same year also found a significant dose-response relationship between magnetic field exposure and childhood leukemia.</P>

<P>In the United States, there were different findings. In 1991, the results of the NIOSH study of reproductive health and female VDT workers were published in <I>The New England Journal of Medicine</I>. No increased risk of spontaneous abortion was discovered in the control population.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/4schmid2.gif" align=left hspace=10><B>Conflicting Interests</B><BR>
What do we make of these conflicting results? Are some studies more reliable than others? How can we tell? For the Swedes, the latest batch of EMF research, although not definitive proof of a health hazard, was the impetus for formulating an official position on emissions. In September 1992, Sweden's National Board for Industrial and Technical Development declared that it would &#147;act on the assumption that there is a connection between exposure to power frequency magnetic fields and cancer, in particular childhood cancer.&#148; In the United States, no such statement is expected soon.</P>

<P>&#147;The anxiety of the public on this issue is enormous,&#148; says Dr. David Carpenter, dean of the School of Public Health at the State University of New York in Albany, &#147;and we're hiding our heads in the sand. Too many of the players have a conflict of interest.&#148; As Dr. Carpenter points out, much of the American research into EMFs has been financed by federal agencies or major utility companies, a situation that may affect the kinds of questions that are asked and the way results are interpreted. Berkeley physicist Jackson's investigation of cancer data and electricity consumption was supported in part by the Department of Energy. Not coincidentally, the same agency is a major benefactor of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), an academic consortium dedicated to developing America's technology infrastructure that was hired by a federal committee on radiation research and policy to conduct an independent scientific review of EMF health hazards. In 1992, the ORAU panel concluded that extremely low frequency EMF &#147;does not constitute a public health problem&#148; and that &#147;in the broad scope of research needs in basic science and health research, any health concerns over exposures to ELF-EMF should not receive a high priority.&#148;*</P>

<P><SMALL>(*From the Executive Summary of &#147;Health Effects of Low Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields,&#148; June 1992. Prepared by an ORAU Panel for the Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy Coordination.)</SMALL></P>

<P>This sort of mitigating language comes as a relief to utility companies and manufacturers of electrical equipment who could possibly face retroactive liability for their customers' health problems. Two years ago, a Florida man sued a cellular telephone company, claiming that his wife's death from brain cancer was due to EMFs emitted by her phone. Recently, several cancer patients have sued utility companies whose power lines run through their backyards. Although none of the suits has been won by the complainants, Dr. Carpenter predicts it is only a matter of time before the computer industry becomes a target of litigation as well. If the federal government were to acknowledge EMFs as a serious potential health hazard and enforce emissions limits, some manufacturers could face exorbitant costs in order to make their products compliant with the law.</P>

<P>Despite possibly biased funding sources for epidemiological studies, aggressive lobbying on the part of utilities and computer companies, and the poor record of federal agencies on conducting research, it is not clear that the government is deliberately broadcasting misinformation about EMFs. Even if an association between EMFs and health effects could be proved, a viable theory about how the fields interact with the human body to promote or cause cancer is still lacking.</P>

<P>Dr. David Savitz, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who replicated the 1979 Denver power line study, disagrees with the ORAU panel's conclusions but insists there is &#147;room for legitimate differences.&#148; Cautiously optimistic about the progress of EMF research, Dr. Savitz suspects that VDTs will not turn out to be a major health risk. &#147;Evidence for a hazard is suggestive but uncertain for power lines and electrical workers,&#148; he observes. &#147;In the extrapolation of that information for VDTs, the concern goes down markedly.&#148;</P>

<P><B>A Prudent Policy</B><BR>
The point is that we are working in the realm of educated guesses. We just don't know enough about what kind of dose at which frequencies is dangerous. In the absence of a national standard on EMFs, however, concerned consumers have fashioned their own policies of prudent avoidance, and public schools have been among some of the most visible advocates of precautionary measures. In 1991, the New York City Board of Education adopted stringent guidelines on computer emissions, becoming the first public institution in the country to do so. The reasoning was simply that computers are here to stay and might as well be made as safe as possible. &#147;There is no other electrical appliance used by so many people for so many hours a day that produces such an enormous range of electromagnetic radiation,&#148; observes Michael Mason, a consultant on EMF issues who helped devise the New York City Board of Education's policy on VDTs.</P>

<P>There are easy, inexpensive precautions we can take with VDTs while waiting to find out the extent of the health risks. For computer manufacturers, the costs of making monitors compliant with MPRII is minimal, less than 10 dollars per monitor. The liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors often used with laptops are a viable alternative. Although they involve expensive technology, LCD monitors typically do not generate significant emissions and have recently become available for use with desktop models. In addition, the design of the computer work station can play a crucial role in reducing exposure, because most of the emissions come from the back and sides of a monitor and tend to fall off rapidly with distance.</P>

<P>Before working with the New York City schools, Mason, in collaboration with an architect, had designed offices at the Fund for the City of New York, a nonprofit organization that advises the city and other municipal groups on policy issues. Low emission monitors had not yet come on the market, so Mason improvised a spatial solution. He arranged 43 work stations in such a way that every employee was at least five feet away from the sides or back of another's display. At each cubicle, the keyboard rests in a tray attached to the edge of the desk. This allows the VDT operator to reach the keyboard comfortably while maintaining a 28-inch working distance from the screen. Pregnant workers at the Fund were requested to use one of two LCD desktop monitors purchased from Norway.</P>

<P>When Mason was hired by the New York City public schools in 1991, lower emission monitors were available, but typically only the newest models met levels established by MPRII. At the time, the New York City school system owned 60,000 computers for students and staff and was acquiring 6,000 to 8,000 new models on an annual basis. The school system's computer orders for the following year had already been placed. Under Mason's recommendation, however, the school system warned its vendors that it would not accept delivery of any monitors that failed to meet emissions limits at least as stringent as MPRII. In a pioneering gesture, the vendors responded positively. Wherever necessary, substitute monitors were found, and Mason tested a sample of each model at 53 specified measurement points according to MPRII test protocol to verify compliance.</P>

<P><B>Money Matters</B><BR>
The New York City Board of Education's successful campaign for low emission VDTs has paved the way for other school systems and communities to follow suit. But without support from the federal government, schools may fare unevenly in their quest for control over EMFs. In wealthier communities, school systems may be able both to hire a consultant for an EMF evaluation and to pay for suggested alterations. After the Woodmere Middle School in Hewlett, Long Island, was found to have some of the highest EMF emissions in the state of New York, the local school system developed a proposal to build a new $10 million school at a different site and hired a consultancy firm to do a thorough &#147;magnetic field survey&#148; in early 1994. As a result of the survey, the school system spent $50,000 during the summer on adjustments in basic wiring and reconfiguration of classroom space. Student VDTs will now be positioned at optimum distances from each other, and in the Early Childhood Center, children will no longer sit on floor areas situated directly over fluorescent lights on the ceiling of the floor below. More substantial alterations, including the shielding of electrical equipment and of classrooms located close to electrical sources, involve expensive materials and await budgeting approval.</P>

<P>Rebuilding and renovating schools is expensive, but simply purchasing the safest VDT can be costly as well. Today, most of the major U.S. computer manufacturers sell monitors that meet MPRII guidelines, but older, noncompliant models are still on the market. Louis Slesin, the publisher and editor of <I>VDT News</I>, a bimonthly newsletter that addresses computer health and safety issues, warns that public schools may well be stuck with less sophisticated, older models. &#147;A lot of poorer districts can't afford to buy the new computers,&#148; Slesin says, &#147;and many depend on hand-me-downs. We don't know whether there is a risk, but what's happened is that computer companies have begun to fix a problem without ever admitting there was one or what it was.&#148; Unless manufacturers are forced to retract older models, it may be years before MPRII-compliant monitors reach classrooms in some parts of the country. In New York City schools, where the monitors meet the Swedish guidelines, classroom space is at a premium and computer terminals may not always be configured at recommended distances from each other.</P>

<P>Although no one can say for sure whether money spent on reducing EMFs is money wasted, parents, teachers, and schools ought to be informed about both potential health hazards and preventive measures as they make their technology choices. Understanding EMFs and the risks associated with them is part of computer literacy. As Michael Mason points out, if you factor in the costs of medical care, prudent avoidance begins to look like a bargain.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Carole Novak</H3>
<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="jescalante.gif" align=right hspace=10><B><I>Jaime Escalante is best known from the 1988 feature film</I> Stand and Deliver<I>, which chronicled his efforts to raise standards at predominatly Hispanic Garfield High School in East Los Angeles by training his students to take the Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus test.  Expectations had been very low for Garfield students, but Escalante changed that.  By 1987 Garfield was ranked fourth in the country in the number of students taking the AP Calculus test.  It wasn't easy.  Escalante was demanding of his students, abrasive with his colleagues, unrelenting in his insistence that everyone&#151;including himself&#151;pursue excellence.  By 1991, he had been ousted as chair of the Mathematics Department and had moved on to other challenges, including teaching Basic Math and Algebra at Hiram Johnson High School in Sacramento.  In partnership with the Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education (FASE), he is also involved in the production of a Peabody Award-winning PBS series, &#145;Futures&#146;, and other projects based on his classroom techiques.  His biography,</I> Escalante: The Best Teacher in America <I>by Jay Mathews, was published by Henry Holt & Co. in 1988.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><I><B>What would you tell President Clinton or Education Secretary Riley about the state of education in this country?</B></I></P>

<P>We do not have to mix politics with education. No. We have to understand that the problems we have in L.A. are completely different than the problems we have in Chicago. The problems we face are local problems&#151;we have to tackle them with the different tools we have in each state or in each city. Money is not the only problem. Public education is a better solution than private education. We have great teachers in America, teachers who can really motivate and do the job. What we have to emphasize is the motivation of the students to do the work, to work together, and to share ideas. And we must teach in the classroom what these kids are going to be using in real life.</P>

<P><I><B>Do you think American education needs to be restructured or reformed?</B></I></P>

<P>One hundred percent.</P>

<P><I><B>What's the first thing you would do?</B></I></P>

<P>One of the things I would do is have colleges and universities prepare those great teachers who will be working with our kids by emphasizing academics. Let me put it this way: If you ask the kids about sports, they know all the names of the players and all their statistics, and when you talk about music, they know all the rap artists and their songs. But if you talk about science, chemistry, history&#151;they don't even know what it is; they don't even open the book. Another thing is that we have to have the kind of curriculum standards that will prepare these kids for life. And it's very important for us to treat the kids in the classroom as if school was their job.</P>
 
<P><I><B>If you were a university dean of education, what would you do about your institution's requirements for teacher education?</B></I></P>

<P>I would emphasize academics: mathematics, science, and chemistry. Also, I would emphasize that teachers need to teach ethics, morals, and responsibility to the kids. Those are the things I think are lacking in our curriculum. Some people think that those concepts are related to religion. No, they are not. It's just logic and thinking. So we need to emphasize that by trying to develop the simple concept of responsibility in our kids.</P>

<P>This is the key: Colleges and universities have to make the teaching profession more attractive; and they have to prepare these youngsters to teach those concepts in high school, and to motivate their students. It's not necessary to emphasize subjects that you don't use in real life. Only three things are important to the teacher: First, to have command of your subject; second, to know how to motivate the different ethnic groups we have in this country in order to preserve the unit&#151;because the unit, or team, will give you success; and last, to understand your kids and keep a good relationship with them. A good relationship will be a giant step to success.</P>

<P><I><B>Is there a need for national standards and assessment practices? Would you advocate a national test?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes. It's necessary to have that. It's important to prepare these kids to take a test like the AP Calculus test to know how to tackle those kinds of problems. I do teach my kids how to take the test. I tell them to find the key word, then go to the first step, and move to the next, and so on. And I have trial tests in the classroom. It's necessary; academically speaking, it puts the kids ahead for the rest of their education. They become familiar with that kind of selective test, or standard test.</P>

<P>Another reason I'm in favor of, for instance, the AP Calculus test, is because it tells us that we teachers are doing the job. If in my school I'm just giving out grades, and there is no kind of competition, I could tell you I'm the best teacher because all my kids got As. The test is important to prove I'm doing that. We teachers need to practice quality control. You see, that's what I do. After my kids take the test, I look at the results, and I say, &#145;I blew it&#151;I need to emphasize factoring more next semester.&#146; That's the only way to improve your teaching.</P>

<P><I><B>Accountability on the part of the teachers, too.</B></I></P>

<P>Naturally. And it's a kind of competition with other schools. I have a team approach; I tell my kids that they're the only school that could beat the Japanese. I say, &#145;If you take this test and you score high, you prove you are prepared.&#146; And even though some of my kids may not score high, the ones who took the test are exposed to the experience, and I'm positive these kids will do a good job in college.</P>

<P><I><B>So, the discipline of studying for the test is valid in itself.</B></I></P>

<P>Yes&#151;that's one of the things that helps, you know. It's another way to motivate and to have discipline, by spending a little time to prepare for the test.</P>

<P><I><B>Do you think the international comparisons of test scores are valid? Are the disappointing results something we need to worry about?</B></I></P>

<P>They are. Unfortunately, here's the situation: When our kids compete in mathematics, science, and chemistry, they rank at the bottom five among industrialized nations. Why is that? Because these kids are not exposed enough to these subjects&#151;they are taking &#145;Mickey-Mouse&#146; classes in high school! They are not being challenged, and the teachers are allowed to get away with it. That's why some people think private schools are better than public schools. No. The teachers have to emphasize academics, compare test results with other countries, and keep the United States number one. There is no reason why we have to fall behind. We have everything over here: We have great teachers, we have equipment, we have the new technologies. What we have to do here is to use those things and transmit to our kids that they are expected to assimilate the material. The teacher is the one who plays an important role in that.</P>

<P><I><B>Do you use technology&#151;computers, videotapes, multimedia, that sort of thing&#151;in your classroom?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, I do use some videotapes to motivate these kids&#151;not the whole period; only five, ten minutes. I'm in opposition to the use of television just to kill time. Unfortunately, a person watches television on average of six hours every day. Now, that's not gonna help us at all. So that's the reason why FASE developed the &#145;Futures&#146; tapes of my classroom, which PBS is broadcasting. And they're developing a new multimedia project to teach basic math. We must understand we have to use the new technologies. Otherwise, we fall behind. You see, many years ago, we didn't have more than long playing [LP] records; now we're talking about CDs. This is an application of new technology. What we teach in class has to reflect what the kids will use in real life, and part of that is technology. The kids have to be open to it, because it's all over. And that's the only way we'll be able to compete with Japan or any country in Europe.</P>

<P><I><B>Why aren't you teaching calculus courses via satellite teleconference?</B></I></P>

<P>I'd be glad to do it, but I would have to prepare the students in the different approach I use. For instance, for the first 10 weeks, I do not use any book. I just do experiments in the classroom to show the applications of calculus, and then I develop the things kids need to know. Because, in order to speak the language, you have to know the alphabet; in order to know the alphabet, you have to write the letters. So that's what calculus is. You have to have a strong background in all the different rules you'll be using. The second part of my course is the application of the things learned in the first 10 weeks. Teleconferencing would be good for teacher enhancement, but for now, I'm working with FASE on the multimedia project. In this case, they were impressed with the way I motivate the kids in basic math, because that's their weak point. Most of the kids don't like math; they have a negative image. FASE was surprised the way I do, for instance, fractions, so they came to this school with the cameras and they captured some of the things I do to motivate the kids. So that's part of the project; another part is algebra, and the third part is calculus.</P>

<P><I><B>So, basically, there'll be a series of Escalante math classes available in multimedia format?</B></I></P>

<P>Right. Classes, assignments, companion print materials, everything.</P>

<P><B><I>Let's talk about motivating students for a minute. One of the great scenes from</I> Stand and Deliver <I>is when your character tells the kids their ancestors, the Mayans, had developed the concept of zero, they should have pride in that, and believe they can learn math. Did you really say that to your class? Do you use a form of ethnocentric education in your classroom?</I></B></P>

<P>Yeah. I did say that in the classroom; I would talk about the Mayans, to motivate the kids. The movie is 90 percent true. But, you know&#151;anybody could learn. The important thing is the kid has to be ready to learn, willing to learn. Otherwise, it's difficult for us. The minds of the kids are on basketball, music, or copying those funny haircuts, and so on. In order to motivate them, we have to touch those points they will remember. We have to use that to reach kids in different ethnic groups. I said to one kid, for instance, &#145;Look, your future is not to become Michael Jordan. He's a super, superstar in basketball; you are not. Your future is to become a superstar engineer or technician, to become something positive in life. And education is the ticket to success; education is your life. So take this as an example,&#146; I told him. &#145;This guy shoots the ball nicely; he has a really good math concept. Use that math concept in your brain to become a professional&#151;but not a professional basketball player.&#146; I do pull some examples from the Hispanic community, the Black community, the Anglo community, the Vietnamese community here, and so on, to motivate.</P>

<P><I><B>You're not necessarily using ethnocentric education. You're using whatever it takes to motivate the student.</B></I></P>

<P>Naturally. That's what it is. That's the point. It goes like this: Teaching is touching life.</P>

<P><I><B>How would you compare your experience at Garfield High to the one you're having now at Hiram Johnson?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, I have three different kinds of thoughts in this regard: My experience back home in Bolivia was completely different than the experience I got from Garfield High School, and the experience I'm getting over here in this school also is different from Garfield. This is simple: Garfield High was a more homogeneous class. Mainly there were Mexican Americans, about 98 percent, or they were from Mexico or Central America. And it was easy to joke with the kids, for instance, in their language. Also, I was able to build a strong reputation with the parents, so I was well-known. Here at Hiram Johnson, I am dealing with four different ethnic groups. I have the Anglo kids, the Black kids, the Chicano kids, and also the kids from Vietnam&#151;and I have to use a different approach when I talk to each kid.</P>

<P><I><B>So there really is a difference in the type of student&#133;</B></I></P>

<P>Naturally. You have to understand the student. Some think you have to use psychology&#151;no, no, no. This comes from the experience you get in the classroom. The experience that counts is that earned in the arena.</P>

<P><I><B>Your style seems to be that of a coach with his team. Is the teacher really a coach?</B></I></P>

<P>This is true. I'm just a coach. In some of the classes&#151;for instance, in period five&#151;the kids call me &#145;Coach.&#146; I do ask them to have determination and to believe in themselves, to be disciplined and to put in hard work&#151;and that's the only way they'll succeed. I say to the kids, &#145;If you believe in yourself, that means you're thinking positively, and you'll make it; you're gonna do it! But, if you have a negative image about yourself, you'll really kill yourself. One of the greatest things you have in life is that no one has the authority to tell you what you want to be. You're the one who'll decide what you want to be. Respect yourself and respect the integrity of others as well. The greatest thing you have is your self-image, a positive opinion of yourself. You must never let anyone take it from you.&#146; And so, that's the key. I also tell the kids, &#145;Keep in mind: A coach is only as good as the talent on the team. You see the Lakers&#151;if they become champs, they're a good team. Who gets the credit? The coach! That's what I'm doing for you. If you succeed in life, it's a big plus for your last name, it's a big plus for your school, it's a big plus for the country.&#146;</P>

<P><I><B>If you could give one message to young people who are going into education, who want to be teachers, what would it be?</B></I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="1escalante.gif" align=right hspace=10>I would say only one word: Fun. Teaching is fun. Grading papers is part of it, but it's not just that. Teaching is touching life, and it is motivating these kids to do something positive for themselves and for their country. We need good people; we need people who are responsible, people who are able to create, to innovate. If a kid can read, understand, and come up with some change, he's thinking. I have in my classroom, all around the top of the wall, the word &#145;Freedom&#146; written, I don't know how many times. I tell my kids once they walk into my classroom, they'll have the freedom to raise their hands, ask questions, answer my questions, and do the assignments. I tell them I'm positive that they'll be a success, because I want them to be a success. One of the kids asked me how I define freedom. And I told him that freedom is the power to choose to make a change in the right direction. Not negatively. That's not freedom. I tell my kids that only five percent of the people think, and then 10 percent of the people think they think, and 85 percent of the people prefer to die before they think. I tell them to think of mathematics as just a game. &#145;You follow the rules,&#146; I say, &#145;and you're gonna be a big mathematician. You don't need anything else more than desire to learn, which I call <I>ganas</I>.&#146; If we could teach our kids how to think, how to communicate&#151;we'd have the job done. That's what we need.</P>

<P><I><B>Have any of your former students gone into teaching?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes, a few of them. As a matter of fact, there were three teachers&#151;one in chemistry, one in math, and one in elementary school&#151;from the Class of &#146;82, the kids who made the movie. We had a reunion last year, and do you know what they told me? They said they were better teachers than me, and everybody knew it, but because I caught the eye of the media, they could not become stars! Now, that's a great class. They have pride in what they do and they are really doing a good job and enjoying it. And they told me they sometimes use the &#145;Futures&#146; tapes in their classes to motivate their students and to show them the kind of life they can have if they study hard.</P>

<P><I><B>Why did you become a teacher?</B></I></P>

<P>I remember my mom, who was a teacher in Bolivia. She used to cut up oranges to demonstrate fractions. When I asked her why she did that, she told me this: &#145;If I give you money, you'll only spend it and it will be gone. But if I teach you something&#151;make you remember something&#151;you'll have it forever.&#146; That is what a teacher does. My mom demonstrated to her students what a fraction actually was, what it looked like; they could touch it, too&#151;it was an orange, an everyday thing. It was in their memory. It's like a computer and a disk. You put the disk in, and it works. Why? Not just because of the disk. No. Because there is a memory. But if you also add the keyboard&#151;input something and touch and see it&#151;you learn from it. I wanted to do that for others. Also I had encouragement from my teachers, who told me I had creativity and was independent, and that these are good traits for a teacher to have.</P>

<P><I><B>What do you see in the future for your students?</B></I></P>

<P>I worry sometimes that this generation does not realize how hard the previous generation worked for this country to have all that it has. I see it this way: Each generation must plant a tree for the next generation. Education is the water that produces fruit on the tree, and each child plucks this fruit, which is knowledge. But each generation must also work as a unit and cooperate to nurture the tree and to make life better for the next generation. And so on&#133;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>The Internetworked School: A Policy for the Future</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Barry J. Fishmann and Roy D. Pea</H3>
<HR>

<P>The next five years will radically change the ways that schools relate to the world around them as global computer networks&#151;long the exclusive domain of higher education and private industry&#151;link up to primary and secondary schools. The Internet, a network made up of many smaller contributing networks, represents a powerful educational resource unlike anything that precedes it. Its potential for education grows with the establishment of each new connection.</P>

<P>For the first time, schoolchildren have the means for simple, direct contact with millions of adults in a forum that masks their physical youth and presents them as virtual equals. However, just as the new kid in school has to learn new social codes and rituals to fit in, schools must learn some of the practices and etiquette of the Internet. Of course, the established denizens of the Internet will soon have some adjusting to do as well, with thousands (or millions) of new kids knocking electronically at their doors. Since the Internet was not designed with children in mind, many potentially difficult issues must be discussed by both the education and the Internet communities.</P>

<P>This article presents a framework for thinking about some of the issues that are essential to making the initial encounter between schools and the Internet successful. It also presents an excerpt of a policy that embodies our approach to resolving those issues.</P>

<P><B>Expanding Access, Expanding Horizons</B></P>

<P>For roughly the past decade, schools increasingly have participated in specialized computer networks such as the NGS/TERC Kidsnetwork, the Intercultural Learning Network, and FidoNet, as well as for-profit services such as CompuServe, America Online, and Prodigy. The majority of these projects were conducted on networks, where teachers' or students' messages could not be read by anyone beyond a predetermined audience composed of other students and teachers. These projects made it possible for students and teachers to communicate with their peers in faraway places and pioneered some pedagogical uses of networks for computer-mediated communication and collaborative project work that will carry over to the Internet.</P>

<P>Internetworking, however, goes beyond proprietary systems by joining a vast number of distinct networks into one large network, the Internet. As individual schools and bulletin boards are connected to the Internet, the number of people and services within easy reach increases exponentially. By one estimate, there are currently 19 million users of the Internet, with an annual growth rate approaching 80 percent. Furthermore, some of the Internet's most powerful communication tools are specifically designed so that any of these millions of people could join any conversation. The network's true power comes from the synergy of many dispersed minds working together to solve problems and discuss issues, and there is little in the way of hierarchy or control of the discourse.</P>

<P>The schools' shift to internetworking systems involves critical technological, as well as pedagogical, issues. It requires a change in the school computing paradigm from centralized computing to distributed client-server systems, thus bringing about an administrative change in the nature of school computing. Many schools that currently have some kind of network access provide accounts only to teachers or administrators. Internetworking is fundamentally different&#151;giving accounts, access, and therefore control directly to students.</P>

<P>There are numerous arguments for the pedagogical benefits of school internetworking. But what of the risks? What safety, liability, and, above all, educational concerns must be addressed before schools are ready to tap into the Internet? This policy is not intended as a document that sets limitations or restrictions. Rather, it is designed to facilitate and set guidelines for exploring and using the Internet as a tool for learning. The policy was written with the purpose and goals of the Internet as a background: support for open research and education in and among research and instructional institutions. The context for the policy was provided by the specific needs of a growing community of learners composed of students, teachers, scientists, and researchers. The networked environment must support collaboration and cooperation. Proper frameworks to support network navigation and information searching must be established. And because networks will continue to be a scarce educational resource for the foreseeable future, the policy also provides guidelines for maximizing the educational cost-benefit ratio for teachers and students.</P>

<P><B>Testbed for Change&#151;The CoVis Project</B></P>

<P>Our framework for considering internetworking issues is a project currently being conducted at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. The Learning Through Collaborative Visualization Project, CoVis, is designed to reconceptualize and reconfigure high school science education. CoVis is a networking testbed funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Its goal is to enable project-based approaches to science by using low- and medium-bandwidth  networks to put students in direct contact with practicing scientists and scientific tools. In CoVis, we are working with the types of network connections we believe will be common in schools in the near future.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="1fishman.gif"align=right hspace=10><I>Ken Lewandewski, standing, teaches earth science at Evanston Township High School. Here he supervises freshman students in the CoVis classroom as they use a cruising program to network with other students. Ryan Hart, left, Myah Smith, and Seiji Hori are observing weather data from the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.</I></P>

<P>In the first phase of our project we are working with two Chicago-area schools, Evanston Township High School in Evanston and New Trier High School in Winnetka. CoVis is deployed in 12 classes at the two high schools, involving three teachers at each school. Approximately 300 students are involved in the project: 100 freshmen, 100 sophomores and juniors, and 100 seniors, all enrolled in either earth science or environmental science classes. Each classroom contains six Macintosh Quadra computers with audio/video conferencing units linked to an internal ethernet, which is linked to Northwestern's ethernet by a primary-rate Integrated Services Digital Network bridge for telecommunications using the public-switched network. Additional computers are available for Internet use in computer labs at each school.</P>

<P>The CoVis Network Community consists of students and teachers in CoVis classes, scientists who wish to collaborate on CoVis student projects, the researchers conducting the Covis project, and other interested parties who are granted special accounts. In the CoVis classroom, each student is given an account that makes him or her a &#147;full&#148; member of the Internet community. This means two things: Each student has access to all Internet services with minimal mediation by teachers or other adults, and anybody with an Internet account can contact the students directly, again without mediation.</P>

<P>In addition to the standard Internet resources, which include electronic mail, listservs, Usenet news discussion groups, Telnet, gopher, and file transfer, CoVis makes it possible for students to communicate with peers and scientists via video and audio conference tools and remote screen-sharing technology for synchronous collaborative work. Therefore, the CoVis Network Use Policy goes beyond the needs of the typical low-bandwidth internetworked school.</P>

<P>As an NSF testbed, CoVis has the job of developing new frameworks for the use of internetworking. In seeking to understand problematic issues of networking, we turn both to other projects&#151;Bolt Beranek and Newman's work with the Ralph Bunche computer-minischool in New York; AT&T's Learning Circles; and TERC's LabNet project&#151;and to analogous situations extant in schools. Our attention thus is placed on the development of a policy to establish ground rules for the students who will be introduced to the Internet.</P>

<P><B>The Need for a Proactive Policy</B></P>

<P>Exciting or revolutionary educational programs too often are derailed. In the 1970s, Jerome Bruner's curriculum Man: A Course of Study (MACOS) was at the center of a political and ideological firestorm that prevented its implementation in many schools. The experience of the MACOS developers taught us that it makes sense to spend time in the initial stages of a project trying to determine what challenges might arise to an educational innovation in order to avoid, preempt, or co-opt them.</P>

<P>In March 1993, the Communications Policy Forum, a nonpartisan group of telecommunications stakeholders convened by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, met on the issues of Internet services for the K&#150;12 educational community. The forum concluded that services should be provided only to schools that would indemnify the service providers. It also recommended that a warning statement be developed to advise schools of the presence of materials on the Internet that may be deemed inappropriate for minors.</P>

<P>We believe that it is not enough to devise a policy designed to protect schools and service providers, although our policy also speaks to those roles. In this policy designed to guide students through some of the social complexity presented by the Internet, we created guidelines to alert novice users of established expectations and practices. Because the Internet is somewhat anarchic in its daily commerce, it is necessary to define a safe local space, or identity, for a school network where students can feel like members of a supportive community. The goal of establishing the boundaries of our own community forms the framework of our policy.</P>

<P><B>Issues and Analogies</B></P>

<P>The kinds of issues posed by internetworking are not new. Similar issues have been debated by schools many times before, from creation science to dress codes. These concerns resurface in the availability of networked material that some parents, teachers, or students might find objectionable, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate. Although the actual percentage of materials in this category is small, their mere presence draws plenty of media attention. Consider this lead-in to a story about graphic material that can be retrieved through the Internet, published in the <I>Houston Chronicle</I> in 1990: &#147;Westbury High School student Jeff Noxon's homework was rudely interrupted recently when he stumbled across the world's most sophisticated pornography ring&#133;. It was supported by taxes and brought into town by the brightest lights of higher education.&#148;</P>

<P>While some are shocked, an alternative interpretation might point out that in using a valuable resource provided by the local university, a high school student chose to view material that many (including regular Internet users) find objectionable. Educators must understand that, as a byproduct of introducing internetworking, schools likely will have to justify student use of network resources to a public that does not understand the medium or its utility to education. By seeking out analogous situations and applying them to the development of our network use policy, we believe it is possible to establish frameworks for responding to these challenges. We found several significant analogies.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><P> <B>American Library Association (ALA).</B> In considering information access issues, the most striking and informative analogy is to a remarkable set of documents built around the ALA's L<I>ibrary Bill of Rights</I> of 1980. It is not farfetched to consider the Internet, at least in part, as a vast digital library. After all, the electronic database and information search tools it employs are rapidly becoming part of new school media centers, and many public and school libraries are beginning to offer some type of network access to their patrons.</P>

<P>The ALA documents state, &#147;Attempts to restrict access to library materials violate the basic tenets of the <I>Library Bill of Rights</I>.&#148; However, they add, what goes into the library collection should be chosen thoughtfully and with an eye toward instructional goals. School librarians are bound to devise collections that &#147;are consistent with the philosophy, goals, and objectives of the school district,&#148; and they must &#147;resist efforts by individuals to define what is appropriate for all students or teachers to read, view, or hear.&#148; Similarly, tools used to access the network must be designed to direct access to materials that support curricular concerns. Thus, the interface to the network embodies the notion of a library collection. In a school network policy, the &#147;intent of the collection&#148; should be clearly reflected in a statement of purpose for the network.</P>

<P>Directly addressing the information access needs of children, the ALA opposes attempts to limit access based on the age of a library user. &#147;Librarians and governing bodies should maintain that parents&#151;and only parents&#151;have the right and the responsibility to restrict the access of their children&#151;and only their children&#151;to library resources,&#148; it states.</P>

<P>While we in the CoVis Project have some ability technologically to restrict what is in our Internet &#147;collection,&#148; it is virtually impossible to prevent students from accessing materials whose presence we never anticipated while preserving the students' status as full members of the Internet community. In this way, the Internet is fundamentally different from a relatively static library collection. Following the lead of the ALA, however, we believe that the precise limits placed upon students' access cannot be formalized by the school policy. Instead, it is the students' responsibility to adhere to the standards set by their parents.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>American Society for Information Science (ASIS).</B> The code of ethics of ASIS provides another informative analogy, this one speaking to issues of professionals' responsibilities to both individuals and society. Where individuals are concerned, information professionals&#151;a designation we believe should be applied to teachers&#151;must strive both to &#147;protect each information user's and provider's right to privacy and confidentiality&#148; and &#147;respect an information provider's proprietary rights.&#148; With respect to society, information professionals should &#147;serve the legitimate information needs of a large and complex society while at the same time being mindful of [the] individual's rights.&#148; They also should &#147;resist efforts to censor publications.&#148;</P>

<P>The ASIS code speaks directly to issues of electronic mail privacy. We believe that students and teachers must feel certain that their communications are private. In many electronic mail systems currently used in schools, the teacher must act as an intermediary between the school and the outside world. When students are &#147;full&#148; members of the Internet, mail is sent directly to the outside world with no human mediation. As a rule, such communications should be private, and the network policy must make explicit any reasons for teachers or researchers to have access to message content. Users must be made aware of times and circumstances under which private mail may be monitored.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Prodigy.</B> Privacy in electronic mail communications seems like a straightforward issue&#151;it is analogous to the U.S. mail. But what about network bulletin boards or Internet newsgroups? Posting a message in one of these public information exchanges may raise questions of freedom of expression among students and other network users, but no more than in any other public forum.</P>

<P>One approach to dealing with this issue was described in the <I>Wall Street Journal's</I> technology supplement of November 15, 1993. Prodigy, a dial-up bulletin-board service jointly owned by IBM and Sears, has a strict editorial policy for both its public forums and its members' private e-mail exchanges. Prodigy employs editors who screen every message before it is posted, sometimes delaying posting by up to 40 hours. It also uses special software to screen messages for what it deems objectionable language. The result is a lowest-common-denominator approach to what is acceptable or unacceptable material.</P>

<P>This approach undervalues the maturity of Prodigy's users. In the CoVis classroom. we want to strive to develop students' maturity, and in order to learn these lessons, they must feel that their message content is under their own control. To let students know what level of behavior is expected of them, we are very clear about the use of offensive, obscene, or inflammatory language on the network. These guidelines are not unfamiliar to the students in CoVis, as their local school codes of conduct include the same admonitions. Offensive messages posted by students are not ejected from the network. However, students can lose their privileges on the network if they post such messages (a significant disincentive for CoVis students), and they are encouraged to post a retraction or apology once they understand why their message was problematic. These interventions are only initiated upon the complaint of another user, not as part of an explicit editorial policy.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>School Conduct Codes.</B> Every school has a code of conduct for its students that details appropriate school behavior, outlines rights, and sets expectations for students. Because the CoVis Network is used as part of a school activity, the school's code of conduct applies to network activities. Thus, we believe the network use policy should be an extension of the school's policies. An important part of the development of the CoVis Network use policy was a close reading of the participating high schools' codes of conduct. For example, at one of our high schools, special rules against vandalism of computer equipment and unauthorized access to information exist. These rules cover such important concepts as computer piracy, hacking, and other tampering with hardware or software. Both CoVis schools have codes warning students that use of harassing or abusive language is unacceptable, as is obscenity. At the same time, both high schools place a high value on students' right to freedom of expression and outline the dimensions of that right in some detail.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Field Trips.</B> All of the rules that apply to student conduct in school also apply when the students are off campus on field trips. The Internet offers many opportunities for virtual field trips to distant locations, and CoVis adds a new twist to this genre with the addition of full audio and video connections to remote locations. Students in the CoVis community will be able to "visit" the Exploratorium in San Francisco, directing a remote camera around the exhibit floor and engaging in conversations with guides and other museum visitors. It is important that students realize they act as ambassadors for their school in such encounters, and our policy states this explicitly. Currently, parental permission slips are required before students may take field trips. At one of our participating high schools, such slips are required even for &#147;trips&#148; within the school building. Is there a precedent for extending the concept of permission slips to the virtual field trip? We do not believe so, but we do recognize the importance of written information alerting parents to interesting or innovative school activities.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Beyond the Barriers</B></P>

<P>Barriers to internetworking in schools are being lowered every day, and soon electronic bulletin boards may be as familiar to the American classroom as blackboards. Educators are encouraged by continuing developments that make the Internet accessible to schools. This is accomplished in part through commercial networks such as America Online and Delphi and by the decreasing costs of modems and communications software. With the cooperation of nearby universities, dial-up Internet connections can now be obtained for an investment of under $100 per existing computer.</P>

<P>Schools will find tremendous new opportunities for enhancing, extending, and rethinking the learning process with the advent of internetworking. But will they be ready to face the challenges? To date, schools have had little experience with advanced telecommunications technologies. Many classrooms still lack even such basic tools as telephones. Given the general lack of communication even between classrooms in the same school, it will not be easy for schools to join in the fast-paced discourse of the Internet. The CoVis Project has taken a proactive stance toward the issues that internetworking raises for schools with the development of a network-use policy based upon the best lessons available. We invite feedback on our policy and offer it as a contribution to this exciting and rapidly developing area of educational technology.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Interview with Gerald R. Ford</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Mardell Raney</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I><IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/gford.gif" align=right hspace=10>Gerald Rudolph Ford was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 14,1913, and grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan, and earned a law degree from Yale in 1941. In 1965, he became House Republican Leader, and was chosen by President Richard Nixon as Vice President to succeed Spiro Agnew. On August 9, 1974, following the
resignation of Nixon, Ford became the 38th President of the United States, serving from
1974-1977. During the 1976 campaign, he narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan to win the
Republican nomination, choosing Senator Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate. Gerald
Ford's political philosophy is best summarized by one of his favorite speech lines,  &#147;A government
big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything
we have.&#148;</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><B><I>During your administration, education was under the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, isn't that correct?</I></B></P>

<P>Right. HEW was the parent of the Department of Education. In my administration, I chose David
Mathews, who had previously been president of the University of Alabama, to be Secretary of
HEW. Terrel Bell served under Mathews as the nation's 21st U.S. Commissioner of Education.
<I>[Bell, former Superintendent of Public Instruction in Idaho, was later appointed Secretary of
Education under President Reagan and served from 1981-84.]</I></P>

<P><B><I>What was the emphasis of education during your administration?</I></B></P>

<P>Under the leadership of Mathews and Bell, our emphasis was to stimulate local involvement in
education, not only in terms of money, but also in increased parental and community activity.</P>

<P><B><I>Some candidates in this 1996 Presidential campaign propose abolishing the Department of
Education. Do you agree with that proposal?</I></B></P>

<P>I'm not certain that's desirable or necessary, although I was very satisfied when I was President
with the setup that existed, which consisted of a Commissioner of Education within the
Department of HEW. From my personal observation, that system worked, but I'm not convinced
that it's necessary to go back.</P>

<P><B><I>In general, what do you think of the state of education today in the United States? Has it
improved or declined?</I></B></P>

<P>I'm more optimistic than most of the skeptics. My exposure comes primarily from involvement
with my granddaughters. Three of them go to public schools in Winston Salem, North Carolina;
and our daughter in Tulsa has two daughters who attend private schools. I'm convinced that
education today is doing a better job than all of the cynics are trying to convince us. While I'm not
up-to-date on test scores and new standards, my experience is very positive. I know that my
granddaughters are getting a better education than I did.</P>

<P><B><I>School reform is a very real and ongoing issue today, of course. For instance, in your home state
of Michigan, Governor John Engler has instituted some massive school changes in which he's
changed the focus from the local level to the state level, away from teacher unions and so forth.
What are your ideas on that? </I></B></P>

<P>Basically, I support Governor Engler's changes. He got a statewide referendum that drastically
changed the funding. In Michigan, local real estate taxes were a major part of the funding for
education. He got Michigan voters to add to the sales tax by an overwhelming margin, and in that
way to change the funding focus.</P>

<P><B><I>Was this a positive move?</I></B></P>

<P>Yes, it was a step in the right direction because real estate taxes had gotten way out of line in
Michigan, and then there was the add on of sales tax. In my judgement, an increase in the income
tax is a better approach.</P>

<P><B><I>Who should be primarily responsible for quality and accountability in education?</I></B></P>

<P>I'm an old traditionalist. I still think that local school boards should be the place where primary
responsibility lies, and I like the idea of voters picking school board members. It may not be a
perfect method, but I don't see any better alternative.</P>

<P><B><I>What role should education play in a democracy? Do citizens need to be educated about rights,
responsibilities, and benefits?</I></B></P>

<P>No question about it: If you don't get the general public interested in the broad scope of
education, you've failed in a democratic society.</P>

<P><B><I>How might this be accomplished? Should schools stress the study of civics and government more? </I></B></P>

<P>I think we must. I was shocked at a report several months ago on how badly informed today's
students are about government. That was sad. Somehow we've got to offer more and better
courses on what government is at the local, state, and national level. If people don't know about
their government, they can't be constructive participants.</P>

<P><B><I>I agree. Only 57.5 percent of our 18-year-old high school graduates voted in the 1992 Presidential
election. How can we encourage young people to vote and to participate in government? And can
we somehow restore public service as a noble calling and respected occupation? </I></B></P>

<P>I was one of the leaders in getting the constitutional amendment permitting 18-year-olds to vote
in federal elections <I>[Article XXVI, ratified July 1, 1971]</I>. Therefore, I am terribly disappointed
with the poor performance record of 18-year-olds in voting for officials&#151;from the President on
down. I think the generation that has the biggest stake in the future of this country has a moral
obligation to participate in all federal, as well as state and local, elections. I don't have the answer,
except I think we've got to push and prod and encourage young people to vote. They have a big
stake in the end result of every election at all levels of government.</P>

<P><B><I>Should the federal government be involved in curricular decisions&#151;what our children are taught in school&#151;and is it qualified to make such decisions? What kind of responsibility and authority should
it have in this area?</I></B></P>

<P>I have a broad view. I don't want ideological groups interfering with the general curriculum. I
resent special interest groups trying to impose curricula or their own limited vision or agenda. I
think we must have a broad view, and we shouldn't let ideologues dictate what education should
be.</P>

<P><B><I>What about equality of learning opportunities for all students, regardless of race, gender, culture,
or socioeconomic condition? Does everyone today have equal opportunity to learn? And how do
you feel about efforts such as school busing? </I></B></P>

<P>I went to a school system in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where there was no problem with
integration. It was totally integrated&#151;in the classroom, in sports, in every way. So I grew up in a
society and a school environment where integration was accepted and endorsed. I've always had
reservations about court-mandated busing, and I think courts are backing off because that kind of
program wasn't successful.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3fordfam.gif" align=left hspace=10><I>President and Mrs. Ford and Susan walk with Liberty at Camp David. August 7, 1976.</I></P>

<P><B><I>In your opinion, what's the greatest problem facing young people today?</I></B></P>

<P>Young people today need more discipline. They need more direction. They need encouragement. They've got to understand what a great and blessed country we have, and that they can be a part of it if they discipline themselves, if they organize themselves, if they work at it.</P>

<P><B><I>As you know, newer and more powerful technologies are being developed every day that offer the
potential for fantastic learning opportunities. However, technology costs are escalating at a time
when school funding is declining. What's the solution for helping schools exploit these new
technologies, this environment in which students will live and work?</I></B></P>

<P>I envy our granddaughters who were exposed to computers in the first grade. I think it's a
wonderful opportunity, and they will be the beneficiaries. Because our youth will eventually
compete with young people around the world, we've got to find a way to give them the equipment
that puts them in a position to compete in this technological world that we're living in. How you
raise the money or allocate the funds, I can't answer. But somehow our young people have to
have the best equipment available, because that's the only way they can learn to compete on a
global basis.</P>

<P><B><I>Several huge companies and private industries are key players in national telecommunication,
deregulation, and related activities. Do these groups have any responsibility toward schools and
the public, to try to give everyone access?</I></B></P>

<P>Yes, they have two reasons. Number one is a selfish interest: if they don't do something to
enhance educational opportunities for young people, they in turn will be the losers. Secondly, they
ought to have a national interest in doing something in this area for the country as a whole. I feel
very strongly about that.</P>

<P><B><I>Today cyberspace is our newest frontier. We know what exciting and unlimited potential the
World Wide Web offers; however, unrestricted content and access may be a mixed blessing. Who
do you think should be in control? How do you feel about censorship and policing, particularly of
material that children have access to?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, this is a close call. I think, for example in television, we need some self-censorship by the
industry. Certainly some of the things we see on TV and in movies are offensive to me.
Self-censorship would be the better approach. But if the industry doesn't do the job there and in
the areas you're talking about, then inevitably the government will stick its hand in the pot. This
presents a controversial issue. I believe in the First Amendment and freedom of speech, and I
resent the kind of censorship that some people would like to impose. So somewhere between
protecting a right of free speech and having responsible limitation on what is produced is a very
tough dividing line that I hope we can resolve.</P>

<P><B><I>Arthur Burns, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said, &#147;Ford had a better grasp for
economics than any other President that I served.&#148; What do you think about our present economic
situation? Will we be able to balance the federal budget, and what are the implications of either
doing or not doing so?</I></B></P>

<P>We can and must have a program to achieve a balanced budget within the next seven years. It's
not only doable, but it's necessary. And that means we have to do several things. Number one, we
have to put limitations on the growth of entitlement programs. Entitlements are 51 percent of our
cash flow, about $800 billion a year. We've got to restrict the growth. Notice that I didn't say cut,
but restrict the growth. Secondly, we have to stimulate our economy so that it grows at about a
three percent level each year. If we do that, we'll generate new revenue without increasing taxes.
So we have to limit the growth of expenditures, particularly in entitlements, and we have to
stimulate the economy so there's more tax money coming in without a tax increase. I'm against
any tax reduction at this time.</P>

<P><B><I>If you could make any major reallocations of funds in the federal budget, what areas might these
changes cover and how?</I></B></P>

<P>Overall, I think we have to tighten the belt and restrain the growth of virtually every program in
the federal budget, with a few exceptions. The defense department undoubtedly needs some
additional funds, not as much as the Pentagon would like, but more than some of the anti-defense
people would recommend. I also believe that we have to make certain that our environmental
resources are protected, so I would be cautious in that regard. And certainly we have to do the
best we can with education and technology funds. Other than these four areas, I think we have to
hold the line and restrain growth. <I>(In 1976, the final year of Ford's administration, the federal
budget was $76.7 billion; in 1994, it was $203.7 billion [U.S. Bureau of Census]. Alan Greenspan,
current Federal Reserve Board Chairman, was Chairman of Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers.)</I></P>

<P><B><I>What do you consider to be the most important characteristics voters should seek in a President?</I></B></P>

<P>Fundamental experience, leadership, and character.</P>

<P><B><I>I know you're a great student of history; how would you like your own Presidency to be
remembered?</I></B></P>
<P>
I would hope that historians in the future will remember the Ford Presidency as one that restored
public confidence in the integrity and competence of the federal government. When I became President, the public was disillusioned because of Watergate and the war in Vietnam. There was great, great uncertainty about whether government was honest and responsible. In my judgment, the Ford administration restored integrity and confidence in our form of government to the American people.</P>

<P><STRONG><I>In the information age, the new challenge is to add meaning to the onslaught of data available to us. Educational publishers, in particular, must provide easy access to the global information infrastructure for schools and offices.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR><BR>

<P>Choose an answer: If you haven't personally experienced "information overload" yet, it's virtually
guaranteed that you are</P>

<OL type="ALPHABET">
<LI>not enrolled in a school or college,</LI>
<LI>not part of the workforce,</LI>
<LI>somewhat out of touch, or</LI>
<LI>all of the above.</LI>
</OL>

<P>If you chose D, it's time to face up to the three opportunity-packed facts of life today:</p>

<UL>
<LI>A vast mix of undifferentiated information makes it increasingly difficult for "nonswimmers" (i.e., computer-illiterate students or workers) to survive, let alone thrive.</LI>
<LI>The choices offered by today's standard education, business, and government information
systems can be enhanced to include the full range of truly individualized options made possible by
new computer-based, "multisensed" technologies.</LI>
<LI>Drawing on Howard Gardner's concept of multiple intelligences, we now know that learners tend to learn better when multiple senses are engaged&#151;which is what multimedia enables in a very natural way.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Surfing the Technology Wave</B></P>
<P>The publishing industry is well-positioned to surf the new technology wave. The traditional print publishing industry made the switch early on from typewriters, cut-and-paste editing, and linotype machines to computers. We now have the opportunity to evolve our thinking and organizational structure to leverage these technology gains. We can build on the familiar linear process, in which an individual publishing project starts with a group of writers and researchers and progresses through editors to the final product, by encouraging an active "cross-fertilization" of information at all stages in the editing, publishing, and distribution processes.<P>

<P>The opportunity to take full advantage of new technology is by no means limited to the publishing industry. Yet our industry is among those that can make the greatest contributions to society by seizing this opportunity. If students and workers are provided with world-class information that capitalizes on the latest delivery systems, the country as a whole can gain in many aspects of international competitiveness as well as personal achievement and fulfillment.</P>

<P>It is in the publishing industry's best long-term business interests, as well as among our social and civic responsibilities, to offer educational tools that help schools and colleges provide a constant supply of young people who are equipped with the latest skills&#151;and with the understanding and flexibility to upgrade their skills continually to keep pace with emerging technology. We also know that our schooling system will falter and fail unless it is so intimately linked with the business world that the education it provides is truly "job-oriented." Our responsibility, then, is to find the optimal balance of educational content successfully integrated with the power of
multimedia.</P>

<P><B>Beyond the Linear Process</B></P>
<P>There's a tendency outside the publishing industry to assume that the increasingly complex process of information exchange both begins and ends with the author whose name appears on a textbook's dust cover or an article's byline. This explains why publishers typically are eager to enlist authors that have gained a certain level of name recognition. The theory of sole-author dominance is being enhanced in the age of the Internet, CD-ROMs, and multimedia textbooks.</P>

<P>High-speed, low-cost, universally available electronic distribution over ordinary telephone lines is enabling us to go beyond the traditional, linear model of multitrack publishing. Today's increasingly sophisticated and discriminating information seekers are accustomed to the added value offered by "media-independent" publishing. One of our technology challenges at The McGraw-Hill Companies is to reinvent and enhance the current linear publishing process with an integrated system that can respond, in real time, to the information demands of emerging multimedia outlets. Rather than accelerating old publishing techniques with faster typewriters, we're developing a vast multimedia database system that codifies and organizes all information&#151;author's manuscripts, reporter's dispatches, editor's observations&#151;into a collective
intelligence to be utilized by all the people involved in the publishing process. New technology will enable all "published" information&#151;magazine articles, television reports, and, most important, educational materials&#151;to be far more accurate, timely, and comprehensive than ever before.</P>

<P>Consider the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of integrated electronic publishing that</P>

<UL>
<LI>feeds the writer's raw product into a single, vast editorial database where all of the raw product is edited, coded, or tagged and formatted according to the same hypertext rules and</LI>
<LI>makes this single, integrated, uniform database readily available for constant and immediate repurposing so that the same accurate, verified, and updated information can easily be switched to different tracks&#151;for print subscribers, for individual electronic subscribers, for online services, for on-site client databases, for multimedia CD-ROMs, etc.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Using relational database programming technology, CTB's publishing operations can draw&#151;instantly&#151;from a wealth of information that is organized for fast retrieval and easy conversion to the final medium.</P>

<P><B>Repurposing</B></P>
<P>Information downloaded from the Internet is, at best, inconsistent, ranging from public-domain, government documents to republished stories from a variety of sources. Even though the Net brings an ocean of information to a person's desk, the information is often out of context and unedited. The Internet is a pervasive, highly influential <I>distribution</I> method for educational materials, but without a publisher making editorial judgments and adding the value of context and perspective, the Internet is lacking as a primary source of information.</P>

<P>With our new electronic publishing model, we can take advantage of the latest technology and allow each of our writers and editors access to a vast, companywide editorial database. Using proprietorial technology, material prepared for a <I>Business Week</I> article on new financial instruments, for instance, becomes instantly available for use in Glencoe's economics textbooks. The new-wave educational package can include multimedia video clips that let us see and hear economists and floor traders debate the merits of the new instruments.</P>

<P>Unlike the public "bulletin board" of the Internet, we have total control over the material flowing into this proprietorial database; this control can assure accuracy and timeliness, regardless of whether a particular end product is a magazine article, a general-readership book, a multimedia presentation, or educational or training materials. We believe an educational publisher must offer this type of integrated editorial database if it is to respond and compete in the 21st century.</P>

<P><B>Electronic College Textbooks</B></P>
<P>One successful integration of effective educational content with the latest technology is our Primis Custom Publishing Division. This customized electronic-textbook publishing system is built around the tremendous wealth of information gathered and coded by the entire organization: financial information from the Standard & Poor's Rating Group; current events and technical analysis from our publications, ranging from <I>Business Week</I> to <I>Chemical Engineering</I>; and educational and medical expertise.</P>

<P>The specialized and copyright-protected Primis information treasure chest is coded to serve 17 different academic disciplines. By connecting with this database electronically, college professors select specific pieces of information and design their own custom-tailored textbooks. Individual instructors pick out material from The McGraw-Hill Companies' organized, edited, and constantly updated collection of textbooks, magazine articles, and technical papers and then mix these materials with their own contributions in whatever format and order they wish. Currently, the Primis system is being used by more than 1,000 U.S. colleges and universities to create timely, relevant, and cost-effective course materials.</P>

<P>In addition, anyone connected to the Internet can search our current catalog of 8,800 books on subjects ranging from architecture to nursing. America Online subscribers can read and download articles from <I>Business Week</I> a day before it hits the newsstands. Or they can search past issues and "chat" electronically with the magazine's writers and editors or with winners from its Schools in the Age of Technology program.</P>

<P><B>Steam Boiler Syndrome</B></P>
<P>Whether for schools, business, or government, integrating new technologies never seems to be easy. In making the transition to any new system, problems and skepticism always are part of the package. For example, 18th-century steam boilers had a tendency to explode and were condemned as monsters. Yet, despite the risks and daunting up-front costs posed by new technologies, human experience repeatedly has proven that early adapters can reap rich rewards for themselves and deliver tremendous value-added benefits to their customers. We think the risk and cost are worth the trouble. In addition, we believe that computer-based information gathering and education should be</P>

<UL>
<LI>totally "transparent"&#151;giving a personal computer, for instance, the ability to gather information as readily from Moscow, Tokyo, or Prudhoe Bay as from your local school or office network without any additional effort on your part or any difference in time or cost, regardless of physical distance</LI>
<LI>equally accessible to all&#151;because every school, library, workplace, and government agency will be seamlessly connected as part of the World Wide Web of the Internet or the Internet's next generation of browers.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Value-Added Information</B></P>
<P>Providing equal access to technology-transparent information gathering is essential but not sufficient.</P>

<P>The next step is to maintain the integrity of the best educational materials and not become distracted by the bells and whistles of new technology. We believe an educational publisher should build on its reputation for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and editorial judgment rather than simply provide bulk information that could be as likely to mislead as to inform.</P>

<P>In the area of educational materials, the implications of new multimedia technology are tantalizing and rich. Multimedia could become the core of new curricula that reach all students in the most effective ways possible. Properly designed and implemented, multimedia offers the ability to provide for Gardner's multiple intelligences by communicating in ways which incorporate all individual learning styles, whether aural, visual, or tactile (also called "hands on"). And because none of us learns by purely one single style, multimedia is capable of addressing all the senses simultaneously in a "natural" way that ideally offers more than even the most animated style of teaching.</P>

<P>Multimedia also can offer students precisely what they will need for tomorrow's working world: familiarity with the newly integrated worldwide "intelligence" that now includes far more accessible data stored in electronic form than is contained in printed form in all the world's libraries. Add to this the prospect that in the very near future, students and entrepreneurs not only will use the Information Superhighway to connect directly with this new global intelligence but also will be able to download information instantly in their own language, regardless of whether the source document happens to be in English, Russian, Japanese, or Hindustani. It's an exciting and challenging prospect, to be sure.</P>

<P>Ideally, multimedia will lead to the wholesale advances in the educational system that educators and parents have sought for decades. The hope is that multimedia-driven educational options will prove to be invaluable and indispensable to the next generation of teachers, students, and workers. It's far too soon to predict precisely what form the school of the future will take&#151;or if it will be located in a distinct school or office building or become a home-based "virtual" school. The only certainty is that if multimedia delivers on its immense promise, then the lifelong learning environment of the future will be limitless because transparent technology will provide students with instant, direct connections to the world's information resources.</P>

<P><B>Online Education</B></P>
<P>We have traveled far enough along the Information Superhighway already to have middle school students in Juneau, Alaska, using the Internet, special keyboards, and synthesizers to improvise and compose music jointly with students in other states and other countries. Through our Schools in the Age of Technology Program, we are bringing this type of innovation to schools throughout the country. One way we do this is by enabling educators across the country to "talk" with winning schools via America Online and share educational concepts and strategies.</P>
 
<P>At Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, New Jersey, Judy Gray, one of the five national winners in<I> Business Week</I>'s fifth annual awards for Instructional Innovation, makes it clear that multimedia has become an essential part of the curriculum for the school's 1,800 students.</P>

<P>As director for Hunterdon's Academy for Continual Development, Gray has found that multimedia can address all the different learning styles, enabling teachers to reach more students more effectively. She explains that it is past time to replace the rigid industrial model of education with new multimedia strategies. At Hunterdon, students are encouraged to use whatever resources work best for them individually, whether these are centered around multimedia or traditional textbooks. Thanks to broad support from the community and the state, Hunterdon High has a computer network that allows students to access school resources 24 hours a day and a communications building housing the high school's own radio and cable TV stations. Gray explains that students find such resources empowering and motivating. Students who aren't naturally inclined to write term papers can create equally challenging multimedia projects that present the same content and require the same synthesis of information.</P>

<P>Hunterdon High has had to change, both to prepare students for the workplace and to guide them through today's far more demanding curricula. Contrasting the 300- to 400-page biology textbooks that most adults remember with today's 1,200-page versions, it seems obvious that with the same 180-day school year, students increasingly need the proper skills and equipment to access and organize such voluminous materials electronically. That's why Hunterdon High's library includes some four dozen CD-ROM disk services (magazines on CD-ROM) that are regularly updated and easily accessible from any student's home computer.</P>

<P>The advent of multimedia does not mean that every student has to use a computer. Multimedia offers valuable options for students in their search for information and knowledge.</P>

<P>The "multiple intelligences" of multimedia-based education enhance our innate human skill for deriving meaning from multiple sensory inputs. To be successful, an educational publisher must recognize the power of this emerging medium and maximize its potential. Publishers that develop their own internal publishing resources to reflect the "hyperconnectivity" of the distribution media will define the future of educational publishing. </P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Interview with Milton Friedman</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Mardell Jefferson Raney</H3>
<HR>

<P><STRONG><I><IMG SRC="/journal/bios/mfriedman.gif" align=right hspace=10>Milton Friedman, senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution since 1977, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Science in 1976. He taught at the University of Chicago from 1946 to 1976 and presently is Paul Snowden Russell Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Economics there. Friedman is widely regarded as the leader of the Chicago school of monetary economics, which stresses the importance of the quantity of money as an instrument of government policy and as a determinant of business cycles and inflation. His publications include</I> A Theory of the Consumption Function <I>(1957)</I>, The Optimum Quantity of Money and Other Essays <I>(1969)</I>, Bright Promises, Dismal Performance: An Economist's Protest <I>(1983)</I>, Capitalism and Freedom <I>(1962), and</I> Free to Choose <I>(1980)&#151;this last with his wife of 57 years, Rose D. Friedman. He served as economic advisor to Senator Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan during their campaigns for the presidency and for Presidents Nixon and Reagan during their terms of office. A member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1971, Friedman was awarded the National Medal of Science and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1988. TECHNOS Senior Editorial Advisor, Mardell Raney, recently spoke to Friedman about his economic policies and how they might improve American public education.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR>
<P><B><I>We all agree that our most important assets are, and always have been, our children. And their education is of paramount importance. In some of your recent writings you've addressed the enormous problems that our educational system faces today. What do you think is the solution?</I></B></P>

<P>In my opinion, the cause is the key to the solution. Why is it that our educational system is turning out youngsters who cannot read, write, or figure? The answer&#151;simple but nonetheless correct&#151;is
that our current school system is a monopoly that is being run primarily by the teachers' unions: the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. They are the strongest trade unions in the country and among the most powerful lobbying groups. They, quite properly, look after the interests of their members, not after the interests of the children whom their members teach. Many of their teacher-members are very concerned about this situation. Indeed, that's demonstrated dramatically by the fact that a larger fraction of teachers in public schools send their children to private schools than the population at large. In places like Chicago and Los Angeles, where the problem is particularly serious, something like twice as large a
percentage of public school teachers send their children to private schools than does the public at large.</P>

<P><B><I>How did this come about?</I></B></P>

<P>In a sense, what's going on now in our school system is exactly what went on in East Germany in  automobile production. When you have a collective, single, monopolistic producer, inevitably that producer produces a poor product: in the case of East Germany, it was the infamous Trabant car. With no competition, some people do very well, but most people do badly. The same thing is true of our current school system: it's a socialist system, the largest socialist entity in the United States, other than perhaps the military. As a result, like all socialist systems, it produces a low-quality product, with some exceptions (as always, there are special cases). And it benefits a small group of people: in this case, primarily the unions, at the expense of a large group of people. This was not always so. When I went to public school, you did not have the trade unions; you did not have the monopoly. It was a much more decentralized, locally controlled system. But even before the post-War period, there was a tendency to centralize the control of the school system. Although we currently have over 10,000 public school districts in the United States [the current figure is 16,438], this is a small fraction of the number that existed in 1932. As our population has multiplied, school districts have been consolidated. Control by local parents and authorities has been replaced by control, first by the civil servants of the community, then by the state board of education; next the federal government stepped in, and, finally, the unions have put their imprimatur on the whole lot.</P>

<P><B><I>So do the unions now have the final control?</I></B></P>

<P>Now, don't misunderstand me. The people who run the unions aren't bad people; they're good people&#151;just like all the rest of us. But their interests and the interests of a good school system are
not the same. In my opinion, you cannot get a good school system run by a monopoly. And, similarly, I do not believe there is any effective way of reforming that school system from inside. The only way you can reform the school system is by competition from outside&#151;competition that will make them shape up or shut down. Let's continue my analogy of the automobiles. At the end of World War II, West Germany had the same kind of people and the same capacity as East Germany. However, instead of adopting a centralized system of control, they adopted a competitive system. And the result was that you had Volkswagens, BMWs, and Mercedes. In the
same way, we in the United States need to break the monopoly of the unions in the public school system and expose it to competition.</P>

<P><B><I>How do you do that?</I></B></P>

<P>Today about 10 to 12 percent of our children go to private schools, but those private schools are of two kinds: they're either the very elite schools with high tuition charges, which are patronized by the very well-to-do families in the community; or they are schools that are financed from other sources, such as parochial schools, Catholic, Evangelical, Jewish, Lutheran, etc. And other than the relatively small group of more elite schools, almost all private schools are of the latter kind. [The latest figure is 23,186 K&#150;12 private school buildings.] That's because, if somebody down the street is giving something away, it's very hard for you to sell it and make a profit!</P>

<P><B><I>What about examples of privatization that now exist? For example, although The Edison Project
schools have received enormous amounts of private money and support, some of them are
struggling for survival.</I></B></P>

<P>The Edison Project was originally intended to produce competitive schools. But they have not been able to because they cannot surmount the obstacle of being forced to compete against somebody who's giving away&#151;supposedly for free&#151;what they're selling. Of course, it's not free. It's being paid for by the taxpayers and those parents who choose to send their children to private schools, parents who are being forced to pay twice: once in their taxes and again in the tuition they pay. Our present system, in my opinion, is thoroughly inequitable. People who have income have choice. They can decide where they want to live; they can move to a community that has a relatively good school system, or they can send their children to a good private school. The lower-income groups, the people at the bottom, have much less choice. They either go to the
public schools in their districts or they can go to these private schools where they are, in a sense, objects of charity. And yet, they, too, are paying taxes to support the school system.</P>

<P><B><I>What kind of tax relief or adjustment would you give parents and how?</I></B></P>

<P>The solution I have been in favor of since I first suggested it 40 years ago, is this: if parents choose to send their child to a private school, they are reducing the burden on the taxpayer in general, and they ought to get at least some of their money back. They should receive a voucher to compensate for the benefit they are bringing to the school system by reducing the number of pupils. You have a system like that today in Milwaukee that's limited entirely to low-income pupils. Initially, it was limited only to non-parochial schools, non-religious schools, but that limitation has been eliminated. However, it's a very interesting situation. After it had already started, the teachers' union and the education establishment brought suit in the courts, calling it unconstitutional. The courts issued an injunction against continuing it on the state level. That's a good example. There was a great public outcry, and people in the Milwaukee community contributed enough money to replace the proposed state vouchers in order to enable the project to continue while it's being contested in the courts. [See &#147;<A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb1friedman1.htm">Variations on Privatization</A>.&#148;]</P>

<P><B><I>What about The Edison Project examples?</I></B></P>

<P>Because The Edison Project was unable to surmount the obstacle of a competitor who was undercutting them, they have now gone into the business of contracting to run public schools. I don't believe that is a good solution. It doesn't really give the power where it belongs, namely to the parents, nor does it really provide free choice to parents. Now, within the public school system, there are some exceptions. District 4 in New York City has gotten a lot of attention because it has constructed quasi-autonomous schools, among which children in the neighborhood can choose. Results have been dramatic, with a great improvement in student performance. But
that's only one very small experiment in a very large city.</P>

<P><B><I>Realistically, how would you go about privatizing educational services?</I></B></P>

<P>If you give parents a voucher, which they could use to buy educational services anywhere, it would provide a market that would be attractive to people who want to set up schools&#151;like The Edison Project&#151;but who have been unable to find a big enough market for it because of the existence of the public schools.</P>

<P>Let me not speak in the abstract. Right now, in California, we are circulating petitions for an educational freedom initiative. It would provide a scholarship to any public school student who chose to go to a private school; the scholarship would range from $1,000 for kindergarten to $3,500 for grades 3 through 12. California is now spending roughly $5,200 per student for education, so the $3,500 scholarship would still leave a substantial net saving for the state. California is spending less than half of that $5,200 in the classroom. Half is going for supervisory personnel, experts, and so on. And while $3,500 may not seem like a lot, it's more than the state is currently spending in the classroom. It's clear that any private enterprise can invariably produce
things more cheaply than the government.</P>

<P><B><I>Who would operate these systems, and with such a tight profit margin, what would be their
incentive?</I></B></P>

<P>We've talked to many potential private entrepreneurs who would like to set up such systems and who insist that $3,500 per child would be enough to enable them to set up a profitable enterprise. The people who would benefit most would be those in the inner cities who would have a totally new alternative available for their children. I applaud the current private schools: they're doing a much better job and are a real advantage to the kids who are able to attend. But at the same time, these schools are operating under conditions where they cannot really be innovative and enterprising; they're nonprofit, and for the most part, religious organizations. A private market of the kind I'm talking about would be energetic, innovative, experimental. No industry in the United States is as backward technologically as our education system. We teach kids the same way today that we did 300 years ago. Just consider what happened in the telephone industry when AT&T's monopoly was broken or what happened to airlines after deregulation. What if you started a private school industry that was made possible by letting people spend their own money instead of giving it to the state to spend? I'm sure that you'd see the same kind of thing in education.</P>

<P><B><I>Tell us about this &#145;educational freedom initiative&#146; and petition that you mentioned earlier.</I></B></P>

<P>This proposal is a public initiative that's been approved by the secretary of state and that is now out on the streets being circulated for signatures. Needless to say, we need not only signatures but also money and publicity. [See &#147;<A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb1friedman2.htm">Educational Freedom Initiative</A>.&#148;]</P>

<P><B><I>A November 1995</I> New York Times <I>article [&#145;School Money Is Serving Social  Needs&#146;] cites a study by the Economic Policy Institute which states that much of the increase in school spending for the last 25 years has gone not to regular classrooms but to educating disabled children,
counseling, other social welfare functions, and for many tasks beyond academics. How would your proposed system address the needs of special students?</I></B></P>

<P>There are two kinds of special students. First, those who are physically handicapped can only be effectively taken care of by some state action or by private charity; you're not going to do that through a private enterprise school system. On the other hand, there's another category of so-called &#145;educationally disadvantaged&#146; children who aren't really that at all in most cases. Those students may be part of programs in which parents get a stipend if their child is classified as educationally disadvantaged, a very broad category. There are many abuses here. But the point I want to make is a different one: One of the worst things that has happened in schooling in my opinion is the tendency to neglect the gifted children and overemphasize the underachievers.</P>

<P><B><I>There are those who would say that gifted children already have an advantage. Can you explain
what you mean?</I></B></P>

<P>The progress of a society comes from the top, not from the bottom. The top pulls the rest of the structure up as it works. In California, the amount of money being spent on programs for the educationally disadvantaged of one kind or another, including bilingually, is five times as large as the amount spent on gifted student programs. This is a great mistake from the standpoint of everyone in society&#151;not merely the gifted children. Competition from the private schools, under the kind of system I'm describing, would more or less force public schools to cut back on that kind of activity and to concentrate much more on their educational functions. I don't believe that schools should be institutions for social change. They ought to be educational institutions that teach kids to read, write, and figure. That's what students need; that's what our society needs.</P>


<P><B><I>Obviously, business and industry has a lot to gain from such an improvement, if schools turned
out better educated and more skilled students. Do you think schools should concentrate on traditional academics? Or should they also help students develop skills for the workplace?</I></B></P>

<P>Neither one nor the other.</P>

<P><B><I>But is it possible to do both well?</I></B></P>

<P>If you have a competitive private enterprise system, students will be able to choose the kinds of schools they attend. And one thing I'm sure of is that you'll see a tremendous variety of schools. Some schools will specialize in science, some in literature. Interestingly enough, right now many schools that train youngsters for vocations&#151;to be a plumber or a TV repairperson&#151;are almost entirely private. And I don't see why that should be the case. Why should a 10th- or 11th-grade student who has a $3,500 scholarship not be able to use it for training to be a television repairperson? And there's no doubt: if you have a free market in this, if you have competition, if there's a demand, schools will rise to meet it.</P>

<P><B><I>If we did indeed have this kind of educational private enterprise, how would existing school systems respond to the competition?</I></B></P>

<P>There's no doubt as to how they would respond: they would improve, or some of them would close up.</P>

<P><B><I>Do you think this might be the collapse of public education as we know it?</I></B></P>

<P>Well if it were, it should be. If schools can't compete openly and freely, with free choice for their students, is it essential that we keep a horse-and-buggy industry alive? My own belief is that the public schools would improve very greatly and that the public school system would not disappear. But it would become smaller, and it would become more competitive.</P>

<P><B><I>You've said that vouchers are not the answer but a means to an end, a transition from a government to a market system. What do you mean by a market system, and who would be in charge?</I></B></P>

<P>The customer. Who's in charge of automobiles?</P>

<P><B><I>The customer.</I></B></P>

<P>Right. And who's in charge of what you see on TV?</P>

<P><B><I>The advertisers?</I></B></P>

<P>No, the advertisers want the customer. The advertiser is not presenting his own views, I assure you.</P>

<P><B><I>So, would parents make these decisions?</I></B></P>

<P>Absolutely, the parents would make the decision. They would get information and shop among schools. One thing that annoys me about &#145;elite&#146; attitudes is that they tend to denigrate the interest and ability of low-income parents to do something about their children. And I know&#151;and you know&#151;that's absolutely wrong. One of the most interesting experiments going on in the United States in the last five or ten years was started by Pat Rooney of the Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indianapolis. He started a private-voucher arrangement. His grant agreed to give scholarships to pay half the tuition of children who qualify for the school lunch program in any private school they chose, up to a maximum of $1,000 or so. They were overwhelmed with applicants and had to turn many away. Since then, such private-voucher arrangements have been established in 15 or 20 cities around the country: in Oakland, California; in Los Angeles; and in
Little Rock, Arkansas, for example. They're all over the country. In every case, they have been overwhelmed with applicants&#151;people in the lower income groups. Parents have a great interest in their children and will go to great lengths for them. In these cases, they have to pay half of the tuition. Pat tells stories about how parents have taken another job in order to pay the tuition, and so on.</P>

<P><B><I>And would these criteria be more conducive to higher learning achievement?</I></B></P>

<P>We know this from the example of the rest of our society. We know we've made the greatest gains in productivity and the like in the private sector, not in the government. But we don't actually know; we just have an enormous amount of experience. Moreover, one thing is clear: If parents have the freedom to choose, they are not going to choose a bad education over a good education for their child.</P>

<P><B><I>True.</I></B></P>

<P>So, in general, what do we depend on to keep up the quality of automobiles? The fact that consumers can choose among them. The same thing is true of all of our food products, everything. People don't realize how large a potential industry schooling&#151;elementary and secondary&#151;could be. The total amount of money that's spent on public and private schools is a multiple of the total amount of money spent in restaurants. And you have restaurants of every quality, every kind. Just what keeps a restaurant from poisoning its customers? I assure you, it's not the food and drug laws.</P>

<P><B><I>Just how much should we spend on education?</I></B></P>

<P>In principle, I don't think government should spend anything on education as such. The responsibility for educating children ought to be with their parents. And I would like to see a situation in which there were none of the things I'm talking about now, a situation in which parents were free to choose but would also back up their decisions with their own money. The only reason they don't do that now is because they have this attractable alternative of supposedly getting something for nothing. However, I do think there would be a problem with indigent children; it would take either government assistance or private charity to enable indigent children
to get schooled. But beyond that, the ultimate goal I'd like to see&#151;which I shall not live to see&#151;would be that parents are responsible for their own children's schooling.</P>

<P><B><I>How would you go about getting teachers and administrators to really commit to a privatized
education system?</I></B></P>

<P>At the moment, private schools can hire teachers of the same quality at a lower wage than a public school can, because teachers prefer to teach at private schools. They find them more attractive: They have more freedom and they're not as restricted. So I don't really see a problem at all. Just offer them money; offer them jobs. I want to emphasize that public school teachers are not the problem; indeed, some public schools are very good. But mostly these schools are in the higher income suburbs and areas of the city; and even there, the public schools aren't doing what they should be doing. They're not innovating. And you find in the best schools, interestingly enough, this kind of change is coming from the top&#151;not from the bottom. I believe that if you really got education moving, you'd see the same kind of changes in the next 10 years that you saw in the last 10 years in the computer industry. You and I aren't clever enough to predict exactly what form it will take. Computers have been thrown into public schools systems; although they're widespread, they're not really integrated into the educational process.</P>

<P><B><I>Unfortunately, that's true in many cases. How would you suggest that we effectively integrate
computers&#151;and other new technologies&#151;into the classroom?</I></B></P>

<P>One of the things that will come out of this will be much greater and more effective use of computers of all kinds. Indeed, right now, one of the fastest growing areas of education is home schooling. This is because private enterprise has produced a great many computer and other programs to help parents teach their own children.</P>

<P><B><I>There's been an explosion of technology-based resources, and we can't even imagine what these
resources and capabilities will be like in a few years. But, given what we now know, how might education exploit positively those resources, from video and computers, to laser discs and virtual reality? And should it do so?</I></B></P>

<P>Yes, if parents want it. After all, they're the customers. But the point is that nobody can really answer the question, because it's only in the process of development, experimentation, and innovation that we discover what really can or cannot be done. In 1977, when two students, Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, produced a personal computer in their garage and founded the Apple Computer Company, they had no idea what the world was going to look like in 10 years&#151;nor did anyone else. It's only later that people find out what they can use these things for.</P>

<P><B><I>If we were able to incorporate computers and simulations and virtual reality and other resources
that are fast coming, if we could make them routine classroom features just like chairs and desks, what would that mean for the school as we know it? Is the school still a school? Or is it something else? Maybe access from home or from a library?</I></B></P>

<P>Maybe not. Why should all of a child's schooling be in one building? Why shouldn't he take math one place, literature somewhere else, music somewhere else? I am not predicting that you will continue to have schools of the present kind. I don't think anybody can predict exactly what will come out&#151;as nobody could have predicted in the case of the telecommunications industry, in the case of the computer industry, in the case of the automobile industry to begin with, and so on.</P>

<P><B><I>Our present-day education system is very labor intensive. Will technology make it less so?</I></B></P>

<P>Of course. It certainly should.</P>

<P><B><I>Might technology be the &#145;great equalizer&#146;? And could it help give everyone an equal opportunity to learn?</I></B></P>

<P>I think not technology alone; but a competitive system would be a great equalizer of opportunity. There's no area of life in which a family trapped, let's say in Harlem or in Watts, is so disadvantaged as in the kind of schooling its children receive. Whether he lives in Watts or Harlem, if a man gets together enough money, he can buy a car of any kind, and he can go to any restaurant he chooses. But, unless he can increase his income enough to shift his family's actual physical location, he can do very little about the kind of schools available to his children. And so inevitably, if you provide a wider choice in that area, you are going to help equalize opportunities. Today many people have that free choice of schools for their children, which is a great advantage
to them and a great disadvantage to people at the bottom. So I agree with you that this is very much an equalizing process. The public school establishments try to present it as subsidizing the tuition of the rich, and to some extent it does. But that's a very minor element of the process. And it isn't subsidizing; it's eliminating the burden of double taxation.</P>

<P><B><I>In reviewing your famous</I> Free to Choose <I>[1980], which is still used in college classrooms, I was
amazed to see that your views&#151;on medical care, school reform, consumer and worker protection, and a host of other consumer issues&#151;are even more relevant today than when it was originally published. How do you account for this?</I></B></P>

<P>Because it's fundamental. But let me point out one thing that people don't like to recognize: the difference between the climate of the opinion and the actual world of fact. In terms of the climate of opinion, there's a great deal more sympathy for the ideas of free markets, capitalism, and so on, today than there was 30 or 40 years ago. But in the realm of actual performance, there's less freedom today than there was 40 years ago. The government&#151;local, state, and federal&#151;has grown ever larger and now controls at least half of the national income. And while we've gone forward in ideas, we've gone backward in performance. That's why all these ideas that I expressed are still relevant.</P>

<P><B><I>Have you changed your opinions or proposed solutions from that time?</I></B></P>

<P>Very little, but I have changed my opinions on education. When I wrote <I>Capitalism and Freedom</I> in 1962, I supported compulsory education. Later, in <I>Free to Choose</I>, we reversed that opinion, based on factual evidence accumulated in the meantime by Edwin West that studied the large fraction of the population that was literate before compulsory schooling. Otherwise, I haven't changed my basic ideas. After all, truth doesn't change.</P>

<P><B><I>If you were asked to advise today's leaders, what do you think is the greatest single problem
facing the United States today?</I></B></P>

<P>I don't have any doubt: The greatest problem facing our country is the breaking down into two classes, those who have and those who have not. The growing differences between the incomes of the skilled and the less skilled, the educated and the uneducated, pose a very real danger. If that widening rift continues, we're going to be in terrible trouble. The idea of having a class of people who never communicate with their neighbors&#151;those very neighbors who assume the responsibility for providing their basic needs&#151;is extremely unpleasant and discouraging. And it cannot last. We'll have a civil war. We really cannot remain a democratic, open society that is divided into two classes. In the long run, that's the greatest single danger. And the <I>only</I> way I see to resolve that problem is to improve the quality of education.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Illumination in the Desert</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Kenneth Goodall</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I><A HREF="HTTP://www.christdesert.org"><IMG SRC="3monmenu.gif" align=left hspace=10></A>As long ago as the sixth century, monks have used illumination to turn information into beautiful works of art. Now those same skills and dedication&#151;combined with cyberspace savvy&#151;are lighting up the World Wide Web, from New Mexico to the Vatican. And suddenly an ancient art again opens doors (and Windows&#153;) for a whole new generation of learners.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>Monks at Christ in the Desert monastery near Abiquiu in northwestern New Mexico, faced with a need for income to support their growing community, turned to what monks have always done best: the art of illumination. But instead of illuminating parchment or paper manuscripts, as their fellow Roman Catholic religious did in the Middle Ages, they are lighting up cyberspace.&#147;In the scriptorium of Christ in the Desert
monastery, we don't have any parchment (well, maybe a little), and even paper is used sparingly,&#148;
computer-bound visitors to the monastery's virtual site are told.&#147;We write on electrons, creating
cyberbooks: pages for the World Wide Web.&#148; </P>

<P><A HREF="HTTP://www.christdesert.org"><IMG SRC="3chant2.gif" align=right hspace=10></A>Founded in 1964, the monastery, an adobe building housing 24 monks along with 12 personal computers run by an array of solar panels, sits 75 miles northwest of Santa Fe on the Rio Chama in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The area is known for such great Southwest artists as Georgia O'Keeffe.</P>

<P><B>Major Publishing Project </B></P>

<P>Now the Benedictines' desert art is attracting worldwide attention: the Vatican just signed
up &#147;scriptorium@christdesert&#148; (registered trademark of the monastery's Web design business) to
produce the Holy See's Web pages.&#147;It's easily one of the largest publishing projects ever
undertaken in any medium,&#148; 30-year-old Brother Mary-Aquinas told <I>TECHNOS</I>. &#147;We have full
responsibility for the design of the Vatican's Web site, including visual/artistic design, content
organization, and the underlying technical design.&#148; A former systems analyst in Denver, Brother
Aquinas is the director of Christ in the Desert's scriptorium and also director of the massive
Vatican Project.</P>

<P><B>Complete Vatican Offerings</B></P>

<P>Included in the Vatican's Web pages, Brother Aquinas said, will be tens of thousands of
documents and books&#151;each of which will be entered in as many as a dozen languages&#151;along
with complete collections from the Vatican museums and libraries. A Vatican news service will
integrate words, audio, and video, and there will be sections for children and families and for such
special events as World Youth Day and Millennium 2000. &#147;Very many other things as well!&#148;
Brother Aquinas added, his excitement apparent. </P>

<P><A HREF="HTTP://www.christdesert.org"><IMG SRC="3brourl.gif" align=right hspace=10></A>Christ in the Desert's own Web pages are truly unique. &#147;At least one organization listed our Web site as ideal for teachers to use to introduce students to the Web,&#148; Brother Aquinas noted. Welcomed and guided by Brother URL (the acronym for &#147;universal resource locator,&#148; which refers to addresses on the Web), visitors to the site find artwork that spices age-old illumination techniques with a strong Southwest flavoring. Monks, working at rough tables that line the
scriptorium's packed-dirt floors, do the hand lettering on canvas and scan the illuminations (using
a Microtek scanner) into their computers, then incorporate them into the Web pages.</P>

<P><B>Information into Art</B></P>

<P>&#147;I can't think of better work for us to be doing,&#148; Brother Aquinas told a visiting <I>New York Times</I> reporter last March. &#147;This work goes back to the ancient tradition of the scribes, taking
information and making it beautiful, into art.&#148; For centuries during the Middle Ages, monasteries
throughout Europe and the British Isles maintained scriptoria where monks produced handwritten
and hand illuminated manuscripts. Such work became almost obsolete, however, with the advent
of printing in the 15th century. &#147;In a certain sense, the Web and what will happen in the next
decade is a return to that tradition,&#148; Brother Aquinas said. The <I>Times</I> reporter noted that a
wooden crucifix hangs on one wall of the scriptorium and &#147;hand-painted illuminations by the
monks share shelf space with Windows 95, Adobe Illustrator, and Partition Magic.&#148;</P>

<P>The cyberspace operation at Christ in the Desert is part of a trend noted in a recent article in
<I>Wired</I> magazine (Heather Millar, &#147;The Electronic Scriptorium,&#148; August 1996). &#147;In growing numbers,&#148; Millar writes, &#147;religious orders across the country have taken on&#133;computer work as a replacement for more traditional occupations like distilling brandy or making cheese.&#148; Monks and nuns are helping turn university library card catalogs into digital systems, cataloging archives for such enterprises as the <I>New York Daily News</I> and <I>Time</I> magazine, and digitizing records for government agencies. </P>

<P><B>CID Web Pages</B></P>

<P><A HREF="HTTP://www.christdesert.org"><IMG SRC="3benedic.gif" align=left hspace=10></A>The Christ in the Desert Web pages provide informative texts as well as beautiful illustrations. Web pages include an introduction  (&#147;scriptorium@christdesert&#148;), a history of the Benedictines, &#147;A Brief History of Scriptoria and the Evolution of the Book,&#148; &#147;Monasticism and Scholarly Resources,&#148; a gift shop guide that features the monks' handicrafts, and information for guests who want to visit and stay in the monastery's guest house. (A minimum stay is two nights; maximum two weeks. Reservation materials are provided by e-mail.) Wordsmiths will enjoy the beautifully illustrated definitions (such as <I>scribe, rubricator,</I> and  <I>miniator</I>).</P>

<P>An online catalog of books that may be purchased at the monastery's bookstore features works by
fellow monk Thomas Merton. Merton, who stayed at the monastery in 1968 after leaving his
Trappest monastery in Kentucky in search of  &#147;a new place,&#148; wrote <I>Woods, Shore, and Desert</I> while there. The book includes photographs that he took of the monastery and surrounding area,
including one of Merton with Georgia O'Keefe. <I>[Shortly after leaving the New Mexico monastery, Merton died
tragically in December 1968 in Bangkok, Thailand, while attending a congress of monks.]</I></P>

<P>Another Web page included, until the Vatican project came along, was an advertisement for a business the monks had planned: helping others, including schools, foundations, and corporations, design their
own Web pages. Brother Aquinas was swamped with requests for help, particularly after the
<I>Times</I> ran an article on the scriptorium on Sunday, March 17, 1996. &#147;Unfortunately, because the
Vatican project is so large, we aren't able to work with other clients any longer,&#148; Brother Aquinas
told <I>TECHNOS</I>.</P>

<P><A HREF="HTTP://www.christdesert.org"><IMG SRC="3news.gif" align=left hspace=10></A>He pointed out, however, that the monastery's Web pages have proved interesting not only to schoolchildren wanting to start their own Web pages but also to those studying medieval European history, &#147;since they are able to see that monks are still very much alive in the current age.&#148; And, he said, &#147;the Vatican site will have significant educational value, especially as we bring the libraries, museums, and architecture of the Vatican online. We definitely want to provide
specialized tours and sections that will make the resources appealing to different age groups.&#148;</P>

<P>Speaking generally, Brother Aquinas thinks that the Web &#147;will certainly impact education because
of the immediate access to information it is fast beginning to provide.&#148; He also predicted that
school intranets, because of their collaborative potential, may have an even more significant
impact. </P>

<P>The talented Scriptorium director sees great potential for the Web in education, and observed
that &#147;the coming ubiquity of network-published teaching materials will undoubtedly have a
significant impact in the classroom.&#148; </P>

<P><IMG SRC="3broaqui.gif" align=left hspace=10><I>Brother Mary-Aquinas is the director of Christ in the Desert's scriptorium and Vatican project director. He is a former systems analyst from Denver.</I></P>

<P>Brother Aquinas hopes that the monastery will be able to work with school districts in the future to develop
collaborative intranets and fun, artistic sites that will appeal to kids.</P>

<P>For now, however, the monks at Christ in the Desert are focusing &#147;very heavily&#148; on the Vatican project. It's enough to keep 24 Benedictines busy&#151;what with the cleaning, the chopping, the weaving, the carving, the baking, and all those other quotidian monastic duties.</P>

<HR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Interview with John I. Goodlad</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>Adapted by Carole Novak</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I><IMG SRC="3goodlad.gif" align=left hspace=10>John Goodlad is professor of education and director of the Center for Educational Renewal at the University of Washington in Seattle. Goodlad is no stranger to education reform. For the past 25 years, he has been involved in an array of reform programs, large-scale studies of educational change, school improvement, and teacher training. The national network for educational renewal was created to further the simultaneous renewal of schooling and the education of educators. It is redefining the concept of school-university partnerships. This interview is excerpted from </I>John I. Goodlad: New Schools, New Teachers<I>, a two-part series of professional development videos for teachers produced by the Agency for Instructional Technology and Phi Delta Kappa.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><B><I>You've devoted your career to education and its reform. What have you learned from your experience in school reform that is helpful in understanding the current movement?</I></B></P>

<P>One of the things you learn is that good things keep recycling. If it's a good idea that doesn't make it this time, it'll make it next time. The other thing that you learn&#151;and it's discouraging&#151;is that you're always getting newcomers on the scene for the recycling process. That means the process of educational change and improvement never ends because you're always dealing with a new clientele, a new group of parents, a new group of administrators, a new group of teachers, and so on. Third, and most important, would be that it doesn't matter how many bills you pass and how many policies you lay down from on high&#151;when it comes right down to it, the individual school has an incredible capacity for rejecting it passively or taking it on and doing something about it. And it doesn't matter where the ideas come from. Ultimately, they've got to be seized upon by people in the individual school unit and seen as important enough to spend time and energy on.</P>

<P><I><B>What have been some of your major concerns over the years in the area of school reform?</B></I></P>

<P>I think it is the intensive cycles of seeing the need to use our schools in some sort of instrumental way. This instrumental use&#151;to think that schools can do something other than educate people well&#151;has gotten us into a great deal of trouble. When we start making education in the schools instrumental to work and the right to work&#151;which we seem to be doing now&#151;we are downplaying the value of education. Because whenever you make anything instrumental to anything else, you have downplayed the thing that is the instrument. That, I think, is the misplacing of our educational values in this country. So I would say that these periodic reform movements should be replaced by a continuing process of renewal. That means we have to value education more than we do; we have to value our children more than we do.</P>

<P><I><B>Would you characterize our present emphasis in education as not valuing learning very much, in and of itself?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes. I refer to Ted Sizer's work with the notion of the child as worker, the child as learner. It's very interesting how some parents are objecting to that notion because they think it means the teacher is abrogating responsibility and turning it over to the learner. It is a much more difficult and challenging teaching task to get youngsters meaningfully involved in the work of learning&#151;and it is work, goodness knows. Japanese parents don't downplay this notion at all. When the child goes off to school, the child's going off to work, just like his father. Youngsters get meaningfully involved so that they don't know when the school period ends. They don't know when to stop; they don't want to stop. That's what we're after, and that means the student has to become an involved worker. It requires a teaching skill that we're not preparing for, because teachers teach the way they were taught, and the way they were taught was frontal teaching. Eighty-eight percent of high school teaching time in the hundreds of high school classes that my colleagues and I visited in doing our research was spent in frontal teaching&#151;telling, questioning, lecturing, with the students passively sitting, often with their eyes glazed over and their minds somewhere else. That's what we've got to switch around. The one thing teachers have in their control doesn't get legislated, usually doesn't get mandated. It's the teaching act itself. That is the power of teaching.</P>

<P><I><B>How important is it that teachers become empowered, in the sense of being more involved in decision making activities in their schools?</B></I></P>

<P>It's absolutely critical. It's very interesting to note, however, that by the end of the 1980s, just about turning into the 1990s, there was a pretty fundamental agreement that the way to bring about change is school by school, by empowering the principals and the teachers. That idea was agreed upon by policymakers and educational reformers. How much have you heard about that rhetoric in the last two or three years? It's faded away. But it's a fundamentally very important idea.</P>

<P><I><B>Will the current attitude toward assessment affect the process of reform?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, there's some wonderful thinking going on in assessment that's quite different than in the past. That is, the idea of a portfolio kind of assessment where youngsters are competing only with themselves, gathering data that shows their improvement over time&#151;papers they've written, things they've created&#151;ultimately resulting in some kind of exhibition for graduation. It's a wonderful idea, but we're still terribly hung up on norm-based tests. I think it is just absolutely one of the worst things that could've happened that the national assessment that was proceeding&#151;which was never meant to be a comparison of states or children with children&#151;is being converted. Good ideas have all been overwhelmed by norm reference testing, the SAT, the Graduate Record Exam, all of those geared to norm. I am uneasy about the progress we've made in this field being translated into the instruments we use to test children. Standardized, norm reference testing gives us absolutely no diagnosis of the ills of the American educational system.</P>

<P><I><B>Do you think this whole series of events in terms of assessment and curriculum and site-based management offers any clear statement or definition of the purpose of schooling?</B></I></P>

<P>When my colleagues and I set out to study teacher education, one of the things that we identified early on was that teacher education had no mission. That is, when we looked at the catalogs of universities, we looked in vain for a mission of teacher education. If we're preparing teachers for schools, the mission for teacher education should arise out of the mission of schooling. But when we looked for the mission of schooling, we found fragmented goals. We concluded that schools have two parts to their mission. One, we've got to prepare, we've got to enculturate, the young to participate actively and effectively as citizens in a democratic society. That means the worker role, the citizen role, the parent role, the personal role. The other is that we've got to give them command of those processes of knowing that come out of humankind's efforts to study the knowledge system. Those are strictly educative functions; they're not instrumental in any way. When we've talked about this with groups around the country and presented this to those who've committed themselves to our reform agenda, they see that as making sense. If we could get policymakers to focus on an educational mission rather than an economic mission or a political mission, we would then begin to see what's required to have our people educated.</P>

<P><I><B>What do you believe the purpose of education ought to be?</B></I></P>

<P>It's to cultivate the sensibilities and the sensitivities of the individual at the highest possible level. That's what it's all about. We want people to be sensitive to the world around them; we want them to have the sensibilities that make it possible for them to recognize the elements of phenomena that need to be dealt with in their lives. We need for them to be sensitive to one another, so they'll have successful relationships with others. It is developing responsible individuals whose individuality is molded in their culture. The school needs to provide that opportunity for interacting. It's entirely a personal thing. It's entirely an individual thing done in groups.</P>

<P><I><B>How do you see technology playing a part in education reform?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, I would want to redesign the education delivery system. First, there would be teams made up of people, each of whom has high talent in an important given area. For example, in the primary years, I want a teacher who really knows how to diagnose reading disability. I would want a teacher who really knows how to diagnose what youngsters are processing from a quantitative or mathematical point of view; those are team leaders. I would want career teachers aspiring to be head teachers as part of the team. I would want teacher interns and staff members in that group, and I would want part of the delivery system to be a multimedia delivery system of videotapes, computerized learning, and so on. There are thousands of young people in the United States in tiny little high schools that don't have qualified math and science teachers, yet we're expecting those kids to pass the 16-year-old test. I think the states that pass legislation like that have a moral responsibility to provide the delivery system to those youngsters. And if the stakes of schooling were made so high that my child had to pass that test to go on to academic work or to take vocational career training or to get a job&#151;and if the state did not provide the delivery system to the school where my child would go&#151;I'd sue. That's why I'm saying that the moment you raise the stakes of schooling, you raise the moral obligation to provide for it.</P>

<P><I><B>Could you describe your vision of how teachers ought to be trained and prepared?</B></I></P>

<P>At the Center, we've put this forward in a series of 19 sets of conditions, which we have embedded in what we call postulates. First, the institution has to care, has to think it's important. We found teacher education at the bottom of the totem pole in regard to institutional importance. There is this rite of passage that universities have gone through from normal school to teachers' college to state college to state university&#151;and teacher education goes downhill as you get to the more prestigious universities. And there is no effort on the part of teacher-preparing institutions to recruit&#151;they just take people who come wandering in. People don't go to a teacher education program because they think it's the best in the country; they don't go like they go to Yale law school. Once they get there, rarely is there any attempt to socialize future teachers because teacher education usually doesn't start in universities until at least the junior year. One of the weakest features we found was the lack of adequate laboratory facilities. Teaching schools should be like teaching hospitals.</P>

<P>So we recommend: (1) If the institution's going to do it, to make a commitment from the top and proudly raise the flag. (2) There would be an active recruitment program, particularly directed toward minorities because we don't have enough in teaching. (3) There would be an identifiable faculty, accountable and responsible, representing the arts and sciences, the school of education, and the schools. (4) The program would be built around a mission that is embedded in what schools are for, and everything would be lined up to be coherent with that mission. (5) Next, there'd be a lot of field experiences with seminars prior to student teaching. Programs would become five-year programs with four years of general education including preparation to teach built in, plus an intensive year of internship in two different kinds of schools&#151;three or four months in each with accompanying seminars. Those schools would be renewing schools of the kind we'd like to see our children in, so the future teachers not only can experience good schools but also can work with the faculty renewing their schools and learn that it's their responsibility. That's our agenda.</P>

<P><I><B>Tell us about your idea of the center of pedagogy.</B></I></P>

<P>Well, once upon a time, schools of education prepared teachers and administrators. This was all they did. Now the most prestigious schools of education in the country either don't prepare teachers at all or prepare very few, so the function of schools of education has gone far beyond preparing teachers. Stanford University has a small program for maybe 30 people or so; Yale doesn't have a program at all; Harvard has a kind of program that doesn't offer course credit at the undergraduate level; the University of Chicago doesn't prepare teachers at the initial level. So what we have is the most prestigious universities and the most prestigious schools of education not preparing teachers. Now, what would we think if the most prestigious schools of law didn't prepare lawyers, and the most prestigious schools of medicine didn't prepare doctors? It's bizarre, isn't it?</P>

<P><I><B>It is.</B></I></P>

<P>What I'm saying is: Look, we've got a group of people over here in the arts and sciences who provide the basic content for math, history, English, and so on. We've got a group of people over here in education who teach the foundations of education and methods of teaching. There are a lot of people in the school of education who've nothing to do with teacher education. They're running their research programs, or they're doing advanced studies of one kind or another, their doctoral programs, and so on. Let's identify those people in the school of education who want to work with teachers, join them with a cluster in the arts and sciences, join all of them with the faculty and their partner schools, who together make the decisions about the programs. In effect you'd be creating a unit of people with accountability and responsibility for teacher education representing all the component parts. Why shouldn't the faculty that prepares teachers recruit the others, recruit their colleagues? Deans of education have asked exactly that question: What does the school of education do, if part of it is a center of pedagogy, with the arts and sciences as school people participating? You'd better have good answers to that question, because that'll be one a lot of legislators are going to ask. If schools and colleges of education don't prepare teachers&#151;or prepare very few&#151;what are they doing?</P>

<P><I><IMG SRC="3goodbk.gif" align=left hspace=10><B>Doing research wouldn't be a good enough answer?</B></I></P>

<P>It wouldn't be a good enough answer for me, if I were a congressman. I would want to know more than that. Research on what?</P>

<P><I><B>Research on how children learn.</B></I></P>
 
<P>I'd want answers. It should be research that bears upon a particular function. My recommendation is a unit, a center of pedagogy with arts and sciences people in it, school people in it&#151;and the rest of the people in the school of education would go about their usual business. It needn't necessarily disrupt things. In fact, it could let a lot of people off the hook who don't want to be in teacher education and don't have much to contribute to it.</P>

<P><I><B>What will it take to assure that greater attention is given to the preparation of teachers?</B></I></P>

<P>Oh, it's hard work. We have a group of senior associates, some of whom are with us at the university, most of whom are scattered about the country working on these problems. It's hard going because many state legislators don't like schools of education. That's a given. The idea of mentoring teachers solely, letting the teachers prepare other teachers, is very attractive in times of low funding because it doesn't cost much. But the question I raise of legislators who want to do this is: Given all the criticism of teachers and all the criticism of schools not doing an adequate job, why would you want to prepare future teachers solely with the people who you think aren't doing a good job now?</P>

<P><I><B>Right.</B></I></P>

<P>It doesn't make common sense. Rather, let's get schools that are going about their business of renewal, let's get the professors who are teaching the subject matter that teachers must know, let's get professors who are teaching the pedagogy, let's get the experienced, competent teachers in those schools together to design and conduct teacher education programs. Now, that's what we're trying to sell to policymakers, and interestingly enough, they're responding very well to the notion. Yes, it makes sense that the university and the school districts join for the education of teachers. The surprising thing is that we haven't done much of what seems to make sense. So that's the challenge. I'm hopeful.</P>

<P><I><B>What advice would you give to educators&#151;classroom teachers, administrators&#151;and others interested in expanding their efforts in the area of school reform?</B></I></P>

<P>The first thing I would say is, you have a moral responsibility as a steward of the school to participate in school renewal. You cannot be an observer; you have to be a participating member. As a teacher, you have responsibility for all the children in the school. If you take on the responsibility of becoming a teacher, you take on the moral stewardship of schooling. And your assumption is that every child can learn; every child will get equal access; no child will be excluded because of color, race, or creed. That's the commitment you make as a teacher&#151;not just to manage the classroom.</P>

<P><I><B>Project yourself 20 years into the future. What would you hope people would be saying about schools and education reform?</B></I></P>

<P>About public schooling, I would hope it would be the kind of thing where the wisest person in the community walked into the school, went through it, and came out and said, &#145;That's where I'd like my child to be. What a wonderful place for my child to be&#151;to be happy and at the same time to be learning.&#146; What a wonderful combination.</P>

<B><I>After the big-name panels in Washington issue their calls for national education reform, how soon do real changes appear in the classroom?  The journey to America 2000 includes stops at committee meetings, policy sessions, and fund-raising events.  The process may well take longer than the seven years till the turn of the century to create the kind of competency-based, globally minded education reformers are recommending.  It begins one classroom at a time&#133;</I></B>
<BR>

<P>James Zimmerman, a 1992 Christa McAuliffe Educator, is reforming education for the 21st century now, starting with his own classroom. It's going slower than he'd like.</P>

<P>Two weeks before the spring semester ends, a fatigued Mr. Z lifts a cardboard box full of plastic Lego parts and wades through chairs, desks, and clusters of student bodies to search for another storage place. &#147;We're finishing up our science projects, so it's a little chaotic right now,&#148; he explains.</P>

<P>Where will this box of Lego parts go? Atop the hamster cage? Under the hornet's nest hanging from the fluorescent lights? Zimmerman stops at a precarious stash of other boxes, some holding parts of model space shuttles and Renaissance sailing vessels. Many boxes bear names of computers and accessories. Ironically, the box of Lego parts is placed atop a box holding models of Christopher Columbus's ships. A reminder that the journey to the 21st century&#151;at least as far as education reform is concerned&#151;is via a slow boat.</P>

<P><B>Start Your Engines</B></P>

<P>&#147;We want to spend some time this afternoon working on our science projects,&#148; Mr. Z announces.</P>

<P>&#147;Yes!&#148; his students shout.</P>

<P>In Zimmerman's cluttered fifth-grade classroom at Thomas Paine Elementary School in Urbana, Illinois, students are enthusiastic about their science projects. They are middle-class and at-risk 10- and 11-year-olds who have progressed beyond wide-ruled writing tablets and crayon drawings. These kids compose drafts, digitize images, and scan barcodes.</P>

<P>Zimmerman's students produce typed science reports containing inset pictures of the heavens that include barcodes&#151;the footnote's younger sister&#151;indicating where the images can be found on videodisc. For this project, Zimmerman has taught his students to use Macintosh word processing software, Optical Data's Windows on Science videodiscs, and the New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia.</P>

<P>&#147;For most kids, writing a term paper or report is a very dull assignment. But from the beginning of this lesson on space, I showed them what their reports would look like when they bring pictures in from videos,&#148; Zimmerman explains. &#147;Right there, the motivation went up. Students are much more willing to do some tedious work, because they know the end result is going to be enhanced by the technology.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3mindy.gif" align=right hspace=10>During a unit on simple machines, Zimmerman's students are thinking robotics. They use Dacta's LegoLOGO kits to build machines from plastic Lego blocks and then program LOGO computer commands. With a touch of the return button, the machines act out motions the students have engineered. Some students are so enthusiastic about preparing their machines for the school's spring science fair that they work on the projects during recess and after school.</P>

<P>Zimmerman wants his students to arrive in the 21st century equipped with an indestructible enthusiasm for learning and the skills necessary to meet their goals. That's why his chosen mode of transportation to the year 2000 is technology. The fueling station for the technological engines of Mr. Z's fifth-grade curriculum includes a library of videodiscs, CD-ROM resources, and software packages. The engines number nine computers, two laserdisc players, three TV monitors, and a hand-held image scanner.</P>

<P>&#147;Students become more comfortable and confident as they use technology. To be able to digitize an image and bring it into a report increases their confidence level,&#148; he says. &#147;It also gives them practice in using the tools to gather information and to manipulate it. I think that's a very important skill for succeeding in the real world.&#148;</P>

<P>For Zimmerman instructional technologies such as these are fascinating tools that magnify and make relevant what his students learn in their core-subject studies.  The incorporation of technology is just one aspect of his efforts to restructure education, a project he began several years before the U. S. Department of Education's America 2000 strategy was formulated. Another focus is global education.</P>

<P><B>Making Crucial Connections</B></P>

<P>&#147;There are so many bridges connecting us to people in other cultures,&#148; Zimmerman says. &#147;We're tied together economically, environmentally. But America has kind of a &#145;tourist&#146; attitude about the rest of the world. We look at it as something for us to enjoy, not to understand. And some of the problems that we face globally are challenging us to rethink that attitude.&#148;</P>

<P>So he turns a weather lesson into a chance for his students to learn along with thousands of other students connected worldwide by computer and modem to AGE, the Apple Global Education network. Zimmerman's students share weather reports with classes elsewhere, and at the same time experience the power of on-line computer networks, which allow users to communicate, share ideas, and access information databases around the globe.</P>

<P>Of course, nothing can replace the human touch. For social studies, he invites international guest speakers to class. Today's visitor, an instructor of Portuguese at nearby University of Illinois, is a native of Brazil. &#147;We could learn about Brazil by opening a textbook and doing a workshop, and students will get a perception of that country,&#148; Zimmerman says. &#147;But to be able to talk to someone from Brazil, to have that direct contact, is going to have a much stronger impact.&#148;</P>

<P>Then, Zimmerman stretches the lesson technologically to include on-line communication with students in Brazil. &#147;It's done with a lot of enthusiasm and motivation, because students sense they're dealing with real people. I think that's one of the keys to successful restructuring. We've got to involve kids in reality&#151;based education&#151;make it real.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Doing a Reality Check</B></P>

<P>But with this global education goal, the technology engines in Zimmerman's classroom grind to a snail's pace and the next century dims. For while Apple donated a Macintosh computer, telephone modem, printer, and access to AppleLink to encourage participation in the AGE network, his students can't use it because the classroom has no telephone line. They must rely on Zimmerman to access AGE for them, in a tiny library storage room down the hall where the equipment now resides.</P>

<P>In fact, there are many schools better equipped than Thomas Paine, a K&#150;5 school serving 479 students, to model 21st-century education methods. While in Zimmerman's class every 2.6 students share a computer, in most other rooms at Paine there is just one computer for all 25 or so students. The school also lacks a computer laboratory where students could learn software applications to use with that one powerful machine in their homerooms. By contrast, some technology magnet schools in this country enjoy a student-computer ratio of 3 to 1, and in schools participating in the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow and similar technology immersion programs, the ratio is 1 to 1. </P>

<P>As for other technologies, every Paine classroom is wired to receive cable, but the local signal is too weak. The school can't take advantage of real-time educational cable broadcasts such as &#147;CNN Newsroom&#148; or &#147;Channel One.&#148; Zimmerman envisions a day when the school will have a satellite dish that would allow it to participate in special projects such as down linking live video from NASA during space shuttle missions. He imagines a day when Paine has a TV studio where students could produce videos for broadcasting on educational cable or sharing with classrooms abroad.</P>

<P>How are Zimmerman and Thomas Paine Elementary restructuring for the year 2000 when they don't have all of today's technology? Mr. Z is working very hard to use the technologies available to him, but he's also realistic. Despite his consuming love for them, Zimmerman believes that having the most sophisticated tools is not essential.</P>

<P>&#147;A classroom with no or limited technology can have as valuable a program as the classroom that has all the latest things,&#148; he says. &#147;It shouldn't drive the curriculum; you should have your curriculum and find ways to enhance it with technology.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Seeing Is Believing</B></P>

<P>But there are advantages inherent in the use of technology in the classroom. Just ask Janice Bradley, principal of Thomas Paine Elementary. She sees instructional technology allowing teachers to teach to different learning styles and quickly assess student progress, usually privately without risk of embarrassment. Bradley thinks computers and word processors are especially helpful for the 25 percent of Paine's students who are classified as students at risk of failing in school.</P>

<P>&#147;I see technology as a plus for all those students who have struggled so long with the traditional way of using paper and pencil. The old way isn't working for some of our children,&#148; she explains. &#147;Through technology, those children are now finding another avenue, another opportunity to grow and to shine.&#148;</P>

<P>As yet, there are no standardized tests to measure the effect of technology use in the classroom, so statistical proof that Paine students are benefiting from it doesn't exist. &#147;I hate the fact that we don't have the scores,&#148; Bradley admits. &#147;But we can't measure this phenomenon by our existing assessment tools. You really have to be in the classroom to see how the students are affected.</P>

<P>&#147;Their eyes light up when they use the computers. And some of these children were never turned on by anything else in the classrooms&#151;never read books, for instance.&#148;</P>

<P>Such success convinces Zimmerman and his colleagues that the educational reform they're effecting&#151;augmented by as much instructional technology as they can muster&#151;is on track. In fact, Zimmerman's thoughts echo the goals outlined in the U.S. Department of Labor's 1991 report, &#147;What Work Requires of Schools: A SCANS Report for America 2000,&#148; suggesting that perhaps the beleaguered field teacher and national committee may someday meet on the path to reform.</P>

<P>&#147;We need to rethink the structure of our education system,&#148; Zimmerman says. &#147;The idea that we can teach kids all that they need to know is ridiculous. We can't do that. Somehow we have to teach them the skills to be lifelong learners, to know how to find and access information, to know how to organize that information, and to know what to do with it when they get it.</P>

<P>&#147;Because this and more is what kids are going to be needing in the real world. If we're concerned about educating students for the 21st century, and we ignore technology, then there's a big gap in our philosophy of what we think we need to prepare them.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Paying the Piper</B></P>

<P>Yet his efforts to bring education even this close to 2000 have not been without cost. A self-described workaholic who &#147;spreads himself too thin sometimes,&#148; Zimmerman, 40, struggles to balance home, family, church, and work. This father of three spends much of his working hours immersed in technology and reform activities. In addition to serving as on-call volunteer technology trainer in his own school, Zimmerman presents about 60 science and technology workshops each year at state and national education institutes. He coordinates The Teacher Is the Key, a math, science, and technology program that meets at several sites around Illinois for six days of workshops and collaborative projects. In addition to organizing the food, housing, and logistics of each meeting, Zimmerman presents three to four training sessions each day.</P>

<P>Interspersed among those activities were several trips to Washington, D.C., in 1992 to plan the 10-day Christa McAuliffe Institute for Educational Pioneering sponsored by the National Foundation for the Improvement of Education. Assembled at Stanford University in August, Zimmerman and four other McAuliffe Educators led 20 McAuliffe Fellows in activities planned around the theme, Preparing All Students for the 21st Century: Using Telecommunications to Restructure Education for Global Understanding.</P>

<P>Some of Zimmerman's splintered time is spent writing grant applications. Since 1985 he has received nearly $400,000 from state and national sources for classroom equipment, projects, and teacher training programs such as The Teacher Is the Key. The result: Many of his teaching goals are being met, but at the expense of other responsibilities.</P>

<P>Teachers like Jim Zimmerman are doing the hard work of reforming American education, one classroom at a time. It takes frequent phone calls, planning sessions, and never-ending reading and self-training to stay current with technology. But all these endeavors are made easier, Zimmerman is quick to point out, by knowing he is supported by his school administrators and colleagues.</P>

<P>&#147;I think Urbana is unique, and 90 percent of the teachers in the district would echo the same sentiment. Teachers are valued as professionals here,&#148; he says. &#147;We're encouraged to teach to our strengths and to try different approaches. And the administration is definitely pro-technology.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Moving Beyond Rhetoric</B></P>

<P>Principal Bradley doesn't have a computer in her own office, yet she recognizes that instructional technology is forcing a restructuring of the way teachers teach. She and other administrators in the district determined this year to make faculty comfortable with that trend. Bradley started with inservice training led by herself, Zimmerman, and Carol Godoy, a second-grade teacher at Paine. The three set up all the school's computers, software, and accessory equipment in the school gym and gave teachers a technology blitz.</P>

<P>Bradley believes that &#147;technology's coming and there's no way to avoid it anymore. I think the key is to make sure that teachers are given the support they need so they can feel as comfortable with it as possible.&#148; The first line of that support, she says, are the students, who often pick up new software applications just as quickly as they learn the latest video arcade games, and other teachers who have acquired technology literacy elsewhere.</P>

<P>Godoy is just such a teacher. She established the school district's access board to Free Educational Mail, or FrEdMail, a grass-roots, on-line network transmitted between Apple computers. Like Zimmerman, Godoy has found that implementing the technology&#151;acquiring hardware, getting principals' consent, establishing phone lines, and training teachers from each school&#151;is a slow process. She estimates that just 10 to 15 teachers in the district used FrEdMail during the last school year, but expects interest to grow. Urbana High School joined the network this year.</P>

<P>Of course, Godoy and Zimmerman use FrEdMail. Last year, with the help of University of Illinois educational psychology professor James Levin, they teamed their second- and fifth-grade classes to take part in an international project to collect ideas for a zero-gravity space station. Their students devised recreation and exercise activities and plans for a classroom in space, then put them on the FrEdMail bulletin board. There, they were critiqued by other participants&#151;students, teachers, even NASA and Lockheed researchers. Godoy and Zimmerman's students were thrilled to receive responses to their ideas and eagerly revised them as they learned about the challenges of living in a zero-gravity environment.</P>

<P>Despite such collaborative projects and his own campaign to implement technology, global perspectives, and future-minded objectives, Zimmerman realizes that a few individual teachers can't carry reform all the way into the next century.</P>

<P><B>Drawing Battle Lines</B></P>

<P>He needs the help of an army of teachers who have raised their knowledge and comfort level with instructional technologies&#151;something they aren't accomplishing through occasional staff workshops held after school, when dozens of other tasks beckon. Zimmerman advocates frequent inservice training, facilitated perhaps by sending students home an hour early once a month to free up teachers' time.</P>

<P>And he'd like to see university schools of education focus on the reality that technology-aided classrooms are alive and advancing. &#147;The applications and software that are coming out now should be available for preservice teachers so they can become comfortable with the technology, so they're not technologically illiterate when they go into the classroom,&#148; Zimmerman says. &#147;The districts they're in may not have those resources, but if the teachers are informed, then they'll find the resources and make the effort to bring them into their classrooms.&#148;</P>

<P>Money to support instructional technology is a perennial concern. Sometimes, however, it doesn't cost a cent. At Paine they've learned that a reputation for innovative technology use begets more technology: Thanks to Zimmerman's high profile in teacher-training and grant-writing circles, he often receives new hardware or software free from vendors, who know his endorsement is an invaluable marketing tool. It's a Catch 22 situation, though. The freebies usually end up in Zimmerman's room, while other classrooms with less technologically advanced teachers go without.</P>

<P>Bradley would like to create a better equipment balance among all of her school's classrooms, but she is under financial constraints. Paine has no special technology line in its budget, and money is always needed for such basics as paper, pencils, and crayons. &#147;I wish there were more funding, but we're going to take any little bit that's available and try to become as competent as possible in technology,&#148; she says. &#147;I'm balancing a very sensitive scale.&#148;</P>

<P>The sensitivity has to do with which teachers are comfortable with the technology and whether or not all students will be equitably served. Even when gifts of equipment and funds are offered by vendors, local businesses, and families, equity is an issue. The Urbana school district is formulating a policy to deal with it.</P>

<P>&#147;I don't want to see schools not be able to accept gifts, not have access to technology because the school down the street doesn't have it. In that case, everybody gets penalized,&#148; Zimmerman says. &#147;I think somebody&#151;the state, the government-has to think about equity, and that translates into dollars and business partnerships. I think it's going to be a problem that we'll have to deal with for a while. It may never go away.&#148;</P>

<P><B>All Aboard!</B></P>

<P>Everyone agrees: The challenge of reforming American education is a daunting one, whether it starts in Washington or in the classroom. Those looking for the fastest route between the two points perhaps should consider addressing the obstacles that Zimmerman, his colleagues, and other classroom-level reformers have been unable to overcome.</P>

<P>Real reform is being done by teachers in the trenches, people like Jim Zimmerman, who are working as hard as can be expected to effect change. After a summer jam-packed with presenting teacher-training workshops and attending seminars and institutes, Mr. Z returned to his classroom in August with a bright eye on the future and one wary eye on that teetering pile of cardboard boxes. The slow boat to reform moves on.</P>

<HR>
<P>In America, there is a privileged class that will be able to find opportunities among complex global economies, a changing  world of work, and a changing society. Increasingly, though, even the middle class seems to sense that the same conditions which have been compounding wealth and opportunities for the
elite often result in diminished opportunity and lessened security for the majority. Those at the bottom of the American economy increasingly see not just less opportunity but no way up at all.</P>

<P>New technologies have revolutionized our daily lives. Medicine, banking, travel, communications, entertainment, and even warfare (as we saw in Desert Storm) have changed in ways that we never dreamed possible only 25 years ago. These changes have improved many aspects of our lives. They have also raised a host of new and complex, often troubling issues. As we approach the close of this century, one fact is certain: how we, as a nation, address the use of these technologies and the opportunities they afford will determine whether the ongoing technology revolution is used as a force to further divide or to unite our society.</P>

<P>In his work on how to build successful learning organizations, Peter Senge has suggested the need
for organizations to have conversations that may not be deemed &#147;polite.&#148; Senge says we must be
willing to talk about ideas that may be uncomfortable and to challenge concepts that many may feel are beyond question. If we believe, for instance, that all students can learn, we must overcome barriers to the use of technology by disadvantaged students everywhere.</P>

<P>Information is the natural resource of our society. The ability to operate the technologies that can locate and use information is a critical skill for the workplace. Failure to address this issue of equitable access to technology and information resources will tear the social fabric of the nation, further eroding a sense of shared values among the citizens of this country, and ultimately promote the development of a permanent American underclass. America does not want to understand that she has woven strands of myth and fiction into a rope thick enough to strangle any hope of a decent future for those children that are the most poor, most alone, and most in need. Offering no apologies for this impending not-so-polite conversation, we at Milton Hershey
School believe strongly that America has a moral obligation to its disadvantaged children, for they
are the children that we serve.</P>

<P>As we examine whether America is at risk by the way it cares for its children, we can begin with the educational system and ask ourselves if schools are changing fast enough and what role technology plays in the pace of that change. Although social, business, and demographic changes are creating a workplace and communities that need citizens who think critically and solve complex problems in a constantly changing environment, the question remains whether schools are seriously changing their delivery of teaching and learning to respond.</P>

<P>If we Americans really believe our children, and therefore our nation, is at risk, we have the ability to change things. Consider our prior battle against economic depression, our funding of technological and economic miracles, our influence in the collapse of communism, and our speedy financial support of the Gulf War. America continues to pump money without limit into a prison-building spree unlike anything the world has ever seen. When America is convinced that it is at risk because it neglects its poor children, the neglect will end within a decade. Such a realization will not occur, however, as long as upper- and middle-class Americans believe they can insulate their own children from those less fortunate.</P>

<P><B>Who Really Cares?</B></P>

<P>Herein lies a perception that is not far removed from the second myth&#151;that America truly cares about <I>all</I> its children. As Americans look outside their own families and their local schools to the needs of other children, they may recognize that other schools are bad. Then, however, ambivalence leads to the belief that as long as the schools their own children attend are acceptable, fixing others is not a priority. Hence, school reform is a topic for others. Those who can influence changes do not do so because they are not directly affected by the problem.</P>

<P>Technology can be a great equalizer, for it can provide access to learning regardless of the school. The electronic infrastructure that is being installed in this country is an infrastructure for learning. Equitable access to the information on this information highway will give all schools an equal chance at having the best learning and teaching opportunities available. As Bill Gates states in his recent book, <I>The Road Ahead</I>, technology and the information highway won't replace or devalue the human educational talent needed for the challenges ahead in education. Committed teachers, creative administrators, and involved parents will all remain necessary components of the learning process. Technology will assist teachers in sharing their excellent work and wonderful materials with not just a few students but with many. The best teachers and the best resources can be available to all children, not just to some.</P>

<P>But even if America does not truly care about its disadvantaged children, this does not mean that such children can never be a national priority. The American agenda is often set, not by big majorities, but by well-organized minorities. Let us engage in a conversation about building a more effective national advocacy for poor children. Technology offers us a great opportunity to connect, collaborate, and convene professional educators, child-care organizations, health-care and social service providers, public and private schools, educational agencies, and other grassroots groups to support and promote the interests of disadvantaged children. The information highway enables groups of like minds to collaborate locally, regionally, or nationally.
The challenge is to organize the same kind of grassroots support that special interests use every day to work their influence in Washington, D.C., and the state capitals.</P>

<P><B>Nurture and Education for All</B></P>

<P>The third segment of our not-so-polite conversation is the idea that America does not know how and cannot afford to fully nurture and educate its poor children. But the fact is that America <I>does</I> know how to nurture and educate children and <I>does</I> know which parenting and teaching skills work. Some American children, born lucky into good families in healthy communities, are the best parented and the best taught children in the history of the world.</P>

<P>America's poor children are its shame because it has been unwilling to share its best parenting and teaching skills with those who need them most. Instead of bemoaning the deficiencies of inadequate families, communities, and schools, America needs to face the same realities its poor children must face every day. We need to design and provide, not just discuss, the help that is needed. Inevitably, some will say America cannot afford to serve its poor children well. Advocates for children need to dive headlong into that conversation. If we do not serve the children who need us most, we can pay now or pay later, as the man in the television car-repair
commercial used to say. America needs to pay the cost of effective nurture and education for all children, or it can pay ever-increasing amounts for prisons and the effects of crime, drugs, teenage pregnancies, and endless cycles of poverty.</P>

<P>At Milton Hershey School, we suspect that when all costs are fully calculated, nurture and education is cheaper. Although our priority is, first and foremost, the children whom we nurture and educate, we will not remain ambivalent to the disadvantaged children of this country, for we understand that all are affected when those children are not cared for. We stand ready to join in the dialogue with other organizations, businesses, institutions of higher learning, and community agencies to learn from each other by sharing ideas and best practices and to establish and maintain an advocacy for America's disadvantaged children. The power of technology in this effort is only beginning to be explored.</P>

<P>The capital outlay for technology is considerable. Recent statistics prepared by the Software Publishers Association (SPA) describe technology in schools in terms of a computer-to-student ratio and indicate that of the 5.5 million computers available to students, more than half are out of date and do not have the capacity to access the Internet. Federal money that funds some of the technology-related purchases (which in the 1993-94 school year amounted to $1.5 billion) is expected to be cut by Congress in the near future, according to SPA, thus leaving the states and local schools to fill the void, if they can. The impact of these cuts will be most noticed by the poorest of our schools.</P>


<P><I><IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/1hershey.gif" align=left hpsace=10>Founded in 1909 by Milton and Catherine Hershey, Milton Hershey School's mission is to seek financially needy boys and girls of character and ability from diverse backgrounds and to prepare them through education and support for meaningful, productive lives. Located in South Central Pennsylvania, Milton Hershey School offers each child a no-cost education that prepares the graduate for post-high school opportunities, housing in family-like student homes, meals, clothing as needed, and assistance with medical care.</I></P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P><B>Collaboratives and Grassroots Action</B></P>

<P>The power of technology lies not in the technology itself but in the intellectual capital which schools and communities can leverage through its effective use. <I>How</I> technologies are used is what matters! To maximize the potential of technology in this effort, Milton Hershey School supports and advocates the following.</P>

<P><B>Establish regional information and technology collaboratives.</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Help provide access to technology and information resources and could achieve economies of scale through mass purchasing of hardware, software, and service contracts.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Enhance effectiveness by sharing experiences, resources, services, and facilities, thus avoiding costly and unnecessary duplication.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Establish a common set of technology standards to facilitate access to shared resources, thus promoting connectivity and interoperability among all partners.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Serve as a forum for the exchange of ideas, programs, and research results so learning can occur at the organizational as well as the individual level.</P></LI>
 
<LI><P>Use the power of these collaboratives to help influence local, state, and national policies that affect a wide range of issues dealing with children.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Increase access to technology.</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Help develop strategies and actions to provide physical access to technology outside of the regular school hours, using libraries, community centers, after-school programs, and the possible loan of equipment to families. This can make more efficient use of underutilized resources.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Develop financial incentives and/or alternatives for schools and communities serving large numbers of low-income students. A regional collaborative will have a greater chance to compete for federal and private foundation money supporting education by showing that grant dollars could have a significant and broad impact on its diverse communities.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Expand partnerships.</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Strategic alliances and partnerships are a key to success. Some national companies such as DirectNet, an Internet service and curriculum software provider located in Dallas, Texas, have made a commitment and devised some innovative strategies to help poor and rural schools gain wider access to technology. Collaboratives need to find these small businesses and corporations and engage them where possible.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Alliances with universities can use integrated distance learning technologies to extend learning opportunities to schools and communities. Human services resources to poor and often remote schools can be provided by using technologies that facilitate conferencing, special courses, and mentoring of teachers and parents.</P></LI></UL>

<P><B>Improve management of resources.</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Use the regional collaborative concept as an information resource center. Just as we have developed statewide systems for interlibrary loan, the collaborative would need to address the sharing of electronic resources and services for schools and communities. Costs can be collectively shared by businesses, local civic groups, school districts, and individuals within a  region. Resources can be managed through a local school or library.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Provide low- or no-cost expertise to other schools and community organizations on how to access and use information available on networks. Develop coordinated technology plans and local budgets. Provide training opportunities for the use of technology and the resources available to teachers, parents, and community members.</P></LI></UL>

<P>Using our collective efforts, we can make a regional impact. Financial constraints are significant; however, denying disadvantaged and low-income children access to technology and information resources makes a fiction out of the most fundamental American principle: that of equality. Equity of access to technology and the information resources it provides is one of the most significant issues that schools, school districts, organizations, and communities face.</P>

<P>If we believe that we are all created equal, as the Declaration of Independence states, then we
must seriously address the growing divide between the information &#147;haves&#148; and the &#147;have nots.&#148; To secure the rights to &#147;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#148; in 21st-century America, a poor child with little or no family support will need more nurturing and help with education than our
nation has been willing to provide so far in this century. Technology can help. The vast amount of electronic information and technology that Marshall McLuhan predicted to be available by the advent of the 21st century must be made available to all of our children, not just to the privileged few. The time to move from discussion to action is now. We must create the well-organized, grassroots groups that influence action. If we provide access to only some children and do not serve all, we should not be surprised in this time of rapid change if millions of our children conclude that the Declaration of Independence is just another myth. </P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Realizing the Promise of Technology in America's Schools</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Edward M. Kennedy</H3>
<HR>

<P><STRONG><I><IMG SRC="/journal/bios/ekennedy.gif" align=left hspace=10>Senator Edward M. Kennedy has been a champion of education for 34 years in the United States Senate. He served on the Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1965, when it passed the first federal aid to education programs for both elementary and secondary education and college student aid. As Chairman of the Labor Committee in the 1993&#150;1994 Congress, often called the &#147;Education Congress,&#148; Senator Kennedy spearheaded the passage of six major education initiatives from preschool through adult learning: the expansion of Head Start; Goals 2000; the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including the Technology for Education Act; Direct Student Loans; National and Community Service; and School-to-Work. In the current Congress, Senator Kennedy is a leading defender of schools and colleges across the country. This year he led a successful effort to maintain federal support for education at 1995
levels, against heavy pressure for deep budget cuts.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR>
<P>Personal computers and the Information Superhighway are rapidly transforming America. Already, the Internet is making large amounts of information available at unprecedented speeds. When this revolution makes itself fully felt in schools, teachers and students will have virtually instantaneous access to vast amounts of information and a wide range of learning tools. If we guide the information revolution wisely, these resources will be available not only to affluent suburban schools but also to rural school districts and inner-city schools. Broad access can reduce differences in the quality of education and give children in all areas new opportunities to learn. Used well, this transforming technology can play a major role in school reform.</P>

<P>This promise, however, is still a distant hope for the vast majority of American students. A U.S. Department of Education survey shows that 50 percent of schools in America now have access to the Internet&#151;but only 10 percent have the high-speed connections that would allow access for more than one user at a time. Continuous upgrading of this technology in schools is, therefore, an important part of improving education.</P>

<P><A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2kennedy.htm">NetDay</A>, which originated in California, is a new model for achieving and expediting the needed changes. It is a partnership among schools, businesses, volunteers, and government to  bring schools onto the Information Superhighway. This fall, <A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2kennedy.htm">NetDay</A> comes to Massachusetts, and volunteer support for elementary and secondary schools is likely to reach an all-time high in the state, with the active participation of students, parents, business leaders, educators, and public officials. The event is part of MassNetworks, a campaign to use technology to support school reform in Massachusetts.</P>

<P>The first <A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2kennedy.htm">NetDay</A> took place in California on March 9, 1996, and generated impressive attention. President Clinton participated and called it a &#147;high-tech barn raising.&#148; Underlying this activity was an essential goal&#151;to give schools the internal wiring they need to connect their classrooms to the Internet.</P>

<P>The new technology will enable students to acquire the skills that are essential to succeed in modern society. Exposure to computer technology in school will permit students to become familiar with the necessary tools at an early age. By using the technology well, they will also acquire better thinking skills to help them become informed citizens and active community members.</P>

<P>Better training for students today will also prepare them for the workforce of tomorrow. More and more jobs in the United States require employees to have higher levels of skills than ever before. This need arises in part from the increasingly global marketplace, which has transformed the environment in which American companies do business. According to a 1990 report by the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, American businesses must become &#147;high-performance work organization[s],&#148; in which the average worker is expected to make decisions, use good judgment, and take greater responsibility for the final product of the firm.</P>

<P>Companies are willing to pay for increased job qualifications. Recent research indicates that employees reap an 8 percent average increase in income for each additional year of high school, college, or graduate school they complete. The average high school graduate in 1992 earned $6,000 more than a high school dropout, and the average college graduate earned $14,000 more than a high school graduate.</P>

<P>These emerging needs present a dual challenge to America's public schools. We must raise academic standards for students and help them acquire the skills they need to function effectively in the modern workplace. Our success in meeting these challenges can be increased by making technology, including the Internet, available to all schools, and by using it effectively.</P>

<P>Technology can also help us focus our energy on improving education. To reach our goal, three shifts in the way we think about computers, networks, and learning must take place. Some of these changes are already underway.</P>

<P><B>Shift 1&#151;Helping all students: a challenge to teachers and software developers</B><BR>
The ability to retrieve information from anywhere or to communicate with anyone on the Internet amplifies the information, interactions, and computing power available to teachers and students. This phenomenon makes computers especially useful for research. Previously, students would go to the library to find out about what crops are grown in a particular foreign country. Now, they can get those facts and many more in the same amount of time on the Internet.</P>

<P>Computers are more than just information retrieval devices. They are also tools to help us communicate and think more effectively. Harnessing this power calls for new ways of examining how computers can help us learn.</P>

<P>Classroom software today has not yet reached its potential to fill these needs. Often, it attempts to engage students through drill-and-practice. In <I>Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Superhighway</I>, Clifford Stoll refers to this generation of computer educational programs as &#147;uninspired&#151;they work remarkably like flash cards.&#148; Too often, the only features added by computerized instruction programs are animated pictures and buzzing sounds&#151;far from full use of the computer's capabilities.</P>

<P>Today's computers can offer exercises that teachers cannot provide, or that would be prohibitively expensive to make available on an individual basis. One sophisticated example is &#147;glasses for the ears,&#148; a tool for dyslexic children. This approach was developed by research groups headed by Dr. Paula Tallal at Rutgers University and Dr. Michael Merzenich at the University of California at San Francisco. Using slow, clear computer-generated speech, dyslexic children learn to recognize differences in sounds that they could not hear before. With successful practice, the sounds are gradually accelerated until they reach normal listening speed. After just four weeks of practice, the children advanced two years in their verbal comprehension skills, and the improvement persisted even after they stopped using these &#147;glasses.&#148;</P>

<P>In addition to teaching basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic, the new technology can help students &#147;learn how to learn.&#148; Some of the best new classroom computer applications demand that the student construct a model and strategize, in order to solve complex problems.</P>

<P>These qualities make the student an active participant in learning, with a clear stake in the outcome of a program. The similarity of good computer applications to dramatic interactions has been pointed out by computer game designer Brenda Laurel. In her book <I>Computers as Theater</I>, she lists features shared by the most effective software: a clear task at the beginning; a struggle and dialogue between the user, other users, and the computer; and a satisfying ending at which the user's performance is clearly evaluated. The dramatic and social nature of computer interactions is what makes the Internet so attractive. Students often express the greatest satisfaction not from fancy graphics but from text-based interaction through e-mail.</P>

<P>Designers of school software applications can learn from this important point and make software that enables students and teachers to participate actively with the computer and each other. An experimental project at MIT's Media Lab, &#147;Cocoa,&#148; will help children become active, creative participants in the World Wide Web, rather than merely casual surfers. Modeled after the new Web-design tool Java, Cocoa is a simplified language that lets children create their own Web sites. A possible analogy is the difference between watching television and creating your own television programs.</P>

<P>Learning often takes place as work is revised over time. Yet hardly any educational software permits students to save their work on a disk for later use. Allowing a student's interaction to extend beyond a single session would be valuable. Anyone who has seen a child carefully save drawings and essays knows the power of such motivation. Like adults, children are interested in preserving what they have done, whether for posterity or for the refrigerator door.</P>

<P>Another major challenge to curriculum developers is to use computers effectively to help all students. Some students will take on a computer and dive eagerly into all it has to offer, overcoming almost any barriers. In fact, as Bill Gates has suggested, it is from young people that the most unexpected new uses of computers are likely to originate.</P>

<P>How can we expand the range of computer teaching software to help the vast majority of students? One promising example is Boston's Computer Clubhouse. Students, primarily from underserved communities, go there after school and work with the Media Lab's experimental software. In one exercise, students assemble virtual LEGO parts to make complex machines and robots, and simulate their behavior. They learn basic engineering principles and use their new-found knowledge in the laboratory to build real, functioning devices. Other students use computers to record their own music or to compose three-dimensional architectural layouts.
These students are doing more than acquiring knowledge. They are learning in new ways that are made possible by computer-aided design tools.</P>

<P><B>Shift 2&#151;Ensuring universal access to technology and the Internet: a challenge for public
policymakers</B><BR>
Effective educational technology will not be available to all students without specific and coordinated efforts by both the public and private sectors. Accessible sites such as the Computer Clubhouse are rare. It is more common to find computers in affluent homes than in public schools. Underserved students in inner cities and rural areas also deserve access to these opportunities.</P>

<P>Federal aid to public education is an essential cornerstone of our modern democracy and has been since the G.I. Bill of World War II. The federal government can and should play a strong role in ensuring universal access. An overriding public interest exists in ensuring that the benefits of new and powerful technologies are available to more than a privileged few. There is a federal obligation to ensure that improvements in education are accessible to all students. The Technology for Education Act, which Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and I sponsored in 1994, established national challenge grants&#151;competitive five-year awards to communities across the country. To qualify for these grants, school districts must work with parents, local industries, libraries and other organizations to develop innovative approaches to bring technology into the
classroom. In 1995, 19 challenge grants totaling $25 million were awarded to underserved districts. This year, the amount available has been nearly doubled&#151;to $48 million.</P>

<P>In his Education Technology Initiative, President Clinton has asked for $2 billion over the next five years to fund these challenge grants and other state and local initiatives, as federal seed money to help schools and students across the country. If this initiative is funded by Congress, the country will be taking a giant step forward in modernizing the nation's classrooms.</P>

<P>The federal government can help in other ways as well, by using its regulatory authority to benefit schools. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires firms to sell advanced telecommunications services to schools and libraries at discount rates. NYNEX, Continental Cablevision, and other companies have responded by proposing new services and rates to the Federal Communications Commission, including free service for schools in some cases. As the definition of advanced telecommunications evolves, this regulatory authority will do more to help schools meet their needs while reducing the strain on their budgets.</P>

<P>At a local level, public-private partnerships such as <A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2kennedy.htm">NetDay</A> can give an extra boost to these efforts. This support can make a difference at a time when schools face other competing critical needs such as textbooks, teacher training, and the renovation of facilities. In the end, however, a genuine commitment means support by long-term budgeting. In Massachusetts, a $60 million education technology bond initiative, which will help schools take this path, is under consideration. Efforts like these are essential for technology to assume its rightful place in education.</P>

<P><B>Shift 3&#151;Bringing people into the process: a challenge to teachers, parents, communities, and businesses</B><BR>
New approaches are promising, but they are useful only if teachers and parents embrace them. Many students require extensive personal attention in computer instruction. For this reason, the most important shift that must happen for technology to take root in school reform is a human one: teachers and parents must take the lead in making it happen.</P>

<P>Teacher training is an essential part of realizing this goal. Teachers have many demands on their time and energy and may view these new, unfamiliar approaches as an additional burden. Dale Lestina, president of Organizations Concerned about Rural Education and director of Congressional Relations for the National Education Association, has said that teacher training must be given the highest priority, if new technology is to succeed in improving education. Adequate training will give teachers a practical vision of technology's potential, opportunities to use it, sufficient support services, and time to experiment.</P>

<P>In California, <A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2kennedy.htm">NetDay</A> was a highly visible opportunity for parents and volunteers to participate. The commitment extended beyond wiring to general improvement of schools. In some cases, so many volunteers showed up that they did not have enough to do. Enterprising principals with cans of paint on hand put the volunteers to work on buildings and classrooms.</P>

<P><A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2kennedy.htm">NetDay</A> gave California parents, teachers, and businesses a tangible opportunity to help improve their schools. As the idea spreads to other states and communities across America, it will become a visible commitment not just to wire schools but to strengthen schools in other ways as well.</P>

<P>The advent of the Information Age gives us powerful tools for improving education. Their power does not come solely from their computing capacity; it comes in part from the opportunities they provide to help students learn in new ways. Meeting and mastering this challenge involves far more than technology. We should seize this priceless opportunity and rededicate ourselves to supporting teachers, schools, parents, and students.</P>

<P><I><B>Something is wrong on line.</B></I></P>

<P>For all the hype about information highways and the explosive growth of the Internet, not many educators are using computers for genuine communication. This is due in part to lack of knowledge and opportunity, but, even when educators have access to cyberspace, depressing numbers of them are engaged at only a trivial level. Larger and still more depressing numbers are consciously avoiding the medium altogether, and for good reasons.</P>

<P>On-line communication is often addictive, but not always rewarding. Discussions sink into &#147;flame wars&#148; of insults, nitpicking, and abuse. Or they veer off into aimless debate. &#147;Hijackers&#148; take over, uploading torrents of incoherent drivel. It doesn't happen all the time, but it does occur often enough to frustrate users who want to use cyberspace seriously.</P>

<P>At the local level, electronic bulletin board systems (BBSs) offer a sense of community to schools and interest groups. Yet here, too, something can go wrong. Discussion turns into abuse; a few dominate the board while everyone else lurks silently, reading but not contributing. I call this the passive-aggressive syndrome. Most teachers and students who go on line are passive readers of other people's postings; they rarely, if ever, respond to what they read. That leaves the aggressives in charge&#151;teachers and students who post often and, of course, have only one another to respond to.</P>

<P>Another problem is that BBS e-mail is far from private&#151;whoever is running a BBS has the power to get into every mail-box and to monitor every exchange of information. That is enough to keep many potential users from even getting started, as I saw when I tried to introduce a colleague to Capilano College's new BBS. Since she's on various college committees that often deal with sensitive information, she instantly decided the risks far outweighed the advantages and opted not to use the BBS.</P>

<P>These problems reflect in part the attitudes of the pioneers attracted to the medium. Other factors include mistaken attitudes and habits that we bring from other kinds of communication. The pioneers tend to be not only aggressive but also rational, ritualistic, addictive, and solitary. I am not, I hope, using these terms judgmentally or universally. In any case, I'll wear the shoe if it fits.</P>

<P>The computer demands its own arbitrary rationality: If A, then B; if not A, then B doesn't happen. Getting from A to B is a matter of ritual: Hit the right keys in the right sequence, and you get the desired response. That response, in turn, becomes the purpose of the ritual. The sequence of keystrokes or mouse clicks delivers a jolt, an event on the monitor that rewards the user: A window pops open, a text scrolls into view, a file downloads. This leads to further jolts: The window displays a nude, the text mentions one's own name, the file does something surprising and interesting (maybe even useful). Like lab rats with electrodes wired into their brains' pleasure centers, some computer users keep looking for more and bigger jolts: A flame from a debating opponent, a faster response to a command, the illicit thrill of reading banned or private information.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the activity that produces these jolts is solitary. The user sits at home or at a workstation, engaging with other people at a distance. One is not, despite all the hype, part of a community when one communicates on line; one is profoundly isolated.</P>

<P>Because we do not yet understand the circumstances under which we telecommunicate, we risk another problem. It's not enough to write in the reader's language; we must also write in the proper register. In this context, the word &#147;register&#148; is a linguistic term. If dialect is the vocabulary and grammar I use most comfortably, register is the way I use my dialect in different circumstances. Register reflects the subject under discussion. It also differs if we're using speech or writing and according to the social relations between the participants. I do not speak the same way, or about the same topics, at a neighborhood barbecue as I do at a neighbor's funeral. I don't write about science as casually as I talk about it, and what I say depends on whether I'm dealing with a roomful of scientists or one young student.</P>

<P>We educators have not yet found the right register for most on-line writing. We read and write at our computers in solitude, which tends to make our messages more intimate, so we may expose more of ourselves than we would if we were speaking in a crowded church or classroom. But our messages are public (either overtly, or at least open to scrutiny by the system's operators). The effect can be like saying &#147;Darling, I love you&#148; over the PA system of a crowded hockey rink or &#147;That ought to hold the little bastards&#148; over a radio microphone we think is dead.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/2coverly.gif" border=2 align=left hspace=10>On line, we often write quickly. We are really trying to emulate speech, which is a sloppier, vaguer, much more redundant form of communication than formal writing. But writing that is sloppy, vague, and redundant is in the wrong register. We expect, when we read words on paper, to see the result of care and organization. When the message on the computer screen looks like the transcript of a drunken monologue, reading becomes harder and misunderstanding much easier. The response is equally sloppy, vague, and redundant&#151;and the ratio of signal to noise drops rapidly.</P>

<P>Like any other frontier, cyberspace will grow more welcoming as serious settlers begin to outnumber the rough-hewn pioneers. Educators are in a position to encourage settlement, but we must prepare our students and colleagues carefully. For example, I talk about register with my computer-using students and try to show how it can affect communication. I also go on line to comment on the subject, and I try to keep my remarks in the right register. The student reader may be at home on a Sunday evening or in class on a Monday morning, but, in either case, I'm still the teacher; I can't throw my weight around and expect to get worthwhile responses.</P>

<P>Most of my students accept the idea of proper register, though some of the younger ones (all pretty aggressive posters) think I'm calling for a needless courtesy, or &#147;netiquette.&#148; Such students think that <I>having </I>an argument is the same as <I>making</I> an argument. I'm not making much progress with them, and their presence is keeping some of their classmates among the passive lurkers.</P>

<P>With fellow teachers, the outcome is similar. On a local school-district bulletin board, I post my weekly newspaper column and answer any comments it may provoke. The BBS uses First Class, a system that records who has read a given message. Judging from the number of readers versus the number of responders, most teachers are still shying away from involvement.</P>

<P>In general, my strategy on line is close to the one I use in the classroom: I try to react positively and entertainingly to every response, while inviting further questions. I usually invite open-ended responses, and sometimes the results are rewarding. Not long ago, knowing that some of the school district's trustees also use this BBS, I invited them specifically to come on line to explain why they had recently taken their board out of the provincial trustees' association. One trustee did so, with a thoughtful posting that illuminated the issue.</P>

<P>In working on line, the classroom analogy is probably a useful one. We know we'll always have some class clowns, some disruptive types, and some quiet but capable students. The trick is to keep the clowns and disrupters from monopolizing everyone's attention and to welcome the shy offerings of the quiet types.</P>

<P>Cyberspace democracy, like the classroom itself, will need to rely for a time on teacher domination of the medium&#151;not to bloat the ego of the teacher but to ensure that a disinterested moderator is there to look after the interests of the less aggressive. (The French term for &#147;moderator&#148; is <I>animateur</I>&#151;and the teacher, like any good host, must animate as well as moderate.)</P>

<P>The issue of privacy is serious. Many more educators would use the computer if they felt their messages were truly secure. And much of the information that educators deal in should indeed be secure from casual snooping. More effective encryption programs may help. Failing that, we must simply learn to post on line only what we'd be willing to see printed in our local newspaper.</P>

<P>Finally, we need to get beyond mere netiquette to find the real registers of on-line communication. Are we alone, able to speak freely about intimacies? Or are we in a public place like Tiananmen Square, our speech limited to public abstractions? The sooner we educators find acceptable answers to those questions, the sooner our students and colleagues will follow us into this extraordinary new world.</P>

<B><I><P>It's a noisy sixth-grade classroom, and it's vibrating with energy. Mr. Calhoun announces a trip to the computer lab&#151;half the class will go to the lab with Ms. Karlov, the computer coordinator, and the other half will stay with him. Marka, a bright and generally enthusiastic learner, groans. She has begun to dread these trips to the computer lab because she feels the computer programs have little relevance or purpose and the boys dominate the machines.</P>

<P>Once inside the lab, the five boys lunge for the computers. Ms. Karlov calls out: &#147;All right, everyone! You will need to share a computer.&#148; The boys don't move from their claim; they have already begun to manipulate the software and play video games. Ms. Karlov gives basic instructions on computer programming and reminds students to take turns developing their programs.</P>

<P>Marka hesitantly joins Billy, who is writing a code at the computer. When Marka sees what he has done, she becomes interested. With Ms. Karlov's reminder, Billy pushes the mouse toward Marka. Worrying that she will appear dumb, Marka writes a few lines while Billy moves about restlessly in his seat. Sensing his impatience, she grows more and more nervous and reaches a mental block. Billy grabs the mouse from her, opens his own program, and begins to write. Marka settles back and pretends that she doesn't care.</P>

<P>Later, Ms. Karlov lets the students use the math software, and the boys again dominate. After several attempts to discover the reason for a program's error message, Sam shouts his frustration from across the room. Ms. Karlov answers without moving towards him, &#147;Try rebooting.&#148; Marka, who is still nervous, has difficulty getting the math program launched, so Ms. Karlov reaches for the mouse and opens the program for her. The boys become very excited about scoring and try to advance to the next level. At the end of class, Ms. Karlov rewards the three highest scorers&#151;John, Brian, and Seth&#151;with stickers.</P>

<P>But for Marka the energy has faded.</P></I></B>
<BR>

<P>Girls are often turned off of computers for a host of social, psychological, attitudinal, and environmental reasons. They are socialized to view technology and technically literate people as belonging to a particular culture&#151;the hacker culture. Sherry Turkle, author of <I>The Second Self,</I> states, &#147;There are few women hackers. This is a male world.&#148;</P>

<P>Women may also see the world of technology as precise and unforgiving, often lacking in creativity and having little connection to people. Lorri Neilsen, director of teacher development at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has discovered that girls often feel that if something goes wrong while they are using high-tech equipment, it is their fault, whereas boys are more likely to blame the machine. Her research also shows that girls and women are less confident than boys and men about their computer abilities.</P>

<P>For girls, many of these feelings of incompetence and alienation from technology start or are reinforced in school. How girls and women relate to technology and the value that they bring to it are often ignored or devalued in education.</P>

<P>Once administrators, educators, and engineers begin to understand how girls are getting turned off of technology and to appreciate the different learning style of each gender, we all can make strides in supporting girls and women in choosing computer-related careers and using computers as a medium of expression.</P>

<TABLE border=5>
<TR><TD align=center>
<B>Regarding Gender</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
In psychology, there are four genders: male, female, undifferentiated, and androgynous. The male gender is defined by stereotypical male characteristics: analytical, aggressive, etc. The female gender is also stereotypically defined: nurturing, emotional, etc. These female and male characteristics are not necessarily assigned to the female and the male sex, respectively. The undifferentiated gender has few specifically male or female characteristics, while the androgynous has both. Although men and women can display the characteristics of any of these four genders, in our society women are socialized to be of the female gender. Because of society's perception of the female gender, this classification frequently harms women's self-confidence and ability to pursue their dreams.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P><B>It's a Turnoff</B><BR>
Instead of enticing girls to use technology, educators are turning them off, both subtly and forcibly. In <I>Failing at Fairness,</I> authors Myra and David Sadker comment on the short-circuiting of girls' technical abilities that begins as early as kindergarten. They tell of research done two decades ago by Lisa Serbin and Daniel O'Leary which documented the way teachers gave boys extended directions on how to accomplish tasks themselves while often completing tasks for girls. This same short-circuiting occurs in the kindergartens of the 1990s. Marta Cruz Janzen, according to the Sadlers, observed a teacher's aide instructing the boys how to use a VCR for their project but running the VCR himself for the girls. This is an all-too-familiar situation.</P>

<P>Computers and other high-tech equipment have been used in and considered part of math and computer science, still predominantly male domains. Girls aren't encouraged to go to higher levels in these disciplines by teachers. They are often discouraged by their peers as well. &#147;While there is no sign on the computer room door announcing NO GIRLS ALLOWED,&#148; says Jo Sanders, coauthor of <I>The Neuter Computer,</I> &#147;females and male students place it there themselves.&#148;</P>

<P>In <I>Failing at Fairness,</I> one sixth-grade teacher comments that she formerly let students choose whether they wanted to use computers during recess. The boys crowded the computer room, while few girls tried to enter what had become the boys' domain.  When some girls did try to enter, they were met by rude comments from the boys. The teacher decided to change her tactic and require that each student spend a certain amount of time each week in the computer lab. As a result, the lab became integrated, with almost equal numbers of boys and girls using it.</P>

<P>There are many factors in and outside the classroom that result in girls' being turned away from computers. Such things as the media depicting men as experts in technology, societal expectations of different life goals for boys and girls, the structure of learning tasks, the nature of feedback in performance situations, and the organization of classroom sitting are a few factors. Often, teachers ask only the boys technical questions, and the boys mock girls' ignorance of technical terms. Also, programming courses are scheduled at the same time as music or art classes, thus discouraging participation. Add to these conditions the facts that the home computer often is placed in the boy's room, not in a common area, and that parents don't usually send girls to computer camp or technology programs, and it is little wonder that girls are turned off.</P>

<P>Because these factors are often subtle, they go unnoticed. The gender gap is not closing, according to Jo Sanders, who says it &#147;is a deeply ingrained pattern on the part of teachers and kids.&#148; Gender bias penetrates all aspects of society.</P>

<P><B>The Game's the Thing</B><BR>
The gender bias of the computer-game market contributes to girls' lack of interest in computer games and inhibits their access to computer technology. These games introduce children to the basic technology, allowing them to interact and explore. Kids who play the games have an advantage over kids who don't. Currently, the majority of computer-game players are boys. Many researchers argue that this is due to the types of games on the market; the software appeals to boys rather than girls. Boys are more attracted to products that depict violence, emphasize competition, and demand strong hand-eye coordination. Most games written for boys contain stereotypes of masculine and feminine. While some girls play with these products, many feel alienated.</P>

<P>In the past, many of the software designers were male; thus they created games that appealed to boys. This situation is changing as more female designers enter the industry. However, most publishers&#151;the controllers of the industry&#151;fail to recognize the gender bias in their products, not to mention the female market potential. Heidi Danglemaier, a computer-game designer in New York City, has made it her mission to make publishers aware of gender bias and to involve females in digital interactive media. &#147;When we as an industry truthfully believe gender differences exist,&#148; she says, &#147;we will make the first step toward creating video games for girls and boys.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/3nogirls.gif" align=right hspace=10>Danglemaier says that the majority of video games are competitive, have strict rules, and require achieving supremacy for the player to be successful. Given a choice, boys tend to choose this type of game 70 percent of the time, while girls choose it only 30 percent of the time. In general, girls prefer purposeful games that involve practical, real-world problem solving, have strong female main characters, and give a sense of completion. Girls often remark that video games are a waste of time; boys see these games as a venue for their game goals: competition and scoring.</P>

<P>With girls making up 30 percent of all new game players and 52 percent of the general population, some publishers are beginning to see dollar signs. Sanctuary Woods has created &#147;Hawaii High,&#148; a CD-ROM game with two female main characters who solve a mystery on Hawaii using historical and cultural clues. &#147;Madeline,&#148; which is in development at Electronic Arts, also has a strong story line with the title character and a male character creating a puppet show to raise money to help a neighbor.</P>

<P>Maria Klawe, director of computer science at the University of British Columbia and a noted authority on gender and computers, believes that computer games are a good way to entice kids into using computers. &#147;Currently, it is the boys' culture that is addressed in computer games,&#148; she says. &#147;It is important to include girls' culture as well. Computer games can be intellectual activities that help children learn by making learning more attractive to them.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Let's Go On Line</B><BR>
What about telecommunications? Do walking through the Internet and visiting sites and people along the way appeal to girls? Given the communication aspect of telecommunications and the ability to make on-line activities purposeful, this field would appear to appeal to girls. Some preliminary studies on girls and telecommunications indicate that having telecommunications as a collaborative activity in classrooms actually heightens girls' interest in computing. In addition, gender differences in the types of on-line activities that appeal to boys and girls are evident. While boys gravitate toward games, girls use e-mail and USENET. From her work on the Learning Connections Project, Lorri Neilsen observes, &#147;[Girls] used newsgroups and listserves as well, but one-to-one e-mail was their primary use. On listserves, they tended to lurk.&#148;</P>

<P>Tracy LaQuey Parker, author of <I>The Internet Companion,</I> says that while the Internet began as primarily a male domain, that is changing. &#147;The Internet is a community and an open collection of resources for everyone. Because the variety of groups on the Internet is growing, there are attractions for girls and boys.&#148; The growth of women's networks and on-line groups such as Systers and Women's Wire are indicative of the on-line space women are creating for themselves.</P>

<P>Because of the relative youth of this field, several educational research institutions plan to conduct research on network use by girls and women. According to a recent study by Alnaaz Kassam of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, &#147;It is the active encouragement of female participation and a reflection of female needs and interests that will bring about any lasting improvement in the inclusion of females on an equitable basis.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Wake-Up Call</B><BR>
Look around your schools and homes. What signals about gender are you sending to the children you encounter? Do you see both male and female gender learning styles being valued and addressed? Awareness is the key.</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><P><B>Exposure to technology.</B> Girls need more exposure to technology, particularly during the critical middle-school years, when they often turn away from science, math, and technology in droves. It's important for kids to be introduced to computers in a variety of capacities before they reach puberty, when students often resist venturing out of their prescribed gender roles. Katherine Hunt, computer specialist for grades kindergarten through eight at Nueva School in Hillsborough, California, has this advice for teachers: &#147;Give kids as much exposure to computers as you can. Do different types of activities. Open-endedness in projects engages girls, thus leading to their success.&#148; Parents must be included in the process of encouraging girls to explore and become comfortable with high-tech equipment. Teachers should invite parents to conferences to discuss their daughters' use of technology and to project nights at the school.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Preferences.</B> Girls often prefer collaborative to individual work. Teachers can help by setting up their classrooms and designing activities to promote cooperation. Girls tend to demonstrate a learned helplessness in regard to technology, but by teaching them to do things themselves rather than doing things for them, teachers can foster girls' comfort and confidence in using technology. Whereas boys tend to tinker, girls usually want to accomplish a task when they sit down at a computer. While learning to use time wisely is an important skill, tinkering&#151;on the part of both girls and boys&#151;often leads to new discoveries and a better understanding of the technology. Centering instruction on programming appeals mainly to boys. Girls respond better when applications, rather than programming, are stressed. Girls are fully capable of programming, although they are often turned off by its apparent regimented nature. Teaching programming as a creative process with many solutions can entice girls, as can integrating computers into the curriculum and using them for a variety of activities. Associating computers only with math and science may turn many girls away. For example, girls can transfer math anxiety to computers if they are placed only in the context of mathematics. Instead, teachers can use computers in a variety of subject areas (reading, history, literature) and for a variety of purposes (word processing, research, design).</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Education reform.</B> Looking at many girls' preferences for using technology, one might infer that gender was part of education reform. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. Myra Sadker, David Sadker, and Sharon Steindam found that only one out of 138 articles on educational reform published between January 1983 and January 1987 discussed gender. The reform movement was not designed with gender in mind. To make a difference in regard to gender and technology, educators must make it a priority.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Appreciating both genders.</B> In a study conducted by the Center for Children and Technology in New York City, researchers asked both male and female technical experts to imagine future technological developments in their field. Their responses indicated clear gender differences in perceptions of technology. The women envisioned devices that connect people, improve communication and collaboration, integrate public and private lives, and improve upon existing technologies. Many talked about portable devices. The men imagined unlimited power, tremendous speed, and absolute knowledge. The men were fascinated with the equipment itself and sought major technological advances. Both sets of values and concerns are needed. The male gender has greatly advanced technology, although sometimes forgetting the needs of the user. On the other hand, the female gender focuses on the users and improving current technologies. Appreciation for both genders' learning styles and addressing them in instruction will help draw girls into technology.</P>

<P>Although teaching to a female-gender learning style is important, it is easy to fall into the equity trap. Jo Sanders explains that to attract girls to technology, teachers often feel they must appeal to sex-role stereotypes, thus reinforcing the status quo. However, if an attempt is made both to attract girls to technology and to broaden their horizons, they will probably not respond. &#147;The only solution I know to the equity trap is the incremental one of stretching girls' interests a little at a time,&#148; Sanders concludes.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Choosing software.</B> Software should be reviewed for gender bias and stereotyped sex roles. Today, with many women at the helm of educational software companies, most of the educational software products appeal to girls because of their purposeful nature. &#147;However, many educational software developers want to take advantage of video game appeal, such as in &#145;Mathblaster,&#146;&#148; remarks Maria Klawe. &#147;But, for the most part, girls are interested in educational software, since it has purpose and is often collaborative.&#148; Klawe also thinks it is a positive sign that &#147;women have participated at least equally in the leadership in this field.&#148;</P>

<P>For teachers who are concerned about gender bias in software, Jo Sanders offers this advice: &#147;By all means, use any software that works and that isn't insulting to get the girls to the computer, but then introduce them to all the other challenging and rewarding ways in which people use computers.&#148; Some developers are working on software with the purpose of motivating girls to investigate technology. Developers at the Center for Children and Technology created &#147;Imagine&#148; after interviewing children about new equipment they would like to create for themselves. &#147;Imagine&#148; lets kids design machines and animate the parts to show how they work. The purpose of the software is to validate girls' interests in design without needing previous knowledge of math and science. The design tool facilitates mental tinkering and spatial relationships to encourage girls to invent things.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Technology programs.</B> Several educational programs have been set up across the country that engage girls in the use of technology. Educators can incorporate these programs into their curriculums or encourage girls to attend the programs after school or during the summer (see <A HREF="/journal/volume3/sb3koch.htm">Technology Programs for Girls</A> Sidebar).</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>All-girl classrooms.</B> Many program administrators as well as researchers on gender bias in education support the use of all-girl classes (see <A HREF="/journal/volume3/sb3koch2.htm">Single-Sex Classrooms</A> Sidebar). Bess Bendet, coordinator of the Eureka and SMART programs at Girls Inc. of San Leandro, California, says all-girl classes are critical because girls are more comfortable taking risks in these environments. They can, in the words of one 13-year old, &#147;act smart without feeling dumb.&#148; In mixed classrooms, boys tend to take over, answering all the questions and using the equipment first. In all-girl classrooms, girls are forced to take on a variety of leadership roles and look to other girls for leadership. Girls' consciousness of themselves and of technology is raised, and female role models are provided.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Role models.</B> Because role models are critical but are often absent from girls' lives (see <A HREF="/journal/volume3/sb3koch3.htm">Who Are the Role Models?</A> Sidebar), several programs have women from industry visit girls' classes to discuss their careers. The instructors of these programs also serve as role models for the girls. Tracy LaQuey Parker, a role model for all girls and women in computer science and networking, believes in the power of role models. &#147;There aren't a lot out there. I think [they] are very important. Susan Estrada, an Internet expert and author of <I>Connecting to the Internet,</I> is my role model. Seeing her do things makes me feel I can do it.&#148;</P></LI>
</UL>

<P>Do these programs and efforts help? In response to visits by role models from Women of Vision at the Technology Museum in San Jose, many girls write letters saying they've changed their minds about science and math and are considering careers in these fields. The Computer Equity Expert Project trained 200 educators from across the country. As a result of this training, at a school in West Virginia, the computer club went from five percent girls to 53 percent girls in about a year. At a school in Montana, in a year and a half the percentage of girls enrolled in programming went from none to 31. Furthermore, in a national field test of <I>The Neuter Computer</I> by Jo Sanders, girls' computer participation increased by 144 percent in only one term. So the programs do work.</P>

<P>Energy and vision are needed from all gender perspectives. These efforts at recognizing gender bias and seeking solutions can make females active participants in technology. The female perspective, which many educators have ignored or devalued until now, is, ironically, at the heart of current struggles in technological development: improving technologies for the user, making better communication tools, and creating collaborative environments. It's up to educators and anyone concerned with education to make the effort to involve a vital resource, the female gender. Can we afford not to?</P>

<P><B><I>Ms. Rose's noisy sixth-grade students are bursting with energy. Some are working with Ms. Rose on measuring the height of various playground objects; others are using spreadsheets and creating charts to describe the measurements they've taken. While Ms. Rose is on the playground with several of the students Mr Vaille remains with other members of the class to answer questions and to make sure that each two-person group receives ample time on one of the six computers. Mr. Vaille checks the operation of a computer that Marka said was giving her trouble when she tried to open her multimedia report for her technology design class. He shows Marka the cause of the problem and lets her operate the mouse to fix it.</P>

<P>Marka shows Mr. Vaille her presentation. She has worked on elements of it at home on the family computer, incorporating sounds that her brother makes playing the electric guitar. Marka, along with several other girls in the class, also attends all-girl classes conducted by Girls Inc. After meeting several women mathematicians and computer scientists at Girls Inc., they decided to research women in math and science. In the classroom, they have posted pictures and biographies of them. Marka and Shirabe are excited about next week's visitors, two computer scientists from a local company, Ms. Martinez and Mr. Carter.</P>

<P><B><I>Telecommunications technology makes it possible to connect our computers to our phones to our TV sets&#151;to each other. Where is education's niche in this network we call the National Information Infrastructure, or NII?  Lifelong distance learning is the place, and the &#145;USE IT&#146; project provides the means with its 12 recommendations.</I></B></P>
<BR>
<P>Ever since the first correspondence courses provided schooling to pioneers settling the untamed West, distance learning has been a part of American education.  By the turn of the century, telecommunications had already entered the picture, as radio broadcasts of &#147;School of the Air&#148; provided formal educational programming to home listeners.  In the 1950s the first broadcast television courses for college credit were offered; and by the late 1980s, 50-year-old satellite technology had become a popular and cost-effective way to deliver instructional programming across the country. Today, quantum leaps in communications and information technology have dramatically changed the context of distance learning. What was once seen as merely an alternative method for delivering instruction is now a powerful resource for high-quality, lifelong learning. Developing this relatively untapped resource should be a priority for educators, private industry, and telecommunications service providers.</P>

<P><B>Distance Learning Today</B><BR>
Almost all of the tools of telecommunications, including broadcast television, satellite, cable, microwave, computer, and telephone networks, are already being used for distance learning. Innovative new applications&#151;from direct broadcast satellites (DBS) and digital compression to inexpensive, user-friendly communications software&#151;are quickly being added to the distance learning menu. As a result, old and new technologies can be combined and integrated in ways that not only fill caps in curriculum or mining objectives but also offer better learning opportunities. Today's distance learning experience bears little resemblance to the &#147;talking head&#148; tele-courses of the past. Instead, digital video, fax machines, electronic mail, instructional software, and traditional classroom activities coexist in an enriched learning environment.</P>

<P>The telecommunications industry is rapidly developing the growing web of complementary and competitive services commonly referred to as the National Information Infrastructure, or NII. The NII promises to provide full voice, video, and data services, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to offer quality education to more citizens than ever before. In spite of industry emphasis on business and entertainment applications, Americans increasingly rank education and instruction* as top priorities for services they hope to receive from the NII. The Clinton Administration's telecommunications initiatives have reinforced this conviction, challenging the industry to link every school and library to the NII.</P>

<P>(*<FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of this article, &#147;education and instruction&#148; are intended to include lifelong learning from formal schooling: K&#150;12, community colleges, colleges, universities, job training and retraining, adult literacy, and continuing education. Technology is increasing the likelihood that anyone can learn at anytime and at any place and is challenging established definitions.)</FONT></P>

<P>The need for greater access to a broader range of learning options is obvious. The demands of the modern workplace require workers who not only are technologically literate but also are creative problem solvers able to continually learn new skills. Decades of education research tell us that learning linked to real-world applications is critical. Worker training, adult education, and professional development all continue to challenge educators and businesses alike. Distance learning is essential for meeting these expanding education and training needs, but the fact remains that most institutions lack the resources&#151;human, financial, and infrastructural&#151;either to access it or to make effective use of it.</P>

<P>In 1994 the 103rd Congress passed significant education legislation, including the benchmark Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which lay out comprehensive national objectives for education in this country. This legislation, for the first time, provides leadership and funding support for planning for educational technology. State education agencies, building on federal government support and industry initiatives, are designing and implementing plans for using telecommunications. Schools, colleges, and businesses are all realizing the potential for distance learning resources to provide greater access to effective educational experiences. Clearly, distance learning is a growing piece of the mosaic of learning technologies needed to achieve the nation's education goals.</P>

<P><B>Exemplary Programs</B><BR>
By integrating telecommunications technologies and resources, local communities are able to design programs tailored to meet particular learning needs. The state of Mississippi, for example, is addressing its literacy problems with satellite distance learning: Project LEAP (Learn, Earn, And Prosper) uses downlink sites in elementary and secondary schools to provide job training and GED completion courses to adult learners, many of whom are single mothers receiving public assistance. While Project LEAP uses a variety of local, regional, and national programming, other projects are creating their own content. A few years ago, innovative teachers in Mason County, West Virginia, came up with one such project to help students who were a few credits short of high school graduation complete the needed coursework. Using relatively inexpensive low-end equipment, a team of local teachers produced courses in the most critical subjects and worked out an agreement with the local cable company to air the programs four days a week for two hours each day. Realizing the powerful potential of cable to reach students in their homes, a county that couldn't afford to offer traditional summer school was able to meet its citizens' immediate needs. The challenge to educators is to make sense of the bewildering array of technologies and resources, then make informed decisions toward achieving specific learning goals.</P>

<P>Distance learning continues to expand its traditional role of providing education in subjects not otherwise available. The Star Schools program, which has delivered distance-learning services to more than 500,000 students nationwide, continues to find foreign languages, mathematics, and science courses among its most popular. Filling gaps in curriculum is still the most common use of telecommunications in K&#150;12; half of small, rural school districts use some form of distance learning. But new technologies have begun to offer more than just distributed courses; electronic communications and high-quality two-way video programming have made possible electronic field trips, access to remote sites and distant experts, and unique opportunities for dialogue and collaboration. Increasingly, distance learning is doing more than just bringing the class to the learner; it is truly breaking down classroom walls.</P>

<P>Effective use of distance learning requires a thorough understanding of both learning needs and available technologies. Since the early 1980s, more information is stored in electronic format than resides in all of the print-based libraries in the world. The increased power of information technologies and the growth of distance learning resources at affordable costs are revolutionizing education. For some communities, telecommunications networks are changing the nature of learning and teaching and are linking homes, libraries, schools, and businesses into a community-wide learning resource. Taken together, these resources give learners control of what, where, and when they learn. Schools and communities that fail to understand the magnitude of such changes inevitably will fail to provide their citizens with the tools needed to learn and achieve world-class academic standards.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/1nii.gif" align=right hspace=10>Understanding the possibilities, though a daunting task, is only the beginning. Planning for the use of these technologies requires a rethinking of traditional education structures, from administrative organization and cost accounting systems to teacher training and instructional design. Effective use of distance learning depends on a combination of expertise in technology, content, infrastructure building, and school administration; few institutions offer opportunities to bring this expertise together. The lack of &#147;technology-friendly&#148; organizational environments is a major barrier to planning. Unfortunately, the ineffective use that results from inadequate planning often devalues the potential of the technology itself in the eyes of many decision makers.</P>

<P><B>Cost Considerations</B><BR>
Issues of cost-effectiveness touch at the heart of institutional barriers. Most K&#150;12 schools use accrual accounting, which merges costs for all aspects of school administration without distinguishing among content areas. Distance learning becomes an add-on cost, the effectiveness of which is difficult to evaluate. Schools must develop accounting structures that include amortized equipment costs and operating and maintenance costs, as well as the actual costs for content, training, and technical support. Moore's law, which states that the processing power of the microchip doubles at least every 18 months, is in direct conflict with school systems, which are accustomed to amortizing equipment and other capital expenses over as much as a 20- to 30- year time period.</P>

<P>The business world has already learned the lesson of cost-effectiveness. Ford Motor Company has been providing real-time, interactive university-level courses to employees directly to their desktop computers. The company realized that the initial investment in infrastructure made training their employees much more efficient in the long run. Hewlett Packard, which used to fly employees into training centers at a cost of millions per seminar, has saved over 98 percent of training costs by switching to distance learning.</P>

<P>To the extent that successful business and education networks can cooperate and learn from each other, entire communities can benefit. The Community College Satellite Network, for example, has encouraged such cooperation: businesses and local organizations develop training that uses the facilities of a local community college, approximately 85 percent of which have access to satellite networks. Partnerships between the public and private sector are critical. Community and district planning for distance learning is absolutely essential if schools are to take advantage of economies of scale for both hardware and content resources, and to avoid duplicating valuable resources.</P>

<P><B>The Future is Now</B><BR>
Schools must learn to work with the telecommunications industry and government regulators to guarantee students adequate access to communications networks and reasonable rates to use it. Distance learning service providers, in turn, must work with educators to develop distance learning projects that are directly linked to content standards and learning objectives. This important dialogue is the only way to ensure that resources are effectively incorporated into the classroom. Too often, programs that may enhance classroom instruction go unused because they cannot be easily fit into rigid lesson plans. Basic issues like inflexible scheduling become enormous obstacles between quality resources and student needs. Learners and educators at all levels must equip themselves to harness the potential for distance learning&#151;to help remedy inequities, to provide flexible learning to those who are hardest to reach, and to enhance even the most traditional learning environments.</P>

<P>This is an important time for distance learning. The need for lifelong opportunities for education and training is affecting all Americans; telecommunications policy is being actively debated; and advances in technologies are making them cheaper, more powerful, and easier to use. The NII is being developed now, and it is being developed quickly. Distance learning could be a valuable dimension to life in the Information Age, but developing its potential requires immediate public and private action. Federal, state, and local governments, educators at all levels, private industry, and telecommunications service providers must all work toward making distance learning affordable, effective, and accessible.</P>

<P><B><I>&#147;I have a good teacher who makes me think.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;She really cares for us, and we care for her, too.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;In her class, we're not considered hoodlums; we're considered students.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;She doesn't tell us the answer-she makes us find out for ourselves.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;She's leading me down a path to my future.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;I never had a teacher like Miss Toliver&#133;&#148;</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>New York City&#151;Manhattan. If you walk north from Central Park on Lexington Avenue and turn east on 104th Street, you pass family delis and faded signs advertising shoe repair. An occasional storefront is boarded up, and several gutted buildings stare down at you as you pass. Graffiti is ubiquitous; climbing up brick walls and covering phone booths, it makes a slightly uneven backdrop to the motion of the city. This is Spanish Harlem, also known as East Harlem.</P>

<P>Before long, you reach East Harlem Tech/Public School 72 and its asphalt playgrounds. This is a math and science magnet school, a school of choice. Called &#147;alternative,&#148; it houses approximately 900 students&#151;800 in the elementary grades and 100 in East Harlem Tech, the junior high component. The student body is approximately 85 percent Hispanic and 15 percent African American.</P>

<P>The media, with their customary emphasis on things negative, might lead you to expect East Harlem to be an unlikely place to find educational excellence. But East Harlem Tech is home to math teacher Kay Toliver, who, for 27 years, has been instilling a love of and thirst for knowledge in middle school students.</P>

<P>Toliver is a teacher on the cutting edge of mathematics education, one who has been carefully following the changes in emphasis promulgated in recent years by groups such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. She stresses application and thinking skills over computation, holds open class discussions, and weaves language, history, and art into the study of mathematics. Recently she received awards for her innovative teaching techniques. In 1992 she won the Superintendent's Award for her school district, received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching, and was chosen as the Outstanding Teacher for Mathematics Instruction at Disney's American Teacher Awards. In 1993 she earned the New York City Reliance Award for Excellence in Education.</P>

<P>But Toliver has been teaching this way since 1967, when, as a new teacher just out of New York City's Hunter College, she came to P.S. 72, rolled up her sleeves, and got to work. Perhaps it has taken these decades for the mainstream to catch up with her.</P>

<P><B>Math as a Communication Art</B></P>

<P>She calls her class Mathematics and Communication Arts, for Toliver considers math a precise language that students of any age can learn to use fluently. &#147;When students arrive in my class, the first thing I tell them is that everybody can do mathematics to some degree,&#148; she says.</P>

<P>The first communication skill Toliver's students must develop is an understanding of math vocabulary. Words such as &#147;area,&#148; &#147;volume,&#148; &#147;mean,&#148; and &#147;mode&#148; have distinct mathematical meanings which, if not fully grasped, make the subject confusing. &#147;In order for students to understand the concepts that are being introduced to them, they must have an understanding of those words associated with the topic,&#148; she says. &#147;Therefore, we spend quite a bit of time on vocabulary.&#148;</P>

<P>She teaches seventh and eighth graders. Because her students often have unstable educational backgrounds, their language skills are poor. That is one reason Toliver puts heavy emphasis on writing, reading, and research. Her students must always be prepared to explain their solutions orally, in clear sentences.</P>

<P>Students are required to keep daily journals. They write about what they learned in class, ideas about how to apply the concepts they study, or simply comments and observations about the classroom or about Toliver. The primary purpose of the journals is to get students to write, for Toliver believes that the ability to express themselves in written English must be acquired hand in hand with mathematical ability.</P>

<P>&#147;I'm always trying to come up with more ways to get my kids to write,&#148; Toliver explains. &#147;What better way to achieve this than to have them explain their thoughts and feelings about math class?&#148; The journals also provide an intimate glimpse of her students' confusions or realizations. They allow her to assess herself as a teacher, correct misunderstandings, and review lessons when necessary. &#147;A teacher can stand in front of the class and think she's giving a great lesson. But that's not always the truth. By reading the journals, I find out if I'm really communicating effectively.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="4tolivec.gif" align=right hspace=10><I>&#147;I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE&#148;&#151;Toliver's hands-on lesson on estimating features a tasty snack of raisins.</I></P>

<P>A story or poem may provide entrance into a new mathematical concept. The Dr. Seuss book <I>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</I>, for example, is the basis for a lesson on complex fractions. For this lesson, Toliver even supplies the oobleck&#151;a liquid cornstarch mixture the students can dig into as they try to determine the correct proportions of its ingredients.</P>

<P>She also requires her class to research famous mathematicians or to learn about the contributions of various ethnic groups to the development of math throughout history. As she writes in an essay for the Winter 1993 issue of Howard University's <I>Journal of Negro Education</I>, &#147;Mathematics has existed for thousands of years, developing through diverse cultures, and finally arriving in the present for junior high schoolers to study. Learning the history lends math a fullness and overall importance it may not otherwise have, and research exposes students to great minds who have made outstanding contributions to human knowledge.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Math Fair, Math Trail</B></P>

<P>Over the years, Toliver has developed unique class projects as a way for her students to apply math and language skills to activities outside the classroom.</P>

<P>In 1988 she began the Math Fair at East Harlem Tech. Much like a science fair, the project originally was for her eighth-grade students to show off the knowledge they had gained in eight years of studying math. Students created games such as &#147;Math Jeopardy,&#148; &#147;Dunking for Prime Numbers,&#148; and &#147;Black Jack Geometry.&#148; They also did research projects. One student made a presentation on the Fibonacci sequence (in which each number equals the sum of the previous two). In another project, students were polled on their musical tastes, with the results presented on charts. When the projects were finished, they were displayed for the whole school. By explaining their projects to the younger students, the eighth graders inspired them to continue their own studies of math.</P>

<P>The fair was so popular that East Harlem Tech/P.S. 72's principal, Susan Siegel, asked Toliver to hold a schoolwide Math Fair the following year. For the second year's fair, each grade level created projects relating to the topics they had studied that year&#151;from displays of sorting and colors by the kindergarten students to basic algebra in the upper grades. The Math Fair is now an annual event at P.S. 72.</P>

<P><I><IMG SRC="4tolivbw.gif"align=left hspace=10>&#147;SHE'S LEADING ME DOWN A PATH TO MY FUTURE&#148;&#151;Kay Toliver and her students embark on the Math Trail.</I></P>

<P>The Math Trail began in 1992 when Toliver discovered that much of the damage done to school property&#151;broken windows, graffiti, and the like&#151;was caused by the students themselves. It was obvious that the kids at East Harlem Tech had little respect for or appreciation of their school or their environment. Toliver first heard of the Math Trail from an Australian teacher, Dudley Wayne, in 1991. In her class, the project evolved as a way to get students out into the community in order to learn that there are beautiful things in their everyday environment and to seek out applications of math in the real world. As her students work on the Math Trail, she finds that they begin to have a feeling of ownership for their community, a sense of pride in the things around them.</P>

<P>The project begins with the students researching the East Harlem community, reading about the history of the area and finding the borders of East Harlem in relation to the rest of Manhattan. They are surprised to discover that the area, now predominantly Hispanic, was once Jewish and, before that, Italian. They find that street names have changed over the years.</P>

<P>After the research comes the trail itself, when Toliver's students, in independent groups, follow their plotted paths through the neighborhood, visiting and photographing the park, shops, and other points of interest along the way, looking for math applications. When they return to class, they create their own books of math problems relating to what they have seen. One group counted how many elevated trains passed the corner of Lexington and 103rd Street in one minute. Then they posed the problem: How many trains would pass in one hour? Another group asked the question: If the jewelry store down the street is having a 40-percent-off sale, how much does a $35 necklace cost? And, if a parking meter costs 25 cents for every 15 minutes, how much money could the meter collect in eight hours?</P>

<P>The books are made of bright construction paper and decorated with student art work. The first page always includes a map of the Math Trail so other students can walk the path and solve the problems. &#147;Now my eighth graders are writing math problems that can be solved by next year's students,&#148; Toliver says. &#147;They not only become problem solvers; they know math well enough to find the problems.&#148;</P>

<P>One of her greatest discoveries on this end-of-the-year project was that students who scored well on tests were not necessarily the ones with the best grasp of mathematical concepts. While walking the trail, one girl pointed to a rooftop and observed that there were two similar triangles in the architecture. When Toliver asked her how she would go about proving this, the girl explained that similar triangles have proportional sides and that the angles would remain the same regardless of the length of the sides. Her answer showed a deep understanding of geometric concepts, yet she had failed three-quarters of Toliver's written tests.</P>

<B><P>A Family Atmosphere</B></P>

<P>The tone in Toliver's classroom transcends the academic. She has made school a home for these children. Many of her students are exposed to drugs or crime. Frequently one parent or the other is gone, or a child may be in foster care. Too often a sibling is in jail, and the students are stepping into the life of the street.</P>

<P>Many call such students disadvantaged. Some say they cannot really be taught. But Toliver disagrees. She herself grew up in the South Bronx and East Harlem, and she understands the problems they face. She also realizes that despite their environment, their socioeconomic level, or the example set by many of their peers, her students have arrived at school. School is their chance to rise above the chaos around them and expand their world, and Toliver refuses to let them down. &#147;I don't feel sorry for my students. And I don't want them to feel sorry for themselves,&#148; she says. &#147;I want them to get up and walk and make their lives better. And the way they make their lives better is through education.&#148;</P>

<P>The atmosphere in her classroom is one of mutual respect; it is a place where students feel safe to make mistakes and to ask questions. Discipline is not a problem; the students know she is there to teach and that a certain decorum, a certain amount of consideration, is required. They know Toliver works hard to make math understandable and interesting, and they do not waste her time with distractions.</P>

<P>One student&#151;let's call him Xavier Mendez&#151;was living in a homeless shelter when he came to Toliver's class in 1988. His mother had been released from a mental institution not long before. Their apartment had burned down, leaving them nowhere to go but the shelter. Xavier spoke to almost no one. The other students secretly laughed at him. He began coming to school early to get out of the shelter. One morning at 7:30 Toliver found him crouched in a corner of the hall by her classroom. &#147;If you decide to come in early,&#148; she told him, &#147;you can help me.&#148; He brightened up a bit and became her helper that year. Toliver gave him breakfast in exchange.</P>

<P>The other students, seeing how much Toliver cared for him, gradually began to accept him. Soon Xavier felt safe enough in the classroom that he was not afraid to participate. By the end of the school year, he had opened up, made friends, and shown himself to be an excellent student. It turned out that he was also an artist. When Xavier graduated from eighth grade, Toliver helped him get into a high school art program. In February 1992, Xavier dropped by P.S. 72 to show Toliver his high school diploma. He told her that he had taken advanced courses and was able to finish high school six months early. What's more, he was on his way to Hunter College that very day to plan his spring semester.</P>

<P>Toliver likes to use Xavier as an example of students who need a little extra attention. On the surface they may seem unwilling to learn or impossible to reach, but given the chance and enough care, most will rise to the occasion and begin to learn. &#147;We don't need different methods to teach so-called disadvantaged children,&#148; she says. &#147;We just need teachers who are dedicated and who believe their students can succeed.&#148;</P>

<P>Over the years, Toliver has observed that as her students begin to master the language of mathematics and learn to express themselves clearly, their performance in other classes improves as well. By gaining a firm hold of one subject, they are able to tackle education in general. Toliver's basic goal, beneath the projects, journals, and assignments, is to draw out her students' intelligence, to challenge them to use their minds, to teach them to reason. &#147;No matter what they choose to do in life, students must learn to think,&#148; she says.</P>

<P><B>The Role of Technology</B></P>

<P>Philosophic arguments about the appropriate use of technology in education are overshadowed by economic reality at East Harlem Tech. The issue is not whether technology is valuable&#151;that's a given&#151;but whether it's available. There are only 20 working computers in all of P.S. 72.</P>

<P>Toliver feels strongly that her students must learn to use computers, and learn to use them well, to be prepared to work in the 21st century. Whenever possible, she has her students type assignments in the computer lab. By teaming up with the computer teacher, she succeeded in getting the students to use computers to write simple programs relating to geometric formulas and for other math exercises. &#147;If I had computers in my classroom, I'd certainly integrate them into my lessons,&#148; Toliver says. &#147;But right now, we're having trouble affording calculators.&#148;</P>

<P>With the money she received from her Presidential Award, Toliver is purchasing software and two computers for her school's computer lab, but the process of acquiring enough equipment has been slow. Her primary hope is that initiatives to bring technology into schools will emphasize equal access for all students. &#147;Students are going to need more and more education in order to find a rather basic job,&#148; she says. &#147;But we can't prepare them unless we have the technology.&#148;</P>

<P><B>A Model Teacher</B></P>

<P>When teachers visit Toliver's classroom, one of their first observations is that this teacher of nearly 30 years is not &#147;burnt out.&#148; Her response is that she has never given up being a student in life and has never stopped looking for new ways to teach or avenues of knowledge. It is her love of learning that she hopes to pass on to her students, whatever careers they may choose. This, she says, is the greatest contribution a teacher can make. &#147;It is a thrill to hear that my students have finished high school and gone on to college, for I know they are continuing to challenge themselves and will really do something in life.&#148;</P>

<P>Toliver always hopes some of her students will become teachers, but only a few have done so over the years. Recently, however, after she appeared on a television special, five students in a class of 35 told her they wanted to become teachers. &#147;I became a real-life role model,&#148; she says. &#147;It was wonderful to see young students taking pride in education, because we need more people who love to teach.&#148;</P>

<P>And Toliver does love to teach. She is working as a mentor to other teachers in an effort to reach all of the students in her school. She laughs at the suggestion that she would ever leave the classroom. &#147;What else would I do?&#148; she asks. &#147;I'm a teacher.&#148;</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Apprenticeship American Style</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Anne C. Lewis</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I>&#147;We've got two very clear tracks right now&#151;College prep and &#145;Nowhere&#146; Prep,&#148; bemoans the parent of a Wisconsin High School student. But the move to another track, that of youth apprenticeship, is part of the strategy for the future of American education. For the players of this game, making the right move will take on a whole new meaning as they gain work experience and academic training. Noted education writer and Washington insider Anne Lewis considers the American version of apprenticeship. Will it work here?</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><IMG SRC="2chess.gif" align=left hspace=10>The profit ledgers for overseas airlines ought to be heavily black these days, considering the number of travelers from the United States who are out looking for the school-to-work system to copy. They land primarily in Germany, with side trips to Denmark and other Scandinavian countries. Some go the other way, to study how Japan's high schools educate and place students in workplaces.</P>

<P>When they come back to write their reports and books, the almost unanimous recommendation is that the United States needs a youth apprenticeship system. Not only should the transition from school to work be seamless, is the advice, but also it must give young people opportunities to develop higher skills and gain knowledge about technology&#151;and real workplaces are the best places to do this.</P>

<P><B>A Changing Picture</B></P>

<P>Less than three years ago, the word &#147;apprenticeship&#148; was almost unknown in U.S. education and workplace circles. The Department of Labor funded a small demonstration program, primarily for youth in their late twenties. Cooperative and distributive education programs in schools traditionally provided work experiences, but they did not link education and training very well. Scattered proposals and experiments, such as Tech Prep&#151;the melding of vocational preparation in the last two years of high school with two years of technical/community college education&#151;popped up here and there.</P>

<P>Then, at a Washington, D.C., one-day meeting in December 1990, the picture changed abruptly. Several hundred people crowded into a hotel meeting room, brought together to discuss school-to-work transitions for the &#147;forgotten half&#148; by the William T. Grant Foundation Commission on Work, Family, and Citizenship and other groups. They heard apprenticeship mentioned loud and clear as the most viable strategy for the nation's youth and economy.</P>

<P>Since then, states have adopted policies and programs supporting apprenticeships, networks have been formed, pilot projects are rampant, and politicians elevated what had been mostly a demonstration project to a federal policy initiative. As a building block of its economic growth plan, for example, the Clinton Administration is asking the Departments of Education and Labor to sponsor jointly an apprenticeship program for youth, starting at $270 million in fiscal 1994 and authorized at $500 million through fiscal 1997.</P>

<P>But can the United States really import a German or Japanese model and make it work here? Is there agreement on what is meant by &#147;apprenticeship&#148;? Is the apprenticeship model the best way to guarantee that youth are prepared for high-skill work?</P>

<P><B>Systems vs. Programs</B></P>

<P>The principles of apprenticeship are good for American young people, believes Stephen Hamilton of Cornell University. He directs the Cornell Youth and Work Program, an apprenticeship demonstration emphasizing the development of a skill certification system that embodies high-skill standards. A leading proponent of apprenticeships at that Washington kick-off meeting, Hamilton points out that other developed countries &#147;take it as a natural phenomenon that young people not going on to higher education after high school should spend several years doing work that school prepares them for.&#148; In this country, however, there is not much difference between the work experiences of students before and after high school. When they graduate, he says, they flounder around &#147;in the same work they did while they were in school&#148;&#151;such as in fast-food and retail jobs.</P>

<P>Hamilton acknowledges that Germany, Japan, and other countries with strong connections between school and work have systems, not programs, while the opposite is true in the United States. In those countries, employers, labor unions, and schools plan and implement apprenticeship programs together. In this country, no such tradition exists. In fact, organized labor has been very cautious about endorsing the expansion of youth apprenticeship programs. Interviews with 14 labor officials by Jobs for the Future in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found more concern about than support for a youth apprenticeship model&#151;particularly the impact upon current workers.</P>

<P>One problem is the definition of the term &#147;apprenticeship.&#148; As it is being used by current supporters, it is misleading, according to Tony Sarmiento, assistant director of the AFL-CIO Education Department. Standards for apprenticeships imply that the trainee is an employee with the protections that status brings with it, that there is wage progression, and that the content is  not firm-specific, he says. But current youth apprenticeship models seem to have none of these elements. U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich told a conference of the Joint Center on Economic Policy, a minority research/policy group, that apprenticeship &#147;is a term that has risen from obscurity directly into meaninglessness.&#148;</P>

<P>Moreover, important questions are being raised about the readiness and willingness of the business sector to participate in building an apprenticeship system. It certainly would be a new experience for most American businesses. In a 1991 survey of 4,000 companies, the National Association of Manufacturers found that 60 percent believed work experience is one of the best ways to develop good skills in entry-level workers. However, only five percent of the companies were participating in work/learn programs with the schools. The American business community may point proudly to the $30 billion a year it spends on training employees, but the fine print shows that only 0.5 percent of the employers&#151;15,000&#151;account for 90 percent of that spending. Further, almost all of the investment is in people with some managerial experience and education, the management level and above. Less than one percent of the training dollars goes to unskilled workers.</P>

<P><B>Some Considerations</B></P>

<P>Practically speaking, recent trends in the economy would not seem propitious for a turnaround in business attitudes about investing in youth training. An increasing percentage of the work force&#151;estimated to be 30 percent&#151;is now employed part-time or on a contingency basis. Though the Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics hedges, Sarmiento cites a University of Lowell (Massachusetts) study that estimates five million part-time workers, of whom one million are working two part time jobs. &#147;If businesses are moving in this direction with regular employees, why would they want to take on a youth apprenticeship program?&#148; asks Sue Berryman, former director of the Institute on Education and the Economy at Teachers College, Columbia University. Now with the World Bank, Berryman is just as passionate as Cornell's Hamilton about wanting to link what youth learn in school to what they need to know in the workplace. The issue as she sees it, however, is where best to put such learning.</P>

<P>Hamilton insists that, properly designed and supervised, real workplaces &#147;can contribute not only to job training but also to making schooling more relevant.&#148; Students may not appreciate learning higher order math in school, he says, but &#147;when they see people using such math, not at McDonald's but in a high tech machine shop, they begin to make connections.&#148;</P>

<P>Berryman, on the other hand, cautions about overselling the workplace as an educating place. Some workplace training she has observed is highly inadequate, particularly if it uses traditional drill-and-skill methods. If the employer focuses on high skills and modern methods of teaching, though, the training could be quite good. The downside, as other researchers have pointed out, is that the turnover among supervisors at workplaces creates situations where novices are training novices.</P>

<P><B>A Few Options</B></P>

<P>Do not let schools off the hook in preparing youth for an increasingly high-skill economy, Berryman advises. The bulk of occupational training (redefined) ought to be in the schools, she says, but in a way that makes maximum use of the resources of the workplace (such as equipment, personnel, involvement in setting standards, career counseling). Options are available, though not all are well-defined or have been implemented properly.  In addition to cooperative education and apprenticeships, Berryman lists:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> <P><B>Cognitive apprenticeship.</B> This in-school strategy uses &#147;experts&#148; to introduce gradually and guide students through the skills they will need&#151;as tailors, for example, once taught their apprentices. It's still a &#147;hot-house idea,&#148; popular in theoretical articles but not yet implemented.</P>

<LI> <P><B>Tech Prep.</B> Encouraged by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of l990, this provides a sequence of course work, usually beginning at the 11th grade, that continues through community/technical college and provides both a high school diploma and an associate's degree in a specific field. Work experience is an important component.</P>

<LI> <P><B>Integration of academic and vocational education.</B> Also emphasized in federal vocational programs, this model seeks to reform the school curriculum, although real work experiences often are part of the overall effort. It has been most successful in the 13 states under the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB). Through a grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, SREB has expanded to l00 sites in l9 states and is expected to grow to 300 sites by the end of 1994.</P>

<LI><P> <B>School-based enterprises.</B> Originating many years ago in Arkansas and Georgia, this model engages high school students in identifying businesses that might be supported locally, especially in rural areas. Enterprises help students develop and maintain businesses such as retail stores, bicycle repair shops, or child care facilities. One of the cleverest was a restaurant started by students in North Carolina on the interstate to Florida. The students named it the &#147;Way Off Broadway Deli.&#148;</P>

<LI> <P><B>In-school academies.</B> These can be career magnet schools or schools-within-schools emphasizing a specific, sequential curriculum that prepares students for occupations. Usually they're organized with the help of local businesses, which offer on the job experiences.</P>
</UL>

<P>Of all of these options, Berryman sees Tech Prep and magnet schools as the most promising components with which to build a school-to work transition system in this country. Both can include apprenticeships, and both also can incorporate using workplace experts to help with school-based instruction.</P>

<P>No matter what pieces are put together, she adds, they all need to emphasize more and more how to deal with abstract thinking and appropriate technologies. Young people, she says, &#147;need to be bloody well prepared&#148; for work that will continue its march toward higher skills.</P>

<P><B>State Leadership</B></P>

<P>For Hamilton, these various bottom-up approaches to a system that he hopes will depend heavily upon apprenticeships is being matched by top-down policies at state and federal levels. Good examples abound.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> <P>The <B>Wisconsin</B> legislature approved a youth apprenticeship program in l991, making it part of a general school reform plan. This component requires 10th-grade students to pass a &#147;gateway assessment&#148; before being allowed to gain workplace experience. Their work placements are competency-based, integrate with academics, focus on high-skill occupations, and pay students a minimum wage. Students receive dual credit from a technical college and are credentialed statewide by the industry.</P>

<LI><P> In a similar vein is the <B>Oregon</B> school-to-work transition plan and its apprenticeship program. The state is developing assessments of mastery to be taken by all 16 year-olds; those who pass the assessments will have several options, including a registered apprenticeship program to help them enter high-skill and high-wage employment. The initial focus will be on six job categories: health services, industry and technology, human resources, natural resources, arts and communications, and business management.</P>

<LI> <P><B>Maine</B> has set up a Center for Youth Apprenticeship at Southern Maine Technical College in South Portland. That state's apprenticeship program&#151;to begin in 20 percent of its high schools in 1993&#151;offers 30 weeks of workplace experience during the eleventh grade. Then follows two years of further education and work, with the first year of college at no expense to the student.</P>

<LI> <P><B>Oakland, California</B>, offers eight schools-within-schools, each focused on a specific occupation. Its Health and Bioscience Academy, for example, enrolls 175 students chosen because they are at risk but show an interest in health-related careers. They outperform students in the regular school around them. Among the &#147;specials&#148; enjoyed by these students are smaller classes, tutoring, internships, mentors, and part time jobs.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Common Elements</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="2wpr.gif"align=right hpsace=10><I>Communication skills and dependability enable a diverse work force such as the Banquet Kitchen Team at the Scottsdale, Arizona, Plaza Resort, to work together effectively. The chef and his crew are featured in the &#147;Teamwork&#148; module of</I> Workplace Readiness, <I>a three-part multi-technology series from AIT.</I></P>

<P>Jobs for the Future is a major proponent of apprenticeships. It is providing technical assistance to newly funded demonstration projects selected by the Department of Labor. In addition, the Department has given planning grants to six states&#151;California, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, and Wisconsin&#151;to design and implement statewide youth apprenticeship systems.</P>

<P>Because the movement in the United States is so new, no single model of youth apprenticeship has been developed, according to Jobs for the Future. It has identified some elements that distinguish apprenticeships from other forms of school-to-work links:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> <P>Active participation of employers, not only in providing jobs but also in developing curriculum and industry standards.</P>

<LI><P> Integration of work-based and school-based learning so that the learning at one place reinforces learning at the other.</P>

<LI> <P>Integration of academic and vocational learning, focusing on cognitive as well as technical skill development.</P>

<LI> <P>Structural links between secondary and postsecondary institutions, so that credits may be transferred to four-year colleges and universities.</P>

<LI> <P>Award of a broadly recognized qualification of occupational skill, particularly a certificate of mastery of skills recognized by firms across the industry in which students train.</P>
</UL>

<P>Richard Kazis, director of work-based learning programs for Jobs for the Future,* welcomes the possibilities for building a &#147;system&#148; of school-to-work transitions that incorporates these components. But he also cautions against new federal policies that promote apprenticeships at the exclusion of other options, such as youth service, cooperative education, and high school career academies. What needs to be encouraged, he says, is continued diversity and experimentation as the country moves toward a solid system, one that &#147;will outlast a few demonstration projects&#151;or another change in administration&#133;.&#148;</P>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Joan E. Lewis</H3>
<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="1light.gif" align=left hspace=10>The hot topic in communications these days is fiber-optic networks. The potential for this communications technology&#151;one that uses light to transport sound, images, and data along fibers of glass&#151;seems limited only by imagination, but the cost to implement fiber optics nationwide is enormous. Even more sizeable is the amount of money that will eventually come to the providers of this service. This big-bucks potential is the carrot at the end of the stick toward which telephone and cable companies and others are scrambling. Education seems destined to play the role of major catalyst in fiber-optic network implementation and expansion, but there are many questions&#151;including who owns and who pays&#151;that need to be resolved along the way.</P>

<P><B>As the Paradigm Shifts</B></P>

<P>In communications technology, the market process moves quickly. We marvel at each technological advance only briefly before we ask for more. If we have broadcast, we want interaction. If we have data, we want voice. If we have voice, we want images&#151;in color, no less.</P>

<P>If our insatiable hunger spurs the development of communications technology, it in turn inspires us to rethink our business and education paradigms. The current surge to incorporate distance learning in instructional programs of all levels is a prime example. The concept of distance learning&#151;teachers and learners in different locations&#151;isn't new. Satellite and cable broadcasts have a firm place in education, and interaction by computer data carried over existing telephone lines continues to grow. But recent technology, which enables teachers and learners in different locations to interact as if they were in the same room, has changed the concept of distance learning and is making it a pivotal tool in education reform.</P>

<P>The rationale is straightforward: If technology enables us to join learners (regardless of location) to highly competent instructors and information sources (regardless of location) in an interactive teaching-learning environment, we can apply that technology to make high-quality education accessible to all.</P>

<P>As distance learning programs pop up across the country, education associations are offering guidelines that will affect the expansion of certain technologies. The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) issued a position statement in July 1990 that establishes criteria for applying distance learning. A key NSTA criterion is the capability for interaction between instructors and learners.</P>

<P>The National Education Association (NEA) also regards interactivity as key and lists it as one of the five standards &#147;that should guide the development of a telecommunications infrastructure for the twenty-first century.&#148; These standards, which also include interconnectivity, decentralization, broadband capacity, and equity, appear in the NEA's 1992 testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Communications of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. If we view NEA's standards as job qualifications for technology candidates, fiber-optic networks hold the winning resume because fiber can best meet all of these requirements.</P>

<P><B>Is Fiber Really Better?</B></P>

<P>The quality of a communications transmission system is often measured by the product of two quantities: The distance the signal can go without an amplifier or a repeater to keep the signal strong, and the amount of information-carrying capability, or bandwidth, the signal has. Systems labeled &#147;broadband&#148; have the capacity to carry thousands of telephone calls or television programs simultaneously.</P>

<P>There are three major ground communication transmission vehicles: pairs of twisted copper wires, used by the telephone companies (telcos); coaxial cable, used by the cable television (CATV) companies; and optical fibers now being implemented by both. Of the three, copper offers the fewest advantages, while optical fibers far outshine the other two.</P>

<P>In addition to having almost unlimited bandwidth, optical fibers transmit more information quickly and with less need for amplifiers than either copper or coaxial. Fiber is not affected by lightning, power lines, motors, or generators. That means no static on the line. Optical fibers are lighter than copper wires and coaxial cable and therefore are easier for installers to handle. Fibers are smaller, so they take up less space, and the base product, glass, is one of the cheapest materials available. Finally, fiber provides top security because it is extremely difficult to tap. Terry Forkner, manager of the Systems Integration Group for Indiana Bell, says, &#147;It just doesn't make sense to deploy anything other than fiber.&#148;</P>

<P>The rest of the world seems to agree. Other countries, such as Germany and Poland, are laying fiber, and Japan is updating its infrastructure with fiber. In this Age of Information, no one wants to be left behind.</P>

<P>How does it work? The fibers of fiber-optic technology start as individual rods about the length of a yardstick with a diameter a little larger than a quarter. The rods are constructed of many layers of glass. The core of the rod&#151;highly transparent, nearly flawless glass&#151;is surrounded by 50 to 75 layers of different types of glass. These outer layers are called the cladding.</P>

<P>Technicians heat the rod to soften it enough to enable them to draw the tip, rather like a taffy pull, into a thin glass fiber. These drawn fibers, which are surprisingly flexible and sturdy, are usually coated in protective plastic and wound in spools as they are drawn. The individual fibers&#151;thinner than a cat's whisker and each capable of handling thousands of two-way voice, video, and data messages simultaneously&#151;are bundled in various ways to form fiber-optic cables. The highly transparent glass core of the optical fibers is the highway on which voice, video, and data zoom at the speed of light from sender to receiver. The cladding keeps the light within the core because its layers reflect light inward, rather like a mirror.</P>

<P>Two basic equipment requirements are necessary to send and receive messages through optical fibers: Access to a semiconductor, a laser or a light-emitting diode, to transform electronic signals from a phone or computer, for example, into pulses of light; and a light detector/decoder to convert light pulses back into electronic signals at the receiving end. The other send/receive equipment needed depends upon the types of messages. If the messages are just voice or data, phones and computer modems are all that is needed. If live image messages are desired, television cameras, microphones, video switching equipment, and viewing monitors are needed.</P>

<P><B>What's the Holdup?</B></P>

<P>Miles and miles of fiber-optic cable are already in place, but much of it is not yet connected to consumers. What is holding up the final leg in fiber's implementation? Lack of funds? Technology problems? Politics?</P>

<P>Indiana Bell's Forkner replies. &#147;I wish it were as simple as saying it's just a political issue, or just an economic issue, or just a technological issue&#151;but it's all of those things at once.&#148;</P>

<P>A major holdup is the cost of technology. The base technology is available now, but cost-effective refinements are still needed. Affordable power is one problem. To send light pulses through fiber networks, each send/receive unit must have a power source. The source of choice is lasers, and they are still very costly.</P>

<P>Forkner agrees that power is one part of the cost problem, but points out that there are larger issues. &#147;There is an incredibly large capital investment required to run fiber optics all the way to homes and schools. And then there are all kinds of issues, such as who buys and who maintains the electronic equipment needed by each house or school or library.&#148;</P>

<P>Regulations and restrictions also contribute to the fiber-optic deployment holdup. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations have long prohibited telcos from providing video and other information services to customers. According to Gary Watts, senior director of the NEA's National Center for Innovation, &#147;The telcos have been laying fiber for years&#151;their trunk lines are down&#151;but they are not connected to homes and schools, and the telcos are not going to put out the expense to do that unless they can sell something besides voice mail. At this point, it is still not cost-effective for [telcos] to connect us.&#148;</P>

<P>But times are changing. In July 1992, the FCC ruled that regional telecommunications companies could offer, without obtaining a CATV franchise, &#147;video dial tone&#148; services to transmit video signals over telephone lines for video programmers. Within six months of the FCC announcement, Bell Atlantic Corporation declared that it would team with a small New Jersey company to provide 60 channels of television over a combination of optical fibers and coaxial cables that will carry both telephone and video services to homes in Dover township, located about 50 miles west of New York City. By year's end, Bell Atlantic had set up two more alliances to deliver video signals.</P>

<P>Restrictions remain for telcos, but their prospects of eventually providing a full range of communications services are looking brighter, and they are grateful for the changes. Cable TV companies, on the other hand, are not applauding.</P>

<P><B>CATV-Telco Turf Wars</B></P>

<P>Telcos are invading CATV turf, but the cable television companies are also moving into telco markets. Early in 1992, TCI, this country's largest CATV operator, bought 49 percent of Teleport Communications Group, Inc., a move that gave TCI the capability to provide data transmission services to major corporations and placed TCI in direct competition with local phone companies. It is no secret that CATVs and telcos want to enter each other's markets. Both are busily laying down fiber-optic networks that will enable simultaneous video, voice, and data transmission.</P>

<P>Telcos have the advantage of superior switching capabilities, which provide communication between virtually any two locations. And for now, the telcos seem to be leading in the amount of fiber they have in place. But telcos, like everyone else, are still blocked by the problem of how to make the costly connection from the fiber-optic main cable to individual homes, businesses, and institutions on a mass scale. On this point, CATVs may have the advantage.</P>

<P>Telcos, of course, already have copper wires in most households and buildings, but copper simply cannot handle the full range of services&#151;nor can it deliver at the speed&#151;that the fiber networks can. Connecting copper to fiber is like guiding six lanes of speeding traffic through a one-lane exit. Things slow down, a lot.</P>

<P>CATVs also have wires in many homes and schools. They don't have as many wires as the telcos have, but CATVs claim about 60 out of every 100 households. CATVs' advantage is that they have wired with coaxial cable. Coaxial is a good conduit for optical fiber because for distances under 300 feet, coaxial cable&#151;unlike copper&#151;is a &#147;broadband pipe.&#148; This means that coaxial cable can carry huge amounts of voice, video, or data very quickly.</P>

<P>Wires installed inside a home or building belong to that home or business. There is nothing to stop a school wired with coaxial cable, for example, from allowing a telco to connect its fiber-optic cable to the existing coaxial cable in the building. The school can then begin receiving telco-provided services on this hybrid network.</P>

<P>The Indianapolis Regional Economic/Academic Development (IREAD) distance learning network&#151;implemented in fall 1992 and put together by Indiana Bell/Ameritech, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS)&#151;is just one example of an operating fiber/coaxial hybrid system. To create this network&#151;which links 90 locations in Indianapolis and is billed as &#147;the world's largest fully interactive video fiber-optic network focused on education applications&#148;&#151;Indiana Bell laid a 600-mile-long fiber trunk line and connected it to existing coaxial cable in each IPS building. A fiber connection to the campus of Indiana University Bloomington, 45 miles south of Indianapolis, is also in place.</P>

<P>Perhaps telcos and CATVs will explore ways to cooperate. New alliances do seem to be part of the changes in telecommunications. But for now telcos and CATVs, along with other companies, are racing to lay down their own fiber networks. Sometimes several of these basically redundant networks end up virtually side by side.</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT size=+1>Distance learning isn't the only selling point for fiber-optic networks. Interactivity and instantaneous access to materials are strong attractions for classroom teachers. The Westfield-Washington (Westfield, Indiana) network allows teachers access to myriad instructional materials stored in the school district's &#147;technology distribution center.&#148; With the push of a remote-control button, the teacher can call up a videotape, a print resource, or a live satellite feed. And multimedia materials can be used by teachers and students alike.</P>

<P align=right>&#151;Editor's note</FONT></P>
<HR>

<P>The Westfield Washington Schools Corporation in rural Westfield, Indiana, for example, is located just one school district away from the IPS district. But its new fiber-optic network is not connected to the IREAD network, nor is there a plan for the connection to be made. The Westfield network, also up and running last fall, uses both copper wire and fiber optics to connect classrooms and offices in the district's three schools. The network is made possible by a partnership that includes GTE North and Ball State University's Center for Information and Communication Sciences in Muncie, Indiana.</P>

<P><B>The Driving Force</B></P>

<P>The race to rewire in optical fibers and the resulting duplicate networks, duplicate research, and multiple courting of customers is driven by one force&#151;free enterprise. Terry Forkner says, &#147;What we are really about here, is the rebuilding of the infrastructure for the Information Age. And up to now, there has been no concrete plan set out by any regulatory or legislative body. So in the absence of a plan, the marketplace is developing that network on its own. At this point, we are relying on free-market forces to build that infrastructure. And right now, it's a horse race.&#148;</P>

<P>Typically, when companies introduce new technology, they court potential customers with immediate application needs. Once sold on the new technology, these customers-referred to as &#147;key catalytic customers&#148;&#151;provide the initial funding for market expansion. They also showcase the technology, thus whetting the appetites of other potential customers.</P>

<P>Education has been targeted as a key catalytic customer for fiber-optic networks. Telcos and cable companies are courting the education market, big time. One result is model distance learning network start-ups all over the place. The IREAD and Westfield projects in Indiana are just two cases in point.</P>

<P>Is the fiber-optic race good for all concerned? Jon L. Harkness, chair of the NSTA's position paper on distance learning committee and director of the Wisconsin Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Network project (WISMATE, which is not a fiber-optic network), says he also &#147;favors competition at this point.&#148; Harkness thinks that the jury is still out on which is the best system or the best technology or combination of technologies. He prefers to &#147;let the competition sort out the winners and losers.&#148;</P>

<P>NEA's Watts expresses mixed feelings about the fiber race. &#147;I think everyone ought to be free at this point to get in the marketplace. The competition will help us [implement state-of-the-art infrastructure] sooner,&#148; he says. &#147;But I do worry that we will wind up with a lot of fragmented networks that might not be compatible.&#148;</P>

<P>Are multiple, often redundant, networks what most people are asking for when they speak in favor of fiber-optic implementation? During his election campaign, President Bill Clinton often spoke of creating a nationwide communications network to link schools, universities, libraries, hospitals, factories, etc. This goal is expected to take high priority in his administration, and Vice President Al Gore is expected to be the man who steers its course. Does Gore see this &#147;national research and education network&#148; as part of the many networks already (or soon to be) deployed by telephone and cable companies, private businesses, and school districts&#151;or as yet another competing network?</P>

<P>What will the federal government's eventual role be in the implementation and regulation of these networks? The question, at present, seems to be an open one. When he spoke on the subject at Clinton's fall 1992 Economic Conference in Little Rock, Gore said, &#147;&#133;with the advanced high-capacity network like the national research and education network, it does seem to me that government ought to play a role in putting in place that backbone&#133;. Most people think [the network] ought to be built by the federal government and then transitioned into private industry.&#148;</P>

<P>Some educators assume that government will play a role in the ownership of the fiber-optic communications networks. Harkness expects that the fiber network will be &#147;tax supported and government directed, to ensure equal access and reasonable rates, especially to schools.&#148; Watts predicts that &#147;government will play a role, but the network will be basically private.&#148; On the other hand, phone company executives seem set on private ownership. Robert E. Allen, chairman of AT&T, made clear his preference for private enterprise ownership and control when he told Clinton's Economic Conference last fall, &#147;I think the government should not build and/or operate such [communications] networks.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Picking Up the Check</B></P>

<P>Cost-effectiveness is a major consideration. With all the duplication, will there be fiber networks put down that will never be used? &#147;Yes,&#148; Forkner replies. &#147;Free enterprise will sort out the ones that are not competitive.&#148;</P>

<P>And is the capital risk worth it? Forkner thinks so. &#147;When the economic gain potential is this high, companies are going to take the risk,&#148; he explains.</P>

<P>Does it matter to the public that the communications companies are racing and risking? Absolutely. Someone has to pay for that big capital investment, and rate payers are prime candidates.</P>

<P>In a June 9, 1992, <I>New York Times</I> article, Edmund L. Andrews estimates that the cost of providing broadband service to every home during the next 20 to 30 years will run between $100 and $400 billion. Andrews suggests that &#147;the telephone companies want their customers to foot much of the bill up front.&#148;</P>

<P>In fact, phone companies are petitioning regulating bodies to gain the right to depreciate their investments more quickly. According to Andrews, the logic is: The bigger the depreciation, the greater the companies' costs appear, and the more they can then charge customers. The FCC and some state regulators are lending a sympathetic ear, but consumer advocates are critical. Andrews quotes Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, who says, &#147;This is a forced investment from rate payers, not from Wall Street, not from stockholders, but from ordinary customers. It's a risk-free loan&#151;it's even better than a loan, because [the phone companies] never have to pay it back.&#148;</P>

<P>Lisa Hendrickson, media information manager at Indiana Bell, takes issue with Kimmelman's statement. &#147;That [argument] seems to imply that we are just going to put fiber out there, whether anybody wants it or not. But there really has to be a customer need for it. We are not going to just go and invest all the shareholder money in rewiring America, if the customers don't want it.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Decisions, Decisions</B></P>

<P>Although many educators look with favor on the prospect of a national communications network, some also express concern. Harkness says, &#147;I am concerned about the potential [for educators] to use available technology purely for the sake of its existence.&#148; Frances Haley, executive director of the National Council for the Social Studies, thinks &#147;the big issue in communications technology is accessibility [for] all.&#148; She asks, &#147;What guarantees are there that every district will have the means to be part of this planned communications network?&#148; Haley cautions, &#147;It seems to me we have to first ask what is it we are trying to achieve, and then explore the various ways we might achieve it, before we go off and implement one technology or another. We need a plan.&#148;</P>

<P>Haley's point is well taken. According to the NEA's report to the U.S. Senate, the majority of the educational networks now in operation are &#147;self-contained and proprietary&#148;&#151;they cannot communicate with one another. And in some cases, the education customer is investing in very expensive fiber-optic networks in the absence of any plan for their instructional use or for teacher training.</P>

<P>Educators are among the primary users of communications technology. It's time for those looking out for education's best interests to look sharp, for the fiber-optic race is on, and many of us still aren't sure which horse our money is riding on.</P>

<P><B><I>Looking for a technological star for education to wish upon? A new one is rising, and its applications by government, commerce, and education are already virtually real.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>It's like snorkeling on a colorful reef in the Caribbean. With a clear mask and breathing tube in place, you slide your face into the water and simultaneously slip your senses into the underwater world. The moment you do, you become aware of only the stunning undersea landscape and its colorful inhabitants. The above-surface world switches off like a light.</P>

<P>It won't be long before you, too, can experience true virtual reality&#151;maybe even virtual snorkeling&#151;at entertainment places, at local businesses, or in your own home. And sooner than you think, virtual reality promises to be an integral part of the schoolroom. Virtual reality, VR, is the ultimate human computer interface, and its rapid ascent is being fueled by warm wishes, hot interest, and lots of cold cash.</P>

<P>Interest in VR is widespread. At least 200 research groups in 17 countries are working on some aspect of it. In the United States, many companies, both large and small, are scrambling to establish VR-based enterprises. A growing number of independents, CEOs, venture capitalists, and government agencies are sliding out VR-tagged dollars with the studied coolness of gamblers confident they've been tipped to a sure thing. And several major universities have been conducting VR research in various areas, including architecture, biotechnology, medicine, and education.</P>

<P><B>Birth and Growth</B></P>

<P>VR technology was born under government auspices, and for years, most VR spending and research was military based. For example, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Research cosponsored development of the first head-mounted display (HMD) in the late 1960s.</P>

<P>But things have changed. Today, nongovernment VR research and development is established and growing steadily. How much money is involved is difficult to estimate, but it's huge. John Latta, president of the market research firm 4th Wave, projects that nongovernment entities around the world, which spent $91.5 million on VR research in 1993, will quadruple their expenditures by 1997. And Latta's figures exclude not only government research dollars but also the tens of millions spent each year by members of the public playing at VR entertainment concessions.</P>

<P>The U.S. government's continuing interest in the potential of VR is evidenced in part by the establishment in February 1993 of a VR committee within the National Research Council (NRC). According to Anne Mavor, NRC's study director, the committee has a broad sponsorship of about 10 government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The committee, charged with researching priorities in VR research and development, is preparing a report that will recommend a national agenda for VR. &#147;The committee is heavily interdisciplinary,&#148; says Mavor, &#147;and will try to come up with a consensus for the report that will well represent a broad range of concerns.&#148;*</P>

<P><SMALL>(* The report is due out in August 1994 and will be available from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Avenue NW, Box 285 Washington, DC 20055; or call 800-824-6242.)</SMALL></P>

<P><B>What is VR, really?</B></P>

<P>The technology causing the stir has been called the next best thing to being there. Virtual reality envelops users in a computer generated world. If the term &#147;computer&#148; triggers visions of passive watching for you, you're just not getting the VR picture. Using VR is not like merely looking at graphic simulations on a screen it's more like jumping into the screen&#151;and becoming part of the action.</P>

<P>That is, <I>some</I> kinds of VR are like that. Unlike certain terms on labels&#151;&#147;fat free,&#148; for example&#151;that carry government-determined product requirements, the term &#147;virtual reality&#148; carries no limits of use. But it is a hot market term that is being used for a growing number of disparate products, programs, and activities. For instance, both the creation of imaginary worlds in the minds of people receiving text descriptions of those worlds on the Internet (called MUDs, for Multi-User Dungeons) and the viewing and manipulating of animated graphics on a computer screen are called VR.</P>

<P>Because this free-hand application of the term makes VR a slippery concept to nail down, even the most casual discussion about it demands a definition. Unless otherwise specified, in this article, VR is what many call &#147;true&#148; VR. It refers only to technology that has the ability both to immerse the user in an artificial world and to allow interactive navigation within that world. If you have ever snorkeled over a coral reef, you have a good visual simile for the VR characteristic of total immersion.</P>

<P>It is interactive navigation that is VR's most captivating characteristic. When you, the VR cybernaut, turn your head, you see a different view, much as you do in the real world. If you approach an object, you see more of it. If you go behind the object, you see the back of it. If you pick up an object, it moves with your hand. If you drop a ball, it bounces. If you drop a glass, it shatters. If you shoot a pterodactyl, it screams and dies.</P>

<P>But there's still more to defining true VR. At least two major technology systems can achieve the characteristics of total immersion and interactive navigation. One system is the tethered HMD, which, although somewhat inhibiting, does a great job of blocking out the real world. The other is a room-like VR system that surrounds an individual or group (wearing special glasses) on three sides and overhead with multiple large-screen projection displays. The Cave at the University of Illinois-Chicago is an example of this type of system. It uses three-dimensional images to model fractal mathematics, biochemical mapping, and brain structures for participants.</P>

<P><B>Today's VR</B></P>

<P>To put VR's potential in time perspective, it is important to separate what's here now from what might be coming. The VR of the future promises to send us through time and space on exciting, enlightening, even perilous adventures, all within the safety of our VR-equipped room. When the predicted VR of the future is in place, we might slip into the crowd at the Colosseum in ancient Rome and hear the roar as we vote thumbs up or down, or we might stroll on the moon in the floating, bounding steps that its low gravity allows. Someday through VR, we might get the feel of a new career or keep abreast of current affairs by surveying world events up close. We might do all these things someday.</P>

<P>But not now, and not soon. That level of technology isn't here yet. There are no specific predictions of when VR technology will catch up with its hype, but engineer David Homan of NASA's Automation and Robotics Division offers this analogy: &#147;If you compare the development of VR technology to the history of flight, we are presently at the Wright flyer heading toward the Concorde.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="1lewis1.gif" align=right hspace=10>So what's VR like at the Wright brothers' level? Many experimental programs are being tried by the government. Notable examples are NASA's use of a virtual simulator to train astronauts and its use of virtual prototypes of the Hubble Space Telescope and Costar (Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement)&#151;the corrective optical instrument package created to fix Hubble. The virtual Hubble and Costar were used to rehearse the corrective procedures and test Costar's design before the actual hardware was built (see photo). During this virtual rehearsal, two important Costar design problems were discovered and corrected before the actual hardware was launched.</P>

<P>VR prototypes are appearing more and more in various fields, prominently in the area of computer-aided design (architecture and auto design, for example). However, most people's exposure to VR at present is through the entertainment industry. Many cities have either permanent or traveling VR arcade games.</P>

<P>The graphics of this virtual game world, which is perceived within the HMD that the player wears, are crude by today's standards. In the distant future, VR graphics may be indistinguishable from real-life people and objects, but for now, VR worlds  are basically cartoon worlds. You move yourself about the computer-generated virtual environment by pointing a finger or pushing a button on a joystick. Surprisingly, these &#147;unreal&#148; factors do not overshadow the feeling that you are actually inside this interactive, three-dimensional other world. The experience may not seem real, but it is awesome.</P>

<P>There are several VR market potentials. Home entertainment is certainly prime. 4th Wave's Latta predicts that entertainment ventures will account for 76 percent of VR-generated revenues through 1997, but serious VR applications are emerging, too. Education, in its broad sense, is one of these.</P>

<P><B>Virtual Lessons</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="1lewis2.gif" align=left hspace=10>An interesting classroom application is being tested at the University of Houston-Downtown. R. Bowen Loftin, a physicist who divides his time between the university and his work at NASA where he develops VR environments for training purposes, has developed a Virtual Physics Laboratory for students. In the VR lab, students can conduct physics experiments with the non-real world ability to control friction and drag (see photo).</P>

<P>Much of early VR technology grew out of educational needs. Flight simulators to teach flying skills safely are a significant part of VR's roots and continue to be a major focus of VR research. Systems that teach flight, navigation on water, and emergency procedures in nuclear power plants are examples of some of the VR simulation systems currently under development.</P>

<P>Health care and medical training are also areas of education based VR development. Some partnerships of commercial companies and universities are developing VR simulations to train surgeons. When these simulations are perfected, surgeon interns will be able to perform an operation over and over until they get it right. And their VR patients will respond physiologically like live human patients, but they will never complain, never sue for malpractice, and, of course, never (really) die.</P>

<P>It is not difficult to think of lower-level versions of these VR applications. If VR flight simulators can be used to train pilots, then VR driving simulators can be used to train teenagers to drive. If interns can operate on virtual patients, then kids can dissect virtual frogs. The education possibilities seem unlimited.</P>

<P>Peter Cornwell, president of Division Incorporated in the United States and Division Limited in Britain&#151;providers of high-level VR software and ready-to-run VR systems&#151;feels that &#147;VR has great potential in education.&#148; Cornwell explains that in addition to offering cheap, safe alternatives to learning tasks (such as flight training) that involve high cost or serious hazards, VR &#147;will have a lot of impact in the conventional areas of education, as well.&#148; He thinks several things will make VR attractive to educators, not the least of which is the compelling technology. &#147;People like to use it,&#148; Cornwell says. &#147;Kids will be motivated to learn a variety of things in a VR environment simply because they will like being there.&#148;</P>

<P><B>High-End Interest</B></P>
<P>Are educators interested in VR? &#147;Yes, very,&#148; says the University of Houston's Loftin. &#147;I have spoken to about a thousand teachers at all levels and, almost uniformly, they have been excited by the potential of VR technology. Most are very enthusiastic.&#148;</P>

<P>Cynthia A. Elliott, manager of product development and distribution at Miami Dade Community College in Florida, is a VR enthusiast interested in furthering its position in education. Elliott says that &#147;at the large universities, they are actually doing research on educational applications of VR, but we at the community college level are just at the talking stage&#148;&#151;a stage Elliott seems eager to move past. She sees &#147;medical applications and the whole area of allied sciences as holding the biggest potential for educational VR applications, right now.&#148; But she also sees potential for teaching career training, English as a second language, and basic skills. Elliott says interest is high, but securing the funding for projects is a real problem.</P>

<P>Keith Zook, technology coordinator for Grosse Township, Michigan, and a member of the National Education Association's special committee on telecommunications, has a less enthusiastic view of VR. &#147;When I graduated from college,&#148; Zook says, &#147;TV was going to be the savior of education; it was going to replace teachers. That didn't happen. I don't see VR doing it, either. VR is just going to be one more tool. If it does a better job, teachers will clamor for it. If it doesn't, they won't. I don't see VR crowding out other methods.&#148;</P>

<P>NASA's Homan, viewing VR education applications from a space training perspective, also sees VR's near future as becoming one component of a training package, not total replacement of other methods. &#147;VR will be best for teaching some aspects of a program. Other aspects will be better conveyed by other technology,&#148; Homan says. &#147;I don't see us abandoning one teaching technology for the other.&#148;</P>

<P>Among those who use the term VR in its broader sense&#151;that is, without immersion and navigation capabilities&#151;is Roger Ray, professor of psychology and director of the Institute of Educational Technology at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. Ray has developed what he labels a VR program using interactive two-dimensional video to conduct experiments in animal learning. In his prototype, the experimenter views a video of an experimental rat and inputs decisions about training the rat into the computer. The decisions made influence the next rat behaviors shown and ultimately determine the video's&#151;and thus the experiment's&#151;outcome. Ray thinks that this non-immersive technology &#147;has a much rosier future in education than does true VR,&#148; which he feels is &#147;too costly to be widely used and offers fewer natural marriages to content.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Education's Assignment</B></P>

<P>Mitchel Resnick, a professor at MIT's Media Lab who specializes in technology in education, also sees room for more than true VR under the VR label. Resnick is experimenting with MUDs in which computer network users create imaginary worlds with words, rather than HMDs. He offers this caution about true VR: If serious education efforts are going to be made in this area, &#147;people better think more about creating kits that allow kids to build VR environments and less about building VR environments for kids to visit. The real educational benefit of VR will come in the building of the artificial environments, not in the manipulation of an environment built by a teacher.&#148;</P>

<P>On the other hand, Gary Watts, senior director of the National Education Association's National Center for Innovation, has reservations about a kid-first approach to implementing VR. &#147;We need to avoid the mistakes we made with computers,&#148; cautions Watts. &#147;Computers are still not well integrated into the schools because of strategic mistakes we made. The main one was thinking that computers were for kids first, not for teachers first. We thought we could jump over the teachers and go right to the kids. It didn't work. The truth is, you can't integrate any technology into the schools when the teachers don't know and understand what that technology is. If VR or any new technology is going to work in the schools, we need to give it to the teachers first, for use by them&#151;not by the kids.&#148;</P>

<P>To educators who must untangle various views and issues, Jim Shuck, director of commercial business development at Kaiser Electro-Optics Incorporated&#151;a company that has recently made a foray into the commercial VR market after 10 years of applying its VR technology to strictly military applications&#151;offers this advice: &#147;VR is coming, and it's going to change everyone's life.  It's going to change society.  I urge educators to prepare for it now, while there's time.&#148;</P>

<P>Loftin is of the same mind as Shuck.  &#147;I am very much of the attitude that VR is something that will happen, regardless of anyone's opinion,&#148; he says.   He also feels that inappropriate uses of VR, some in education, are probable.  &#147;I can't stop that, but I will deplore it.  And I will do what I can to push VR along in the right direction.&#148;</P>

<P>Loftin and Christopher Dede, director of the Center for Interactive Educational Technology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, recently were awarded a million-dollar NSF grant to explore &#147;where VR fits and does not fit in education.&#148;  This funding should enable them to take future VR applications in education a giant step in the right direction.</P>

<P>According to NSF program director Nora Sebelli, Loftin and Dede's grant is the first or one of the first major NSF grants awarded to study the potential of VR in education.  But NSF is also awarding small grants (under $50,000) to address the same topic.  Sebelli says, &#147;From these small grants, presently going mostly to people who already have access to the technology, we may find promising ideas that might be worthy of further exploration in a full proposal.&#148;</P>

<P>In spite of all the activity, education is not yet a lucrative market for true VR.  The costs are just too high, and the applications aren't available yet.  When will VR applications and systems be ready and within the price range for homes and schools?  Latta, Loftin, and Shuck agree: Five years.  Peter Cornwell predicts a shorter time of three to four years.</P>

<P>VR's arrival seems inescapable, and it has the potential to change drastically the way we do business, relative to one another, and learn.  From an educator's perspective, VR holds one certainty:  The light from this rising star of technology is going to fall on education before the year 2000.  Whether it illuminates or blinds depends on how  well educators prepare for its coming.</P>

<P>If education leaders do not explore VR, test its effectiveness, find its hazards, and take actions to shape its role in education to meet education's objectives, that role will be shaped to accomodate the personal objectives of the entertainment industry, VR vendors, and bandwagon opportunists.  They'll be knocking at the door.  And each time someone knocks, educators&#151;ready or not&#151;will have to decide whether to set out the welcome mat or bolt the door.</P>

<P>There is still time, but precious little to spare.</P>

<HR>

<P><STRONG><I>Is multimedia really all it's cracked up to be? Not according to this 20-year veteran educational psychologist. He says the new kids on the block&#151;the techno wizards graduating from our universities with Ph.D.s in instructional systems&#151;are selling educators a bill of goods.  And it's all because of a basic error in research, one they should have learned about a long time ago.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR>
<P>There is no evidence that computers and multimedia improve learning. Once more? Research to date on the impact of technologies on learning has never established that using a computer or any other technology improves learning. I have closely monitored the literature on teaching technologies since the bloom of computers in the classroom in the early 1980s and have yet to see a study that was without a fundamental flaw.</P>

<P>It's called the &#147;Type I Error,&#148; and it means the researcher has found benefits that aren't really there. Strange but true.</P>

<P><B>This is Research?</B><BR>
Multimedia has become such a science that universities are now granting doctorates in what is essentially multimedia design and programming. Typically these degrees are called something along the lines of &#147;Instructional Systems Design.&#148; Unfortunately,  their graduates appear so narrowly educated that they know little or nothing of instructional design outside of that which is packaged in slick authoring systems. These same universities spend thousands of research hours on background colors, text style, acceptable video compression rates, etc.&#151;a significantly greater &#147;dosage&#148; than that provided for research on instructional strategies exclusive of media.</P>

<P>Experimental design is a critical component of scholarly research. It also appears to have taken a back seat to the latest fashions in media. When I hear research paper presentations, I am often puzzled by the failure of the new Ph.D.s to use such basics as: true control groups; pre-tests that enable the researcher to equalize individual differences among subjects when crunching the numbers; and failure to control for a whole myriad of confounding variables. Whatever happened to true experimental design?</P>

<P>Case in point. Throughout the first part of this century, some misled psychometricians revealed that, as indicated by a variety of instruments, members of lower socioeconomic status and members of certain racial groups were of inferior intelligence. The <I>data </I>was there; unfortunately, the <I>design </I>wasn't. Dangerous? Yes. These studies proved nothing and could have been avoided had they been properly designed. At best, they damaged the perception of those identified as &#147;inferior&#148;; at worst, they fostered racism and class envy. They were fundamentally flawed in that they failed to control for a host of environmental experiences and conditions that contribute to test performance of any kind, extraneous factors that could account for the observed differences. What does this have to do with the more recent glowing multimedia research conclusions?</P>

<P>The flaw in the research on multimedia's impact on learning&#151;for it is flawed&#151;is much like that in the &#147;IQ&#148; research of the 1950s. Just as those misled souls failed to control for environmental differences (perhaps an impossible task), many multimedia researchers to date have also failed to control for a host of conditions that may account for the observed impact on learning (other than the fact that a computer was used to mediate the instruction). And this flaw leads to their Type I Error.</P>

<P>A typical research design on the impact of multimedia pits a videotape version of an instructional lesson and a non-media classroom version against an interactive multimedia version. Comically, the traditional classroom version is often referred to as a &#147;control group.&#148; In reality, there typically is <I>no </I>control group&#151;certainly not one that would help assure that differences are attributable to the treatment rather than to some extraneous variable. There is no pre-test to account for individual and resulting group differences at the onset, differences that may influence the statistics. Rather, the assumption is made that because there are 20 or so students in each group, any differences would &#147;average out.&#148;</P>

<P><B>A Matter of Dosage</B><BR>
But there is an even bigger problem. The typical study described in the multimedia research parallels a pharmacological study in which a new drug is tested, with the exception that the multimedia research study often <I>excludes </I>a true control group while the pharmacology industry has the sense to include one. A drug is tested at three significantly different dosages, though the vehicles of delivery are identical (for example, the same-looking pill). Surprise: The group receiving the highest dosage experiences the greatest effects! Unfortunately, our multimedia researchers lack the insight to see that their dosages (of content and instructional strategies) vary significantly from one experimental group to another&#151;in other words, from multimedia group to classroom group. The pills even look different. Typically, the multimedia group receives either more content or content for which greater care was taken in its preparation. And with average development costs of CD-ROMs in the $700,000 range, rest assured that the latter difference is common. The difference in preparation of the teacher who is to be compared with the preparation invested in some $700,000 CD-ROM, is glaring.</P>

<P>Poor media research design predates multimedia. For example, it was once commonplace to measure the effectiveness of televised instruction in a manner similar to what is now done with multimedia. Typically, the best teacher was selected to provide the televised instruction and given a full day to prepare the surrounding lesson. The progress of the televised instruction group was then compared with the progress of students in conventional settings with average teachers who taught the usual load of classes and had the usual (minimal) time to prepare. The results and subsequent conclusions of studies that hailed televised instruction as education's savior were, of course, flawed. The real finding was that better teachers with more preparation time and novel teaching tools resulted in greater student achievement. Had a group of better teachers substituted dramatic roleplays or field experiences for the televised instruction, their students' performance might have equaled or surpassed that of the televised instruction group. Experimental design flaws like this thrive in today's multimedia research and lead to the Type I Error.</P>

<P>To add to the confusion, the contexts in which most media studies are carried out are so complex that researchers cannot possibly control, and are likely unaware of, all the variables in the environment that might affect the results.</P>

<P><B>The Myth of Multimedia Benefits</B><BR>
There are no unique educational benefits from multimedia or its attributes. Once the information content and instructional strategies are controlled for, or equalized, the differences will disappear. Such controls are absent from multimedia studies revealing benefits of the medium. The motivational effects and preferences of multimedia often cited in studies are a charade as well. What occurs here is blind belief in a new and novel machine, a machine that students find more interesting and easier to accept than a talking head in front of the class. It is not, however, the machine that motivates. Rather, it is curiosity, content, and instructional strategies that motivate the learner.</P>

<P>Case in point. In my 20 years in the teaching business, having produced some 75 interactive laserdisc and multimedia programs, I've found the most motivating medium I ever used was a print-based lesson. That's right, print! It was called the &#147;Wayne Powers Action Maze,&#148; and it was published by Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Company in 1975 and sold for a mere $1.25. This inexpensive handbook was a highly interactive instructional tool for teaching managers and supervisors how and how not to handle employees with behavioral/medical problems such as alcoholism. When part of a dynamic lesson plan, the &#147;Wayne Powers Action Maze&#148; provided as much enthusiasm and student achievement as any multimedia version could have. It was an interactive tool that included a captivating case study with complex consequential branching the likes of which I have never seen again outside of multimedia. And it was a very effective training tool.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume4/2jackbox.gif" align=right hspace=10>

<P><BR clear=right><B>The Economics of Multimedia</B><BR>
There is no mediated program that cannot be mediated by an alternate medium. Unfortunately, the battle between fashion and efficacy seems to have been won by fashion. Today it is fashionable to &#147;do a CD-ROM&#148; with little regard for other less expensive methods of delivery (such as print). What is puzzling is that the question &#147;Can it be done cheaper using other forms of mediation?&#148; seems to be routinely overlooked by developers. Fashion seems to have won out even over economics.</P>

<P>Clearly, there are applications for which multimedia has the most efficacy. But even in these cases, the advantages are economic. For example, it may be a lot less expensive to use a flight simulator than hands-on flight training for pilots. But the advantages are economic&#151;time, cost, liability&#151;not learning-oriented. Conversely, I seriously question the use of multimedia to supplant hands-on classroom science experiments or simple dissections in the biology lab. A computer simulation is clearly neater, cleaner, and easier, but it is not an experience. The true experience occurs on the lab table.</P>

<P><B>Dangers of the Type I Error</B><BR>
The Type I Error&#151;finding benefits that are not really there&#151;apparent in much of the multimedia research would seem to present education with a panacea: a path (albeit an expensive one) to equity, efficacy, and high SAT scores. The reality, in stark contrast, is that the Type I Error will lead to inequity, either lower scores or lower standards, and wasted financial resources.</P>

<P>Clearly, multimedia is not the great equalizer. The same groups indicted by the IQ research of the first half of this century will be impacted similarly by the multimedia panacea. For example, access to technology is clearly inequitable and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Poor urban and rural school systems do not now and may never approach the access to technology resources afforded well-financed systems. And even if this inequity were somehow magically remedied, performance in a multimedia environment will clearly favor those with off-campus access and preschool exposure, common in today's middle and upper-socioeconomic status households, rare in others.</P>

<P>A second consequence of the Type I Error is the resulting misdirection of resources toward applications that may be better served by cheaper, less fashionable instructional strategies such as field experience, role playing, and print-based works. A truckload of quality print-based interactive instruction can be produced for the $700,000 cost of producing a single CD-ROM program. And its impact will be equal to or more than that of the CD-ROM, if teachers have the time to prepare to use it and the motivation to deliver it. Furthermore, misappropriating resources to multimedia projects better or equally served by other instructional strategies leaves fewer funds for those projects best served by multimedia.</P>

<P>Yet another outgrowth of the Type I Error is the blind thirst for multimedia at the expense of instructional design. A recent instructional designer search I conducted at the Association for Educational Communications Technology national convention yielded a large crop of vitae. Each and every one of them highlighted multimedia experience and quasi-experience and little, if any, instructional design accomplishments. The ultimate consequence of hiring these multimedia whiz kids will be poorly designed yet flashy, fashionable, and entertaining instructional materials&#151;great baby-sitters but poor teachers. And what will become of the teachers? Will we give up on them and employ technology specialists instead? With that, will we also give up on reality in favor of simulation? Why undertake a field activity, when we can simulate it with a CD-ROM?</P>

<P><B>A Matter of Semantics</B><BR>
Is this treatise merely a matter of semantics? Some may view it as such. However, careful reflection can only lead to the conclusion that multimedia and a host of other technologies such as the Internet; the WEB, a hyperlink system within the Internet; and virtual reality are fast becoming the new educational panacea. But we must avoid the Type I Error. We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is instructional strategies that cause improvements in achievement, not media. The richness of life's contexts, its faces. fragrances, and emotions, will never be effective candidates for computer simulations. Neither will the training of a surgeon nor the handiwork of a carpenter.</P>

<P>Some instructional strategies are well suited for multimedia and other technologies. Simulated outcomes of decisions impractical to experience live, literature review, and data collection are a few examples of technology applications that are consistent with sound instructional strategies. Though any of these could be accomplished using other media, multimedia and on-line technologies are clearly more efficient and economical with little if any experiential cost. However, for each well-guided application, there is a host of misapplications&#151;misapplications with measurable costs in achievement and dollars. More important, they are misapplications that deprive students of those human interactions and hands-on experiences that yield feeling, thinking adults.</P>

<P>Media clearly enable us to design better instruction. For the past 30-plus years, film and video have brought the world into the classroom. Unfortunately, we relied on film and video to bring the community into the classroom rather than the class into the community. Multimedia provides the opportunity to interact with the images behind a glass screen. Let's hope we don't let it replace interaction with each other and the world around us. Multimedia and other technologies are simply tools that assist with instruction. They have no more influence on achievement and  wholeness than a scalpel has on healing.</P>

<P><B><I>Precedents for future legal cases involving the K&#150;12 environment, censorship, and electronic communication could be set in pending cases that involve adults. Individual schools and school districts should formulate and implement use policies now that limit provider liability and minimize student exposure to inappropriate material.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>&#147;Students do not leave their rights at the school-house gate.&#148;<BR>
<I>Tinker v. Des Moines</I>, 1967, p. 12</P>

<P><I>Tinker v. Des Moines</I> (1967), the seminal Supreme Court ruling on free speech and expression rights, contained this now familiar quote regarding students' rights. It bears directly on any discussion of questions surrounding the rapidly evolving issue of censorship and pupils' access to the Internet and other forms of electronic communication. However, one of the difficulties associated with attempting to formulate a coherent policy on censorship in cyberspace is that all of the key court cases involving student speech predate widespread access to electronic communications. For example, speech cases such as Tinker, upholding the rights of Vietnam-era protesters, and <I>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</I>, affirming the right of school administrators to control student publications, were adjudicated prior to the burgeoning of Internet bulletin board services and technology reform initiatives (such as Goals 2000 and the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 that created the National Research Education Network, NREN) that encourage schools to use the Internet as an educational resource.</P>

<P>Rather than attempt a comprehensive examination of legal issues related to Internet access, this piece focuses on two key issues that must be considered if we are to define the problem and frame district policy solutions.</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>We must consider the difficulties surrounding definitions of obscenity and censorship that might limit freedom of expression.
<LI>We must consider the responsibility of carriers who provide users with access to information from myriad network resources, many of them not explicitly designed for educational use with students in grades K&#150;12. 
</OL>

<P><B>The Eye of the Beholder</B><BR>
What material is obscene, and when is censorship justified? Forty-one states have statutes that prohibit the distribution of obscene materials to minors. Rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments have never extended to obscene material. But who determines what is obscene? Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart declined to state a comprehensive definition of obscene materials but said of pornographic material, &#147;I know it when I see it&#148; (<I>Jacobellis v. State of Ohio</I>, 1964). As his statement infers, determining obscenity has rightly been relegated to localities because of the recognized differences among community values (<I>Miller v. California</I>, 1973). In Miller, conditions for determining &#147;obscenity&#148; were met if the average person, applying current community standards, would find that the materials were offensive, designed to arouse immoral or lustful desire, or  appealed to &#147;prurient&#148; interests.</P>

<P>On the Internet, the process of defining obscene materials based on community standards is complicated because materials originating in one locale are distributed to another. In a recent Tennessee case, Robert and Carleen Thomas were convicted on 12 obscenity charges when a Tennessee postal inspector subscribed to their adults-only, California-based bulletin board service and downloaded images judged to be obscene in Tennessee. The Thomas case aside, the general spirit of <I>Miller v. California </I>(1973) still provides the guiding tenet for determining obscenity, though even this issue has been clouded by the character of electronic network distribution and access.</P>

<P>Determining whether material is obscene is but one key factor related to policy that may limit minors' access to these materials. The other factor is determining who is responsible if unacceptable or unsuitable materials find their way into the hands of or onto the computer screens accessed by school children. Not surprisingly, in the context of rapidly evolving Internet legal issues, the responsibility of carriers&#151;on-line services like America Online or CompuServ&#151;that provide access to Internet information is unclear. However, control over information is the central issue. Common carriers such as phone companies have been judged free of liability for damages since they have no control over the information transmitted via their service. In contrast, print publications that exert full editorial control over published works are fully liable for damages resulting from printed work. A recent court case has upheld these trends with reference to electronic carriers. In a 1991 ruling, <I>Cubby v. CompuServ</I>, a federal trial court ruled in favor of the carrier in a defamation claim resulting from an item in a newsletter distributed via CompuServ. The court noted that CompuServ had neither knowledge nor reason to know of the contents of the newsletter. Although CompuServ had the right to edit the newsletter, its liability was limited because of the impracticability of reviewing every item posted using its service.</P>

<P>Some providers choose to exercise more control over access than do the commercial on-line services. Recently, for example, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh made headlines when its administrators dropped from its servers certain bulletin boards that contained sexually explicit materials. The university cited its worry that because it had formal knowledge of the offensive images, it risked criminal liability for carrying the materials (because first-year college students are often minors). Several Internet watchdog groups, such as the Electronic Freedom Frontier, believe Carnegie Mellon overstepped its responsibility and chose censorship when a &#147;sensible-use&#148; policy would have sufficed to solve the problem.</P>

<P>For school districts, formulating enforceable policies that address the suitability of materials and carrier liability issues is critical. Even in the current climate of evolving legal frameworks, it is possible to make a policy that limits the school's exposure to liability and realizes the enormous educational potential of information networks. Teachers, parents, administrators, and service providers can work together to delineate responsibility and the kinds of access that will be acceptable and appropriate for students in their district.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2intcar.gif" align=left hspace=10>A reasonable district policy can be formulated that places responsibility on the user and apprises parents of the possible hazards of Internet access and their right to limit their child's access to those materials. In such a policy statement, parents and students would be defined as the responsible parties and arbiters of suitable materials. Teachers would be defined as supervisors of young children at school, and access to files by system operators and school officials would be clearly stated. A brief and understandable user agreement and parent permission form should be signed and returned to the school where it can be kept on record.</P>

<P>To date, no cases involving school districts and obscenity and liability issues are pending. There are, however, cases involving adults and obscenity, privacy, and First Amendment rights that may foreshadow cases and rulings for public schools. What is essential in this atmosphere of emerging legal precedent is that school districts work with community stakeholders to draft and implement network use policies that offer access to the vast educational resources of electronic networks, protect minors from unsuitable materials, and provide districts and carriers with relief from liability.</P>

<P><B><I>Access to technology in schools can open doors for students. Whether those doors are opened depends primarily on two things: expectations for students and commitment to a technology program, beginning with funding. Our writer visited two New York City high schools to compare their uses of technology, particularly computers. What she found is a startling contrast in resources and expectations that points up the problems of inequity of access to technology. Walk through the doors of Stuyvesant and Prospect Heights, but be forewarned&#151;if you are searching for elegant solutions, you may be disappointed.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P align=center><FONT size=+2><B>Stuyvesant High School, Manhattan</B></FONT></P>

<P>Avis Hsieh hates her new haircut; she's jammed a baseball cap over her head to hide it. She also has a bad case of senioritis as she nears the end of her senior year at New York's prestigious Stuyvesant High School, the city's highly selective magnet school for math and science students. Between the haircut and the senioritis, Avis is taking only a mild interest in the final project for her Advanced Placement (AP) computer science class: programming &#147;Hangman&#148; in Turbo Pascal.</P>

<P>This class isn't very difficult for Avis. And if she doesn't get much done this period, she can always continue working on the project at home&#151;she has an IBM compatible with a hard drive&#151;or in the library, where 10 computers are reserved for student use at all times, or here in Room 307, where Mr. Greenfield will let her come in early and work on one of the 35 networked IBMs.</P>

<P>Steven Milman, another of Mr. Greenfield's AP students, has forgotten his password. Stuyvesant students each get one so they can log onto the system from any computer in the school. But Steven prefers to work at home, where he and his father, a computer programmer who brought his family to the United States from the Soviet Union four years ago, have installed C++ Compiler, Turbo Pascal, Windows, dBase II, WordPerfect 5.1, Lotus 1-2-3, and Auto CAD onto their 386SX.</P>

<P>For his final project for Mr. Greenfield, Steven is doing an elevator simulation, programming two cars to stop and start on command. At the moment, he's sketching notes and designs on paper with a pencil; he'll do the programming tonight at home.</P>

<P><B>Opportunity Knocks</B></P>

<P>David Greenfield lets Avis, Steven, and the 28 other students in Room 307 do whatever they need to&#151;talk with each other, talk with him, program their projects, or work on other computer projects. Stuyvesant's 2,721 students are chosen from among the very top students in the city. Many come from immigrant families who are betting everything on their children's education. These kids don't need much supervision or discipline.</P>
 
<P>&#147;Obviously, we teach a subject,&#148; says math teacher and computer coordinator Stuart Weinberg. &#147;But most of the time, we just get out of their way.&#148;</P>

<P>Stuyvesant High School has so many computer nerds that you have to divide them into subcategories. Besides the programming nerds on the third floor, at least one of whom has a software program on the market, there are the computer art nerds on the tenth floor, where the art studio has a color laser jet printer, and the industrial design nerds, who work in one of the three advanced computer-aided design (CAD) labs, one with robotics, that line the fourth-floor hall. And that covers just three of Stuyvesant's 10 floors.</P>

<P>In one CAD lab, students are designing structures that could never be built&#151;an exercise to stretch their minds and sharpen their sense of design. Industrial arts teacher Frank Wright explains: &#147;We're not training them for the job market. We're developing creative thought.&#148;</P>

<P>How does Stuyvesant's principal feel about all this? He can't stop beaming. &#147;Everything these kids touch turns to gold,&#148; boasts Abraham Baumel, walking through a hall where students sprawl haphazardly on the new white linoleum floor. The bell rings. Doesn't he think they should get to class? &#147;There are no rules here,&#148; Mr. Baumel scoffs.</P>

<P>What <I>is</I> here is opportunity. Stuyvesant has just moved into a new $150 million facility on Manhattan's western waterfront that provides students with just about everything they need in computer technology. There are 450 IBMs and Macintoshes all linked by local area networks, with each network tied into one of 13 file servers that spiral along a fiber-optic backbone.</P>

<P>While a billion dollars was cut from the city's school budget between 1989 and 1992, Stuyvesant got almost everything it asked for from the New York City Board of Education. It has 12 science labs, five gyms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, and an 866-seat theater with acoustics so advanced, you can hear conversational speech anywhere in the room&#151;without amplification.</P>

<P>The board did scale back the school's computer budget, from $6 million to $3.5 million, but even with the reduced funding, the school has provided 22 of its 65 classrooms with computers. Technicians from IBM are at the school at least twice a week to fine-tune and enhance the system.</P>

<P>The school has <I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I> and untold amounts of additional research material on CD-ROM. The system includes modems, a fax server, and links to Internet and NYCENET, an on-line city education service. Fifty laser printers are available for student and teacher use. For classrooms that don't have computers, units on movable carts can plug into connectors throughout the building. All can log onto a network.</P>

<P>One key to Stuyvesant's success is the dedication of its students' parents. In a city where most parents never show up for open-school night, Stuyvesant's parent association raises $80,000 to $100,000 a year through its activities.</P>

<P><B>Divergent Perspectives</B></P>

<P>New Yorkers appear to be of two minds about this school. On one hand, some think it is terribly elite, the students ridiculously indulged while students elsewhere lack desks and textbooks. On the other hand, some feel if there's a Stuyvesant, there's hope. This view holds that at least some kids, the really bright ones, should get everything they need. &#147;These kids are among the most extraordinary kids on the planet,&#148; principal Baumel explains succinctly.</P>

<P>Mr. Baumel himself has a love affair of sorts with computers. He even grudgingly admires the school's corps of computer hackers, which is legendary. He has three computers in his office and keeps up with new hardware and software developments. And he sees the future opening like a lotus. In the old days, Mr. Baumel says, computers were used for four things: simple review, drafting, word processing, and data processing. Now schools can have multimedia and CD-ROM and hookups to libraries around the world. Stuyvesant is even putting a satellite dish on the roof to capture data for meteorologic computations and communications.</P>

<P>Mr. Baumel believes the only problem with computers is that they can't think like kids. &#147;No matter how clever the programmer, he or she can't anticipate the student responses,&#148; Mr. Baumel observes, &#147;including marvelous wrong answers. The kid is wrong, but it's great!&#148;</P>

<P>The Spanish teacher, Juan Mendez, is another computer nut. Today he is using the Stuyvesant network's electronic mail program, Lotus's CC:Mail, to teach Spanish II. He requires students to send him messages in Spanish. If they don't include all the accents, he mails their messages back electronically for correction.</P>

<P>It is June 9th, well into the last month of school. The journalism class has finally published its term project, a magazine called <I>Survival 345: How to Make It, Break It, or Fake It at Stuy</I>. It's selling like hotcakes in the lobby. <I>Hussein Kanji</I>, production editor of <I>Survival</I>, put it together with Quark XPress, a program which he first installed, then taught himself to use. (That was at the same time he was taking Honors AP Calculus, AP Physics, Latin, and Political Theory and auditing AP Economics; academic expectations are very high for Hussein and his fellow students.)</P>

<P>The survival guide tells tales from the dark side of Stuyvesant High. It features articles on student depression, boyfriend rejection, exhaustion from all-night study marathons, cliques, and the prolonged agony of awaiting Ivy League college acceptances.</P>

The stress level is high here, and some students are at the breaking point going into the final stretch. That's why Avis Hsieh has finally decided not to program &#147;Hangman.&#148; Instead, she'll program a binary tree, which is easier. Anyway, she has already been accepted at Princeton. And Steven Milman isn't skipping lunch today, either. In fact, he's lingering in the lunchroom. The view of the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty is soothing, and when you're among the best and brightest, you deserve a break.</P>

<P align=center><FONT size=+2><B>Prospect Heights High School, Brooklyn</B></FONT></P>

<P>At Prospect Heights, high tech greets you at the door in the form of metal detectors, x-ray scanners, and a central computer linking the security desk with every classroom. Using this system, guards can be dispatched immediately to &#147;incidents&#148; throughout the building. Ranked the twelfth most violent among New York City's 125 high schools in 1990 by the Board of Education, Prospect Heights rates not only all the security hardware, but also a special full-time security coordinator, a retired police detective.</P>

<P>More high tech awaits a visitor in the principal's office down the hall. Next to Jerry Cioffi's desk is the computer that serves as nerve center for the PINS and PASS school administrators' program&#151;the Principal's Information Notebook and Pupil Administrative Support Services. Here's how it works: A student is marched in between two security guards, who say he was disrupting a class. The principal enters the kid's name into the PINS and PASS system and views his report card (scores of 45 and 0), his attendance record (late at least 11 times in the last month), his class schedule (he wasn't where he was supposed to be), and his biographical information (poor, black, lives with one parent). Enough information to suspend him, which is what the principal does.</P>

<P>For all his toughness, though, Mr. Cioffi is trying as hard as he can to turn this school around. He's been here six years, longer than the previous 10 principals, and the school has become safer and improved academically under his leadership. For him, the technology is part of the strategy. &#147;We probably use computers here more than most places,&#148; he says, referring to New York's other high schools. The security hardware has kept most weapons out of Prospect Heights, though they're an everyday fact of life in the surrounding neighborhood of Crown Heights.</P>

<P><B>TLC vs. Machines</B></P>

<P>Aside from the computers that are used for security functions, Prospect Heights has 150 or so computers to address the needs of a high school population that the Board of Education never could have planned for. Seventy-five percent of Prospect Heights' 2,006 students are Caribbean immigrants, many of whom arrived in New York City only in the past year or two. Some had no formal schooling; 80 percent require remediation. In the United States, they shoulder adult responsibilities, some raising brothers and sisters or their own children, many working nights. They need literacy training, job preparation, flexible hours, and some way of recovering their self-esteem. Prospect Heights' technology does those things quite well.</P>

<P>&#147;It's possible we make better use of our computers for our needs than Stuyvesant makes of theirs. Their kids will succeed no matter what,&#148; Mr. Cioffi says, noting the high expectations and extensive support that surround Stuyvesant students.</P>

<P>Unlike Stuyvesant's kids, who are all expected to go to college and graduate school, Prospect Heights' kids hope to earn a diploma and get a job. The Business Academy, which teaches mostly typing and ledger keeping, has three computer rooms on the fourth floor. Computer rooms for special education, literacy training, and remediation are on the second and third floors. Mr. Cioffi plans a computer language lab as part of a forthcoming modernization of the 1924 school building, and he's upgrading the existing &#147;Plato&#148; room, used for GED preparation.</P>

<P>Some Prospect Heights teachers are against using computers. Remediation teacher Carol Bowman believes the students are so deprived that their first need is basic human interaction. School librarian Norman Ringle took all the computers out of the library this year. He says the students are &#147;missing a lot in their home life, and I think mechanization is taking even more away from them.&#148;</P>

<P>Mr. Cioffi understands this attitude, but he wants computers in the school, for a lot of reasons. &#147;These kids aren't babies; they need something that makes them feel advanced, not remedial,&#148; he explains. &#147;This program is part of the solution.&#148;</P>

<P>In addition, Mr. Cioffi believes that a computer can sometimes compensate for negative learning experiences. &#147;The computer never gets tired of repeating something. It never gets angry or upset, and it even plays nice music for you when you get a right answer,&#148; he observes.</P>

<P><B>Trial and Error</B></P>

<P>Neal Cameron, a 16-year-old Jamaican, came to the United States a year ago and to Prospect Heights just six months ago. He speaks so softly that it's hard to hear him. Some early trauma is written on his face. He's neatly dressed in colorful sweat pants and nylon jacket. Like most American high school boys, he wears big running shoes with laces half tied and sports a fade haircut. But Neal has neither a computer nor a typewriter at home, his mother is away all week, and what he needs to do is learn to read.</P>

<P>That's what he's doing in Isabelle DiGiacomo's resource remediation class every morning at 9:00. He works on an IBM-based interactive videodisc program called PALS, Principles of the Alphabet Literacy System. PALS, at more than $100,000, is the single most expensive piece of technology in the school.</P>

<P>Neal does exercises in vocabulary and phonics, then views the story of wise King Alpha and brave Queen Bet, which is told in pictures, voice, and text. He is asked to copy the words, complete sentences, and answer questions; his progress is electronically praised at every step.</P>

<P>Neal works steadily, carefully, through the story. He rarely looks up. He never jokes around. At the end, he writes his own summary of the story, in which the good king and queen triumph over the evil Duke Haman by learning written language. In conclusion he writes: &#147;And that his how Wise King Alfa came over Evil Duke Haman bad works and was stell ruler of UR.&#148; His summary is a triumph for a beginning reader, though it has all the hallmarks of adult illiteracy: comprehension and recall are excellent, but he writes in incomplete sentences and uses random capitalization, spacing, and verb tenses.</P>

<P>Ms. D, as her students call her, lets Neal know he has done well. He doesn't smile but listens warily. She corrects the summary and gives it to him to revise, and he dives back into it. Maybe, just maybe, with Ms. D pulling for him, he won't be dumped into special ed, which in New York City is tantamount to a stiff sentence for boys like Neal. &#147;I'm a big believer in computer ed,&#148; says Ms. D, whose 12 other resource remediation students are also working at computer reading programs.</P>

<P>Mr. Cioffi would like to put computers in every classroom, instead of having the computer lab arrangement. In this he is in agreement with Abe Baumel and many other school principals. They feel that course work should take place on computers rather than having computers taught as a separate subject. &#147;The idea of a laboratory is not good,&#148; Mr. Cioffi says. &#147;The move now is to take them out of the computer rooms and put them in the classrooms. You only need four or five per room.&#148;</P>

<P>In Room 407, Mr. Jean Laventure's social studies classroom, there are three Macintosh LCs&#151;a start on Mr. Cioffi's vision. But one computer and the printer have been broken since March, and now in June officials at the Board of Education still don't know when the repairs will be done. The second computer is missing a part, and the projection screen for it is broken. Ernst Pierre works on the third computer, writing a script for his church play, a story in Creole about immigrant life in New York City.</P>

<P>Ernst is 20 years old, too old for high school; but when he came from Haiti two and a half years ago after his mother died, he was placed in ninth grade. Now he is ready to graduate. Ernst dresses in a silk shirt and tailored trousers, speaks French as well as Creole and English, and has polished manners. There is little Prospect Heights can offer him anymore, and he spends a lot of his time in Mr. Laventure's classroom, mostly because the computer is there.</P>

<P>Mr. Laventure taught Ernst how to use the Macintosh after first teaching himself from a manual. The Board of Education offers teachers brief training sessions in computer use, but neither Ms. DiGiacomo nor Mr. Laventure found that training very helpful. IBM and Apple offer workshops, but they are too limited. The teachers have managed to figure out the school computers for themselves.</P>

<P>Ernst is quick with the mouse and fascinated by the computer, even though it keeps thwarting him because it has insufficient memory. The Macintosh in Room 407 has only two megabytes of RAM and really needs four to run the social studies program &#147;Point of View,&#148; which Ernst is working on.</P>

<P>Ernst wants to go into computer programming. He has been accepted at Hunter College, and he has the smarts. Like most young people, he is not afraid of computers or other technologies. But what he doesn't have is the sense of how a computer reasons, how it works. This can be taught. Ernst would learn it quickly. But at Prospect Heights, advanced computer is not an option. So he pushes a lot of buttons but doesn't find the elegant solutions. He is learning by trial and error.</P>

<P>Still, the machine functions fine as a word processor, and Ernst has completed his play. It is about Johnny and Sandra, who flee Haiti for New York. Their aunt and uncle want them to go to work, but they want to study, pleading to be allowed to learn to read. Finally they win their argument, that they will not break out of the cycle of poverty until they get schooling. &#147;The way of school is the way of progress and life,&#148; says the play's concluding maxim. For Ernst and other Haitians who've escaped economic and political terror, it is also the only hope.</P>

<P align=center><FONT size=+2><B>To Have and Have Not</B></FONT></P>

<P>The New York City Board of Education has no program to computerize its high schools; any funds spent on technology in city high schools come from federal education grants or from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a private agency. And the city's ongoing fiscal crisis means there won't be any new programs soon.</P>

<P>Many schools, including Stuyvesant and Prospect Heights, acquire computer hardware and software through private grants or with aid from their parent associations. Others apportion discretionary funds to computers. And there lie the roots of a terrible inequity of access to computers and other technology in the city schools. Schools that are adept at grant writing, those whose parent populations are active in the school, those that are political showcases for the city, get computer networks. Those who don't have grant-writing staffs, whose parents work nights and can't be involved, get by with minimal technology.</P>

<P>A 1992 report* by city comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman found that New York City public school students had less access to computers than other students in the state and that schools with high concentrations (over 60 percent) of black and Hispanic students had far more students per computer than schools with fewer minorities. And that's just the beginning of the story.</P>

<P><SMALL>(* See &#147;Inviting Change: Computers in New York City Schools,&#148; published by the City Comptroller's Office.)</SMALL></P>

<P>A school such as Stuyvesant&#151;a high-profile magnet school with 51 percent Asian students&#151;and one such as Prospect Heights&#151;a zoned school of one of New York City's poorest and politically weakest neighborhoods, with a 100 percent black population&#151;have completely different relationships to computers, and thus to the future. Stuyvesant embodies technology's most exciting potential, encouraging its students to expand the frontiers of knowledge. Prospect Heights uses computers to try to hold back the floodwaters of disaster. Yet students at both schools take to the computers quickly and easily. The painful truth is that the future is limited for students at one school, while the possibilities are dazzling at the other.
And there are no elegant solutions to that problem.</P>

<B><I>John &#147;Jock&#148; Mckernan served two terms as Governor of Maine. One of his major contributions during his tenure was the development of the Maine Youth Apprenticeship program, which was designed to revolutionize education in that state. Modeled after the European system of apprenticeship but with an American emphasis on flexibility, Maine's program was launched in 1992 [see <A HREF="sb1mckernan.htm">School-to-Work&#151;in Maine and across the Country</A> Sidebar].  It calls for unprecedented cooperation among three essential groups: Business, Education, and Government.  McKernan, a former chair of the education commission of the states, outlines the program in his 1994 book,</I> Making the Grade: How a New Youth Apprenticeship System Can Change Our Schools and Save American Jobs<I>. The book is written in collaboration with Jobs for America's Graduates, Inc., which McKernan serves as chair, and Jobs for the Future.</I>  TECHNOS <I>spoke with then-Governor McKernan in November 1994, when his wife, Olympia Snowe, was running for the U.S. Senate and Angus King was running for the governorship.</I></B></P>

<P><SMALL>* [Angus King was elected Governor of Maine in November 1994 and sworn into office on January 5, 1995.]</SMALL></P>
<BR>

<P><B><I>The most fascinating thing to me about your book,</I> Making the Grade<I>, is the fact that you were able to get people in education, government, and business to agree and to cooperate in order to implement the Maine Youth Apprenticeship Program. How did you manage to achieve consensus?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, it helps to have the governor be committed to it&#151;it's amazing what an impact that can have. And one of the things that we've tried to do is to grow the program fast enough so that it won't require the next governor* to have to spend as much time on it as I did. It was something that I feel very strongly about, so I was willing to put in the time and be the facilitator to get the meetings scheduled and get people on board. I'm not sure that a new governor coming in is going to have either the inclination or the time to give that I did.</P>

<P>I just gathered people together, both to design the program and to participate in it. I had a lot of one-on-one meetings with people in education and in business. Now, obviously, since I was the governor, I didn't have too much trouble getting government to participate, but it was one of those activities that I think is absolutely essential for everyone to participate in and to be a part of. It just doesn't work unless you have three willing partners. It wasn't easy. But everybody knows it's the right thing to do. Everyone knows that the current system of preparing young people for the world of work is outdated and not helpful for businesses. The problem we have is that educators don't quite know how to change it, and businesses don't know what they really ought to be doing about it.</P>

<P><I><B>Did you build in any tax incentives for the employers who participate in your program?</B></I></P>

<P>We haven't. We talked about it and concluded that it wasn't necessary to get the program started. We originally had planned on having a tax credit for 20 percent of the $5,000 the businesses had to pay to sponsor each of the apprentices. But ultimately, given the budget constraints we had, we decided that it was not going to have a major impact on participation by employers and, therefore, we could probably spend our money better somewhere else. We may get to a point where a tax incentive would make sense.</P>

<P><I><B>Is it a voluntary program among the districts and schools?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes. This is a totally voluntary program. What we have done is to create a Center for Youth Apprenticeship at Southern Maine Technical College. We have an advisory board&#151;and our Commissioner of Education as well as our Chancellor and the head of our Technical College System sit on that&#151;so we have a number of people who are involved in education who are out helping us sell the programs. There are about 150 high schools in our state, and 35 of them are participating this year. Frankly, we may have trouble getting more than 90 ultimately, because some of them are so small and in such rural areas that I'm not sure there would be enough jobs in those areas to warrant much participation from them. So we're probably halfway to what would be the most realistic total size of the program. And we have only about 57 businesses that are participating, which is probably five percent of what we need to make this program be the size we want. But we're seeing exponential growth each year, and that's what I think will happen once the program really gets into each of the areas. We're only beginning our second year in most of the areas of our state. The first year was just in the greater Portland area, which is the largest city. Last year we went into all five areas of the major population centers, where 80 to 90 percent of our population is.</P>

<P><I><B>Do you think this program could be transplanted to other states&#151;such as New York or California or Texas or Florida&#151;places where we've got not only large urban areas but also large immigrant populations?</B></I></P>

<P>There's no question but that these programs would be just as useful in those areas. Tulsa has a program, for instance, that they've started, and they're doing some pilot programs in Milwaukee and outside of Philadelphia and in some parts of New York as well. It can be done anywhere. The real issue here is, how do we make sure that youngsters coming out of our schools have the skills they need for the jobs that are going to exist? And the only way that we can do that is to get businesses in a local area&#151;it could be a community, it could be a county, it could be a state&#151;together with educators so that they understand each other better. That can happen anywhere in America. In fact, it's perhaps easier in urban areas because you don't have some of the travel considerations that you have in rural areas.</P>

<P>The important thing, though, that we're trying to stress is that the history of education in this country has really centered around either the best students or the worst students. And the reason is that the kids in the middle were always able to get a decent job when they got out of school, even if they didn't have much formal education. And that's what has changed in our society. We have become so technology driven, and the competition from outside America is so great, that we are now requiring more and more skills in our work force&#151;and it's that great middle, which has sort of been ignored as they move through the education system because they didn't cause problems and they weren't going to go to four-year colleges, so as long as they made it through and got the basics, they could do fine with the kind of jobs that we had in our country. That has changed, therefore schools have to change. I think the only way they can do that is if businesses get involved in helping them establish what criteria they need in order to be able to hire kids coming out of the schools during the last pan of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century. That's going to be important, no matter what part of the country you come from.</P>

<P>One thing that has struck me over the last eight years that I've been Governor is the role technology plays in all the changes in our society. I am convinced that we have to make sure youngsters get the kind of education that is going to allow them to participate in this new information age by having at least a basic understanding of technology. What we have tried to do in our state is to enhance the use of technology throughout the early grades. And what we hope to do with the apprenticeship program is to ensure that through the involvement of businesses in the education system&#151;starting in the eleventh grade&#151;youngsters are going to have the opportunity sooner than they otherwise would to learn those kinds of skills that are oftentimes technology-based that will give them a real leg up as they get out into the work force.</P>

<P><I><B>Has the state of Maine set aside funding for technology  implementation in the schools?</B></I></P>

<P>We have technology grants that we have given out to our schools and have set aside money specifically for that. We also have developed an interactive television system within our university system that is one of the tops in the country. Because of the rural nature of Maine, we are doing a lot of interactive work and bringing university courses to over 40 high schools in our state so that people can get graduate degrees and additional courses through the use of that medium. We lost, unfortunately, an interactive TV bond issue for our high schools&#151;we want to wire up all of our high schools so we can start to make better use of technology to bring courses that perhaps some of the smaller schools couldn't afford to get. We're going to go back into the next session of the legislature with a revamped version of that so we can continue to move forward. But I am just convinced that if you look at the gap that has grown between the haves and the have-nots, you will see that probably half of the wage differential between those who are educated and those who aren't is based on their ability to use a computer. Therefore. what we have to do is find a way to get kids more access to more technology, and I think the apprenticeship program does that by getting them the opportunity to work in actual offices where the technology is far more current than you could ever have it in our educational institutions.</P>

<P><I><B>How will the federal seed money from the School-to-Work Opportunities Act be used in Maine?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, I was a little frustrated, frankly, with the way the grant program came out. I don't want to be an ingrate&#151;they did give us two million dollars a year for five years&#151;but we had hoped to get nine million dollars a year for five years. We had hoped they would look at the merits of the program and not use a formula approach that would cut people back almost based on population&#151;which is basically what happened. It was frustrating for us because we thought we had a real systemic approach in which we were going to use the standards that we had begun to set for a certificate in our apprenticeship program as the standard. And then have everything funneling toward that standard&#151;whether was tech prep, cooperative education, vocational education, or apprenticeship&#151;and the only difference would be how a student would get to that certificate. It might require a longer period of time it someone took one course as opposed to another&#151;but everything was going toward what had been commonly agreed upon by businesses and educators for each of the occupational clusters as standards that were necessary for people to be certifiable as employable in particular areas. We thought that was a wonderful way to foster the kind of reform we need in our educational system and not have a lot of separate programs out there going in different directions.</P>

<P>But the two million dollars we received was helpful because that is going to allow us to fully implement the apprenticeship program over the next five years, which I think is an important foundation on which to build the other programs. I think the School-to-Work Opportunities grant program is very important because it forces states to look at what they might be able to do in this area and it dangles the federal dollars out there, which makes addressing the issues more attractive.</P>

<P><I><B>What about the Carl Perkins and Adult Education and National Literacy moneys? Are these conflicting with school-to-work programs?</B></I></P>

<P>I don't think they are. One of the big problems that I have with much of what we're doing, whether it's in adult ed or voc ed or cooperative education or tech prep, is that everybody has set up what they think is a nice end result to their own programs. But the state and the industry or the occupational clusters involved haven t really been a part of determining what skills they want kids to have. Therefore, we're operating on the last half century's information on things that were established when the program first came into being, and we don't really have a systematic way of updating what the result should be coming out of these programs.</P>

<P>I told the story in my book about when we first started our apprenticeship program. We wanted to have three or four forward-looking occupations, so we decided to use health care. We decided to turn a lab technology program at one of our technical colleges into more of a work-based learning opportunity and make it more of an apprenticeship approach&#151;because kids really liked the program and there was always a waiting list for it. So we made that decision, got the human resources directors together from the three hospitals in Portland, and they all told us that they didn't think that was a good program because they wouldn't have any jobs for those kids when they finished. Of course, that brought up the question of why we were teaching the lab tech course at our college. The answer was because nobody had bothered to tell the college that it wasn't really what the hospitals needed. Those kinds of things are found throughout our educational process. I hope that we can start to bring together businesses and educators to draft the standards for certification. Then there will be the kind of dialog that will drive the curriculum because of the standards that the educators and the business community have adopted for each of the occupational clusters or industries.</P>

<P><I><B>The other thing that struck me as I read your book is the cooperation that you received from the technical college system in Maine. There's a bit of a problem in some states convincing the colleges that some of the technical credits young people earn during high school or even at a two year college should be accepted at four year institutions.</B></I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="1mckbk.gif" align=left hspace=10>Well, we have a little bit of a problem with that, too, especially in the two-year to four-year situation. But we have a very good chancellor of our university system who believes strongly that a four-year education is not in everybody's best interest. I didn't appoint him, by the way, but he agrees with my view that what we need to do is make sure we offer a lot of options so that people get to play to their strengths. It may be a one-year certificate for some people, it may be a two-year or a four-year degree. But what we need to do is have those options available and make sure they are interrelated pathways so you can get credit for the path that you've taken, if you decide you want to move onto another one. That is really the underpinnings on which our program is based.</P>

<P>It became clear to me when we were in Europe that there are really two things that made the European systems of apprenticeship work: One, the education was relevant, so the kids were interested in it; and two, it had such a tradition that the apprenticeship route was viewed in one's community as a worthy route to take and one for which people received respect, so there was a reward as well among one's peers for having done it. It struck me that you couldn't do that in America without having a college component to it, because we had just spent 50 years telling everyone in this country that if they wanted to be a success, they'd better go to college.  How are you going to come back and say, &#145;Hey, we were wrong. You don't have to go to college&#146;? That was when we realized that apprenticeship had to be integrated into our post-secondary system. And it seemed that the most obvious choice was the technical college because many of the courses we're teaching, they also taught at the technical college system.</P>

<P>We could, in fact, give credit for work-based learning as well as academic learning. What has to happen, especially in secondary vocational courses is to get more involvement between the university and community college sectors with the high schools. The high schools must give kids the kind of learning experience that would warrant their getting any credit for what they learned. Part of the problem is that many of the vocational courses in our high schools and our vocational schools aren't worthy of very much credit in a post-secondary institution. There has to be a greater interrelationship, so the courses are ones that have already been discussed with the institutions of higher education and they're taught in a way that would allow them to give credit. Then we have to hope that the post-secondary institutions are enlightened enough to realize that this is the wave of the future and they ought to be figuring out what it would take for kids to get credit for applied curriculum or work-based learning.</P>

<P><I><B>This whole idea of an applied curriculum not quite being worthy is something that we at AIT run into all the time because we produce those materials.  We've found it difficult to have them endorsed by some teachers groups or by the NCAA or by some universities.  Do you have any thoughts about that?</B></I></P>

<P>I think a youth apprenticeship system will make a big difference in a lot of what's called &#145;nontraditional&#146; coursework because the fact that the courses are designed to receive credit from both our technical colleges and our university means that they are going to be at a high enough level that there shouldn't be any question. That, I think, is what has to happen all across the country. We have to do this, starting out state by state, and then hopefully we'll be able to get the NCAA, for instance, to decide what their criteria are going to be when they see these state standards.</P>

<P>I can assure you that there isn't any state university&#151;probably almost any college&#151;in this country where the kids who go through our youth apprenticeship program couldn't do the work. We screen kids carefully, and they learn a lot more than most of their peers in high school during their coursework. They become much more serious students. And they are the kind of kids who will benefit from a college education. So that, I think, can happen. But that is a far cry from many of what we have historically seen as the vocational courses. That's, I think, the problem we're now having&#151;and it's why certification is so important.</P>

<P>Ultimately, what we all hope is that various associations&#151;whether it's the NCAA or whether it's the Metal Products Association or whether it's the American Bankers Association&#151;will ultimately design the standards that are acceptable to the members of their associations. Then there will be a number of different ways that the courses will be taught, depending on what it is that a youngster happens to have the most interest in. We want to establish what both the academic level of proficiency has to be and what the industry or occupational level of proficiency has to be in order to receive certificates. Then, we want to give people a lot of pathways so we might have a program that would say, &#145;At the end of your 13th year, you could get both your academic as well as your applied certificate in a particular field, in our apprenticeship program.&#146;</P>

<P><I><B>It sounds as though you're trying to build some flexibility into your program, which is something that the European models have been criticized for not having.</B></I></P>

<P>Absolutely. In fact, those models, in my view, wouldn't work in this country because of that. First of all, they track kids at a very young age&#151;which is something that I don't think we should do&#151;and secondly, it's a lot harder than it needs to be to move from one program to the next.</P>

<P><I><B>It seems to be so. Was there any kind of negative reaction from the citizens of Maine when you went to Europe?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, since I had a foundation pay for it, they weren't unhappy in the least! The good thing about apprenticeship is that people have a universally positive visceral response to the concept. It's fascinating. People know that we aren't doing enough for kids who aren't going on to four-year colleges. If they have a child in that category, they're darn sure, and even if they don't, they realize that we've neglected those kids. So it really is an easy intellectual sell. It is not as easy to get people to participate, especially businesses, and that is what I see as the great threat to enhancing education&#151;small and medium-sized businesses who don't have the expertise and aren't really sure why it affects them, and if so, what they should do about it. That's why what we're trying to do is get some of our larger businesses to help us in the first few years so we can design workbooks, if you will, for the meisters, or mentors, who will work with the apprentices. Even if you're an insurance agency of seven people, you could have one of those people be in charge of an apprentice. We would have a booklet that would tell you what you were supposed to do each of the 30 weeks that the youngster's with you in each of the three years. It would be spelled out for the businesses.</P>

<P><I><B>Was that a problem for them?</B></I></P>

<P>Sure. And they should sometimes say, &#145;We don't know anybody who knows how to do any of this stuff. We're not teachers.&#146; And they probably don't have any real training programs for their new employees, either. What this, we hope, can do is to say, &#145;Look, we have not only group programs for the meisters who are participating all across the state but also a how-to notebook in your particular field and your particular apprenticeship, so you can stay a week ahead of the kids.&#146; With the price being only $5,000 to sponsor an apprentice, most of these apprenticeships aren't rocket science&#151;so companies might lose money the first year that they participate, but by the second year, the youngster is generally pulling his or her own weight, and by the third year they're probably making money while the student is there. As a three-year investment, even if you don't hire the young person, you still have not lost any money over the three-year period. In fact, you've made a big difference in that youngster's life, you have increased the pool of qualified employees for employers in the state, and have probably on the whole, made some money for your company.</P>

<P><I><B>After only three years, do you have any documentation as to the effects of the apprenticeship program?</B></I></P>

<P>At this point, our first year's group is working on their first year at the post-secondary level. This is the third year of the program, so this is the first year that they have been at the technical colleges doing their academic work after graduating last June. So it really will be next year that we'll find out how many of them actually do well. What's interesting is that we're seeing all sorts of results, which is what we'd hoped for. Kids who decide to stay on and get their associate's degree after this year, others who are going to go to work full time for the businesses that they're now working for, and some who are going to work full time and continue their education at night to get their associate's degree. For the most part, it is working as we'd hoped. We've had some drop out&#151;some for unavoidable personal reasons and others who've decided that they wanted to get out because all of a sudden they've been inspired to get a four-year degree, so they've gone into the college prep program&#151;which is, in our view, a great result. So that's where we are at this point. We won't really know for another couple of years what happens to these kids after they finish the three years.</P>

<P><I><B>How was it that you chose this particular program as your personal crusade?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, it's funny. I've chaired a group called Jobs for America's Graduates, which did some of the research for my book, since 1989. It's a program that works with at-risk kids on school-to-work transition issues. It started out about 15 years ago as a program that looked at the toughest 20 percent of the senior class who were in jeopardy of dropping out or not graduating. We put in a job specialist who works at about a 1 to 40 ratio, and we have found that even intervening that late, we have a 90 percent success rate in kids either graduating or getting their GED within nine months of when they would have graduated&#151;and 80 percent of them end up getting jobs. It really has shown that if you just give some of these toughest kids an adult role model, someone who's looking after them and nurturing them, even at that late age, you're able to have a phenomenal success rate.</P>

<P>But what we noticed over the last few years has been that our job specialists say it's tougher and tougher to find these kids jobs. When the program first started, we taught them to dress up and how  to do a resume and how to interview, and what their obligations are when they go to work&#151;like showing up everyday&#151;and how to relate to adults. For a while, that was enough: it made them great employees, and we had great success. We have found more recently that it is tougher and tougher to find them jobs because even though they have all those skills, they have no substantive skills. Therefore, we really had limited the kinds of jobs they were able to get because of the way that the world of work had changed.</P>

<P>I then talked to a couple of CEOs in Maine and to Lou Gerstner, who was then at RJR Nabisco, and they were giving me anecdotal evidence. They said things like, &#145;We can't afford to hire people who don't have skills anymore. The competition's too great. We used to be able to train them to do something that we could afford to pay them a decent wage for, but that's all changed. We just can't do that anymore. We need kids that can contribute something. And kids coming out of high school today can't.&#146;</P>

<P>So, it was really the combination of those two experiences that made me realize the greatest threat to our standard of living in this country is not how we tweak the educational system for the top third of the class. The real challenge for us is how to do a better job with the middle third. Those are the kids who are really going to determine our standard of living.  Those are the kids who have something to offer, if we just had a system that gave them the skills to operate. That was when I started thinking a bit about the Japanese model, which is much too structured for us, and then the European model, which I went to look at.</P>

<P>Something sort of clicked when I was in Europe&#151;this was a system that we could adapt to the American system to really make a difference in the lives of a lot of kids. When you realize that only about 25 or 30 percent of the kids who go to four-year colleges ever graduate, all of a sudden, you realize that going to a four-year college is not a panacea. They'd be better off going into the Youth Apprenticeship Program than taking a year and a half of liberal arts courses at a university and dropping out. Heck, a lot of kids graduate with four-year degrees without anything that's usable.</P>



<P><I><B>What do they do?  They go to grad school.</B></I></P>

<P>That's right. And that's almost what we've gotten to. The real challenge for us in these kinds of programs&#151;and something that we struggle with&#151;is how to communicate what's happening to parents, how to help them understand that, yes, their child needs to go to college, but it might be a different kind of college than they've been envisioning.</P>

<P><I><B>Maybe we've done a wonderful public relations job for our universities but now it's time to get realistic about what we want our kids to do in the future.</B></I></P>

<P>That's right. I had breakfast with a fellow who works for the president of a community college in Tulsa that's doing some things in youth apprenticeship. He said to me, &#145;You knows this whole society is run by Harvard University anyway, and this situation is a classic example. Some Harvard professor after the war wrote that we ought to get a liberal, general education to begin with and then specialize afterward.&#146; And he said we've taken that to the extreme and what people ought to realize is that probably what we need to do now is get people a technical education, or a specific education, so there's something they can do in society and then let them expand beyond that. And that's sort of the approach we've taken.</P>

<P>When I called Bill Bennett to ask him what he thought about youth apprenticeship, to see whether it was something he was interested in being a part of, one of the things he said was, &#145;Oh, I think it's a great idea. Your problem is going to be that you're going to have more kids who want to do it than you're going to have slots for, because,&#146; he said&#151;as only he could say&#151;&#145;Why wouldn't anybody want to learn something useful before he went to Princeton?&#146;</P>

<P>You know what's interesting about that? I had dinner with a banker in Munich who said that the most sought-after people in the banking industry when they come out of four-year business colleges are those who did an apprenticeship before they got a four-year degree. Because they already know the industry.</P>

<P><I><B>They have the practical skills.</B></I></P>

<P>That's right. And they already have worked in the industry for three years and understand banking and there isn't as much training involved. It's the same thing in the United States. If we have a youngster who goes through an apprenticeship program and then at age 19 enrolls in a program to get a business degree or a four-year degree or a two-year degree, that extra year of being certified and understanding an industry, I think, is going to make a huge difference in his or her employability.</P>

<P><I><B>What do you think is the purpose of education or learning schooling, whatever one wants to call it?</B></I></P>

<P>I describe it the way our Commission on the Common Core of Learning described it when we formed about a 40-person task  force back in the late 1980s to look at what young people in the 21st century ought to know and be able to do, because it was something we hadn't really looked at in 50 or 60 years. Times have changed. What should we be doing about a curriculum that really hasn't changed that much?</P>

<P>We want to produce young people coming out of our educational system who can be productive and contributing citizens in the 21st century. And that means understanding where we've come from; it means understanding how to interact with others; it means knowing something about the world around us and having the basic skills to function in modern society. I think that is what the role of education has to be at the most basic level. And after that, people's own interests and strengths, I think, take over and will push them in one direction or another. We ought to have a system that is open enough to accommodate that.</P>

<P><I><B>You chose politics as opposed to going into education. Is there an example that you followed? Do you have a hero?</B></I></P>

<P>When I was in high school. I thought I was going to be playing basketball for the Boston Celtics, so I wasn't all that interested in politics. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized I was going to need a new career. That was probably my awakening to more of the world around me. It was during the turbulent time of the late 1960s when I was at Dartmouth College, and a lot of things were hitting a lot of us during that time. That was when I first started to get interested in politics. And what struck me&#151;it was probably my moderate nature&#151;was that there had to be a better way to effect change in our society without civil disobedience. It really was Nelson Rockefeller and John Lindsay who influenced me, since I sort of had Republican leanings anyway, as understanding a better vision of what we could do within the system to make responsible change. Lindsay became a Democrat after that, so I can strike him off my list now! But at the time, I thought he was a good example of somebody who could find a consensus&#151;I think I'm a consensus kind of person. That was really what started to drive me toward a life of trying to make a difference and doing it within the system.</P>

<P><I><B>You've written that you think coordination of these programs at the national level is going to be essential very soon. If the United States were to have a youth apprenticeship czar, would John McKernan be the person?</B></I></P>

<P>Well. I've told [Labor] Secretary [Robert] Reich as well as Deputy Secretary Doug Ross that I'd be happy to be a part of any of these efforts to have people see the wisdom of the need to focus on school-to-work. I don t have an interest in doing it on a full-time basis, but I'd be happy to be on commissions or on ad hoc groups that are touring the country trying to have other states see the importance of it. I'm frankly not sure that the federal government ought to be doing much more than being a catalyst and a coordinator and a facilitator. I don't think we want to establish the national standards and say, &#145;These are the standards.&#146; What we want to do is be more aggressive in working with groups in particular industries to decide what they think their standards should be.</P>

<P>We can get into the same problem at the national level&#151;probably worse&#151;that we had in Maine by trying to have the government figure out what it is kids ought to be learning and what the standards ought to be. That has to be done in the private sector.</P>

<P>I think if there is a role for government, it's that of proselytizing and making sure that the various business groups understand the importance of their being involved in apprenticeship. Being a part of that effort is something that I'd be happy to help with, but not on a full-time basis.</P>

<P><I><B>Will you be a consultant on youth apprenticeship around the country?</B></I></P>

<P>I'd rather see if I can find some foundation money to do some additional things at the Center for Youth Apprenticeship and continue to speak out on the need for the program so that we can increase participation from 70 kids this year to 1,000 over the next three years. And then, I think, at that point it will grow to the 5,000 that we see as probably the optimum level.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Mississippi's LEAP Toward Literacy</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Edwin E. Meek</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I>How does distance learning work? For a unique example, travel to Mississippi, where satellite technology and a commitment to improve adult literacy come together in Project LEAP. A partnership of the state, the University of Mississippi, and private supporters and employers, Project LEAP is helping to educate adults and get them off welfare. The project's founder, Edwin Meek, tells how it's done. </I></B></P> 
<BR>

<P>Diane Calhoune and her nine-year-old daughter live in the small rural Mississippi town of West Point, where the unemployment rate is close to 12 percent. A large number of Calhoune's fellow citizens receive welfare, and many of those who work have seasonal farming jobs. Calhoune doesn't own a telephone or an automobile, but four nights a week she has access to state-of-the-art educational technology and to some of the brightest and most innovative teachers in Mississippi. As a result, she has found a job and left the welfare rolls.</P>

<P>Through Project LEAP&#151;Learn, Earn, and Prosper&#151;Mississippians who have difficulty reading and writing are learning to improve their literacy and employability by taking part in interactive classes broadcast by satellite from the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, near Oxford. Established by the Mississippi Department of Human Services' Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program in response to a federal literacy-training mandate, LEAP is the first project anywhere that uses satellite technology to help educate people like Diane Calhoune so they can get off welfare and into paying jobs.</P>

<P>LEAP's instructional programs are broadcast mornings and evenings four days a week on the Mississippi Cable Training Network, which was established for this purpose by the Mississippi Cable Television Association. The broadcasts serve some 80 adult education centers with the capacity to reach 3,000 students throughout the state. Each center is staffed by a teacher and teacher's aides. University instructors whose lessons are broadcast via satellite from the Ole Miss campus studios present core curriculum courses and enrichment activities. Courses are geared to three ability levels: beginning instruction (grades K&#150;3); intermediate instruction (grades 4&#150;8); and preparation for General Educational Development, or GED (grades 9&#150;12). LEAP students also learn life skills in an &#147;Information You Can Use&#148; component. The class provides instruction on careers&#151;such as good work habits, balancing a career and family, and communication in the workplace&#151;as well as parenting and consumer health issues.</P>

<P>Two mobile learning laboratories, each equipped with 12 computers and instructional software, serve some of the centers. One of the 30-foot-long labs is based in Jackson and travels among three sites: Whiterock Community Center, Reynolds Adult Education Center, and Duling Adult Education Center. The other lab is located in Greenville at Branch Literacy. Both offer a wide range of computer-assisted programs tied into LEAP's goals and attainment of GED skills. Among the programs is a one-of-a-kind basic reading program that allows nonreaders to practice their skills simply by touching the computer screen.</P>

<P>A public-private partnership, LEAP is a multimillion-dollar project funded by the Mississippi JOBS program and the university. The mobile labs were purchased with federal dollars leveraged by private funds from Jitney Jungle Stores of America, Inc., and the Keebler Company. In addition, local cable companies provide satellite antennas and channel space.</P>

<P><B>Pomp and Circumstance</B></P>

<P>For Minnie Frand, 23, of Tchula, LEAP's combination of satellite instruction and one-on-one training sparked an interest in learning after almost 10 years away from the classroom. Four days a week, Frand sends her nine-year-old daughter off to school and heads to a dilapidated farmhouse on a rural Mississippi highway. Called the &#147;shotgun shack,&#148; the house is missing a few planks and shingles. Inside is a toll-free telephone line that Frand and other students use to talk with their television teachers if they have problems with a lesson. Next to the shotgun shack is a satellite dish to receive the lessons.</P>

<P><I><IMG SRC="4meek.gif" align=left hspace=10>Minnie Frand of Tchula talks to her television teacher. Project LEAP provides a toll-free telephone line at each classroom so that students can discuss problems with their University of Mississippi instructors.</I></P>

<P>Frand is one of 45 single, welfare-dependent women from the Tchula area enrolled in Project LEAP. Her courses include reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, and science. She earned her GED in August 1993 and is learning word processing in hopes of landing an office job. In the meantime, she helps teach other students in the LEAP classes as part of the Alternative Work Experience Program.</P>

<P>Frand and others in the program were referred to the Rosebank Learning Center, the shotgun shack that houses the LEAP classroom, through their Department of Human Services case-workers. If they don't attend classes, they risk losing one to six months of welfare benefits, depending on the number of classes missed. Although attendance is mandatory, students at the center are enthusiastic about the program. On their own initiative, they made Thursdays dress-up days, when each student dresses as if she were on a job interview. On Wednesdays, each student speaks before the class to practice public speaking skills.</P>

<P>When Frand and three classmates earned their GEDs, the center held a graduation ceremony complete with &#147;Pomp and Circumstance,&#148; graduation robes, and commencement speaker. &#147;My daughter was so excited that she took pictures and then asked if she could take them to school to show her friends,&#148; Frand says. &#147;It made me really proud.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Technological Field Trips</B></P>

<P>Much of the enthusiasm for LEAP is centered on its use of technology. LEAP was recognized by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment in Washington, which cited the project as one of several innovative programs using technology to help adults achieve functional literacy. LEAP also was nominated for the Heller Report's prestigious Pioneer Award, which recognizes unique and innovative uses of technology.</P>

<P>&#147;Television gives us one more tool to reach learners with different learning styles,&#148; says Pamela Hakim, LEAP's curriculum coordinator. &#147;It allows us to bring to the most rural areas of the state a master language arts teacher, a master math teacher, and a master social studies teacher.&#148; Because the classes are broadcast from a university, the program also has access to artists, scientists, and other professionals not normally found in rural areas.</P>

<P>&#147;In my opinion, visual aid teaching goes beyond usual methods,&#148; says Shirley Williams, a Project LEAP teacher's aide in Charleston. &#147;It enables students to actually see and grasp information. In earlier years, students were forced to go to the board and work out situations. Television cuts out embarrassment and allows each student to get involved.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="4satelit.gif" align=left hspace=10>To take advantage of the television medium, university teachers try to make each lesson a visual experience. In a lesson on homonyms, for example, teachers performed a skit to illustrate the difference between the words &#147;bored&#148; and &#147;board.&#148; &#147;We did it in the context of a board meeting,&#148; Hakim explains. &#147;We had one teacher keep his head on the table. He kept telling the others he was &#145;bored.&#146; Another wrote something on the &#145;board,&#146; and the meeting was held in the &#145;board&#146; room. By acting out the relationships, we drew a picture students could relate to.&#148;</P>

<P>Television also allows students to visit places that they might not otherwise see. &#147;We are able to take the students on a field trip almost every day,&#148; Hakim says. For example, in the &#147;Information You Can Use&#148; segment, the site teacher can tell students what is involved in a career in construction work. But the television cameras can go to an actual construction site and show workers pouring concrete and driving trucks. The expense and time it would take to travel to the site are saved, and students still get the feel of what it's like to work in construction. The TV field trips are taped, but the students can ask questions of the teacher as they view the program.</P>

<P>LEAP's curriculum encompasses much more than most other adult education programs. &#147;We are contracted to prepare our students for the GED and to cover every subject to meet that objective,&#148; Hakim says. &#147;But we go beyond that. We are committed to helping students function as contributing members of society, and that means more than learning what a synonym is or learning multiplication tables.&#148;</P>

<P>LaJunda Pittman, who teaches the &#147;Information You Can Use&#148; class taped at the Ole Miss studios, has addressed such topics as personal budgets, sexual and physical abuse, AIDS, parenting, and job interview techniques. The information presented in these lessons cuts to the heart of problems facing many welfare recipients, and response from students has been favorable. &#147;These are very personal issues, and it's often hard for students to call in and talk about them on the air,&#148; she says. When Pittman visits individual classrooms, however, she is often bombarded with questions about topics she has covered in her television segments.</P>

<P>At first, students seemed intimidated by the television teachers. &#147;They looked at us like we were their little stars,&#148; Pittman says. &#147;But as we've gotten into the studies, they are opening up. They realize there is someone here they can talk to.&#148; And they are using the telephone to ask questions during broadcast time, rather than waiting for personal visits.</P>

<P><B>Beyond the Call of Duty</B></P>

<P>Access to television teachers is provided through toll-free phone lines at each LEAP site, and students make up to 35 calls a day from around the state. Many of them are to Ras Pickens, who teaches LEAP's math classes, but not all of his callers are seeking help with mathematics. &#147;I talked to one lady who said her boyfriend kept telling her she didn't need to go to school. She had questions about how to handle the situation,&#148; Pickens says. &#147;I think a big part of my job is to encourage them to keep doing what they're doing.&#148;</P>

<P>Pickens's life story has served as encouragement for many students. He taught adult education classes in Clarksdale in the Mississippi Delta for nine years before moving to Detroit to take a similar post. He returned to Oxford and worked as a janitor at the university to support his family when a teaching post wasn't available. Pickens's ability to relate to students has made him one of LEAP's most popular teachers, and they frequently turn to him for encouragement in their private and academic lives. &#147;I think they see me as a friend as well as a teacher,&#148; he says. &#147;A lot of students view a teacher as someone who looks down on them. They can perceive it from your voice.&#148;</P>

<P>Encouragement from teachers, both on and off the air, has given many LEAP students the boost they need to return to school after years away from the classroom. &#147;The average age of our students is 31 years&#151;mostly single women with dependent children,&#148; says Marie Antoon, assistant director of resource development at Ole Miss, who guides Project LEAP. &#147;This is a group of individuals society has failed or who have dropped out of the mainstream of opportunities in our state. Our job is to help them obtain the skills they need to become contributing members of the work force.&#148;</P>

<P>The average LEAP participant has completed the ninth grade; the majority of participants are African Americans. Ras Pickens believes their association with one of the state's largest universities has given them a new sense of self. &#147;What keeps many of these women coming back to class is that the University of Mississippi is involved,&#148; he says. &#147;In Mississippi, Ole Miss is recognized as a leader in education. When these women see they are being taught by teachers at this university, it gives them pride. They brag about it to their friends. It gives an added importance to the GED.&#148;</P>

<P>This pride gives the students an impetus to study. After only six months of operation, 79 percent of LEAP students in the GED-preparation level received their GEDs; 16 percent became employed while in the program; 30 percent progressed to a higher learning level; 13 percent entered a community college or other training program; and 5 percent were removed from public assistance.</P>

<P><B>Economic Effectiveness</B></P>

<P>For Diane Calhoune, who recently began working in the cafeteria of Babcock and Wilcox, the second-largest employer in West Point, Project LEAP helped develop the personal confidence and interview skills she needed to land a job and get off welfare. Calhoune, 36, dropped out of school in the ninth grade. When she entered LEAP, she had been out of work for two years and her self-esteem and test scores were low. While in the program, she was tested three times. Each time, her grade equivalency improved dramatically. As her local instructor, Johanna Rice, recalls, &#147;Each time I told her the scores, her personality changed&#151;she developed personal confidence.&#148;</P>

<P>That was evident as Calhoune underwent two rounds of interviews for her cafeteria post. &#147;I was tense at first,&#148; she confides, &#147;but then I remembered some of the things from the &#145;Information You Can Use&#146; class. I gave straight-out answers and didn't take a long time. It made a good impression.&#148; Calhoune also knew what questions to ask of her employers. &#147;I asked about job benefits and what clothes I had to wear to work, and at the end I said I hoped to hear from them. I probably wouldn't have said all that if I hadn't taken the class,&#148; she says.</P>

<P>Calhoune has passed two sections of the GED and plans to retake others as soon as possible. She has the support of her employer, an industrial manufacturing firm that places a high priority on education. Her bosses have promised her a promotion once she earns her GED.</P>

<P>Calhoune's story isn't unique. As competition for jobs becomes more intense, employers look for applicants who take education seriously. &#147;An educated work force is an important tool for attracting jobs to Mississippi. Without education, workers cannot meet the intellectual demands required to compete in today's marketplace,&#148; says Jimmy Heidel, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Economic and Community Development.</P>

<P>Welfare recipients aren't the only ones who can benefit from LEAP technology. With an estimated 60 percent of prison inmates lacking the basic reading and math skills needed to hold down a job, Project LEAP officials are exploring ways to offer classes to prison populations. The plan has met with enthusiasm from law enforcement officials. In a letter to LEAP officials, Greenville police chief Dennis Blass writes: &#147;Teaching inmates to read may be the single best thing we can do to reduce crime in our city. People who can't read can't work. If they don't work, there are only two options: live off the dole or commit crimes. LEAP strikes at the core of the problem, giving those who have not learned to read another chance.&#148; An extension of LEAP in the second year of operation will reach beyond the borders of Mississippi to include national prison systems.</P>

<P><B>&#145;Ah-ha!&#146; Moments</B></P>

<P>Learning to read gave Janie McNeil of Holly Springs a higher sense of self-esteem. She is a stay-at-home mother who dropped out of high school almost 30 years ago and returned to the classroom in March 1993 with a purpose: to get an education and improve her life. With the support of her children she entered the program with a math level below fourth grade.</P>

<P>McNeil's local teacher is Caroline Field, who recounts one incident that illustrates the pride in learning that many LEAP students experience. &#147;It was a moment I'll long remember&#151;it was an &#145;ah-ha!&#146; moment,&#148; Field says. It happened while Field was attempting to explain the concept of &#147;perimeter&#148; to reinforce a lesson on multiplication. &#147;I had said that two lengths plus two widths equals the perimeter as many ways as I knew how. Janie was studying the rectangle at the board when suddenly her face lit up like the Fourth of July. She quickly solved the problem,&#148; Field says. &#147;When I asked her what had happened, she said, &#145;All of a sudden, what you were saying made sense. I thought, I can <I>do</I> this!&#146; Janie beamed the rest of the evening.&#148;</P>

<P>Project LEAP is a combination of all the things that make distance learning effective and exciting: dedicated teachers and administrators; serious commitment from the state, a major university, and local employers; motivated students who understand the need for continuing their learning; and modern telecommunications, broadcast, and computer technologies. Access to education for all segments of Mississippi's population is the short-term goal. Long-term goals include improvement of the state's economic development&#151;not to mention more of those &#147;ah-ha!&#148; moments.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="/journal/bios/hmehlinger.htm">Howard D. Mehlinger</A></H3>
<HR>

<P>After decades of efforts to reform schools, it has become obvious to many that piecemeal reforms make little impact. The main problem is that our schools, which were once the envy of other nations, no longer serve us as well as in the past. The changes required are deep and fundamental.</P>

<P>Technology can be the catalyst for considering wholesale change in schooling. Nearly everyone understands that to use technology effectively requires planning, teacher training, and technical support. As part of the process of planning for technology implementation, educators can ask each other such questions as: How can we teach more effectively using technology? What changes shall we make in our courses to take advantage of technology? Can we assess student work better if we use technology? Making technology the focus of the dialogue can remove the threat to established interests while providing an occasion to reconsider all of the ways that schools do their work.</P>

<P>Our purpose should not be to see how much technology we can pack into classrooms. Our primary goal should be to help schools become places where students learn more effectively, and our secondary goal&#151;related to and probably necessary for the first&#151;is to make schools more interesting and rewarding places to work so that talented adults will become and remain teachers.</P>

<P>The principal advantage for adopting technology in schools is that it can provide the spark for reenergizing teachers, for prompting educators to envision new ways to teach, and for creating the kinds of schools needed now.</P>

<P>These are the reform ideas that schools should embrace:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>A recognition that all children can and do learn; that most children can perform at higher levels of achievement than they do today; that children vary greatly in their readiness to learn, in what they need and want to learn, and in the ways they learn best; and that schools must increasingly customize instruction, thereby enabling each child to learn to the best of his or her ability.</P></LI>

<LI><P>A commitment to make schools more interesting and challenging institutions for learning, where students take greater responsibility for their own education, and where instruction is more interactive, more collaborative, and more closely tied to authentic life experience than is currently the rule.</P></LI>

<LI><P>A belief that schools must become more accountable to the public for their work and that with accountability comes the necessity to allow individual schools and school districts greater flexibility in how instruction will be provided.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Acceptance that student and teacher assessments should become performance based and not rest solely upon degree attainment, experience, or time spent in courses.</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>While additional ideas could be added, these elements are widely accepted as the core of the current reform movement. Technology can&#151;and already does in some schools&#151;contribute to the success of each of these core elements.</P>

<P><B>Four Possible Scenarios for the Future of Schools</B></P>

<P>What is likely to happen with regard to school reform? Will technology actually transform schools? No one knows for certain, but the following four brief scenarios provide credible predictions. Which future we get depends mainly upon us.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Scenario No. 1: School's Out</B></P>
<P>I have named this scenario after the title of a book written by Lewis Perelman. According to Perelman, &#147;Computer-based instruction produces at least 30 percent more learning in 40 percent less time at 30 percent less cost, compared with traditional classroom teaching.&#148; In his view, schools have been slow to take advantage of technology because they are interested primarily in saving the jobs of educators.</P>

<P>Perelman believes schools are obsolete. While the public has not yet awakened to this fact, he professes, when they do, they will abandon the public schools.</P>

<P>Perelman uses the term hyperlearning to stand for all of the existing technology that enables students to learn on their own. In Perelman's view, such technology will soon prove so attractive to students and parents that they will withdraw students from public schools and allow them to work at home or enroll in alternative institutions.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Scenario No. 2: The Tortoise Wins the Race</B></P>
<P>We know the fable about the rabbit and the tortoise. The rabbit is faster and looks better running, but is easily distracted. The tortoise stays the course, trudges along, and eventually wins. Reformers are like rabbits: they dazzle us with their ideas, but they are easily bored, and they soon move on to new projects when their ideas are not rapidly adopted. Schools are like tortoises. They may change slowly, but they make progress. Outsiders may criticize them, or even force them to change in a particular direction, but left again on their own, the turtles proceed on their own path at a comfortable pace.</P>

<P>In this scenario, schools will add technology as they can afford it, but the funds provided will be too small to make a major difference in how schools do their work. The technology will be used variously, conforming largely to individual teacher's interests and ability&#151;as is the case today. In short, five to ten years from now, schools will be very similar to the schools we have today, except that there will be a greater use of technology.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Scenario No. 3: The Revolution Has Arrived!</B></P>
<P>It is possible that the American public will decide that American schools are their most precious public asset and that they have been neglected far too long. By public demand, both state and national legislators will appropriate funds that will modernize school buildings across the nation, equipping nearly all to the level only enjoyed by magnet or model technology schools today. Teachers and staff will be given all of the training required to take advantage of the technology, and the schools will have sufficient funds to employ the technical staff to maintain the technology.</P>

<P>The results will be spectacular. American schools will become the strongest institutions in American society. The brightest college students will become teachers; the schools will become learning centers for each community and be open from early in the morning to late at night, 12 months of the year, serving the learning needs of young and old alike. Students will work hard, enjoy school, and beat all comers in international academic competition. Ninety-eight percent of our youth will graduate from high school; 60 percent will begin and 40 percent will complete four years of college. And those who do not attend college will find high-salaried, high-skill jobs.</P>

<P>Does this sound like a dream? Some parts may seem farfetched, but much of this scenario could be accomplished if there were sufficient will and persistence. For example, technology can make schools more interesting, challenging, and rewarding places for both students and teachers. What is required is a vision of what public schools might become, coupled with a commitment and a plan to make it happen.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>Scenario No. 4: The Market Prevails</B></P>
<P>It is 2005, and a majority of Americans have become so impatient with the tortoise-like pace of change in public schools that they have turned to their state legislatures for relief. The legislatures and courts have agreed that public money can be used for educational vouchers, allowing parents and students to spend public funds on whatever schooling they want; the courts have decided there can no longer be a public monopoly for public education.</P>

<P>Private schools have opened in modern new buildings or fully renovated former public school buildings. They fill their buildings with modern technology, employ some of the best former public school teachers of each city at twice their former salaries, and round out the teaching force with unlicensed college graduates, teachers-in-training, and volunteers. The schools open early and close late to accommodate parents. The state pays three-fourths of the tuition; the parents pay the remaining fourth.</P>

<P>Although some public schools continue to exist, they serve mainly those who remain out of loyalty or because of extracurricular programs not provided in private schools, or because they have no other choice. Most legislators send their children to the new, private academies that have proven profitable. Legislators expect public schools to live within the same allocation of funds provided on a per-student basis to the private schools.</P></LI>

<P><B>And the Winner Is&#133;</B></P>

<P>While I think any of the four scenarios is possible&#151;and while I want the revolution to succeed&#151;if
forced to bet, I would put my money on Scenario No. 2, the tortoise. It is not that No. 3, the revolution, is beyond reach; I simply do not believe that the public is ready to invest the money required for reform to succeed. We have seen what can be done when schools undertake reform assisted by technology, but nearly all of the successful schools have been awarded special funds to support their unusual activity. There is little likelihood that similar investments will be made in all schools.</P>

<P>Scenario No. 1, School's Out, seems unrealistic to me, not because technology is incapable of satisfying Perelman's vision, but because most students want to go to school (they want to be with other children their age), and most parents do not want their children at home. They want them at school, especially if they believe the schools are safe and are truly interested in their children.</P>

<P>Scenario No. 4, private schools with public funds, is likely if the current school reform proves unsuccessful and if sentiment grows for a radical alternative. Perhaps one-half or more American families could afford a private education for their children, if public funds were used to pay three-fourths of the cost, and most of the students who attended the private schools would likely prefer them to any of the public schools still available. It is difficult to imagine that the public schools could recover from a policy of public support to private education.</P>

<P><B>Some Advice to Those Who Can Influence School Reform</B></P>

<P>To those who are able to influence the success of the current school reform movement and who agree with me that strengthening the appropriate use of technology in schools is the key to successful reform, I offer the following few simple words of advice.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>To School Boards:</B> Before appropriating any money for technology, the school board should insist that the staff present the board with a strategic plan for how they propose to implement the technology. A plan that merely lists equipment and how it will be used is not adequate. A good plan will begin with a vision about what the schools should become over time; it should set forth the staff's goals for curriculum, instruction, and staffing. The plan should contain implementation procedures with benchmarks for each stage of development. While the board may wish to amend or alter the plan somewhat before it is finally approved, the plan ought to provide evidence that there is sufficient commitment and understanding by the staff to justify the expenditures.</P>

<P>In return for a well-developed plan, the board should be as generous as it can be in allowing time for the changes to occur and in providing funds for staff training, technical support, external consultants, software, and hardware. One rule of thumb is to set aside three percent of the total school budget, or 15 percent of the technology budget, for staff training. If possible, the board should provide enough computers so that each teacher can have one at home as well as at school. Because teachers do much of their work at home outside of school hours, if they are to utilize technology fully, they need the equipment when and where they are going to work.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>To School Administrators:</B> Both superintendents and principals need to plan carefully how they will introduce technology into their schools and/or build upon prior acquisitions. The pace of research and development is very rapid, making last year's purchases seem quickly out-of-date. It is therefore sometimes tempting to resist implementing technology until R&D stops or at least slows its pace. Unfortunately, this is not likely to happen in our lifetime; schools must begin to implement technology now, while recognizing that they will have to continue to add to and build upon their choices during the years ahead. Only in the most unusual circumstances is it possible to supply the technology requirements of all schools and all teachers at the same time.</P>

<P>Administrators should move as quickly as possible toward using technology for administrative tasks, such as using e-mail to communicate, televising school board meetings over local access cable channels, connecting the schools to community service agencies electronically, and making certain that libraries are equipped for conducting research and accessing electronic databases.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>To Teachers:</B> Teachers must have the primary voice in what technology should be purchased. Teachers must be clear about what they wish to accomplish with their students and not be put off by vendor statements that what they want cannot be done.</P>

<P>The hardware decision is not the most important question confronting teachers. Instructional questions are more important; hardware and software decisions should follow decisions about what to teach and how to teach.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>To Federal and State Governments:</B> Both the national and state governments can contribute in important ways&#151;not only by the usual methods of subsidizing school renovations, providing funds for equipment, and supporting professional training for teachers, but also by using regulatory authority to make certain that schools are served well. Many of the telecommunications companies are urging changes in laws and regulations that will enable them to broaden services to customers and enhance their profits. Both federal and state governments must make certain that the rules are written in ways that ensure schools are treated fairly and can obtain services at prices they can afford. Changes in laws concerning copyright protection should also be undertaken with the interests of schools in mind. States can rewrite rules so that capital funds can
be used for equipment purchases and textbook funds for computer software.</P>

<P>Governments must also attend to equity issues resulting from technology use in school. While some schools have bought new equipment using special funds targeted to serve poor children, they lack funds to repair that equipment. The equity problem cannot be solved by a single school district; it must be addressed at the level of state and national governments.</P>

<P>The federal government can be a source for research and development support. The states can provide funds that give schools access to the Internet and/or commercial online services. They can also provide incentives for linking the use of technology with school reform measures through subsidizing professional development opportunities for teachers.</P></LI>

<LI><P><B>To Universities:</B> Universities should attend to their teacher education programs to make certain that they are providing the technology-capable teacher graduates that schools want to hire. Universities can also begin to make available professional development training by means of distance-learning technology.</P>

<P>Universities ought to be sites for research and development relating to the use of technology in school reform. Universities can also form partnerships with schools to study the process of change that takes place with the introduction and use of technology.</P></LI> 

<LI><P><B>To Foundations:</B> While large, private foundations have been very active in school reform
efforts generally, they have contributed little to the efforts to employ technology for school reform. While it is understandable why foundations want to avoid being drawn into funding the purchase of equipment, they could support other activities, such as technology planning, professional development, and research on the effects of technology use in schools. Foundations might also sponsor technology fairs, bringing teachers and students together across a state or region to celebrate student accomplishments.</P></LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>It is difficult to imagine conditions more favorable to school reform than those that exist at the present time. Business and government leaders seem intent on maintaining pressure on schools to reform. Teachers, students, parents, and administrators also want change, although not necessarily the same changes desired by business and government.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most important factor favoring school reform is the impact Information Age technology is having on all aspects of our culture. To use technology to promote school reform is like flying with a tailwind. Technology can ensure success in school reform. We have only to take advantage of it. </P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Interview with Deborah W. Meier</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>Adapted By Rhonda L. Rieseberg</H3>
<HR>

<I><STRONG><P><IMG SRC="/journal/bios/dmeier.gif" align=left hspace=10>Deborah Meier has spent several decades working in public education as a teacher, writer, and public advocate. She was the founder and teacher-director of a network of public elementary schools in East Harlem; the co-director and principal of Central Park East Secondary School; and the director of a new initiative to redesign several large failing high schools. She is also currently a Senior Annenberg Fellow for the <A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2meier.htm">New York Networks for School Renewal</A>, a project to redesign the systemic supports that might encourage all New York City schools to be &#147;Break the Mold&#148; schools on the cutting edge of reform. This interview is adapted from Meier's remarks during a 1995 conversation with Phillip Harris, director of the Center for Professional Development for Phi Delta Kappa (PDK), as part of</I></STRONG><B> Education Under Fire, </B><STRONG><I>a professional development video series produced jointly by the Agency for Instructional Technology and PDK.</STRONG></I></P>
<BR>
<P><B><I>What caused you to start Central Park East Elementary School?</I></B></P>

<P>A number of the founders were parents, and we consciously brought that dual perspective to the school. I know most teachers are parents, but it's often true that they forget to think about the parent part of themselves when they're in school. I had stopped going to parent-family conferences because I found that if my kid was doing well in school I went because it was nice to hear flattering remarks. I had one kid who was not doing well in school, and I left the parent-teacher conference in frustrated tears because the school was not helping me think about how I could help make that school experience a better one for my son. I was intimidated by
school people. I was afraid to complain because I was afraid they would decide I was a troublemaker.</P>

<P>I've spent time thinking about all the ways in which well-intentioned teachers who feel powerless put parents down. Instead of the two forces coming together in affection around the child, we come together in battle around the child. This is especially true for the children who need it most. They get caught between two antagonistic forces. Instead, both sides should be saying, &#147;Listen, it's not easy raising kids. Let's think this over together.&#148;</P>

<P><B><I>Which approach did you use in creating Central Park East?</I></B></P>

<P>Everything is talked about in Central Park East. Race, class, Shakespeare, the meaning of life, how we write, how we live, how we talk, how we dress. It's a place that takes seriously the ideas of kids, the ideas of their parents, and the ideas of the larger world around them. It's an intellectually exciting community, and that's what kids need: a learning environment created by adults who are living the kind of intellectual life we want kids to live. We want to introduce kids to the complexity and excitement of ideas.</P>

<P><B><I>What are the characteristics of the Central Park way?</I></B></P>

<P>The assumption of mutual respect for the youngest child, for the parents, and for my fellow colleagues. The most striking thing to me about bad schools is how disrespectful they are to people in them. In many schools, teachers are not consulted about important things. It's assumed they don't have a voice, aren't able to make decisions. Teachers aren't given time for planning, organization, and structure. The way we treat the grown-ups in school immediately says we don't respect them. We don't respect most principals. In fact, in New York City principals are not assumed to be thinkers or people who are making important decisions. They are assumed to be people who are mindlessly carrying out decisions made elsewhere.</P>

<P><B><I>How have you been able to sustain that program?</I></B></P>

<P>It's an interesting place&#151;adults like to be there. We also have relationships with adults throughout
the country who invigorate us with new ideas. Someone says, &#147;Listen, I have another way I've thought about doing that.&#148; These are just good communities to be in&#151;communities that provoke you, communities in which you always think, &#147;Tomorrow I'm going to find the answer to that problem.&#148; Someone comes in with another book to read, and someone else has a suggestion.</P>

<P>It's a place full of enthusiasm, full of music, full of art. When I'm feeling discouraged, I go downstairs and listen to the kids sing. We have a marvelous violin program and a marvelous choral program. I walk into a classroom and I'm reconnected with the possibilities of what all children could have if we had the will to do it.</P>

<P>We haven't prescreened our kids, and the teachers are not extraordinary human beings. I think they are extraordinary, but there's nothing in their history that tells us they should be. The school has helped make us all extraordinary. It's an extraordinary place, and every place can be extraordinary. We should not be satisfied with any school that we would call ordinary. We wouldn't want our kids to attend schools that are only ordinary. Now, the question is how can we create schools in which all its participants say, &#147;This place is not ordinary. This is something we created, we designed. And if it has a fault, we can change it tomorrow&#148;?</P>

<P>A school where grown-ups are thinking that way teaches kids something about how they can change things. If we want kids to become thoughtful citizens, we have to immerse them in an environment of thoughtful citizens.</P>

<P><B><I>What do you see as the purpose of public education?</I></B></P>

<P>I think it's to help kids grow up to be the kind of citizens and human beings we want them to be&#151;to create the kind of America that we want. From my viewpoint, that means a strong democratic society filled with citizens who know how to think, who aren't easily conned, who care about each other, who know how to act upon their convictions, and who know how to sift evidence. I think that makes them not only strong citizens, but good and productive employees as well. But it doesn't matter to me whether they're good and productive employees if we haven't maintained a strong, vibrant democratic culture.</P>

<P><B><I>What are the consequences of failing to support public education to its fullest?</I></B></P>

<P>I hate to sound alarmist, because we've survived other alarms. But I think democratic culture and the notion of democracy is in grave peril in America today. I think in some weird way, the triumph of democracy over communism and fascism in my lifetime has led us to treasure it less. It's an inexplicable phenomenon to me&#151;why we don't feel more strongly about democratic life.</P>

<P>Democratic life requires a well-educated citizenry. I think the original purpose of public education was to create an informed citizenry. The difficult decisions we have to make in society require intellectual sophistication, skepticism, and the ability to ask questions and to really consider a wide range of evidence. We're not equipped to do this, and we don't think our fellow citizens are equipped to do this either. That puts us at the mercy of whoever can initiate the latest advertising fad and whoever has the most money. That's scary.</P>

<P><B><I>In a recent article in the</I> Phi Delta Kappan, <I>you said that you see educators poised between two
alternative visions of the schools of tomorrow. What are these visions?</I></B></P>

<P>One is giving up on the idea that we can create schools we believe in, that we have to turn to somebody else to do it. We just carry the mantle. The other vision is reclaiming the schools and public education and saying, &#147;We have to figure out what they're for and then we have to make the school the center of serious intellectual and moral life for a community.&#148; That means that all of us have to participate because schools are where we make decisions about the future of America.</P>

<P><B><I>What do you say to parents who bring their children to your school and ask that you determine
what their children need to know?</I></B></P>

<P>I want to talk to parents about what kind of persons they want their kids to grow up to be. What did they value about their own education? What didn't they value? We often sit with parents and kids and talk about the parents' education because that's a way of thinking about what we might do differently for their children.</P>

<P>The school has an impact on the life of parents because they join us in this discussion of what's important. It's not a narrow discussion about what they want their kids to know&#151;a discussion that tends to divide us more than the discussion about what we would like our kids to become.</P>

<P><B><I>You suggest that schools should be membership organizations of membership communities and
not service organizations.</I></B></P>

<P>When you come to an institution as a consumer you ask, &#147;What are you going to do for me?&#148; When you join it as a member you say, &#147;What are we going to do for each other, and what are my responsibilities to this community?&#148;</P>

<P>I don't want kids to come to school as consumers, buy something called education, and then sit back and say, &#147;Well, it's your job to educate me, and it's my job to judge whether you succeeded. So start educating me.&#148; They're joining a membership community. </P>

<P>Now kids and families don't belong to as many membership communities as they once did, which is one reason why it's even more important for schools to be such communities. Lots of kids have no idea what we mean by being a member of a community and having a responsibility to each other. But you can't be responsible for an anonymous institution that you can't influence and that doesn't involve your family. We have to have schools that are small enough and accessible enough to kids, families, and teachers so we can imagine that we all belong to the same community and that we're going to explore it together. It's a quality of mutual respect that you can feel in a good school and that you can't feel in what I'd call a bad school.</P>

<P><B><I>How do you get parents and students to begin to think about being members of the organization
rather than consumers?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, you treat them that way. We make the school open. There are acts that tell parents whether the school is a community. Do they have to get permission to come in? When I first started teaching in Chicago, one of the early messages to parents and kids was sent by the school's front door, the dividing line at which the kid goes in but the parent doesn't follow. Rather than assuming that we're raising kids together, school personnel viewed parents in the school as spies. The feeling that this is a shared task is most absent in schools where disadvantaged, poor, and alienated families send their children. It's less likely to be true of middle class schools.</P>

<P><B><I>Of the elementary and secondary schools, has one been more effective than the other?</I></B></P>

<P>I'm more amazed at how effective a secondary school can be. I would have said earlier that if you don't catch them young, you can't do anything. The elementary school has been extraordinarily effective. The success rate of the kids who left our elementary school was staggering, even when we didn't have a high school to follow it. Ninety-six percent of them graduated from high school, and two-thirds of them went on to college.</P>

<P>But we took a lot of kids into our secondary schools who didn't come from the elementary school, and we've now started many other high schools all over the city. I'm impressed with what a good experience can do for kids no matter what their age. We have kids coming to secondary schools who've had eight, nine years of really bad education, who have developed a lot of bad habits. Being in a strong and powerful environment where adults, families, teachers, and kids work closely together has a transformative impact.</P>

<P>Schools can make a difference in kids' lives even in a short period of time. After all, kids only spend five or six hours a day in school half the year. But a school can be a very powerful community for kids partly because it's sometimes the only community they belong to. We all long to be members, to be someplace where we are respected and where we count. And when a school meets that need it taps into reserves of potential that kids have that amaze even me. So in that sense, the high school is more amazing to me.</P>

<P><B><I>What were some of the factors that helped create those successful school settings?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, it was a simple message in the high school. By the time we started at that level, we knew a lot about what worked with young children and it turned out that what works with young children works with older children, and what works with older children works with grown-ups.</P>

<P>The same things that help make teachers feel respected in school are the same things that help make kids feel respected in school. First, you create communities small enough so that we can all know each other well. You don't spend all your time trying to negotiate a system. The system we set up is simple, easy to manage, and then you can focus on what is complicated: the ideas that you're trying to get kids and teachers to think about. If you want to allow those ideas to remain complicated and exciting, you've got to simplify the business part of schooling.</P>

<P>A small school can do that better than a big school. Everybody needs to know each other. In a good school, the staff should be able to sit around a table not much bigger than this and talk things out in a way that allows everyone a chance to speak. Half the people shouldn't be marking homework while a few do all the talking.</P>

<P>The same thing needs to be true inside the classroom. A class needs to be small enough so that you can talk things through and get to know what's behind someone's ideas. So when a kid gives you a stupid answer, you can catch yourself before you label it stupid and think, &#147;I wonder what lies behind that. What is that kid's picture of the world that makes him say something that seems on the surface so wrong?&#148; That's a sign of respect. Labeling other people's ideas as stupid is a sign of disrespect. And schools are filled, normally, with people who feel that they're being judged stupid.</P>

<P><B><I>You've said that the approach you use looks at children in a way that is reminiscent of a good
kindergarten program.</I></B></P>

<P>If you came into our elementary school, you'd think that most of the classrooms were kindergarten classrooms until the kids walked in. Even after the kids walked in, you'd be struck by the fact that they're treated with the kind of respect we give kindergarten kids and rarely give kids again until they get to postgraduate school.</P>

<P>In kindergarten we assume that rooms should be filled with things that genuinely are interesting to human beings. We assume that kids have different interests. We assume that they need to share their interests with others as they go along&#151;they need to talk things over, to build things together. We assume that learning is not all talk, but that it also involves creating. We assume that the kids are doing most of the talking and most of the work. Then they hit first grade, and we just forget that that is the natural way that human beings learn and always have learned.</P>

<P>The kindergarten way of learning is, in fact, the natural, most efficient way for kids to learn. It's the way we learn everything else&#151;to play baseball, play violin, drive a car, walk, and talk, and it's the way people usually raise their children. They immerse them in genuine activity and then talk to them, discuss things with them, correct them, and give them feedback.</P>

<P><B><I>You've said in</I> The Power of Their Ideas<I> [Beacon Press, 1995] that a culture of anonymity
permeates children's lives. What do you mean by this?</I></B></P>

<P>A student is only a number in too many of our schools. The average teacher in a high school sees 150 kids every semester and frequently sees a different 150 the next semester. There's a small number of kids in a school who are well-known&#151;the troublemakers and the academically talented&#151;but the rest are unknown. By the time they graduate from high school, if they do, no one knows them well enough to write a letter of reference for them.</P>

<P>There aren't many places kids can go after school where they're known. They hang around the street where they're largely anonymous. Sometimes they join a gang so they belong somewhere. It's not the kind of belonging that I'm longing for for them. Their lives are divorced from adult influences; they belong to no communities. The vast majority of American kids grow up today belonging to no adult community outside of their families that knows them by name, that cares about them, that is attending to them. That can't be good for any kind of America, much less a democratic one.</P>

<P><B><I>What can teachers and administrators do?</I></B></P>

<P>They can begin by answering the simplest questions: Is this a place where people can know and respect each other? What are the signs that we know and respect each other in this place? What signals do we send out? Would we want our kids here? Would we feel respected as parents here? Those are the first-line questions.</P>

<P>Then we need to ask other questions: Do we respect people? Do we assume that they have ideas, and do we take them seriously? If a kid says, &#147;I don't know,&#148; do we say, &#147;Isn't that magnificent that this kid is capable of knowing what he doesn't know?&#148; When someone comes up with an idea, do we stop and say, &#147;Wait a minute. Let me listen to that&#148;? Do we treat each other as though we're possessors of wonderful ideas? Do we acknowledge each other as talented people whose ideas we want to understand?</P>

<P><B><I>What advice would you give to teachers and administrators who are interested in creating that kind of school?</I></B></P>

<P>You can't get kids excited and passionate about ideas with adults who are not themselves passionate about ideas. It's the heart of what we talk about in school: the intellectual life of that school sustains it year after year. It can be done. You can take any school and ask, &#147;What would we do if we were starting all over again?&#148; Then start all over again. You may have to do it gradually, but we're capable of reinventing schools. There's nothing that prevents us from doing it other than our will to do it and the political environment that allows us to do it.</P>

<P><B><I>Are you hopeful?</I></B></P>

<P>Some days more so than others. If parents and teachers don't see themselves as allies around change, as the experts, then other experts who don't know our kids well and who don't understand schools well will try to solve this problem for us.</P>

<P>Above all, teachers have to find their voice and use it. The most important thing is that they begin to think through issues, read, and use their voice. Someone once said that teaching is a nonreading profession. Teachers don't even read in their own field because there never seemed to be any point in reading it when somebody else was going to make the decisions. Well, we have to start reading it, we have to start talking about it, and we have to insist that our voice is part of the discussion about the future of American education.</P>

<BR>

<P>In <I>Hamlet</I>, Shakespeare writes, &#147;What a piece of work is a man!&#148; Marva Collins, a recognized leader in education reform declares, &#147;What a piece of work is a child!&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;I believe, like Pygmalion, I have the ability to sculpt my students into what I would like them to be,&#148; says Collins. &#147;What a glorious and wonderful challenge! When I see the hesitant, problem students enter our school declaring to all: &#145;Teach me if you dare,&#146; I think to myself&#151;&#145;Child, what joy awaits you!&#146; This student does not become a problem, but a challenge. My challenge is to show this child that his days of darkness, failure, and lowered self-esteem are now over. It now becomes my chance to show this child that somewhere there is someone who cared enough to keep polishing until a luster came shining through.&#148;</P>

<P><B>A Teacher's Odyssey</B></P>

<P>For 35 years, Collins has been sculpting, polishing her pupils&#151;many of whom are thought to be &#147;unteachable&#148; and &#147;unreachable&#148; by teachers or parents&#151;into eager learners and high achievers. She has accomplished this admirable feat by applying a &#147;back-to-basics&#148; teaching method in open classrooms where students are grouped according to levels of achievement, rather than age.</P>

<P>Collins began her teaching odyssey in the Chicago public school system. &#147;When I worked in Chicago public schools,&#148; she recalls, &#147;I often heard teachers say, &#145;I am so sick of these children.&#146; When one takes this kind of attitude, it, of course, rubs off on the children. If [teachers] are not excited about what we do, children can sense this.&#148;</P>

<P>In 1975, after 14 years of service in Chicago's schools, Collins was so dismayed with the teaching methods and teachers' attitudes that she started her own school, Westside Preparatory School. She opened it in her home with $5,000 from her pension fund and only six students, including two of her own three children. Westside now has 120 students in grades K&#150;8, five full-time teachers, and several assistants.</P>

<P>Collins has since opened two more schools. In October 1990, a second school was opened in the Cincinnati area. Now in its third year, Marva Collins Preparatory School in Silverton, Ohio, has more than doubled its enrollment (from 43 to 116), tripled its teaching staff (from two to six teachers), and added seventh- and eighth-grade instruction and a science lab (provided through a grant from the Jergens Foundation) to its original preschool through sixth-grade program. The school, which has outgrown its temporary housing in Olivet Baptist Church, has an aggressive goal of raising $500,000 to buy a permanent home.</P>

<P>In January 1992, Collins' third school was opened on Chicago's south side. There are three classes for a maximum of 100 students at the elementary level and 20 ninth-grade students at Marva Collins Preparatory School. There are plans to open a fourth school in the University Park area of Chicago.</P>

<P><B>Basics vs. &#145;Frills&#146;</B></P>

<P>Visitors to these schools are awed by first graders learning the metric system and geometry; second graders involved in astronomy; fourth graders reading flight schedules; fifth graders studying Latin; and sixth graders reading Nietzsche, Voltaire, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy. Reading is one of the basics in Collins' approach.</P>

<P>&#147;Children today do not know what continent they live on and cannot name the five Great Lakes because we gave them more and more pictures in their textbooks and less text,&#148; she says. &#147;In other words, we have been labeled educationally &#145;A Nation At Risk&#146; with 23 million illiterates and 35 million functional illiterates, and two million illiterates added to this dismal figure each year.&#148;</P>

<P>For that reason, Collins is strict about computer use in the classroom. Only those students who have mastered their basic skills are exposed to computer technology. Although Westside has several computers donated by IBM for office and classroom use, Collins contends, &#147;On the kind of budget we have, and with our philosophy, we do not need what might be called &#145;teaching frills&#146;&#151;things like film projectors, teaching machines, calculators for the children, and the like. We deal in the basics.&#148; That includes helping the students develop communication and problem-solving skills.</P>

<P>Though children are exposed to technology (a biology software program is used with four- and five-year-olds, for instance), it is secondary to other lessons. &#147;I think what most of us fail to understand is there are steps in life,&#148; Collins explains. &#147;We try to teach children that you cannot skip from step 1 to step 10. If children can't think, read, write, and compute, they cannot adapt technologically. It is just plain common sense.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;Computers are tools to be used in the pursuit of knowledge and the processing of information. Nothing more, nothing less. If children have the wrong map of life, all of the technological skills in the world won't do them any good. Computer skills do not guarantee one a job. For instance, if you can't get to work on time, you aren't going to stay there anyway, even if you are very good at what you do. And I think that's where we have been misled.&#148;</P>

<P>According to recent data, schools in economically disadvantaged areas or with majority African-American student enrollment have fewer computers than other schools, which means these students are unlikely to have any meaningful training in computer skills. Although Collins admits students benefit from any and all exposure to advanced technology, she maintains that exposure without adequate instruction and basic curriculum is meaningless. &#147;First of all, I think children should know how to spell &#145;computer&#146;,&#148; she says. &#147;They need to realize that somebody literate knew how to program that computer.&#148;</P>

<P>Collins is convinced that the trend toward moving students into more and more technologically advanced instruction also can do more harm than good. &#147;If we have an illiterate population, we constantly become users, but we can't be creators,&#148; she explains. &#147;If we can't create, we can't distribute. And if we cannot distribute, we are not going to be fulfilled. That's what's so ironic. I think that's why a lot of major companies are struggling. Much of the work force is illiterate or functionally illiterate. How can [America] expect to keep up in a technologically advanced arena without being able to read?&#148;</P>

<P>In addition, Collins thinks that more emphasis on moral values and less on computers and other &#147;teaching frills&#148; in the classroom more likely will help students adapt and be successful in the real world. In a column published in the June 18, 1990 issue of the <I>Cincinnati Enquirer</I>, Collins calls for &#147;a return to moral values&#148; to regain and strengthen the integrity of education in America. She states, &#147;There was a time in American schools when virtue occupied center stage&#133;.The large objective of schools was to train the moral character and nourish the souls of the students&#133;. Our textbooks and curricula allowed our children to develop their own feelings, their own ideas, their own morality.&#148;</P>

<P>In her article, Collins calls for a return to the use of syllogistic reasoning, which has all but been eliminated in U.S. schools. She believes that educated people can solve problems through their &#147;perceptive, intelligent, sensitive responses&#148;&#151;and thus help their communities and the world become peaceful places. In fact, she says the goal of world peace &#147;is perhaps the most important and least acknowledged goal of education.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Breaking The Cycle</B></P>

<P>More important than what Collins teaches and why, is <I>how</I> she teaches. Again, her philosophy is simple and direct&#151;a positive learning environment reaps positive results; therefore, positive reinforcement is the backbone of her teaching method. &#147;Our method is nothing less than the &#145;Three Rs&#146; mixed with a total program that teaches every child that he is unique, special, and bright and that we will not let him fail,&#148; says Collins. &#147;We have no monopoly on excellence. We simply do not buy into the idea that poor, inner-city children cannot achieve. We expect universal standards from our children. We teach them to read, write, compute, and to think critically and analytically.&#148;</P>

<P>Many of her students are from the inner-city and have economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Most have been problems for either their parents or their schools, usually both. Collins feels it's not the children who are poor students because of their situations, but it is poor teachers who are keeping these students from realizing their fullest potential. &#147;All across the country, poor teachers are screaming and yelling, and students are often screaming back or turning off. Good teachers have exciting classrooms where children are learning&#151;the same kind of ambience we have in our classrooms. Good teachers are always looking for answers to problems; poor teachers make excuses for why children aren't learning.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2collins.gif" align=left hspace=10><I>Marva Collins' philosophy is summed up in her promise to her students: &#147;I will not let you fail.&#148;</I></P>

<P>&#147;If teachers believe that children can't learn, those students, of course, will not learn. If teachers believe that the kind of home a student comes from has anything to do with what that child can achieve, then, of course, the curriculum becomes watered down and it becomes an impossible feat for the child to learn. I take the position that the more fetid a home environment might be, the harder a teacher must work to break that self-perpetuating cycle.&#148;</P>

<P>Collins' philosophy on breaking this cycle is the real key to her success with most students. By creating and reinforcing a totally positive learning environment, she manages to break down many of the barriers students carry with them that prevent them from learning. The words &#147;fail&#148; and &#147;can't&#148; are strictly forbidden in her schools' classrooms. &#147;I tell the teachers that if a student does not sit still, the teacher is responsible for finding out why. Maybe the &#145;oven is too hot&#146; and we need to make it more comfortable. Or, maybe we need to look at the way the teacher is presenting something. We will not accept failure; there is always a reason why a student is not succeeding.&#148;</P>

<P>Individual attention and positive reinforcement are the norm for every student. &#147;We always find something positive or complimentary to say to each child every morning,&#148; says Collins. &#147;This is just as important as a curriculum.&#148; She believes these methods are even more critical with her students because inner-city students traditionally have been the targets of harsh and unfair stereotypical labeling. They are considered troublemakers, with little ability or desire to learn. Collins sees in these children&#151;particularly black males&#151;what Michelangelo perceived in a piece of marble, &#147;an angel trying to get out.&#148; She says, &#147;There is a lot of toughness and tough talk on the street and in the school, but inside is a child who wants to be accepted, a child who wants to succeed.&#148;</P>

<P>Even students who are considered to be potential problems are treated with respect and challenged with the same high expectations as all other students. Rather than ignore these children as some teachers might, Collins will stand right behind a misbehaving child, place her hand on his or her shoulder, and speak directly to the child. &#147;Sometimes I will actually do their work for them, just to give them a taste of success,&#148; she adds. Collins also says the pressure to &#147;perform&#148; for peer acknowledgment and acceptance is deflated when there is no audience. In her schools, students are expected to continue their work as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred when a child misbehaves.</P>

<P><B>Parents and Teachers</B></P>

<P>Getting parents to take a more active role in the day-to-day education of their children is a universal problem in the education community, but it is a challenge Collins takes in stride. Parents of enrolled students are encouraged to be active partners in their children's education and are welcome as visitors and volunteers in the classroom. Collins also offers special classes and workshops to help parents adapt her teaching methods for home use.</P>

<P>&#147;Children are composites of their parents' habits,&#148; she says. &#147;We tend to ignore that children learn habits&#151;good and bad&#151;from their parents. That's why we try to work with parents, have classes and workshops. We encourage them to visit classes and volunteer their time. It doesn't do any good to teach a child one thing here, and then they go home and see something else there. Parents are encouraged by the positive affirmations they witness at the school. But getting parents to change their habits&#151;that is the biggest problem.&#148;</P>

<P>Adopting Collins' techniques at home may prove easier than translating some of her techniques and philosophies to the classroom. She relies heavily on Bible passages, and her students wear uniforms. Some teachers and administrators still are not convinced that the cure for what ails the American public school system can be found in the form of such a simple philosophy.  Collins believes there is a tendency to reject arbitrarily some methods of teaching, just because they are old-fashioned. &#147;The fact is, a teacher can combine both progressive and traditional approaches to learning, each enhancing the other,&#148; she says. &#147;There is no reason why a teacher can't be sensitive to a child's needs and at the same time teach the child subject matter and skills. That blend has always been the basis of Westside Preparatory School.&#148;</P>

<P>Even in teacher training, the emphasis is on the basics&#151;positive reinforcement and motivation. Collins has trained more than 7,000 teachers across the country in her teaching methods, many through a program started in 1991 in the state of Oklahoma. Twenty-five Oklahoma public schools were chosen from a pool of 65 applicants by a six-member state Department of Education committee. Eight of the schools were considered &#147;at-risk&#148; city schools, with student test scores in one or more grades in the bottom 25 percent on state-mandated achievement examinations. The schools participated in the pilot of an improvement program sponsored by Marva Collins and underwritten by a foundation established by Ponca City, Oklahoma, businessman Charles E. Hollar. The tuition for the program, called &#147;Prepping for Power,&#148; totaled $5,000 per enrolled teacher and was raised through private and corporate donations.</P>

<P>For three weeks, more than 300 teachers were invited to watch as 37 students ages 6 to 11 years were exposed to Collins' &#147;back-to-basics&#148; approach to teaching. Principals, administrators, and two teachers from each of the 25 schools took communications courses at Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma. Training continued in Chicago, where administrators had a two-day training session and teachers attended a five-day training session with Collins at Westside. The training program culminated in a conference held in Oklahoma. Throughout the training period, teachers had access to Collins via conference calls, individual consultations, videotapes, and written materials.</P>

<P>Jean Faulconer served as moderator of the opening session in Oklahoma. &#147;Host parents, some of whom had been away from parenting and homework for a few years, felt the assignments were too much, too hard. Again, it must be remembered these kids had arrived for &#145;Prepping for Power,&#146; not [for] summer camp and beadwork,&#148; Faulconer explains. &#147;To some, [Collins'] methodology may have appeared harsh&#151;over-stressing competition&#151;but no one faulted her philosophy. And the &#145;Prepping for Power&#146; three-week session must be kept in proper perspective. It was a specially funded, first-time, extended education laboratory meant to teach other teachers the techniques proven successful by the master teacher&#151;as well as awaken 37 children to a passion for learning.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Positives, Negatives</B></P>

<P>Through the years, Collins and her methods have been both praised and criticized. Despite features broadcast on several hundred radio and television programs&#151;including &#147;60 Minutes&#148; and &#147;Good Morning America&#148;&#151;and profiles published in national magazines like <I>Time, Life, Newsweek, Forbes, Ebony</I>, and <I>Essence</I> and in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, Collins has not been able to dodge the negative publicity that inevitably comes with being such a notable figure.</P>

<P>In the early 1980s, following the airing of <I>The Marva Collins Story</I>, a made-for-television drama, allegations began to surface that she had handpicked her students and had manipulated their test scores. Her personality was under attack. She was questioned about accepting CETA funds, though she was an outspoken critic of federal aid, and was even accused of playing into the hands of politicians who supported school funding cuts. The same newspapers that once had called her a &#147;super-teacher&#148; were asking her if she was a &#147;sinister woman.&#148;</P>

<P><I>The Wall Street Journal</I> saw the controversy surrounding Collins as &#147;a story about the politics of education in this country, especially education in the inner city, where the public schools have failed miserably. Mrs. Collins' private success invited reaction because it became a reproach to that failure.&#148; The criticism&#151;which came primarily from Chicago public school teachers, a few disgruntled parents, and one former Westside Preparatory teacher&#151;lasted only a few weeks. Collins has never altered her path or philosophy because of it.</P>

<P>Even today, some teachers find her an inspirational model, while others question her motives and methods. Perhaps Civia Tamarkin, co-author with Collins of <I>Marva Collins' Way</I>, states it best: &#147;For all their attempts to tear down Marva's image, her critics had never once questioned her commitment to teaching. And it was only through that commitment that she cared to be judged.&#148; In an interview with <I>The New York Times</I>, Collins replies to her critics, &#147;I've never said I was a super-teacher, a miracle worker, all those names they gave me. It's unfair to expect me to live up to it. I'm just a teacher.&#148;</P>

<P>As Tamarkin found in the year she spent observing the controversial educator, the 1957 graduate of Clark College is &#147;neither an academic, a scholar, nor the perfect grammarian.&#148; She is a teacher&#151;all the time, not just in the classroom. Tamarkin also discovered that the single-mindedness of purpose and method some consider obsessive and self-centered actually endears students and neighborhood children to Collins. &#147;They saw it as a sign of her implacable devotion to them,&#148; Tamarkin explains.</P>

<P>In the book's prologue, Tamarkin writes that meeting Marva reminded her of something told to her by Dr. Ralph Tyler, a former dean of social sciences at the University of Chicago: &#147;Teaching is not just a job. It is a human service, and it must be thought of as a mission.&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;The one thing that can never be disputed,&#148; Tamarkin declares, &#147;is that Marva Collins motivates children and makes them want to learn and achieve.&#148; That is a worthy mission for any educator.</P>

<P><B><I>Futurists are professional visionaries who identify and examine today's emerging forces and trends and project their impact on the future.  Their job is not to predict the future, but rather to make us aware of possible futures and to help us determine which are probable.  While pointing out the pitfalls we may encounter, they spur us to work toward creating the future we desire.  In recent discussions with futurists Clement Bezold, Wallace Hannum, Joel Lapin, and Nancy Risser, Marilyn Norris&#151;herself a futurist&#151;heard of their visions of learning in the 21st century.*  She relates those visions here, along with the hurdles that must be overcome and the critical issues that must be addressed.</I></B></P>

<H4>The Vision</H4>
<P>Envision this: The year 2010, a Saturday afternoon in mid-July, in a shopping mall. People of all ages, from 5 to 85, sit side by side, accessing information from a bank of computers situated between a bookstore and a clothing outlet. An image flashes on each screen&#151;one graphic, one animated, one motion video, one still image. A myriad of sounds is heard, as each intelligent terminal responds to the learner's commands. School&#151;learning, rather&#151;is happening in the mall of the future, where knowledge is a prized commodity and it's available to anyone, at any time.</P>

<P>In the 21st century, we'll have learning networks that link intelligent terminals and multimedia devices in homes, public and private schools and universities, corporate settings, libraries, and community centers. Hospitals, churches, public buildings, shopping malls, even prisons will serve as learning sites. The list will be limited only by our creativity in identifying where potential learners are and where they would like to access the learning network.</P>

<P>Learning will be available to every person who wants to learn. Because it will no longer be delivered in person, learning will be decentralized and will occur wherever the learner happens to be and whenever the learner requests it. Learning will be individualized and interactive, learner activated and controlled; it will be a lifelong endeavor.</P>

<P>Think of it: Dramatic improvements in learning and problem solving will be possible as learners have access to interactive multimedia resources, such as cross-referenced audiovisual dictionaries and encyclopedias with unlimited retrieval capabilities. These resources will enhance motivation, individualization, cooperative learning, and parental involvement.</P>

<P>New forms of child-oriented, interactive, and participatory multimedia learning resources will be available over cable and telephone lines as new communications capabilities and networks are put into place. Learners of all ages will have access to interactive video, on-line databases, and other such materials in their homes as well as in schools. Educational programming on cable television will expand.</P>

<P>Sophisticated computer software will customize learning material to take into account the learner's prior knowledge, cognitive strengths, interests, and cultural backgrounds. Technologies of the future will allow learners to master higher levels of content and to do it more quickly. People no longer will be satisfied with average levels of accomplishment; a certain percentage of failures will be unthinkable.</P>

<P>In the workplace of the next century, lines between work and learning, between real life and lessons, will fade. Local area networks, electronic interfaces, and high-speed computers will allow learning to be an ongoing process, with the learner moving in and out of the educational mode as needed or desired. Retraining&#151;today's term for tomorrow's lifelong learning model&#151;will be thought of as just another phase in professional development. As learners set their own pace, their learning will become more efficient and effective.</P>

<P>In the next millennium, we will change our focus from how long people spend at learning&#151;how many hours per credit, for example, or how many days per semester&#151;to the results&#151;what they can do, what they know, how their skills have improved. Rote learning and memorization will be emphasized less, and the skills of information access, critical thinking, problem solving, and learning how to learn will be emphasized more.</P>

<P>The use of technology itself will change how people think. The concept of basic skills will be redefined beyond language and math to spatial interpretation and data synthesis. Because the new technology will work in unseen ways, people will begin to think in more abstract terms. Understanding the complexity of the computer will help us understand the complexity of our reality.</P>

<P>In the next century, creativity will be fostered as an important intellectual skill. Our ability to think holistically, to jump back and forth from detail to overview, and to organize thoughts on a both-and continuum of possibilities instead of sharp either-or dichotomies will be expanded. In fact, our concept of an educated person will change. No longer will we admire the person who has memorized a lot of facts. Instead, we will reward the one who can find, use, and apply information.</P>

<P>The role of the teacher will change. Because 21st-century learners will have access to a rich store of knowledge and instructional material via satellite and fiber-optic networks, the teacher will no longer be merely a dispenser of information but a guide or coach who facilitates the learning process. The entire teaching-learning environment will become a cooperative venture, rather than a hierarchical organization.</P>

<P>Teacher education programs will be redesigned so that teachers will learn by using the same processes and technologies they will later use to teach. Veteran teachers, alongside their students, will continue to be learners. Information networks will foster collegiality, as teachers will find ready access to their peers and experts on whatever topic they wish to pursue. Teachers also will be better able to involve parents in their children's learning through technological links such as computer modems between school and home.</P>

<P>In the next century, lifelong learning will no longer be defined as merely taking courses. Instead, it will be a way of keeping pace with the new information that every profession and every kind of work will require. Immigrants and adult dropouts will have access to literacy programs and skills for employment. As medical technologies lengthen life expectancy and improve the quality of life, the number of older people will increase. The demand for leisure learning, retraining, and community participation also will grow.</P>

<P>Early childhood and K&#150;12 educational programs will form the foundation for lifelong learning. Workstation training in corporate offices and industrial settings will be natural extensions. Colleges and universities will continue to perform research that &#147;stretches the envelope&#148; of our thinking as they continue to provide general education and professional development programs. Ours will be a total learning society in which all social organizations and institutions are committed to learning as a way of adapting to rapid change.</P>

<H4>The Hurdles</H4>
<P>Will the vision become reality? Technology now available or in the developmental stages&#151;telephone/TV interfaces, computers, interactive television, satellite video and data transmission, for example&#151;can bring about this vision of learning. Whether or not it happens will depend upon decisions made by all of us as educators, as parents, as taxpayers, as legislators, and as businesspeople. First, however, we must overcome several hurdles.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2norris.gif"align=right hspace=10><I><B>The vision will require the universal installation of the necessary broadband fiber-optic networks.</B> </I>Our existing communication networks have limited information-carrying capacity. Although some corporations and universities are installing the kind of networks necessary, access for private homes could become a severe bottleneck. Congressional legislation that mandates the deployment of a broadband fiber-optic network in the United States by the year 2015&#151;when Japan is due to complete its national broadband network&#151;is now pending. The American deployment plan gives high priority to education facilities and requires that network modernization take place at the same rate in inner city and rural areas as it does in affluent and populous areas.</P>

<P><I><B>We must address the questions of equity of access to all information through such networks.</B></I> Many fear that the privatization of learning technology and the installation of a network driven by market forces would severely limit access for the less affluent. If we do not address the risk of creating a gap between the information and technology haves and have-nots, already strained social division could be greatly exacerbated.</P>

<P><I><B>We must change public opinion, which holds that technology only serves to put people out of work.</B></I> A sharp division in opinion between business leaders and the public was reported in a February 1991 Business-Higher Education Forum/Public Agenda Foundation analysis of focus group interviews and public opinion research. Business leaders thought American workers needed better technical, thinking, and teamwork skills. But the public perception was that our workers just need to work harder. The public finds it difficult to see technology as a solution because, at some level, they fear it. Especially as technology literacy varies so widely by age, this public perception by an older, more politically active generation could become a very difficult hurdle to a nationwide initiative.</P>

<P><I><B>Ways to ensure the quality and usability of the information sent out over networks must be found.</B></I> We cannot simply repackage books and lectures and distribute them over the new technologies. Rather, we should develop high-quality, effective educational materials that produce higher levels of student mastery. Wide distribution of poor quality, ineffective instructional materials will not improve the learning process or its outcomes.</P>

<P><I><B>We must develop a new way of thinking about education.</B></I> As the art and science of teaching changes, transformations in many of our social and educational institutions will be required. Such change is difficult. Issues of control, values, conflicts, and traditions must be considered. We know that when learners are actively involved in seeking out information and constructing their own views, their ability to think and understand expands enormously. But a system that is overly concerned with exams, degrees, credentials, and certification would seriously inhibit the potential of extending learning to everyone.</P>

<P><I><B>The vision will not be realized without proper funding.</B></I> The introduction of new learning technologies means new equipment and time for training, and instructional systems have high up-front costs and development time before they get to learners. New ways of funding these systems must be devised. Joint ventures and cooperative alliances between the public and private sectors have been tried in some cases with good results. At Catonsville Community College in Baltimore, for instance, partnerships with a local cable TV company and with IBM have allowed the campus to network its computers. A large-scale learning network should have centralized development of instructional resources and decentralized delivery to learners.</P>

<H4>The Issues</H4>
<P>The possibilities of a true learning society are enormous; the potential of what can be is great. While the necessity is clear, the probability of success is not. Questions of varying magnitude remain unanswered, though informed debate has begun on many of the issues.</P>

<P>We must be aware, however, that new issues will continue to arise and that none will be easy to resolve. As we pursue our personal and collective visions for learning in the 21st century, we must consider and decide how we would answer questions such as those that follow. For if we do not manage these issues well, we may create by default a society very different from the one we desire.</P>

<P>How should we manage the process of social change that would take us from what education is today to what learning could mean tomorrow?</P>

<P>How should we ensure equal access to information and learning technologies for all socioeconomic and generational segments of the population?</P>

<P>How should we guard against the potential isolation that may result from a broadly dispersed system of individualized learning?</P>

<P>How should we take advantage of the attention-getting power of technology while overcoming its power to produce compulsive addictions to stimuli?</P>

<P>How should we translate the expertise of business, industry, and the military into learning programs for everyone?</P>

<P>How should we accommodate differing value systems in the design of learning materials and systems?</P>

<P>How should we devise systems of evaluation and accountability that will help us monitor the learning that has actually occurred?</P>

<P>How should the process of granting credentials be expanded to accept the accomplishments of all learners in a learning society?</P>

<P>How should we ensure that the materials used with learning technologies expand the learner's knowledge, understanding, and critical thinking skills through active involvement?</P>

<P>How should we choose the words to name and describe the new technologies&#151;such as virtual reality, which the Japanese call &#147;intimate presence&#148;&#151;in order to shape our approach to learning and the use of technology?</P>

<P>How should we achieve national consensus on what we want our society to be and what role we believe our schools should play in that society?</P>

<P>How should we ensure that inappropriate uses of technology do not undermine the vision?</P>

<P>How should we solve the dilemma of a more boundary-free telecommunications system in combination with the geographic and political boundaries that enclose our current educational systems and institutions?</P>

<P>Certainly, we have the capability to make the vision a reality. The critical question is: Do we have the will?</P>

<HR>
<P>The Communications Competitiveness and Infrastructure Modernization Act of 1991, HR2546, calls for the implementation of a broadband fiber-optic network in the United States by the year 2015.  It awaits action in the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee.</P>

<P>Talking calculators, braille printers, breath-operated  switches, voice-activated workstations, eye-controlled  computers&#151;these are just a few of the high-tech systems that are helping persons with severe disabilities lead richer, more productive lives. Thousands of assistive-technology devices are available for persons who are blind or deaf or cannot speak, for those who are unable to move their arms or legs, and for those with learning or cognitive disabilities. This technological revolution is liberating millions of physically impaired Americans by helping them to function independently and to become better educated, thereby reaching their full potential.</P>

<P><B>What Is It?</B><BR>
Assistive (or adaptive) technology includes any equipment, software, service, or specialized instructional material that helps disabled persons improve their quality of life and increase their access to education, the workplace, and the community. These devices help people function more independently in nearly all aspects of life, but especially in communication, mobility, learning, and personal care. Many things qualify as assistive technology. Some devices&#151;canes, walkers, braille signs, and wheelchair ramps&#151;are low-tech, whereas others are extremely sophisticated&#151;myoelectrically powered prostheses and computer programs that convert print to speech. Assistive technology can be as complex as a voice-recognition system or as simple as a stick&#151;the walking stick of a blind man or the headstick that physicist Stephen Hawking uses to operate his computer keyboard.</P>

<P>Its broad definition notwithstanding, assistive technology has become something of a buzz during the past 12 years because of revolutionary developments at the high-tech end of the scale. In fact, new products are coming on the market so fast that it's nearly impossible for anyone to keep up with them. Even when a person who has a disability learns about the latest technological development, it is often difficult to determine whether a particular device is suited to his or her special needs. There are other problems, too. Because the equipment is often custom-designed for a single individual, it can be highly expensive. Finding a local dealer who sells and repairs a particular device may also be difficult. Finally, once purchased, the device may prove too hard to operate and end up being abandoned. To overcome such barriers, in 1988 Congress passed the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act, also known as the Tech Act. This law provides funds to the states to establish programs that make assistive devices and services more available to all disabled persons (see <A HREF="/journal/volume3/sb2pesta.htm">It's the Law</A> Sidebar).</P>

<P><B>Who Needs It?</B><BR>
Many people can benefit from these programs. According to the National Health Interview Survey on Assistive Devices, in 1990 more than 13.1 million Americans were using assistive devices of some kind, and the number of users was growing at a faster rate than the general population. The survey also found 2.5 million Americans saying they needed devices that they did not have, and the principal reason they did not have the devices was their inability to pay for them. Lack of money is no excuse, however, when it comes to education. Students who need assistive devices can take advantage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which requires public schools to provide assistive technology free of charge. If the United States wishes to educate all citizens, assistive devices will play an increasingly important role in schools in coming years.</P>

<P>A vast array of assistive technology exists, so much in fact that extensive databases, such as ABLEDATA, have been created to provide information about the burgeoning supply of products, both low- and high-tech. These databases are contained on compact discs that are available at assistive-technology centers or can be purchased from Macro International, a vendor under contract to the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. For modem users, an electronic bulletin board, ABLE INFORM, provides access to ABLEDATA and other databases at no charge, except for the phone call.</P>

<P>Many of the latest developments in assistive technology are based on computers. It's ironic that a machine so often depicted as an emotionless monster threatening to enslave humanity is helping so many people lead more independent lives. Here is a brief survey of major technologies that are enriching the lives of physically impaired individuals at home, at work, and at school.</P>

<P><B>Straw Puffs and Eye Beams</B>
<UL TYPE =DISC>
<LI><I>Voice recognition.</I> One of the most helpful technologies for a person with severe motor disabilities is voice or speech recognition. By programming a computer to recognize the person's voice and to accept spoken commands, a voice-recognition system can perform many functions, including everyday tasks such as answering the phone and turning off the lights, as well as more complex activities like running office machines, entering data into a computer, and writing papers for class.</P>

<P>Persons who have motor disabilities and who are also unable to speak can use various other devices, including switches, pointers, and communication boards, to control their surroundings and help them communicate.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Switches.</I> Special microswitches that operate other devices can be adapted for any individual who can control at least one slight movement of the body&#151;for example, flexing a finger, tapping a pedal, blinking an eye, sipping and puffing on a straw, moving the tongue, or simply bumping against the side of a wheelchair. Like voice-recognition devices, switches can perform both simple and complicated tasks.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Communication boards.</I> A severely disabled person can use a communication board, which is similar to a keyboard but has pictures, words, or symbols that can be pressed or pointed to as a way of expressing needs and desires. In the classroom it is a useful way for a student to respond to a teacher's questions.</P>

<LI><P><I>Headsticks and mouthsticks.</I> These sticks or wands are simple tools that can be used for varied tasks such as pointing, turning the pages of a book, and using a computer or communication board. They differ from a standard pointer, which fits on a person's chin. A beam of light can also be used for pointing: A device similar to a small flashlight can be attached to the head or a pair of eyeglasses, allowing the wearer to point the beam at a communication board or other nearby object. The light may also be held in the hand.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Point-and-shoot devices.</I> More elaborate pointing devices make use of computer programs that display a virtual keyboard or a menu of choices. A person wears a pointer or manipulates a mouse to pick out a selection on the screen, then an adapted switch is used to click the mouse button. A person who cannot talk might use this system to express synthetic voice messages stored in the computer. One point-and-shoot device is Head-Master. Wearing a head-mounted pointer or mouse, the user moves the cursor to keys on a keyboard display, then, by puffing into a straw attached to the headset, the key is selected and typed on the screen.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Vision control.</I> On an even more sophisticated level is the Eye-gaze Computer System, manufactured by LC Technologies. This vision-controlled device allows people with motor disabilities to do many things with their eyes that they cannot do with their hands. Simply by looking at keys on a computer screen, the user can perform tasks such as speaking synthetically, controlling household appliances, playing games, studying lessons, using the phone, or writing papers. Nothing is attached to the person using the system. An infrared light-emitting diode (LED) illuminates the eye, and the LED generates a small, bright reflection off the surface of the cornea. This &#147;bright-pupil effect&#148; enables a camera to locate the center of the pupil, and, based on the relative positions of the center of the pupil and the corneal reflection, a computer predicts the &#147;gazepoint,&#148; the spot where the user's gaze is striking the display screen.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Adaptive keyboards.</I> Persons who have some control of their hands can use special keyboards instead of pointing or switching devices. These keyboards range in size from miniature models, which can be operated with one hand, to oversized units. Their purpose is the same as that of a standard keyboard&#151;to let the user enter data into a personal computer.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Sticky keys.</I> For a person who can do some typing but cannot press more than one key at a time, keylock or &#147;sticky-key&#148; adaptations are possible. For example, the Shift key can be programmed to lock the first time it is pressed, so that the next key pressed will be in shifted position (this is similar to the &#147;caps lock&#148; function on most keyboards). Another device that can help someone operate a computer is a joystick, a gearshift-like switch that emulates the functions of a keyboard.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Word-prediction software.</I> As individual letters are typed, the predictor speeds up the typing process by making several &#147;guesses&#148; at what the word might be&#151;for instance, if the letter &#147;T&#148; is entered, the predictor would offer a menu including &#147;the,&#148; &#147;that,&#148; &#147;there,&#148; and other choices. The user can then either select one of these words or type additional letters to narrow the field of possibilities.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Touch-sensitive displays.</I> Replacing the keyboard altogether, a touch-sensitive display allows a person to operate a computer merely by touching the screen.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Auditory scanning.</I> Choosing words from a list of options is a common way for severely impaired persons to express themselves, but in an extreme case where someone has visual, speech, and motor disabilities, &#147;auditory scanning&#148; can make communication possible. In this method, lists of words are recited by another person or a mechanical device, and the disabled individual indicates his selection by some action, perhaps by raising an eyebrow or bumping a switch.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Braille and Beyond</B>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><I>Electronic readers.</I> Until recent advances in technology, when blind persons wished to have access to printed materials, they had to rely on other people to read to them or on braille or talking books. As a result, they often had to wait some time before the latest published information was available to them. Electronic reading devices have changed all that. These machines read aloud in a synthetic, humanlike voice. They use optical-character-recognition (OCR) technology to scan the information on a page and transform it into audible words.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Speech synthesizers.</I> Speech synthesizers have dramatically expanded the world of blind persons at home, school, and work. For example, a computer equipped with a synthesizer can recite menus, status functions, and edit modes. On a more advanced level, electronic screen readers can send all keyboard entries and on-screen text directly to a synthesizer, whose voice keeps the user informed as operations proceed. Another device is the talking calculator, which uses synthetic speech to report the mathematical functions it is performing.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Braille adapters.</I> Although speech may be the most convenient way for a visually impaired person to use a computer, other methods are also available. Keyboards, computer access terminals, and even printers have been adapted to the braille alphabet.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Oversized displays.</I> For persons with limited use of their eyes, various devices that enlarge words and images are available. Some make use of closed-circuit television technology, whereas others rely on oversized computer screens or on software that enlarges words on standard-size screens. All of these devices are valuable in educational settings, especially when students with restricted vision are intermingled with other students.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Now Read This</B>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><I>Closed-captioning.</I> Deaf and hard-of-hearing people have greatly benefited from developments in the field of telecommunications. Closed-captioning, which converts a television program's dialogue into readable text on the TV screen, is probably the most familiar of these developments, especially since all TV sets with screens 13 inches or larger are now required to contain circuitry to decode closed-captioned broadcasts.</P></LI>

<LI><P><I>Adapted computers.</I> People with hearing limitations do not face a major problem when it comes to using personal computers, for the keyboard and screen are easily accessible. But the sounds that a computer makes&#151;for instance, the beep it emits to indicate a mistake&#151;will obviously go unheard. Special software can change these sounds to video signals, such as a flashing screen.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>The Challenge for Schools</B><BR>
Technology marches on, and people with disabilities can look forward to such exciting developments as voice-controlled robots, TV cameras that boost low vision, and computers that keep getting more friendly. But high-tech research and development do not come cheap, and school officials face the dilemma of having to provide the tools that all students need to acquire the education they deserve, while at the same time husbanding tax dollars that are all too often much too scarce.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Interview with Tom Peters</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Carole Novak</H3>
<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/3peters.gif" align=right hspace=10><B><I>Described by</I> Business Week <I>as the &#145;best friend and worst nightmare&#146; of business, management guru Tom Peters calls for radical, revolutionary change in corporate organizations brought about by empowerment of the individual. His groundbreaking</I> In Search of Excellence <I>(1982, co-written with Robert H. Waterman, Jr.) was followed by</I> A Passion for Excellence <I>(1985, co-written with Nancy Austin),</I> Thriving on Chaos <I>(1987), and</I> Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganization for the Nanosecond Nineties <I>(1992)&#151;all international best-sellers. His most recent book, the first in a series of paperback originals published by Knopf/Vintage,</I> The Tom Peters Seminar: Crazy Times Call for Crazy Organizations<I>, debuted in Spring 1994. What messages does he have for educators? In this wide-ranging interview, Peters shares his ideas about lifelong education, technology, and the economy.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><I><B>What parallels can American educators draw from your theories on chaos and liberation management?</B></I></P>

<P>I think back to 1984, when Ted Sizer published <I>Horace's Compromise</I>, and I remember reading through the book&#151;it kept me awake all night a couple of nights&#151;and absolutely shaking because the things he was saying were bizarrely consistent with the things that Bob Waterman and I had discovered when we wrote <I>In Search of Excellence</I>. The Coalition of Essential Schools could not be more consistent with the line of thinking that we have developed over the last 10 or 12 years. There is an eerie consistency. And I'd be hard pressed to find a single article on any topic that I've agreed with more than the Linda Darling-Hammond interview in the last issue of <I>TECHNOS</I> [Vol. 3, No. 2]. It's precisely the sort of thing that we have been talking about, whether she's talking about the shift from the classroom as a place where one hammered in facts to the classroom as a place where students are actively engaged, or the notion of new assessment criteria.</P>

<P><I><B>But change tends to come slowly in education, and you're always talking about speeding things up, acting now. How can we get those changes made?</B></I></P>

<P>I don't think change is coming slowly to education. I think systemic change is coming slowly. There are literally hundreds of schools around the United States that are experimenting effectively and are doing fabulous stuff. The problem is that there's no equivalent, unfortunately, to the Honda-Toyota-Nissan direct challenge to viability that we find in the auto industry. So the fact that there are hundreds of benchmarks worth emulating doesn't mean they are being emulated at anywhere nearly a rapid enough rate. But if the issue is, have we got good models?&#151;we have got more than enough good models in the K&#150;12 system of how to do it right. And that, to me, is the most frustrating aspect of the entire public sector issue. Whether the issue is education or anything else in the public sector, we cannot complain that we are waiting for Copernicus. There are any number of potential Copernicuses out there who have actually done this stuff and proven that it works. Nonetheless, the system as a whole remains in questionable shape.</P>

<P><I><B>Is it a question of privatizing all schools someday so that the marketplace will just take care of the problem?</B></I></P>

<P>I don't think it's that simple. In general, I think that privatization can be helpful, but I do not think if the whole K&#150;12 world changed to a voucher-based or privatized system in the next 12 months, it would be a panacea. It's certainly no panacea for the world of inner city schools, though you can point to both private and public inner city schools that are fabulous. But the situation calls for a lot more than one-dimensional, one-variable solutions. </P>

<P><B><I>You've written that we should look to the movie industry as a model of a &#145;learning community,&#146; that in the movie industry, people either get better every day, or they're out of a job. How does that apply to teachers and their leadership in teacher unions? Shouldn't they be getting better every day, too?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, I would go back to first principles. Stanley Davis wrote one of the better books on organizations of the future, <I>Future Perfect</I>, in which he coined the phrase &#145;from K&#150;12 to K&#150;80&#146;&#151;the notion that education for life, for everyone, is going to be the minimal door opener for continuous employment as we move into the future. So I think that in some respects there is a degree of misguidedness to extreme emphasis on K&#150;12 issues. What we need to be talking about&#151;as Lewis Perelman did in <I>School's Out</I>&#151;is a society in which education on demand, anywhere, anytime, anyplace, for everybody becomes part and parcel of the American way. My great concern is that with this new global village just in its preadolescence, with new kinds of technology-enhanced, technology-driven, technology-animated organizations that will call on the talents of whomever from wherever (meaning India and Thailand and the Philippines and Indonesia and China, as well as the United States), we'll remain competitive and keep wages relatively high, only to the degree to which the whole country becomes a learning community from age 6 to 80&#151;or certainly 6 to 65. I think the 'schools debate' badly needs to be cast in that kind of broader framework.</P>

<P>I'm shocked that when I give a seminar in June of 1994 and spend 20 minutes on an arm-waving diatribe about education for life, people treat it as if it were a new and interesting idea. On the one hand, I was lucky&#151;I chose the right mother. The notion that growing and reading and developing and educating yourself everyday came naturally to me. We haven't figured out in commercial society that one is getting better everyday&#151;or one is getting worse. So the notion of school being imbedded in your psyche from cradle to grave to me is garden-variety, not particularly interesting, not particularly novel, common sense. And yet I hear people saying, &#145;Wow! I'm really glad to hear you say that! It's really important! It's really a neat idea!&#146; I mean, the idea ain't deeply rooted yet. And that scares me.</P>

<P>Now, tying it all back to the teacher unions&#151;those models of flexibility in America&#151;they are a problem. Speaking as a lifelong Democrat with liberal leanings, I'm afraid that the teacher unions are not doing the United States a whole lot of favors at this stage of the game. I think, as people like Darling-Hammond said, we have not got to <I>change</I> the school system or <I>improve</I> the school system, but we've got to <I>reinvent</I> the K&#150;80 system, if you will. And reinvention means technological reinvention, it means physical reinvention, in which the building itself&#151;as Sir Douglas Hague writes in <I>Beyond Universities: A New Republic of the Intellect</I>&#151;is not the main part of the main game. I'm a little bit of a Luddite, and I'm willing to come down strongly on both sides of the fence: I acknowledge that face-to-face, personal coaching is incredibly important. On the other hand, I think that we're going to be delivering education totally differently in the future than we have in the past, in the corporate world and in public-sector educational activities. And the unions just don't get it. Or perhaps they &#145;get it&#146; all too well.</P>

<P><B><I>I'm a little skeptical that the old-guard educators will give up control of the classroom in a networked world. How are we going to get that to happen? Do we just have to wait till they die off?</I></B></P>

<P>That may be, frankly, the biggest argument for privatization in a market-based system. Something has to be done to destroy the power structure as we have known it for the last whatever&#151;50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years. As a casual observer, I do not see a new generation of mid-thirties, phenomenally enlightened teacher-union leaders coming up, people like Lynn Williams, president of the steelworkers union, who's really with the program. They may be there, and I'm sure they're there in the trenches of union leadership, but it does mean acknowledging a need to reconceive teaching and to understand the movement from building-based learning. God knows, that's inconsistent with what the union is pressing for.</P>

<P><B><I>Do you think national standards will help us out in K&#150;12 education in the future?</I></B></P>

<P>Not national standards of the sort the federal government seems to be railroading us toward. I'm appalled by the notion of national standards. A) It's a time when we need to be experimenting; B) it is a time when our economic security will be dependent on curiosity and creativity. To move to a system that focuses on measuring rote activity now is absolutely insane. I find it ironic that we are moving in that direction at precisely the time that the champions of rote, the Japanese, are very seriously questioning what they're up to. The corporate Japanese world, for example, is throwing money at creativity training like there wasn't any tomorrow.</P>

<P><B><I>Do you think this trend in the corporate Japanese world will sort of &#145;trickle down&#146; into their education system, too?</I></B></P>

<P>I think it's got to, over time. The Japanese, who were highly critical of us 10 years ago for hollowing out our manufacturing and sending it over to low-cost Asia, now are doing the same thing. They're sending their manufacturing out of a very expensive Japan and over to Thailand and Malaysia, which means that they're in the same position we're in. They're left with a world where, to justify their high wages, they've got to become excellent in pharmaceutical research and software design and making movies and doing NIKE advertising campaigns and all of the intellectual-based activities that have become the basis of the advanced economy. So they have got no choice. Will it happen quickly? Of course it won't. The Japanese have a more sluggish bureaucracy and a much longer cultural attachment to the way they do things than we do.</P>

<P><B><I>Let's talk about the cultural differences between Asia and the United States. In Japan, the teacher is revered, and in the United States, not so much any more. Maybe that's why the teacher unions got together and decided to make a case for the teachers.</I></B></P>

<P>Number one: there couldn't be any tougher job than teaching; that's a given. Number two: my respect for the people who are doing it is enormous. Number three: we need to reinvent the schools and the notion of teaching. And I have no more idea whether 10 percent or 15 percent or 50 percent of teachers could clear the hurdles and make it in the new world. Because&#151;to be slightly cynical&#151;I suspect I could say the same thing about teachers that I could say about middle managers in the private sector who are becoming excess baggage. That is: they are very decent people; they care very much about their jobs&#151;and yet, suddenly they find themselves in a new world where the essence of leadership is giving up power; they must be willing to operate in a very different kind of networked environment where they're coaches, flitting from here to there, rather than standing in front of the classroom doing the fact-hammering routine.</P>

<P>Look, we've been talking about &#145;A Nation at Risk&#146; for 10 years now, and we've got fabulous experiments going, but the country isn't taking education seriously. George Bush ran as the education president&#151;that was a joke! Bill Clinton didn't run as the education president, but what he's doing about education is just about as bad a joke as what Bush did&#151;namely nothing. Yes, health care is important, and maybe it does belong at the top of the priority list, and yes, welfare reform is incredibly important, and maybe that ought to be number two&#151;but from my narrow-minded perspective of the economic future, and I think Robert Reich at the Department of Labor would probably agree&#151;training, retraining, and education is where it's at for the United States. But there's just no evidence of concern. It just ain't on page one! And it ought to be a page-one issue every day.</P>

<P><I><B>It sounds as though your opinion of Tech Prep and school-to-work transition programs and workplace training would be high. Do you think such programs will work for us?</B></I></P>

<P>It's not that my opinion is uniformly high; it's that it has to be done. And we do have some role models, at least. Governor John McKernan has written a book about the Maine apprenticeship program that lays out the case very well. We certainly do have examples of people who have done a brilliant job on a pretty broad-scale basis of changing around significantly what it means to move forward beyond K&#151;12 without necessarily getting an associate's degree, let alone a full-scale university degree. And McKernan begins from evidence that says, even in 1994 and for the foreseeable future, the average person is not necessarily going to need a university degree. Maine's program is based on a K&#151;13 model, if you will, which, to me, makes a lot of sense.</P>

<P><B><I>In</I> The Tom Peters Seminar<I>, you wrote about the university as a &#145;talent bank and a library&#146; where &#145;learners will access networked brainfood on demand&#146; and you mentioned National Technological University [NTU] in Colorado Springs and how it does satellite learning as an example. Won't this cause another change in higher education? Won't we still have the Ivy League and other expensive residential campuses catering to people who can afford them, while everybody else will be hooked into the satellite television courses at home?</I></B></P>

<P>Stanford University is a wonderful example of the schizophrenia, I think. On the one hand, Gerhard Casper, president of Stanford University, has been in the lead&#151;to my utter amazement, being the traditionalist he is&#151;in saying that we ought to go to a three-year university degree instead of a four-year degree. At the same time he's saying that, he is absolutely, positively, unequivocally rejecting the sort of Douglas Hague model of the university as a repository with less of an emphasis on the physical facility. If I'm reading correctly, at least between the lines, Casper is saying that the university of the year 2010 is going to look a lot like the university of the year 1994. Statistically speaking, he may be right; but I think that's the wrong approach. I do think the NTU model is a good model. I'm talking to you from Chicago, and I think it's great that the hoity-toity University of Chicago has just spent a whole lot of money to invest in a downtown campus in Chicago where it's teaching MBA programs to large numbers of people at night. Which is certainly something that Stanford University and Harvard University wouldn't ever deign to do.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/3ptrsbk.gif" align=left hspace=10>Hague also says that, on the one hand, we're going to have incredibly high-paid superstar, Carl Sagan-type academics who will do their lectures online, and we'll have on-line libraries, etc.&#151;but we're also going to have a class of tutors or mentors (hopefully something other than the standard university teaching-assistant model of 1994) who will guide and coach, one-on-one. The point is, the high-tech network only works if the high touch is there to complement it. Those who would drive the human being entirely out of the system and run the world via teaching machines are missing the boat. And yet I do think the notion of the old ivy-covered campus is relatively pass&eacute;.</P>

<P>Though we don't really know. Actually, I feel always&#151;completely&#151;confused! I read the stuff that comes out of MIT's Media Lab by Nicholas Negroponte, saying we're going to get a &#145;me paper&#146; and his little &#145;know-bot&#146; is gonna give me exactly what I want to read. Well, every damn interesting thing that happens in life comes from serendipity. And most of the interesting innovations in Silicon Valley come from human beings who've had one too many beers, sharing stories they shouldn't be sharing in a bar. So how you combine the pub and the dormitory and the high-tech network&#151;that's a trick that not a whole lot of people, in my opinion, are paying attention to. You've got the Luddites and you've got the techno-freaks, and you don't have enough people who are living squarely on both sides of the fence, which is exactly the way I think one should be living.</P>

<P><B><I>As editor of</I> TECHNOS<I>, I'm struck over and over by the notion that the story isn't the technology, it's the people who use it and are affected by it. How will we avoid what looks like the impending bifurcation of society in the future, the haves and have nots? How are we going to make sure that there will be equity of access to the technology that everybody's going to need?</I></B></P>

<P>Looking at it through the economic lens, the irony is, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. If you want the information highway to be built as quickly as possible, you must allow entrepreneurial incentives maximum sway with minimum impedance. If you allow that, you will get more, faster. But obviously, as is already happening, the question then is, Where do you put your information-highway, experimental interactive-TV stuff first? It makes sense to put it in communities that have an average annual family income of $65,000, not $23,000. On the other hand, if you mandate absolute equality and say you should be wiring the backwoods of Tennessee at exactly the same speed that you wire Santa Clara County, California, then you will in fact stop the progress of the information-superhighway implementation dead in its tracks. We've got this really horrible conflict.</P>

<P>There are no easy solutions because there's no such thing as a perfect world. We need to get this thing built, and it's going to cost tens of billions of dollars, maybe even a trillion dollars. The government hasn't got the money, so it's going to come from the private sector. And the private sector hasn't got the incentives, unless we let 'em go at it. And that's going to cost us&#151;at least at the margin, in the short term&#151;in terms of equality of access. At the same time&#151;again, I am completely schizophrenic about it&#151;the worst problem that this country and probably the world faces is this balkanization of the United States and every other country in the world.</P>

<P>The job I would most like to have in the federal government would not be Mr. Clinton's or Mr. Gore's. I would most like to be the chairman of the FCC, because I think what's going to happen there over the next 8 to 15 to 20 years will be incredibly important. The job that faces the FCC is to try to keep some kind of equality of access at the same time that it keeps the entrepreneurial spirit alive to get the thing built.</P>

<P><B><I>Is the education sector expecting too much of its corporate partnerships and sponsorships? Is there a point at which some of these folks are just going to say: &#145;Look, we can't afford to take care of you and the whole country&#146;?</I></B></P>

<P>No. They may be totally irritated at what they view as the absence of progress at the local, state, or federal levels, but they've got no choice. Because the wise corporations today&#151;and increasingly that's going to include smaller and middle-sized businesses along with the biggies&#151;understand that they can only survive if they have a fabulously skilled work force that continues to be trained forever. Which means that the notion of training&#151;whether it's partnerships or direct investment in remedial education beginning with literacy training&#151;<I>defines</I> their economic future, period.</P>

<P><B><I>Are there things that teachers and school districts ought to be doing differently when they approach the corporations for help?</I></B></P>

<P>If you go to Governor McKernan's book and see what Maine learned as it installed the apprenticeship system, you'll find what bureaucrats tend to do everywhere. That is, in their first pass, the government decided what ought to be done in terms of training content. To their amazement, corporations were not necessarily interested in the bodies that they were producing. At which point they went back to the drawing board and asked their would-be private sector partners, &#145;What skills would you like human beings to be trained in?&#146; And it was a very different answer from the one that even the enlightened state of Maine's educational bureaucracy had come up with. Again, both sides have a case. The private sector is not willing to embrace the public sector because they see them as bureaucrats; the public sector is not willing to embrace the private sector because they see them as greedy, egocentric robber barons. And yet the Maine program really started to tick when they got the mechanism right for creating a permeable boundary between the employers and the skills-training program, so that suddenly the Maine program was producing what Maine's employers needed. And that's what the Germans do so well with their apprenticeship programs.</P>

<P><B><I>You once taught in the Stanford business school, and you're teaching all the time in your seminars now. From your perspective as a teacher, what do you think the purpose of education is? Is it just about economics?</I></B></P>

<P>It's obviously the essential philosophical question that nobody in education has ever answered fully. Are you supposed to be training &#145;good citizens,&#146; or are you supposed to be providing the best education, whether it's literature or mathematics or whatever, to exist in the economy? It's clearly unanswerable. But my answer is: We're trying to develop self-sufficient, curious human beings.</P>

<P><B><I>I see.</I></B></P>

<P>And that may or may not involve William Bennett's <I>Book of Virtues</I>, and it may or may not involve training in how to use nails and hammers or how to write checks. I think the good news is, as I look at the future of the economy, that the economy is asking for employees who are committed to lifelong learning, who are curious, and who are self-disciplined. What the employer needs is what the society needs, and there could be a nice mesh there. We really aren't, one hopes, still trying to train people to work in Ford auto plants of the year 1917. The world is not all Microsoft, but we're looking more for people who can work on little teams, work independently, learn something new everyday, have high facility in the technology, but who are also interested in the arts and all the sorts of things from whence creativity comes in a brain-based economy. So I can paint a Utopian picture, which I think is a fair picture. It's just, I think, that we're a long way from being there.</P>

<P><B><I>You said you chose the right mother, and she raised you up right. Was she your favorite teacher? Do you have a favorite teacher?</I></B></P>

<P>My mother is number one on that list, clearly. Number two is my tenth-grade history teacher, who also happened to run the debate club and got me interested in yakking. But mainly he treated us tenth graders as if we were adults and kindled something that my mother had already started, which was a lifelong passion for history. My next favorite teacher was actually my battalion commander in the Seabees in Vietnam, who was really my first boss. And my fourth favorite teacher was my first boss at McKinsey and Company, when I became a consultant there.</P>

<P><B><I>So, your favorite teachers were not necessarily people who were trained to be teachers&#133;</I></B></P>

<P>Absolutely not!</P>

<P><B><I>&#133;but people who served as mentors.</I></B></P>

<P>What those four did for me&#151;and I think this is good for the economy, good for the society&#151;they made me more self-sufficient, they made me grow up, they made me incredibly curious about a particular subject. I think it's really a false dichotomy to talk about preparation for the economy and preparation for citizenship; it certainly is in the year 2000.</P>

<P>Once upon a time, in a land far away, disorder and fear plagued the people. Guns and cannons were everywhere, warring parties slaughtered each other by the thousands, and no soldier would venture into battle unless equipped with the most modern firearms. The gun makers of the land were powerful, skillful, and prosperous, for they not only made guns for their own people but sold them to foreigners as well. You could hardly travel anywhere in the cities or country without seeing a gun or hearing one, which is why the children slept fitfully, with fear in their hearts.</P>

<P>For almost one hundred years, this was the situation in that forlorn land. Then, gradually, the people began to wonder if they would not be better off without their guns. It is hard to know why this thought arose. But they were an intelligent people with strong and ancient traditions and a well-developed sense of civilized behavior. Perhaps that is why the soldiers announced that they did not really like guns, for there was little skill and no honor in killing a man with a gun. The politicians were forced to admit that guns were not necessary to protect the land from foreign invasion since their armies were large and loyal and had never forgotten how to use swords. Besides, no one had seriously tried to invade their land for as far back as anyone could remember. Then, too, everyone agreed that guns were ugly, hardly comparable to the elegant beauty of a well-made sword. And because the sword was so beautiful, it had a value far beyond its use as a weapon. It was a symbol of honor, piety, and courage. And everyone knew that there once was a time when swords were given as gifts to men of great character.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="4postman.gif" align=left hspace=10>And so the politicians, the soldiers, the businessmen, and the plain folk decided it was best to give up their guns. This did not happen all at once, for people never agree to a thing one hundred percent. Some gun makers, for example, were not pleased until they realized that it was more fun and almost as profitable to return to making swords. And, of course, there were some soldiers who had never learned the art of swordsmanship and who worried about their future. But, eventually, people began to throw away their guns or sell them to the government, which was happy to destroy them. The government even paid the gun makers not to make guns, the way Americans pay their farmers not to grow food. In a short time, all the guns were gone. There were still wars, of course, for even in a fable the demons that make men war on each other cannot be wished away. But for two hundred years, the sweet song of the nightingale was never drowned by the retort of the rifle or the roar of the cannon. And the children slept peacefully, as they had done many years before.</P>

<P align=center><B>II</B></P>

<P>I begin with a fable because it is the language traditionally used to imagine something that everyone knows cannot happen. But this fable has an ironic twist to it, since what it describes actually did happen. The faraway land is Japan, which in the sixteenth century was a world leader in the manufacture of matchlock guns and cannon, having been introduced to these technologies by European traders. Toward the end of that century, for reasons mentioned in the fable, the Japanese gave up their firearms and reverted to their traditional weapons. There were no guns in Japan until the mid-nineteenth century. All of this is meticulously documented in <I>Giving Up the Gun: Japan's Reversion to the Sword, 1543-1879</I>, by Noel Perrin (Boston: David R. Godine, 1979), who wrote the book for the best of reasons. He wanted to show that two of the fundamental beliefs of those who live in advanced technological cultures are at least slightly questionable. The first belief is that there are no circumstances in which the technological clock can be turned back. The second is that technology is autonomous and is therefore beyond the control of those who make machines or use them.</P>

<P>One must admit, of course, that there are not too many examples that refute either of these propositions. The case of the Japanese and their guns is one. The most well-known instance in the Western world occurred in England between 1811 and 1816, curiously, not far from the time when the Japanese resumed their use of guns. I refer to the much-maligned Luddite movement, the revolt of workers against the intrusion of machinery in the garment and fabric industry. The origin of the term &#147;Luddite&#148; is obscure, some believing that it refers to the actions of a youth named Ludlum who, being told by his father to fix a weaving machine, proceeded instead to destroy it. Perhaps. But it is certain that workers bitterly resented the fact that machinery had led to wage cuts, child labor, and the elimination of laws and customs that had protected skilled workers. Their discontent was expressed through the destruction of machines, and since then the term &#147;Luddite&#148; has come to mean an almost childish and naive opposition to technology. Of course, the historical Luddites were neither childish nor naive. Like the sixteenth-century Japanese, they were people trying desperately to preserve a world view that had given them a sense of worth and justice in an earlier time.</P>

<P>I bring all of this up because I believe there is something to be learned from these examples and these people. No, I do not expect all nuclear weapons to be dismantled or television to be blacked out or computers to be unplugged. There is a more realistic point to be made&#151;an idea that was on the minds of the sixteenth-century Japanese and the nineteenth-century English workmen, and one hopes it will occur to twenty-first-century Americans. The idea goes by different names. Critic Paul Goodman called it &#147;technological modesty.&#148; He meant that we must cultivate a sense of the whole and not cede to our technologies more dominion than their particular functions warrant. This is what mathematician Norbert Wiener, founder of cybernetics, meant when he used the phrase, &#147;the human use of human beings.&#148; My own term for this idea is &#147;technological atheism,&#148; by which I mean that we must disbelieve in the divinity of technology. For if we define god, as did the philosopher and theologian Paul Tillich, as that which is our &#147;ultimate concern,&#148; then technology clearly qualifies as America's deity.</P>

<P>By technology, I do not mean merely machinery but the system of beliefs that comprise a technological thought world. These include the beliefs that the primary goal of human thought is efficiency, that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment, that what cannot be measured does not exist, and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by technical experts. Just as a theocratic culture such as Iran organizes itself to accommodate the requirements of Allah, America does exactly the same in relation to technology. There are few social institutions that have not been willing to modify themselves&#151;even in some cases, eliminate themselves&#151;to accommodate such a system of thought. Our politics, education, family life, judiciary, and even churches have been adjusted, redesigned, and redirected to fit the needs of this new religion. The prevailing theology requires that we focus all of our intelligence on the question of what technology can do, almost none on what it may undo.</P>

<P>Why is this so? In a traditional theocracy the answer is, &#147;We do what we do because it is the way of God. It is His will, and we must obey.&#148; American culture gives a strikingly similar answer: &#147;It is the way of technology. It is its will, and we must obey.&#148; Of course, people obey their gods because they believe it is good for them to do so, and there is no denying that the uses of technological thinking and its products have brought unimagined benefits to many people. But to the extent that the benefits have been accompanied by an unquestioned ambition to acquire godlike powers over nature, by the assumption that technological innovation is synonymous with human progress, and by the demonstrably false proposition that technological thinking offers the best solution to our most profound human problems, we make ourselves into childish fanatics, pursuing false hopes and an impotent idol.</P>

<P>That this is a mistake is what the sixteenth-century Japanese and nineteenth-century Englishmen can teach us. If I may paraphrase a piece of wisdom from another religion: Technology was made for man, not man for technology.</P>

<P align=center><B>III</B></P>

<P>What all of this means for education is fairly obvious (at least to me). The most important point is that our devotion to technology blinds us to the issue of what education is for. In America, we improve the education of our youth by improving what are called &#147;learning technologies.&#148; At the moment, it is considered necessary to introduce computers to the classroom, as it once was thought necessary to bring closed-circuit television and film to the classroom. To the question, &#147;Why should we do this?&#148; the answer is: &#147;To make learning more efficient and more interesting.&#148; Such an answer is considered entirely adequate, since, to the technological fundamentalists, efficiency and interest need no justification. It is, therefore, usually not noticed that this answer does not address the question, &#147;What is learning for?&#148;</P>

<P>&#147;Efficiency and interest&#148; is a technical answer&#151;an answer about means, not ends&#151;and it offers no pathway to a consideration of educational philosophy. Indeed, it blocks the way to such a consideration by beginning with the question of how we should proceed rather than with the question of why. It is probably not necessary to say that, by definition, there can be no education philosophy that does not address what learning is for. Confucius, Plato, Quintilian, Cicero, Comenius, Erasmus, Locke, Rousseau, Jefferson, Russell, Montessori, Whitehead, Dewey&#151;each believed that there was some transcendent political, spiritual, or social idea that must be advanced through education. Confucius advocated teaching &#147;the Way&#148; because in tradition he saw the best hope for social order. As our first systematic fascist, Plato wished education to produce philosopher kings. Cicero argued that education must free the student from the tyranny of the present. Jefferson thought the purpose of education is to teach the young how to protect their liberties. Rousseau wished education to free the young from the unnatural constraints of a wicked and arbitrary social order. And among John Dewey's aims was to help the student function without certainty in a world of constant change and puzzling ambiguities.</P>

<P>What does technology have to do with finding a profound reason for educating the young? Nothing. Indeed, if it were up to me, I would bar educators from talking about technical improvements until they have disclosed their reasons for offering an education in the first place. And such reasons are to be found in places where machines do not dwell and where gods of a different order speak their words.</P>

<P><B><I>The debate over censorship and electronic communication is misguided, according to this author. The real debate should be over how we can expand horizons&#151;not limit them out of misplaced concern.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>As a teacher in an inner-city school in Richmond, California, I'm delighted that so many people are concerned about the problems I face in my daily work. I'm more than pleased at how concerned influential people are with ensuring that my students inhabit an educational environment that will help them prepare for a productive life. Consider the following efforts being made on county, state, and ideological levels.</P>

<P>Orange County, California, is a county concerned with morality. A recent issue of the <I>Orange County Register</I> included the following report on proposed federal legislation:
<blockquote>
In one corner are politicians who vow to keep the information highway from becoming a red-light district to make it a haven safe for children. They hope to arm themselves with the Communications Decency Act of 1995, a bill that&#133;makes it a crime to transmit obscene or harassing text or images through any electronic media&#133;If the government doesn't act, it would be &#147;an open invitation to&#133;hard-core pornography,&#148; said [U.S. Senator Jim] Exon, D-Neb, the bill's sponsor [See <A HREF="sb2radke.htm">The Proposed Communications Decency Act of 1995</A> Sidebar].</blockquote></P>

<P>The state of California is concerned about taxes that could drive out of the state those businesses interested in hiring my students when they graduate from high school. To avert this loss, Governor Wilson, who wishes to take his vision to a national level, has proposed &#147;cutting&#148; taxes, an action which would reduce state funds for education and gut California's educational system even further. If taxes are cut, there will be no money for poor schools to connect to the Internet.</P>

<P>And if political and economic censorship weren't enough, we have Clifford Stoll's new book, <I>Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Superhighway</I> (Doubleday), proclaiming the social argument that teachers, not cyberspace, make a difference in the life of students. He says the millions that would be spent on computers and connections to the Internet would be better spent on teachers. (Since the teachers in the Richmond Unified School District took a nine percent pay cut four years ago, I have no objection to more money being spent on teachers.) At the Berkeley Mac Users Group Macfest in March, Stoll added that rather than e-mailing pen pals in different countries, children should visit the parks, become involved in their own communities, and not replace real friendships with friendships in virtual environments. He also stated that &#147;people who get the most out of computers are people who follow the rules. People who have the most problems with computers don't follow all of the rules; they are creative people.&#148; Cliff Stoll, it should be noted, has been surfing the Net since the 1973 ARPA Net days.</P>

<P>At a later session of this same Macfest conference, Nora Ponce, a 17-year-old Richmond High student, had this response:
<blockquote>
My neighborhood doesn't have parks or roses to smell, just trash and drugs. Walking home from school or the library, I've been mugged and harassed on the streets&#151;I don't know how many times. Our school library is only open three days a week and doesn't have very much in it, and it's outdated. I found one book for a report I have to do on bandits in Mexico; from the World Wide Web I got 64 responses. It's safer ftp-ing materials from my home with the terminal my school gave me. When I program my MOO environment, I can see things come alive on the computer.</blockquote></P>

<P><B>The World in Which We Live</B><BR>
Richmond High School is typical of any inner-city school in the country. We <I>do</I> have a principal and a core of teachers who are committed to restructuring the educational process. But our school is home to students who are shaped by the social decay of the community-joblessness, homelessness, child abuse, drug abuse, poor nutrition, and few resources outside of churches and a couple of neighborhood houses, all of which lack funds to develop any sort of self-esteem in our students.</P>

<P>Every year our students are subject to drive-by shootings, and every year we give excused absences to large numbers of students to attend the funerals of their schoolmates, friends, and relatives.</P>

<P>The December 1, 1994, issue of <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine included an article on gang violence in the Richmond community. In &#147;Hyper Violence,&#148; Lewis Cole includes this telling quote from a surgeon at Oakland's Children's Hospital: &#147;There's a severe crisis. I had a patient with a stab wound. It turned out he had two outstanding felony warrants on line, one for armed robbery, the other for drug trafficking. [He] was an 11-year-old. I've seen 8-year-olds shot because of gang activity. And the ages are going down.&#148; The present homicide rate in Richmond is 59 per 100,000&#151;these are predominantly public school youth.</P>

<P>&#147;I had to take care of my child the last few days&#151;I have an excuse for missing school,&#148; one of my 16-year-old students told me last week. Every day in the United States, 40 teenage youths give birth to their third child. By grade 12, more than 60 percent of surveyed American students indicated that they had engaged in sexual intercourse.</P>

<P>The lack of jobs for graduates means that students have no incentive to finish school. The drop-out rate in Richmond, at 28 percent, mirrors that of the United States. Among Latino youth it's 48 percent; among African-American youth it's 39 percent.</P>

<P>And the problems of these students engulf the classroom. Students &#147;dis&#148;&#151;make fun of&#151;the teachers as well as each other. Respect for adult authority is almost nonexistent, and adult role models are replaced by gang discipline and gang support. No wonder. We place a literal handful of students in four-year colleges. Jobs are scarce, and many of the summer jobs depend on programs that are federally funded and are constantly in danger of being cut.</P>

<P>While our student body is 88 percent non-white, the staff is overwhelmingly white. In fact, 86 percent of public school teachers in California are white, while most students in inner-city schools are non-white. The teachers have their own problems&#151;salaries are dropping or not keeping up with inflation; supplies and books are scarce. And the cultural divide between students and teachers is great.</P>

<P>After I returned from a sabbatical a few years ago, a student asked me, &#147;Are you a new teacher?&#148; Embarrassed, I wondered aloud why she would say that. &#147;Because you don't yell at us like a lot of the other teachers.&#148; And she was right&#151;for most of our teachers, the love of teaching becomes replaced by the drudgery of surviving another day.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2censo2.gif"align=left hspace=10><I>Les Radke's students are a diverse group. They or their parents come from such countries as Nicaragua, Mexico, Vietnam, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.</I></P>

<P><B>Where are the Role Models?</B><BR>
Adult role models are lacking. Fathers are often absent from their families. Many parents leave the country for Mexico or Central America for long periods of time, giving students the choice of disrupting their education or trying to survive on their own. This is not the problem of self-esteem Doonesbury cartoons make light of in discussing California. This is a lack of self-esteem tied to the struggle to survive.</P>

<P>When these students intersect with the world of technology, it's sometimes enough to drive them to virtual reality. The next time you attend a computer event, or walk around a research facility, be conscious of the number of African-American women or Hispanic or Native-American role models my students would see if they were there. An Asian teacher once told me, &#147;I don't watch football because there are so few Asian women quarterbacks.&#148; This is perhaps not a bad reaction for someone who dreams of having a career in football but, finding no role models in the sport, chooses not to pursue that dream. But it would be an unhealthy reaction for my students who dream of having a career in technology.</P>

<P>Three years ago, I took my students to a Sun World computer exhibit. We arrived in a standard yellow school bus. The students were Hispanic, Asian, and African-American. We had passes to the show from a representative of Visual Technology, an exhibitor. When the security guard saw this motley crew from Richmond High School and their teacher, we were promptly told we couldn't go in. When the exhibitor said our tickets were legitimate, we were reluctantly allowed in. After half an hour, a security guard called me to his booth for the following exchange:<BR>
&#147;Please call your students together. They're disrupting the show.&#148;<BR>
&#147;I don't see them doing anything. What are they doing?&#148;<BR>
&#147;That's the point. Vendors think they're regular attendees.&#148;<BR></P>

<P>The vendors supporting me told me all the vendors had actually taken a vote to exclude students from the exhibit. They had, however, voted to <I>allow</I> students to attend. An official of the Sun User's Group apologized and the following year again offered us tickets to the event. But my students voted not to attend any exhibits outside of Silicon Valley, even though I urged them to go.</P>

<P>One of the officials told me the &#147;problem&#148; was that they were high school students, not that they were non-white. If so, students need another venue through which to learn about future technology.</P>

<P><B>The Internet Alternative</B><BR>
As students go through their lives dealing with violence, decreasing opportunities for jobs, sexual and physical abuse, hunger, lead poisoning, racism, a lack of role models, death, and overwhelmed teachers, they look for alternatives.</P>

<P>No place has more alternatives than the Internet. Our school has a principal who has supported the creative use of technology. We've wired all the rooms in the main building of the school with a 10Base-T connection to our Unix lab. We have a dedicated group of former students and other friends who support us by donating equipment and time in our lab. We have four Sun servers controlled by students. This was done with minimal support from our district, which was nationally known for going bankrupt several years ago.</P>

<P>The students have helped the rooms go on line with the Internet. Because students who understand technology, and the social uses and misuses of it, will help control the shape of the information supercanal, these students are taking control of their future.</P>

<P>Part of this control has been assumed by the more interested students who manage our Web server and MOO server, as well as the computer room itself. MOO, the virtual reality environment allowing people to communicate with each other, allows this poor community access to people all around the world and a shot at equal treatment.</P>

<P>For teachers, having a machine that is a host on the Internet, as opposed to an infrequent and unreliable phone connection, means having a reliable tool to expand their classroom activities. Even the technophobes are drawn in and begin e-mailing to friends, subscribing to lesson plans or hobby groups, and talking to teachers in other parts of the school.</P>

<P>We've now been on the Internet as a full node for one and a half years. The students now tell the teachers how to block unwelcome messages. We have a use policy forbidding swearing or harassing others on the Internet.</P>

<P>But our focus needs to be on providing tools to the students to expand their horizons, not to develop tools and policies to limit them. I agree with the representative from Russia who attended the fall telecommunications conference of the International Society for Technology and Education. He said, &#147;We tried censorship for 70 years, and it helped no one. I'm opposed to limiting people's access to information.&#148;</P>

<B><I>The quiet hum of electrical synergy relays the infinite language of 0s and 1s as a second-grader learns to play piano. A ten-year-old takes the helm of a simulated spaceship. And business messages scatter around the globe, reaching their destinations in seconds.  Computer technology has affected nearly every aspect of our lives and has the capability to enhance home learning. Combine the oldest learning environment with the newest technology, and you may provide the best preparation for the workplace of tomorrow.</I></B></P>
<BR><BR>

<P>Compared to home learning, compulsory education is a relatively new phenomenon. Emerging in the mid-1800s, this model of education acclimated children to their future working lives in an industrial workplace that required employees to work outside of the home, follow directions, and keep the line running. In contrast, learning at home is a natural process that begins as the infant develops into an inquisitive, rambling toddler and continues as the child rows, tests boundaries, and strives to &#147;do it herself.&#148; The inherent flexibility of home schooling meant that it could be applied with success in nearly any home. In the centuries preceding the Industrial Age, families of means who could have sent their children to private &#147;schools&#148; often chose instead to provide their children with tutors&#151;sometimes the emerging poets, playwrights, philosophers. Or scientists of the day. Home schooling was also prevalent, although more immediately &#147;hands-on,&#148; in families of the working class who taught their children the skills needed to earn a living on the family farm, with a home-based cottage industry, or through a journeyman-level trade.</P>


<P>Even when free public education for all was offered, some families chose home schooling to ensure the curriculum did (or did not) include a religious perspective. In the late 1960s and 1970s, dissatisfaction with traditional schooling began to increase the numbers of home-schooled children. But the dramatic resurgence in home schooling has occurred since 1978, when an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 children in grades K-12 were home schooled. By 1994, the U.S. Department of Education estimated that 500,000 children were being taught at home. The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) estimates that there are currently between 700,000 and 1 million children being home schooled in America. The entrance of many middle- and upper class families into the home schooling arena signals two things: a pervasive dissatisfaction with public or private school and the increasing public acceptance of home schooling. Many parents who turn to home schooling wonder how teachers can help their children when they must manage class sizes increased by reduced funding, diversified by mainstreaming, regimented by federal and state curriculum demands, and threatened by the presence or potential for violence and drug activity.</P>

<P>Home schooling is legal in all 50 of the United States. According to HSLDA, 40 states do not require home school parents to have any specific qualifications, such as teacher certification. In at least 17 states, home schools or groups of home schoolers have qualified as private or church schools. Thirty states require standardized testing or evaluation, and 14 of these 30 states provide an alternative to testing [see the <A HREF="/journal/volume4/sb1rieseberg.htm">Measuring Up</A> Sidebar]. Connecticut, for example, only requires a portfolio review.</P>

<P><B>The Resourceful Home School</B><BR>
A typical home school's network of resources is so diverse that even without technology, home learning is a rich and active process. Add a personal computer and some or all of its applications, and the home school opens windows of learning opportunities and acclimates the home-schooled child to one of the primary media of tomorrow's workplace.</P>

<P>Local home schoolers often pool their resources and form groups based on mutual interests. These support groups, sometimes called cooperatives, or co-ops, may meet to learn about geography, travel to areas of historical significance, discuss, consider, and share curriculum, and organize and host special events, such as a Christmas pageant or the President's Physical Fitness Program. Co-ops increase a home school's resources, teaching expertise, and social interaction.</P>

<P>Another local resource is the public library, which in addition to reference materials, books, and a rich selection of magazines and newspapers, may also subscribe to periodical databases, such as Infotrac, and maintain a video and film library complete with viewing equipment. Some public libraries have made their electronic catalogs available online, giving the home school with on-line access the ability to conduct library searches and ascertain checkout status before driving to the library to pull the materials from the shelf or search through other library holdings.</P>

<P>Home schooling parents can also look for support and information from regional, state, and national organizations, such as the National Homeschool Association in Rodeo, New Mexico, and the HSLDA in Paeonian Springs, Virginia. Parents who choose to home school through high school can enroll their child in one of the many accredited umbrella schools that provide a high school transcript when the student has completed a correspondence curriculum. The hundreds of colleges that have accepted home schoolers include Harvard, MIT, and Princeton, plus state universities ranging from the University of Alaska at Fairbanks to the University of Michigan.</P>

<P>The introduction of the computer to the home school, and the applications that have followed (interactive software, CD-ROM, networking), can provide the homeschooled student with resources few public or private school students enjoy at all&#151;or with as much freedom afforded the home schooler. In the CD-ROM format, cumbersome reference sources become accessible and enjoyable research tools. Electronic databases currently on CD-ROM include various encyclopedias as well as the <I>1994 Guinness Multimedia Disc of Records</I>, the <I>KGB-CIA World Factbook</I>, and <I>Toolworks World Atlas</I>. Available software programs for the K-12 learning environment include <I>Reader Rabbit</I>, a reading comprehension program; <I>Newsroom</I>, a simplified desktop publishing program; <I>Typing Tutor V</I>, a touch typing tutorial; and <I>The Oregon Trail,</I> a software program that teaches how to plan and execute a simulated journey from St. Louis to the Oregon Territory. Home schoolers who want to learn a second language could invest in a multimedia Japanese program called <I>Power Japanese</I>, which is a self-paced language laboratory that teaches the writing of Japanese characters as well as speaking skills.</P>


<P>And when a home school adds a modem and online access, parents and children both can find ample resources and opportunities for interaction with others interested in home schooling. Through Internet, children can access Academy One, an educational service with classroom discussions and resources, and Homer, an online curriculum offered by Imsatt Corporation of Falls Church, Virginia, through which students can study and be tested on nearly any subject (providing an online correspondence school). Online bulletin boards systems, or BBSs, provide home school families with opportunities to explore interests, query experts, and discuss home schooling concerns. A student interested in astronomy, for example, might want to &#147;listen in&#148; to the Canadian Space Society BBS, the Observer's Database, or the Homeschool BBS [see the <A HREF="/journal/volume4/sb1rieseberg2.htm">Home Schools On Line</A> Sidebar].</P>

<BR><BR>

<P><B>The Socialized Child</B><BR>
How best do children learn how to get along with others? Surrounded by 30 kids of the same age? Or placed within a small group that includes contact with children of different ages and with adults in a variety of settings? Even as the applications of technology continue to transform the workplace, success in tomorrow's service-oriented economy will still depend on the human touch&#151;the socialized child who learned how to get along with others and refined that ability on his or her way to the workplace. Financial service counselors, for example, may never meet their clients face to face, but their success will largely depend on their ability to meet client needs and resolve client problems.</P>

<P>Critics of home schooling question whether even the most active and outgoing home-school environment can compete with the socialization offered in a more traditional school setting.</P>

<P>Learning how to get along with others from different backgrounds and cultures and learning informally from one's peers are key advantages cited for the public and private school setting.</P>

<P>Several studies indicate that home schooling encourages a healthier socialization that more closely mirrors the working world. A 1992 master's thesis by Thomas Smedley entitled &#147;The Socialization of Home School Children&#148; (Radford University of Virginia) compared 20 home-schooled children to 13 demographically matched children from the public school system using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, which gauge a child's social maturity by evaluating communication skills, socialization, and daily living skills. Smedley found that the home-schooled children were better socialized and more mature, scoring in the 84th percentile, while the public school children scored in the 27th percentile. &#147;In the public school system,&#148; he concluded, &#147;children are socialized horizontally, and temporarily, into conformity with their immediate peers. Home educators seek to socialize their children vertically, toward responsibility, service, and adulthood.&#148;</P>

<P>In &#147;Comparison of Social Adjustment Between Home and Traditionally Schooled Students&#148; (1992 dissertation, University of Florida), Larry Shyers compared behavior and social development test scores of two groups of 70 children ages eight to ten. One group was home schooled, and the other group attended public or private schools. Shyers found that the homeschooled children had fewer behavioral problems because they tended to imitate their parents, while the other children modeled themselves after their peers. &#147;The results seem to show that a child's social development depends more on adult contact and less on contact with other children as previously thought,&#148; he said.</P>

<P>The home schooling environment strengthens the bond children have with their family, and parents remain the primary source of direction and guidance while the child develops his or her critical thinking skills. The child also remains an integrated part of a home that may include older and younger siblings. If an older child, she may help younger siblings with their homework. If younger, he may look to an older sibling for help. And when the home school joins other home schools for field trips, sports events, or special activities, the combined group will include children of many ages. This mixed-age, mixed-ability environment more closely mirrors the workplace than the single-grade classroom, with its emphasis on ensuring that a group of children of similar age will work through a prescribed curriculum over a nine-month school year.</P>

<P>The workplace of the 21st century will be a multi-ability, multi-generational workplace in which students who conform with their peer group may struggle to compete, while students who move beyond peer expectations and develop personal  expertise and independence will likely find exciting and challenging opportunities.</P>

<P><B>The Lifelong Learner</B><BR>
Those who will thrive in the workplace of tomorrow will be lifelong learners, people who are constantly seeking new and better ways of doing their jobs and enjoying outside interests. The more easily acquired habit of lifelong learning is perhaps the most significant advantage of the home schooling environment.</P>

<P>The typical home school provides students with one-on-one instruction, a flexible schoolday that integrates daily living with learning, and greater freedom to pursue interests. Learning is perceived as an activity that permeates all parts of daily life, from the orderly pursuit of the knowledge needed to understand calculus or use Lotus 1-2-3 to the serendipitous ideas and insights that occur when one turns an active, questioning mind upon the worlds of information, thought, and experience in which we live.</P>

<P>Because learning occurs during school hours and often beyond as children complete homework or pursue topics of interest, the work is perceived as a natural, ongoing part of life rather than an activity that occurs while confined to a school building, classroom, or study hall.</P>

<P><B>The Workplace of the 21st Century</B><BR>
To better understand the workplace of the 21st century, we should first consider how the workplace has changed since the end of World War II (<I>CQ Researcher</I> chronology, February 28, 1992). During this postwar era, American workers have experienced the emergence and disintegration of an unspoken pledge of reciprocal loyalty between an employer and its employees. In 1956 William H. Whyte, Jr., described this emerging corporate employee in <I>The Organized Man.</I> Signs of change, however, began appearing in the 1970s, with a series of oil crises in 1973 and the first phase of corporate restructuring among manufacturers in 1979. Rising labor costs and growing competition from abroad prompted U.S. corporations to increase automation and open plants in countries where labor costs were lower.</P>

<P>The 1980s began with the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. During the recession of 1981-1982, corporations eliminated millions of blue-collar jobs in an effort to compete with foreign producers. Within a few years, white-collar jobs began landing on the chopping block with increasing frequency. In 1985, IBM began cutting its workforce, and in 1989 a wave of bank consolidations and closures resulted in the loss of more than 100,000 jobs by early 1992.</P>

<P>Restructuring in the 1990s increased cuts in white-collar employment as corporations eliminated many middle-management positions. As the recession that began in July 1990 continued, white-collar unemployment began to mirror that of the blue-collar professions and spread throughout U.S. industry. In August 1990, Sears announced a cost-reduction program that would cut about 33,000 positions by the end of 1991. On January 7, 1992, it announced the elimination of an additional 7,000 positions through automation of customer-service tasks. By early 1992, General Motors announced it would eliminate 74,000 jobs; IBM, 20,000; Pan American World Airways, 7,500: and McDonnell Douglas, 3,800.</P>

<P>As the editor of <I>Workplace Trends,</I> Dan Lacey tracked the steady and permanent loss of millions of jobs that occurred in publicly held corporations. In 1991 U.S. corporations had announced more than half a million permanent staff cuts, a phenomenon that Lacey attributed to &#147;the end of the post-World War II boom days. Everything that everyone considers normal about work&#151;long-term steady employment with a full range of company-paid benefits and ever-rising wages&#151;is a way of life that came about in America after World War II....For middle-class America, the style of employment that is disappearing has been not a luxury but a requirement. That's why we're talking about trauma and turmoil.&#148; When Congress considered the Expanded Training Opportunities Act in 1994, Connecticut Representative Sam Gejdenson would note that about 75 percent of laid-off workers in 1992 were permanently laid off&#151;the highest annual figure since this category of workers was first tracked in 1967.</P>

<P>By the time the recession ended, most experts conceded that the unspoken contract of reciprocal loyalty had become a relic of the past. When bottom lines shifted into black, many companies maintained their leaner staffs and reinvested their profits into upgrading technology instead. Research by professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Thomas W. Malone of MIT's Sloan School found that &#147;even as the typical company in this study eliminated 20 percent of its employees over 10 years, it tripled its investment in information technology.&#148; Instead of hiring additional permanent staff, these companies began outsourcing their overloads and seasonal work to leased, contract, or freelance workers. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of leased workers in New York and New Jersey increased by 20,000 between 1990 and 1993, a 17 percent increase in three years.</P>

<P>In analyzing this sea of change in the American workplace, the February 28, 1992, issue of the <I>CQ Researcher</I> noted that &#147;while corporate restructuring may enable U.S. firms to better compete in the global marketplace, it also foreshadows a fundamental change in employer-employee relations: Growing numbers of Americans will be forced into part-time work with low pay, no job securing and few benefits. The keys to success in this less-predictable workplace will be education, training, and a willingness to alter career goals. Above all, experts caution, employees should not expect lifelong employment with a single company.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Scrambling onto a Horizontal Playing Field</B><BR>
So what should employees expect, and how might home schooling work in this brave new world? In his &#147;On Excellence&#148; column, management guru Tom Peters contends that the success of the economy, companies of all sizes, and individuals &#147;will mostly be a function of our ability to embrace dislocation, pain and ambiguity&#133;.The order of the day is perpetual reinvention and revolution, constant re-creation, continuous curiosity, wild plunges into the abyss.&#148;</P>

<P>Pioneering business educator Peter Drucker concurs and notes that &#147;the center of gravity has shifted to knowledge workers. And they own the tool of production&#133;.It's between their ears. They can take their skill anyplace&#151;and they do. They no longer see themselves as members of an organization. They look upon the organization as their tool&#133;.We are moving toward a society of networks&#148; (William J. Flannery, &#147;Peter Drucker Reflects on Economic Sea of Change,&#148; February 5, 1995. <I>St. Louis Post Dispatch</I>).</P>

<P><I>Fortune</I> executive editor Walter Kiechel III characterizes the defining activity of the age as scrambling&#151;scrambling for footing on a shifting corporate landscape and scrambling to upgrade software, learning, and financial reserves. He has identified six trends that would reshape the workplace, including emerging networks of specialists, the leveling of labor onto a more horizontal playing field, and the shift toward lifelong learning.</P>

<P>As employees scramble onto this horizontal playing field, a winning strategy would include entrepreneurial skills: flexibility, initiative, independence, and a lifelong learner's desire to anticipate and master the skills required to compete for the jobs in the 21st century. The benefits of such lifelong learning are not extras that will secure the best employment, but necessities that will help secure any employment in the future. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Labor Department projects that most of the 24.6 million new jobs added to the U.S. economy from l990 to 2005 will be high-skill positions requiring more training than most of the jobs they will replace.</P>

<P>By nature, home schooling encourages these entrepreneurial skills. The school day is more flexible, allowing greater opportunity for in-depth study as needed or desired. And learning is an integrated and natural part of the home schooler's life. In a study reported in 1993, University of Michigan assistant professor of education J. Gary Knowles surveyed 53 adults who had been home schooled. Knowles found that 40 percent had attended college and nearly two thirds were self-employed. &#147;That so many of those surveyed were self-employed supports the contention that home schooling tends to enhance a person's self-reliance and independence,&#148; he concluded.</P>

<P><B>The Virtual Workplace</B><BR>
Parents who include on-line access in their home school will provide their children with valuable preparation for the virtual office of the future. Advances in technology and the trend toward outsourcing have created the virtual corporation that, according to Walter Kiechel, has been pared down to its core competencies and sends out for everything else.</P>

<P>In 1993, home-based workers accounted for 33 percent of the adult work force. Of these 41 million workers, 81 percent were self-employed and l 9 percent were telecommuters, according to <I>Home Sweet Office</I> by Jeff Meade (1993, Peterson's Guides).</P>

<P>The National Project on Home-Based Work at City University of New York predicts that the trend toward telecommuting will increase from 6 percent of the adult workforce in 1992 to nearly one-third of the workforce in 2020&#151;a trend made possible by the job skill-level changes that have occurred since l 950 and advances in technology. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of jobs classified as professional has held steady at 20 percent in l950 and l99l and is projected to remain at 20 percent in the year 2000. A complete reversal is projected for unskilled and skilled jobs. In l950 unskilled jobs accounted for 60 percent of the job market, with skilled jobs accounting for 20 percent. The reversal of roles reached a midway point in l99l, with unskilled jobs declining 15 percent to 45 percent and skilled jobs gaining 15 percent to reach 35 percent. By the year 2000, the Bureau predicts the reversal will be complete and continuing, with 65 percent skilled jobs and only 15 percent unskilled jobs.</P>

<P>Advances in technology have made telecommuting and home-based businesses a growing number. As a travel counselor for American Express, Michele Paul answers calls routed automatically to the business telephone line in her home, which is equipped with the same reservations terminal her co-workers use. In the first year after she switched to telecommuting, Ms. Paul's productivity rose 22 percent (Robert E. Calem, &#147;More Working, Less Driving,&#148; April 18, 1993, <I>New York Times</I>).</P>

<P>The telecommuting trend dovetails nicely with some of the advantages of home schooling. Those who work at home can create their own schedules, enjoy fewer interruptions, allocate time flexibly, and include family needs. They gain time that would have been spent commuting, breaking for lunch, and dealing with chatty co-workers. If telecommuting is combined with required days at the office, they can enjoy the break from the structured work week.</P>

<P>Telecommuting, however, demands self-discipline and initiative, two skills constantly encouraged in the home school environment.</P>

<P>Tomorrow's workplace will include many of the tools of today, including a computer, the information highway (cyberspace), modem, fax machine, teleconferencing options on the telephone and computer, and CD-ROM and videodisc technology, pager, and cellular phone. Even in today's workplace, laptop computers and cellular phones can create a virtual office in any location. By 1994, nearly 75 percent of U.S. corporations used an e-mail system. Revenues from video teleconferences have increased dramatically from the $113.3 million received in l990 to exceed $1.4 billion by 1996, according to projections by the Market Intelligence Research Corporation. In August 1994, the top five on-line services included CompuServe (with 2 million subscribers), Prodigy ( l .3 million), America Online (900,000), Delphi (120,000), and Genie ( l00,000). The largest on-line computer network is the Internet. As of l995, more than 20 million people were using &#147;the net&#148; daily, according to the International Internet Association. A 1994 Sprint Business Survey found that 97 percent of mid-size companies used fax to communicate, 75 percent used a toll-free number, 57 percent used voice mail, 49 percent used computer e-mail, and 20 percent used video conferencing. According to <I>Wired</I> magazine and <I>USA Today</I>, North American businesses sent almost 6 billion electronic mail messages in 1993. If each message had 50 words, it would be like sending 1,000 manuscripts the length of <I>War and Peace</I> every day.</P>

<P><B>Changing the Wetware</B><BR>
Enhanced with technology, home schooling can provide one of the more compatible environments for preparing children for the workplace of tomorrow. In prefacing a series of charts outlining the rise of the Information Age, Thomas A. Stewart cautions that &#147;the glories of high tech must not distract us from the enduring wonder that technoweenies call &#145;wetware&#146; Wetware is what you have between your ears" (&#147;The Information Age in Charts&#148;, <I>Fortune</I>, April 4, 1994). One of the most diverse and rich ways to charge a child's wetware is to provide a nurturing, flexible environment such as that found in many home schools, fill the environment with people, paper, and technological resources, and stand to the side.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>The Path of Native American Education: Where Tradition and Technology Meet</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Richard Simonelli</H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I>Native people, while they hold their traditions sacred, are knowledgeable in mainstream ways, including trends in education and technology. Our writer talked with educators at three reservations and with first nation philosophers about issues surrounding Native American education. He found that some leaders and teachers fear that exposure to modern technology in the schools will result in assimilation of young Native people into the non-native culture. Others argue that this technology can be instrumental in preserving and teaching traditions and may even be used to educate the wider society in Native ways. As our writer explains, tradition and technology meet on the first nations' path to the future.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>The educational journey of American Indian students rolls down a long and varied scholastic highway, stretching from reservation preschools and Head Start programs in rural Native communities to prestigious urban universities lying far away from Indian cultural centers. Native American students attend both reservation and urban public schools, private alternative schools, and, increasingly, more than two dozen unique tribal colleges.</P>

<P>The education of modern Indian people thus spans two distinct value systems and two world views: The Native American sacred view encounters the material focus of the wider society. In this encounter lies the possibility for an educational give-and-take, a two-way street on which educational reform might prosper in the winds of cross-cultural dialogue.*</P>

<P><SMALL>(*In 1821, Sequoyah developed his written syllabary for the Cherokee language in the belief that literacy would prove beneficial to his people.)</SMALL></P>

<P><I><IMG SRC="3cheroke.gif" align=left hspace=10>Sequoyah teaches his Cherokee Syllabary.</I></P>

<P><B>Multiple Voices</B></P>

<P>The mainstream voice in this dialogue offers the reemerging First Nations a standardized subject matter plus the latest tools in educational technology. Computer hardware and software, coupled with telecommunications, open up education as never before&#151;and many Indian students and teachers are as excited as anyone about participating.</P>

<P>With its sacred tone, the Native voice in such a dialogue offers values essential to a survivable future. The center of the Indian vision is people and relationships. Indigenous values include cooperation, respect, generosity, courage, wisdom, spirituality, and an integrated, or holistic, world view. Without harmonious communities and societies, what good is the abstract European-American notion of progress with its attendant technological tools?</P>

<P>Native Americans are now gaining access to the information superhighway and acquiring skills crucial for the economic development of reservations. Native communities are cautiously emerging from centuries of isolation and poverty with the help of modern education. But Native people disagree among themselves about the role technology should play in their future. Many feel that their own ways of understanding the world&#151;sometimes called indigenous science&#151;are far less harmful to the earth and to the lives of individuals than is Western science. In some Native communities, technology is applied to daily living in a minimal way so that their culture won't be destroyed. This careful use of technology is termed subsistence science. As the future unfolds, Native American involvement with technology will probably span the spectrum from a little to a lot. How much will depend on the needs of both individuals and communities.</P>

<P><B>Assimilation</B></P>

<P>A few Native American school districts utilize and produce modern technology-based educational tools. The Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, and the Hannahville Indian Community on Michigan's Upper Peninsula have one or more schools that are truly exemplary in their uses of technology. While these schools are not typical of all Indian schools, they do show the direction in which Indian education may be headed.</P>

<P>And that has many Indian people and leaders concerned. They worry that education may be the ultimate agent for assimilating Native societies into mainstream culture&#151;something that Native Americans have resisted ever since European contact some 500 years ago.</P>

<P>Oren Lyons is a respected leader and faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation whose ancestral lands lie in what is today upstate New York. As a chief of the Turtle clan and a college professor, Lyons does what he can to keep his people's history and traditional values alive. Before a gathering of about 2,000 Native American college students in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1992, he expressed his feelings about the tightrope Native people walk as they move deeper into the American educational process.</P>

<UL>
<P>We've always looked upon education as being a way of assimilating our people. And indeed, if you look at the law on Indian education, it says very clearly that its purpose is to assimilate the Indian people into the mainstream of American life. I've always been against assimilation. I've always been for the Nation, for the people. And so, a little warning: As you move through these times, as you take your steps, not only should you look back, but you should walk back and not make education a brain drain from your territories and from your nations. You should go back. Put your efforts back into the people. Support where you come from, because we are in perilous times. Be careful. I'm a teacher; I'm a professor at the University of Buffalo. That tells you what I think about education. I really moved into that position as a defensive measure to catch some of our people before they were totally assimilated. To remind them.</P>
</UL>

<P>Many Native leaders would argue that the best Indian education today combines a solid curriculum in Indian culture and local reservation or urban issues with instruction in academic and vocational subjects assisted by educational technology. The best Indian education reminds people of who they are culturally while simultaneously taking them into the future. But some wonder whether Indian values can survive among all those hard drives and megabytes.</P>

<P>Vine Deloria, Jr., is a Standing Rock Sioux, a noted author, and a professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder. For many Americans, his 1969 blockbuster book <I>Custer Died for Your Sins</I> is synonymous with the Native American drive for self-determination that began in the late 1960s. Professor Deloria writes about the relationship between education and traditional Native culture in his book of essays, <I>Indian Education in America</I>.</P>

<UL>
<P>Education in the English-American context resembles indoctrination more than it does other forms of teaching because it insists on implanting a particular body of knowledge and a specific view of the world which often does not correspond to the life experiences that people have or might be expected to encounter&#133;. Education in the traditional setting occurs by example and not as a process of indoctrination. Elders are the best living examples of education and of what the end product of education and life experiences should be.</P>
</UL>

<P>Deloria's criticism of American education, particularly as it is applied to Indian people, is that it's not education in the true sense at all. Rather, it's a refined vocational training that prepares people to assume roles in the job market. He points out that traditional Native American knowledge enabled people to see their true place and worldly responsibility. In contrast, Deloria says, &#147;Formal American education helps us to understand how things work.&#148; He feels that these two thrusts are worlds apart and that it is important not to confuse the two. &#147;The major shortcoming in American institutional life,&#148; he concludes, &#147;is that most people cannot distinguish these two ways of knowing. For many Americans there is no personal sense of knowing who they are, so professionalism always overrules the concern for persons.&#148;</P>

<P>Knowing who we are implies an inner knowledge, a knowledge of the person that may have little to do with information coming down an electronic superhighway. This kind of knowledge is important to traditional Native people. Here, at this juncture, Native American respect for wisdom and spirituality stands apart from the de facto goals of the dominant culture.</P>

<P>Deloria calls for local control of Native education, emphasizing that &#147;the activity should be perceived as Indian or tribal.&#148; Traditional people, he says, should teach a curriculum that includes tribal histories, languages, customs, and traditions. His vision for Indian education may well be at odds with modern teaching tools and methods already at work in Indian country. But those same tools and methods can be used to educate young Native Americans in just the way Deloria envisions.</P>

<P>Is it really possible for tradition and technology to go hand in hand on the path of Indian education? On at least three reservations they do.</P>

<P><B>White Earth Reservation</B></P>

<P>The Mahnomen school district has about 950 students in grades kindergarten through 12. It is located on the White Earth Indian Reservation&#151;800,000 acres of mixed forest, prairie, and lake-studded lands in northwest Minnesota. The district's commitment to the use of technology in the education of its mixed Ojibwe Indian and non-Indian student body is strong, as the presence of 400 computers attests.</P>

<P>Brent Gish, of Ojibwe descent, is principal of the Mahnomen Elementary School. Of the technological tools in his school, he says: &#147;We have been extremely fortunate, first of all, to have the resources within our school district, and then the support of the administration and our school board, to make technology a real priority, a very high priority. We are one of the leaders in our region, and we're told in the state. There are very few schools with more technology than we have.&#148;</P>

<P>Computer technology in the Mahnomen schools includes automated desktop &#147;teacher tools,&#148; such as report card, lesson plan, and record keeping for outcome-based education. Gish speaks with pride of this wider computer usage: &#147;We're all connected by electronic mail. The teachers are able to communicate back and forth.&#148; He also is proud of the student setup. &#147;We have business labs with technology; we have writing labs at the high school. Children have access to computers in the classroom, as well as in lab situations, that are all connected with server units. We can call up one program and serve the entire student population. We have projection capabilities. It isn't just drill and practice. It's one of the ways we enrich our basic curriculum.&#148;</P>

<P>The elementary school (K&#150;6), with 160 children, is supported by 35 computers. And computers are just being introduced intensively at the kindergarten level.</P>

<P>Kindergarten teacher Gayle Gish, wife of the principal, is a non-Indian who has lived on the White Earth Reservation for more than 20 years. She explains that there are very few full-bloods at White Earth, and few children speak Ojibwe or come to school with English as a second language. Yet the staff and students of the Mahnomen schools have produced their own CD-ROM program, &#147;Culture and History of the White Earth Ojibwe,&#148; which includes Ojibwe language instruction as well as history, geography, and appearances by local Native leaders. The language curriculum is supplementary; in class and through the use of this program, teachers hope to rejuvenate and expand interest in spoken Ojibwe among both students and their parents.</P>

<P>Gayle Gish says that her kindergarten kids take to computer instruction immediately; it's natural for them, having been TV viewers all their lives. To the little ones, computers are just two-way TVs. She speaks ardently of the connection her students have formed with computer instruction. &#147;My children, starting with kindergarten, have no fears of it. This is just an extension of their lives. I suggest that the parents come in so they can learn with their children. Even though the kids are only five years old, they have knowledge they don't even realize they have because they're experimenting without fear.&#148;</P>

<P>The establishment, maintenance, and effectiveness of the large networked computer system at the Mahnomen schools would not have been possible without the encouragement and expertise of Kent Estey. An Ojibwe born and raised on the White Earth Reservation, Estey received a degree in mass communications from nearby Bemidji State University, then left Minnesota for a while to work in radio, TV, and sales. Traveling around with his 1984 Macintosh, he learned everything he could about the Mac from books and courses.</P>

<P>On his return home in the late 1980s, Estey worked as a paraprofessional in special education for the school district. He began to observe what was going on with computers and education, becoming a fervent proponent of the transition to technology which he knew the schools must make. A computer position with the district was created for him, and as he tells it, his part-time hobby became a full-time job. &#147;Now I feel like I'm playing every day because it's so exciting&#151;and the kids are enjoying it. But it's taken a lot of salesmanship on my part. There are teachers who've been here for 30 years, and all of a sudden there are computers on their desks. I tell them, &#145;You can do this! You have to believe that you can do this!&#146;&#148;</P>

<P>In demonstrating technology use in White Earth education, Estey sometimes encounters disparaging comments. He speaks to such deprecation eloquently.</P>

<UL><P>There are those who say that Indian people don't learn using these new tools and [that] they are in conflict with some of the traditions. My belief is we're never going back. And there are those who would like to keep us in the woods in the tipi and not let us move forward, [but] we're moving ahead. We find that our kids absolutely love the computer and are comfortable with it. And they know that in a job today they're going to run into a computer. But there are those who have given us some flack. &#147;Isn't this against your tradition?&#148; They're non-Native people&#151;and that's what's interesting. It's non-Native people who've been the most critical of our program because they profess to be knowledgeable about Native Americans. Our response has been: &#147;Who would you rather have producing Native American software than the Native American people from the reservation you're talking about?&#148; Non-Indians are concerned about &#147;preserving the heritage,&#148; and they want us to stay back there and not move forward. Isn't that a form of prejudice?</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Pine Ridge and Hannahville Reservations</B></P>

<P>Misty Brave is a 1992 Christa McAuliffe Educator and a teacher of high school biology in the village of Kyle, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. She is of Sicangu Lakota background; her people come from the Rosebud Reservation, which lies just east of Pine Ridge. It is a large reservation of 2.8 million acres and is a home of the Lakota (Sioux) people, whose portrayal in Dances with Wolves opened up channels of understanding between Native people and the rest of North American society.</P>

<P>Little Wound School, with an enrollment of 750 students in grades K&#150;12, is committed to using computers and especially multimedia as part of regular instruction. At the school, Brave and her students mix tradition and technology daily so that students may meet the future, keep their traditions, and contribute to global understanding.</P>

<P>Brave confesses to having had a &#147;Mac attack.&#148; In other words, she's a passionate supporter of educational technology. She likes to describe one great moment in cross-cultural education made possible by advanced telecommunications. Her students were linked via picture phone with students at another school in the Midwest, which had just stopped using an Indian mascot for one of its sports teams. As students on both ends of the hookup viewed each other live, one of Brave's students asked a child at the other end, &#147;Do we look like Indians?&#148; Across the audio portion of the telelink came a tiny voice: &#147;No. You look like people.&#148;</P>

<P>Little Wound School uses two-way teleteaching hookups with other schools in South Dakota. Enthusiastic about teaching in this manner, Brave says, &#147;It's a good way to share your knowledge with people who are not immediately with you.&#148; When asked if anything is missing in teleteaching, compared with classroom teaching, she thinks for a moment. &#147;Maybe,&#148; she says. &#147;Maybe some of the humanness, some of the closeness. But it's something you get over. It's a mind-set that changes and you get used to.&#148;</P>

<P>Technology and tradition truly follow the same path at Little Wound School, where community elders are an important part of education. They are involved with the placement of spoken Lakota onto HyperCard, and many of the instructors in the Lakota culture curriculum are elders. The community has a foster grandparent program in which members are asked to assist the school as aides. Sometimes they are paid because they offer considerable cultural expertise, but more often than not, they are volunteers who wish to be deeply involved with the education of the young people.</P>

<P><I><IMG SRC="3navajo.gif" align=right hspace=10>Navajo &#147;Sunday&#148; Saddle Blanket, Circa 1870s.</I></P>

<P>Is Misty Brave concerned that extensive use of technology will erode Indian culture?</P>

<UL>
<P>I don't think technology encourages assimilation. When you're working with computers&#151;that's the medium that kids are using these days&#151;you've got to go with the flow. Go with what attracts them. My kids want to show others their values of wisdom, respect, generosity, and courage with these new things. My message to these kids has always been: &#147;Be different. You don't have to be like everybody else.&#148; I let kids know that it's OK to be different; it's OK for one to like the computer, and for another to hate it. Assimilation? No! There will never be. The new technology is just another way of showing us to people.</P>
</UL>

<P>The Potawatomi tribe is yet another Native group combining ancestral ways with the use of technology. The Hannahville Indian Community on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a small, 2,850-acre reservation, has a K&#150;12 school of 100 students supported by 40 computers.</P>

<P>Science and math teacher Rich Sgarlotti champions the use of computers at the school. He points out that in biology classes, for instance, the use of dissection simulation software fits into the Native culture's reverence for animal life because it means that fewer specimens are killed. Both students and teachers at Hannahville's school are free to take computers home, thereby improving access to technology for parents and others whose economic means may be low.</P>

<P><B>Where the Path Begins</B></P>

<P>The First Nations of North America have survived 500 years of cultural erosion and are reemerging into a new springtime. Education of all sorts plays an important role in this reemergence, and traditional values remain a guiding light for Native people. The Four Worlds Development Project of Lethbridge, Alberta&#151;an organization dedicated to individual and community wellness for Native people&#151;sums it up: &#147;Through the guidance of the tribal elders, Native values and traditions are being taught as the primary key to un-locking the force that will move Native peoples on the path of their own development. The elders have prophesied that by returning to traditional values, Native societies can be transformed. This transformation will then have a healing effect on our entire planet.&#148;</P>

<P>Technology and tradition can meet and walk in harmony on the path to Native education, as evidenced in the schools at White Earth, Pine Ridge, and Hannahville, where mainstream educational techniques, ideas, and technology are held up to the wisdom of Native traditions. And, wisdom is a magical glue that binds together facts and all kinds of knowledge to create real understanding. The whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. Without wisdom&#151;facts, information, and especially knowledge become downright dangerous. But what is wisdom? Where is it found? And what is our purpose in seeking it?</P>

<P>These are questions education should never stop asking.</P>

<HR>

<P><B><I><IMG SRC="tsizer.gif" align=left hspace=10>Like Don Quixote, Theodore Sizer is on a crusade, a quest for educational reform. Sizer is professor of education and chair of the Coalition of Essential Schools at Brown University in Providence, R.I. A former history instructor and headmaster at Phillips Academy, Andover, and former dean of the Graduate School of Education at Harvard, Sizer is author of the 1984 landmark </I>Horace's Compromise: the Dilemma of the American High School.<I> His new book, </I>Horace's School: Redesigning the American High School<I> (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1992), again features Sizer's alter ego, English teacher Horace Smith, at the fictional Franklin High. Horace and his colleagues, like Sizer and Quixote, are on a quest for reform at Franklin. </I>TECHNOS<I> talked to Ted Sizer about &#147;Horace's School,&#148; educational reform, and using technology in schools.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P><B><I>If one word describes your philosophy, it's &#145;empowerment&#146;&#151; that of the community, the teachers, the students. You're talking about a basic change in philosophy and attitudes, of a shift in power.</I></B></P>

<P>As a historian, I call myself Don Quixote. Indeed, the ideas that inform the American high school have been around for 90 years. Various sturdy assaults have been made on it, but it remains pretty much intact. There are exceptions to the rule, such as the way we treat kids with special needs. We put the blind kid in a closet in 1950, and we mainstreamed him in 1990. That's a major change&#151;in attitude as well as practice. But, by and large, we still have English, math, social studies, science, broken up into 52-minute periods with tests for review. That's the way it was in 1893.</P>

<P><B><I>How many Don Quixotes will it take to change the situation?</I></B></P>

<P>Putting aside our Spanish friend, I think the realistic among us in this project said, &#145;If one of five schools can pull it off, that's a great deal.&#146; The question is, how many schools do you need to get a 20 percent that really has an impact? We remain not only Quixote-esque but also determined that we can do a lot better by kids in this country. And it is no real insult to our forebears to suggest that the ideas that they espoused in the 1890s can probably be reformed. Further, I think that in contrast with the political climate when we started in the mid-1980s [1984-85], it's much more promising today. Even though we have in many cases a financial crisis, there is much more informed interest about serious improvement of schools of an ambitious sort than was the case as recently as eight years ago.</P>

<P><B><I>In your book, you call for teachers to know and to respect students. Don't kids today have problems that need more attention than just a well-intentioned team of teachers with fewer students in their classes can provide?</I></B></P>

<P>That's true. But you have to ask, &#145;Compared to what?&#146; Research that a group of us did in the early 1980s identified a group of kids referred to as the &#145;unspecial majority.&#146; It's true that the majority of kids go through school not really known very well by any adult. The kind of rearrangement and the reducing of the number of kids per teacher [80 to 1] that is suggested in <I>Horace's School</I> simply sets up a condition whereby a determined teacher has a fighting chance of really being able to get to know each youngster. That's not to say that just because three or four teachers really know little Jimmy that they're going to be able to address all of his problems. But it sure is a light year ahead of the way it used to be.</P>

<P><B><I>They can at least call him by name.</I></B></P>

<P>That's right. And the record in Coalition schools where they've reduced the number of students per class is a record of sharply decreased dropping out and sharply increased attendance and sharply reduced disciplinary problems. It's always nice when practice follows what one thought was a common sense conclusion.</P>

<P><B><I>The word &#145;technology&#146; doesn't appear until well over 150 pages into your book. You finally acknowledge the &#145;key&#146; that technology can be, calling it &#145;a central part of an individual's new means to the end of a consequential education.&#146; What are your thoughts about the use of technology in education?</I></B></P>

<P>A couple of things: First, my experience in schools is that the existing technology&#151;if &#145;technology&#146; means computers and sophisticated audiovisual equipment&#151;by and large, these are handmaidens of the existing assumptions. That is, you take the existing curriculum and work up drill exercises. Or, if you're more imaginative, you take the existing physics curriculum and create a computer-based game. Essentially, the reality that I and my colleagues have looked at is that of technology as the handmaiden of the existing system, and as such it isn't very important in most schools. The exception&#151;and this is my second point&#151;is with regard to libraries, specifically information systems. I'm impressed in a few libraries to see the beginning, a real flicker, of libraries being real information centers of a very profound kind.</P>

<P>For instance, let's say you have a dynabook, with instantaneous access to an entire encyclopedia. And let's assume that dynabook is truly accessible to the poorest kid at the school. And Internet, an on-line information system, is available. What if you can cut your dynabook into Internet? And what if there were visual as well as other forms of interactive communication? You could completely rethink school.</P>

<P><B><I>Absolutely.</I></B></P>

<P>And our friends at IBM, with whom I've talked most about this, say that technically, this is a possibility. We know how to do technologically most of what such a system would require. The problem is cost, which, granted, is a fundamental one. The other&#151;and far more difficult&#151;problem is changing people's habits.</P>

<P><B><I>What do you think of technologies like interactive videodisc and the prospect of virtual reality in the classroom?</I></B></P>

<P>I think they're like all good teaching tools, dumb animals. It depends to what use we put them. Interactive videodiscs only make sense when you have a situation where interaction is absolutely necessary and the parties involved have the incentive to interact. Technology follows pedagogy&#151;not the other way around. There's no point in having technology if you can't use it. We have a lot of examples of people having a new hunk of technology saying, &#145;How can we use this?&#146; And we know that a lot of that equipment is just sitting, gathering dust in closets. Why? Because the system is driven by different ideas. Change the ideas! Make those ideas such that it's impossible to achieve what you want to achieve without the use of technology.</P>

<P>For instance, a humble, but very important way to illustrate this is with word processing. If I'm an English teacher and I want a student to revise his paper 17 times, I need a word processor. Ideally, that word processor would be on line, so if I sit at home, I can just tune into the paper that the student has at home or at school. And, in fact, the computer sets it up in such a way that I don't need a red pencil anymore. Essentially, I can red pencil his paper&#151;in real time&#151;and the kid sitting at home can actually see me do it.</P>

<P>Now, my goodness! Wouldn't that accelerate the process? Those of us who taught in the 1950s and those of us who teach in the 1990s have seen&#151;in favored schools where there are word processors&#151;significant change in the way we can teach and in the quality of the work.</P>

<P><B><I>You mentioned &#145;favored schools.&#146; Are we really going to be able to ensure total, free access to technology?</I></B></P>

<P>Well, in an absolute sense, it's probably impossible. But as an objective, it's a very high priority. We can't afford to have a significant sector of our population that's easily pushed around intellectually, conned by slick advertising, and simply paralyzed when faced with something new in the workplace or in the home. Of course, when one talks about technology, one has to expect more of the kids. There is an army waiting to be mobilized in schools, and it's the adolescents.</P>

<P><B><I>You say in your book that we should give them more responsibility.</I></B></P>

<P>Just expect it as routine. We now spend a whole lot of money hiring custodians to sweep up after healthy kids. It's a terrible education! It says there's a free lunch in this world. It's also an incredible waste of resources. Kids should have a sense of shared obligation, of ownership. They should say, &#145;This is our school. And it's our school, even after a pep rally.&#146; You can't do this in big schools, of course. But it just radiates from schools which are small enough so that people have a sense that they're part of something. How do you do that in a school with 5,000 kids? It's impossible.</P>

<P><B><I>Some of our inner-city schools have so many other problems to deal with.</I></B></P>

<P>But our experience in the Coalition is, in schools serving kids who are under tremendous pressure outside, those schools which are small, and simple, and focused, and demanding&#151;and that get those teacher loads down&#151;are schools that have very high attendance rates. And the kids end up doing all sorts of things they weren't supposed to do, like stay in school, get a diploma, and go to college. On one level, it's really not all that complicated.</P>

<P><B><I>Let's go back to the subject of technology for a moment. Do you think past instructional technologies have been used well?</I></B></P>

<P>I haven't, as a historian, really delved into it. As a practical school person, I was particularly struck by the impact of the hand calculator. The difference in the teaching of mathematics and physics in the school at which I was principal from 1972 to 1981 radically changed. In 1972 the math department forbade calculators; in the late 1970s, the department assigned them, thereby profoundly accelerating the serious mathematics and physics that was taught. Now, there is a modestly priced bit of quite sophisticated technology which had a real and physical impact.</P>

<P><B><I>Your earlier comments about library on-line information systems brings up an interesting point. John Abbott, the director of Britain's reform movement, Education 2000, tells us that in some cases they've seen a 300 percent increase in the number of books checked out of libraries through those systems. Not only is the computer user friendly, it's bringing kids back to books.</I></B></P>

<P>I'm familiar with Education 2000, and John and I have spoken many times. My hunch is the primary reason the students are going back to books is that it has less to do with technology than with the ingenious, attractive quality of the questions being posed by and through the technology. People read things when they're engaged and interested. Whether I tell them, or whether they are attracted by something from their computer, people work on things that they find inherently interesting and important to them.</P>

<P><B><I>Is there a connection among the nine principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools, England's Education 2000 principles, and America 2000 goals?</I></B></P>

<P>I doubt whether the English Education 2000 had much of an impact on America 2000, though I don't know. America 2000 is an interesting grab bag that was put together very fast, I gather. And indeed, there are parts of it that are contradictory. You have American achievement tests where something called &#145;the nation&#146; tells kids what to study, but this clashes with the concept of &#145;choice.&#146; Some of my English friends call that &#145;Maggie Thatcher's choice plan,&#146; whereby local entities are allowed to run the schools as long as they meet the definition of education devised by a centralized authority. Now, I don't mean this very critically&#151;it would be nice if those principles would fit coherently into America 2000, but I don't think that's what [U.S. Department of Education] Secretary [Lamar] Alexander felt he could do. As a result, some of America 2000 is very supportive and consistent with the kinds of things my friends in Coalition schools are doing. The notion of &#145;break-the-mold&#146; schools, for example, is simply the assertion that we can do better in this country in the way we think about learning in the schools. What isn't consistent is the notion that some small group of people will figure out cheap tests that will measure learning.</P>

<P><B><I>You argue against standardized testing.</I></B></P>

<P>Sure. The notion that the kind of standards we really need would be measured by these tests flies in the face of what we know about such tests. We'll end up with tests that don't test that which we really value.</P>

<P><B><I>What about financing educational reform? In your book, you call it a &#145;forlorn society&#146; that must rely on lotteries to finance its schools.</I></B></P>

<P>To me, it's appalling. It's funny on one level&#151;that we're using lottery funds, which depend on an ignorant population, a more desperate population. Or when we expect schools to go begging&#151;that public education depends on a bake sale or the generosity of the local bank. That says a lot about us as a people that is very embarrassing.</P>

<P><B><I>We'd hope that we could again finance our schools as we began to, with public funds from taxes. But these days we're hearing more and more that it's just impossible.</I></B></P>

<P>It's a matter of political will.</P>

<P><B><I>Yes, but our politicians are telling us that we have to go out to corporations to do this.</I></B></P>

<P>That, to me, corrupts the system. And it's unworthy of our democratic tradition. I think it's a very sad statement that we can spend hundreds of millions to put a corrupt Kuwaiti government back in place, but we can't find a few millions to invest in better schools. I understand the politics of that, but to say there isn't money is simply an evasion of the responsibility.</P>

<P><B><I><IMG SRC="1sizerbk.gif" align=left hspace=10>That brings to mind privatization. In your book you mention &#145;entrepreneurs in the private sector,&#146; specifically Chris Whittle and his $60 million Edison Project to design a system of &#145;break-the-mold&#146; schools in the United States. It seems you don't like the idea, but you recognize the potential for change.</I></B></P>

<P>Yes. I think Chris Whittle is terrific. If he's successful, he's going to show the public sector that it's inefficient and it's arrogantly unwilling to think of schooling in different ways.</P>

<P><B><I>So you see the value of his project not so much as producing better schools, but to shake us all up?</I></B></P>

<P>Right. And I wish him very well. The possibility of the Edison Project is that it will gather people who can look at much more powerful ways of moving serious learning by kids forward. It's an embarrassment to me, as an American, to acknowledge that we may need to do what he's doing. But given the present political climate, I say, &#145;Three cheers for Chris Whittle for taking the risk.&#146; It's a horrendous risk, because he'll be fought every inch of the way. The difficulty in community after community after community where my friends are trying to change their schools is that nobody really supports them. So a little competition out there&#151;a little bit of Avis trying harder&#151;is going to help.</P>

<P><B><I>Is there a risk in privatization of someone teaching his or her own ideas? Can we trust these people to do what's right?</I></B></P>

<P>I think we have the risk right now represented by the private sector in the textbook industry. The American textbook industry is really controlled by fewer than six companies. To say that there isn't a major for-profit influence in public schools now is to fly in the face of common sense. So, the public schools are already somewhat privatized, and that's OK. What I'm concerned about&#151;as I think all of us are&#151;is to keep a variety of influences in the schools. Just as I'm against a single national exam or exam system, so too am I against only a small number of textbook companies, the choices of their products being made by highly centralized state textbook committees.</P>

<P>I think our freedom and the likelihood that the best material will win out depends on a truly open market of ideas and materials. If that be privatization, so be it. It has less to do with public and private forms of management and control than it does with a public system that deliberately encourages all kinds of participants and influences, some of which are supported by public authorities, and some of which are supported by private authorities.</P>

<P><B><I>One final question just out of curiosity. What is the reaction of American universities to the Coalition and your philosophies? Are they going to help train teachers for the Essential Schools?</I></B></P>

<P>There's not been much interest.</P>

<P><B><I>Really?</I></B></P>

<P>Yes. As a former dean of a school of education and a long-time &#145;denizen&#146; of higher education, I'm not surprised by that. I'm a little hurt by it, but not surprised.</P>

<P><B><I>Why?</I></B></P>

<P>They really don't feel the pressure of the need for consequential change the way the schools do. The majority of the people in the universities really don't understand what's going on or keep up with the fact that society's changing and that what kids need in 1992 is different from what they needed in 1981. It's been 10 years since I've been a high school principal, but just in listening to my friends I know that the world has shifted in interesting ways. And the good teachers are with the world as it shifts. So, people like me who pontificate at universities pontificate for days past. We hate to admit it&#151;it hurts us a lot&#151;but that's what we're doing. So many of my old friends at universities, to put it cruelly, don't have a clue. They don't understand the world as it is.</P>

<P><B><I>That's a scary thought.</I></B></P>

<P>It's very scary and it's very poignant. And, of course, I can say these things because I'm one of them.</P>

<P><B><I>You have such idealistic views about education and what we can do for it, and yet you're a realist.</I></B></P>

<P>Well, maybe it's my training in history. You've gotta have a bit of both. It's awful&#151;like being a parent is awful. You wish the world for every child, but you learn that they do lose their sweaters.</P>

<P><B><I>To ensure its students enjoy the benefits of on-line access, the San Francisco Day School has addressed community concerns with a full menu of student and parent education, Internet workshops, student Internet use policy and materials, and a parent volunteer program.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>It happened at the beginning of this year. Our school went on line with full Internet access&#151;high speed and in full media. Generous donations, an excited faculty, a terrific Internet provider, and a helpful phone company resulted in a swift transition into the information age. The San Francisco Day School's (SFDS) administration and faculty decided that the first phase of Internet access development would be to create a small but powerful computer center in the library, since we view the Internet as an information source and, therefore, a fundamental library function.</P>

<P>Faculty and students alike were very excited about the access to new sources of information. Images, text, sound, and video from millions of sources on and off the planet are available via the Internet from places like the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Virginia; the Hubble telescope in space; and the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The opportunity for rapid communication with the NASA space crew on the Space Shuttle, relief information on the Kobe earthquake in Japan, and cooperation and response from the global community open doors to different ways of teaching and learning.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2censo1.gif" align=right hspace=10><I>As one parent talks with teacher Jennifer Spaeth (wearing the black turtleneck) in the background, another parent volunteer works alongside the students at the Internet center in the San Francisco Day School's library.</I></P>

<P><B>Concerns and Benefits of Internet Access</B><BR>
The school community recognized early the need for a student Internet use policy. School faculty, parents, and I struggled to come up with a plan. The community was concerned that students would access inappropriate material and that student privacy needs could be compromised. The SFDS Technology Planning Committee, with the help of library parent volunteers, evaluated potential approaches to managing Internet access. The committee, which I chair, is comprised of 13 teachers and administrators who have worked to understand the concerns and the benefits involved in giving our students access to electronic information. The responsibilities of the committee include making recommendations for planning the technology program at SFDS.</P>

<P>Among other challenges faced by the committee was the representation of the Internet in the media. The media tends to pay more attention to access to pornography and inappropriate materials than to the educational potential of electronic information. To balance this representation, the SFDS Technology Committee identified the benefits of on-line access, which include using technology as a critical thinking tool to encourage students to make informational connections and identify degrees of relatedness. Teachers commented on the advantages of technology in integrating the curricula of all subjects, addressing different learning styles through multimedia, and giving students access to more information sources and communication potential than had previously been available. The SFDS faculty are also excited about how the use of networks and multimedia could change portfolio student evaluation. Educators are enthusiastic about interschool collaboration on research projects and the ability to access up-to-date information relating to their subjects.</P>

<P>The SFDS Technology Committee was also worried about students' accessing inappropriate material on line and giving out personal information that could be used by individuals who want to harm children. These issues and others are being addressed by educators through curriculum design and integration that focuses on the use of on-line services and electronic media as a critical thinking tool.</P>

<P>A survey of the fifth- to eighth-grade students at SFDS showed that approximately 30 percent of upper-school children have on-line access at home, with most of them acquiring access within the last year. This discovery underlined the need for a school education program aimed at teaching students and parents common-sense safety practices. When children &#147;go on line,&#148; they leave the building and may meet other people on their journey-other students, teachers, professional experts, or friends. They could also engage in conversations in cyberspace and encounter Internet users who may want to harm children. Just as we educate our children to make intelligent choices when they exit the home environment, we also need to help them exercise common sense when they exit the school environment and travel the planet via wires and satellite.</P>

<P>Traveling on line is also like entering a very large bookstore. Some of the information is not appropriate for children. Such information can be found through a directed search or simply be stumbled upon. Students need guidance on what material is acceptable to access, just as they would in a bookstore. Students will be less confused if the educational message regarding safe and smart use of on-line services is fairly consistent between home and school.</P>

<P>From a technological standpoint, trying to control conversational space and access to inappropriate material at the school would be extremely difficult if not impossible. Some students invariably will excel at manipulating networks and getting around any controls that a system's administrator might put into place. Because of this, and because many of our students have access at home, SFDS chose an approach that focuses on parent and student education as well as student supervision.</P>

<P><B>Education and Supervision</B><BR>
To encourage a more united community approach to managing student use of the Internet, SFDS developed a parent education and volunteer program. Our efforts to involve parents include sending home educational materials and a student contract and conducting monthly workshops on how to use Internet tools. In addition, the Internet center's parent volunteers help develop student use policies and are responsible for supervising and helping students who use the Internet to access computers outside of class time. Parent volunteer suggestions and ideas are critical in developing the management policy for Internet use in the library. When parent volunteers explore the Internet with students in the library, they help the school community come to a consensus about what materials are deemed inappropriate.</P>

<P>A brochure regarding child safety and the use of on-line services is also included in materials sent home with the students. The brochure, &#147;Child Safety on the Information Highway,&#148; was written by Lawrence J. Magid, a syndicated columnist for the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, and produced by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Interactive Services Association. The brochure clearly explains the risks of on-line access and outlines ways to reduce them while using on-line resources. The guidelines ask parents to take responsibility for and become involved in their children's use of on-line services. Parents are also urged to mention the importance of not giving out personal, identifying information. The brochure includes a section titled &#147;My Rules for On-Line Safety&#148;, which is meant to be detached and put near the computer to help remind children of their responsibilities.</P>

<P>Also included in the informational package SFDS sends home to students and parents is a Student Acceptable Use Contract. This contract clearly outlines both parent and child responsibilities and is to be read and signed by both. The contract was modified from a document made available on the Internet by the California Department of Education. This and other information can be found on the Department of Education's gopher server at:</P>
<P><CODE>gopher://gopher.inform.umd.edu/11/Educational_Resources/AcademicResourcesByTopic/<BR>EducationResources/K-12/CalDeptofEducation</CODE></P>

<P>Any students signing the contract must assert that &#147;as a representative of the school, [they] will accept personal responsibility for reporting any misuse of the network to the system administrator.&#148; The contract states that &#147;misuse can come in many forms, but it is commonly viewed as any message(s) sent or received that indicate or suggest pornography, unethical or illegal solicitation, racism, sexism, inappropriate language, and other issues described below.&#148; The contract also requires that the student be polite, use appropriate language, and follow privacy guidelines. Students are taught how to exit quickly from inappropriate material they may have stumbled upon on line. The consequences of not following school guidelines include loss of use and service benefiting the technology program.</P>

<P>When parents sign the contract, they state that they &#147;accept full responsibility for supervision if and when [their] child's use is not in a school setting.&#148; Teachers, through the contract, maintain that they will &#147;agree to instruct the student on acceptable use of the network and proper network etiquette.&#148;</P>

<P>SFDS offers parents monthly hands-on workshops on how to use Internet tools and explore electronic information with their children. Emphasis is placed on using the computer as a tool to bring people together and share experiences. Many of the parents who participate have little experience with computers and no experience with on-line services, and through the workshops they become more comfortable learning how to use new technologies. The workshops generate so much enthusiasm that parents who have attended them often become involved in the parent volunteer program of the school's Internet center.</P>

<P><B>The Parent Volunteer Program</B><BR>
When teachers bring their classes to the library to research information or to communicate via e-mail, they are responsible for student supervision. After school, the library is open for students to explore information on their own time. Since the librarian has many responsibilities at this time, additional supervision was needed at the Internet center.</P>

<P>The Internet center's parent volunteer program helps the school increase the level of supervision of student Internet use and creates opportunities for parents to become much more knowledgeable about Internet access issues. Parent volunteers are responsible for ensuring that students abide by library computer use policies and do not access inappropriate material, supporting student research as much as possible, sharing the students' experiences, and learning about Internet access from the students.</P>

<P>The parent volunteer program can benefit the school community. Increased parental involvement in schools has been identified by the California State Assembly as a way to improve student performance. To encourage this involvement, a new California law allows parents to take time off from work to participate in their children's school activities. The Family-School Partnership Act, Assembly Bill 2590, became state law on January 1. The act was authored by State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin when she was still a state assemblywoman. Eastin commented that &#147;when schools work collaboratively with families, studies show that students have higher grades and test scores, better attendance, fewer placements in special education, more positive attitudes and behavior, higher graduation rates, and greater enrollment in postsecondary education.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Conclusions</B><BR>
The Internet is an incredible information resource and a powerful communication tool. The ability to use new technologies is becoming a more important factor in career options, and the future success of today's students will be more affected by their understanding of and ability to access and use electronic information. The increased use of on-line services in the home by children adds to the impetus for schools to take a more active role in family education regarding their use.</P>

<P>Schools have the potential to be access points and educational centers for exploring Internet resources. Increased involvement of parents in school education programs can help address community concerns and can improve their children's overall academic performance. If educators assume responsibility for helping students master the use of technology and educating them about potential risks, students will become more empowered to make intelligent choices.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Partnering: Myths and Realities</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Ray L. Steele</H3>
<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="2chess.gif" align=left hspace=10>Individuals often talk and write about new and creative project strategies, conceptual approaches to corporate-education deal making and magical partnerships&#133; those partnerships with mystical &#147;freebies&#148; for education and no expectations from altruistic corporations&#133; the kind of partnerships that are a bit hard to find in operation. If forging a partnership were so easy, so predictable a process, why, then, are almost 16,000 school districts and about 3,300 higher education institutions without one? They could and should be in important three-way partnerships among modern schools, ambitious communities, and aggressive employers competing in the most challenging times that most of the U.S. population has ever known. Education would be much better than it is and our cumulative future more secure. Such partnerships are not impossible, but they also are not easy.</P>

<P><B>Pursuing Positive Change</B></P>

<P>While most of what follows can be applied to education, K&#150;G (kindergarten-graduate) in general, some sensitivity for the limits in understanding K&#150;12 problems should be addressed early on, due to the renewed attention K&#150;12 has received in the 1990s.</P>

<P>Technology is a tool and nothing more. It is not an end, just a means for students and teachers to help improve the teaching-learning process. Curriculum is another issue, and when the two are inextricably intertwined in a project initially, the conflict that often follows compromises major technological improvement efforts. Partnerships must be clear in terms of their purpose and goals. Simple is always best.</P>

<P>Although universities and school districts must be sensitive to community and corporate interests and needs in the area of curriculum reform, the academics at whatever level must be allowed to lead the process of changing the curriculum. Using a technology project as the bait for curriculum shift usually compromises the acceptance of the technology. It surely minimizes the likelihood of the completion of a major system.</P>

<P>There can be no doubt in 1993, for the informed, that we are in the Information Age. We have reached some broadly acceptable conclusions about our society, and the implications for improving education and for implementing technology partnerships are somewhat easier to connect with than they were 10 years ago.</P>

<P>We are living in a time of global competition in which any U.S. leadership in any field, including education, is subject to challenge. Quality and updated education and training are both critical to a competitive work force. We cannot compete for long without replenishing our work force. With the baby boomers wishing to enjoy retirement in the next decade, the work force is about to be depleted, with some of the most educated leading the way into early retirement. These same retirees are also those taxpayers least likely to wish to bear any cuts in Social Security in response to deficit reduction plans. They are also unlikely to support willingly local tax hikes for education reform as they jealously guard their fixed-income-based retirement lifestyles.</P>

<P>The context of the world in which most of these potential retirees have succeeded is technology rich. They can understand how expensive it is to train new workers in the very basic tools of the workplace, especially if these youngsters come from K&#150;G environments that are not information equipped. The most basic argument for using partnerships in pursuing positive change in education may be that we actually can save money, in the long term, in the creation of a modern work force for a globally competitive economy. We can invest now in creating Information Age environments in which we educate and train that work force for the 1990s.</P>

<P>Too much time today is spent on teaching basics of common technology in the workplace, when instead it should be a common part of the tools within the learning environment that teachers and students take for granted. The latter situation would lead to a more modernized marketplace where more new employees demand that the businesses where they work modernize in order to compete. Positive change would result, not endless arguments over curriculum change, which compromises context modernization. Curriculum change is important, but it is a different venue.</P>

<P><B>Essentials of Effective Partnerships</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Win-Win Situations.</B> After almost a quarter century in education, I have found few successful education entities or businesses that were driven by pure altruism. All successful partnerships must be founded in mutual interest and mutual benefit. Neither side is as good as it should be in understanding the needs of the other, in my opinion. Both are often trapped by frozen evaluations, outdated perceptions, and artificial limitations on their relationships. If we do not set the realistic limits of any relationship between business and education&#151;and if we cannot articulate with some persuasiveness the overall social arguments that K&#150;12 superintendents, campus presidents, and senior company officials should publicly recognize to be of mutual interest&#151;there is no foundation to begin the creation of a partnership. This is one area often taken for granted, and it is an omission that often creates the basis for failure in education/corporate partnerships.</P>

<LI><P><B>Fearless Leaders.</B> Leadership of both the education and the corporate entity must be involved at the beginning when the basic goals are established for the partnership. This is not a function easily delegated early. Once the basic goals are accepted, there is a perceived reference point with some authority that can be used by those delegated the project leadership role in order to discipline the project as it proceeds. The typical problem is that a general goal for a partnership must be evolved into specific actions leading to one outcome that is good for the whole, not just for a few special interests. These local interests will work tirelessly and naturally, within any bureaucracy, to pursue their own more limited agenda. Without the benefit of leadership's acceptance of the overall goal, there is no discipline possible to keep the whole project on track. As a consultant creating partnerships, I know the first sign of failure is leadership's reluctance to be involved early on. Unit heads will interpret this reluctance as a signal of business as usual, and the partnership on either side will be compromised to just that. A relationship of trust and a comfort zone that can be publicly shown between the partners and the consultant are critical to progress in partnership projects.</P>

<LI><P><B>Risk Takers.</B> The ultimate function of the consultant at this point is to assure both sides at the leadership level that the ultimate goal will be pursued stubbornly and that neither side will be treated unfairly once the project goes into each side's organizational structure. &#147;All oxen gored equally&#148; is the rule. The consultant may be an insider from one of the institutions in the partnership. He or she must be sufficiently protected&#151;in other words, hold a tenured professorship or have the promise of a new assignment at project's end&#151;in order to avoid self-protective compromises when the project gets to the pressure points. The consultant must also have technology knowledge for credibility and human interpersonal and negotiation skills to keep the process moving. Having done these projects from inside my own organization twice in the 1980s and numerous times from my company position as outside consultant, I know that it costs the partner more in dollars to do it from the outside. But I also know it is inestimably easier to succeed. For, no matter who you are as an insider, you must be willing to play &#147;you bet your job&#148; at some point, if you are to succeed. At least, those who may oppose the inevitable change brought to the system by the partnership must believe that you are taking the risk, if you are to move them. Generally, they will not bet <I>their </I>jobs; therefore, change may be accepted only grudgingly as an alternative.</P>

<LI><P><B>Flexibility, Responsibility, Commitment.</B> Another essential of effective partnerships is the willingness to operate flexibly while being faced with ambiguity in the partnership project. These education/corporate partnerships are not done as business as usual. Progress is uneven and processes are changed sometimes just to break mind-sets that do not allow for creative new solutions. Not everything attempted works on the first try, and not everything is reduced to one actionable contract that will please legal counsel, at least early on.</P>

<P>Each partner must be willing to bring those resources most appropriate to each organization to the table. Both inevitably will have some financial resources involved. The telephone or computer company, for instance, must realize that its technical and installation resources as well as equipment are critical. The education institution often has people, time, and some expertise available, as well as an environment in which testing, experimentation, and training may be of value. Each side will find some resistance to any shift in current resources, including the resource of time. The most common problem with &#147;showcase&#148; partnerships is that people within a company are not used to doing the extras in a project to make it a showcase. In addition, people within the education institution are the first to want to restrict access to the completed showcase because of its impact on their time. If the partnership is to benefit either, neither can be allowed to compromise the commitment. A public commitment, up front, helps to forestall this problem.</P>

<LI><P><B>Plans for the Long Term.</B> The last essential is, perhaps, the hardest reality partnerships must face. Even though it impacts each side's resources, the partnership project must be done at a sufficient size to create critical mass. In addition, financial choices must be determined by long-term value, not short-term savings. It matters little what it costs if it does not work.</P>

<P>Users are the key to any technology partnership's success&#151;in education or in any institution. A mere &#147;classroom of the future&#148; approach basically is faulted in the beginning because it lacks real impact beyond a single experiment or a narrow group of limited-interest users. But a &#147;system&#148;&#151;or &#147;campus of the future&#148;&#151;approach impacts and involves many, if not most, potential users. Its critical mass suggests a long-term commitment to change the education environment, which causes a number of individual users to participate. Change becomes more worthwhile to them.</P>

<P>Every technology project partnership takes longer than it should and costs more than anyone hopes it will. Therefore, if early choices in equipment levels or functionality are made for short-term cost savings, by the time you finish and begin to showcase the project, you simply will be showcasing your shortsightedness. The partnership rule for long-term benefit is: Invest up front and achieve full return as a good showcase partnership.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Partnership Pitfalls</B></P>

<P>Habit is, perhaps, our worst enemy as we pursue opportunities in a time of rapid change. Business as &#147;unusual&#148; and critical questioning of current practice may be at the heart of success for technology partnerships between corporate and education entities. At the heart of failure are a few easily avoided pitfalls.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Neglecting to Check the Law.</B> Some organizations do not challenge or check when their business or legal counsel note that they cannot change current practice in doing special partnerships. In my experience, however, most rules have been self-imposed and often restrict projects. State laws related to telecommunications projects vary and provide interesting options that are easily overlooked by &#147;business as usual&#148; advice. Two of my most successful partnerships were nearly killed when restrictions were assumed to be in effect. When the law was checked, it was discovered that local counsel was operating from an unduly narrow perspective and was not current on the full use of available legal options.</P>

<LI><P><B>Avoidance of Risk.</B> Most organizations operate from convenience of time, habit, and risk-aversion perspectives. It is often easier to note what cannot be done or what is cost prohibitive than to research alternatives that must be explained. Every time this happens, students and faculty stand to lose opportunities. A good example is the practice of using spec bids&#151;or bids made to specifications, which essentially detail all the components of a project&#151;as opposed to using performance bids, which detail the results that must be accomplished.</P>

<P>Complex technology projects occur infrequently, involve constantly changing technology, and therefore are much harder to do on a precise spec bid&#151;no matter how capable in technology you think you are when you write the spec. The vendors know their products; even if they could do more for your project for the same or less cost, they respond to a spec bid as it was written. In a good partnership, a performance bid allows for a well-articulated outcome to be met flexibly. It requires expertise-based judgment in comparing responses. And it often means that the lowest and best&#151;and not just low&#151;price is selected. When a bid process is not required, a performance contract insures that both parties in the partnership work to meet overall project goals, rather than argue about change orders.</P>

<LI><P><B>Failure to Dream.</B> As they begin, few partnerships trade enough on the real economic development possibilities for communities and thereby fail to broaden the potential local resource partnership base. Technology modernization projects such as the partnerships at Ball State University or Westfield Washington School Corporation, both in Indiana, had documentable, positive, local results. At Ball State, the result was new and better applicants to campus. In Westfield, the result was a changed perception of the value of living in the community. These are concrete, long-term benefits, and they have real economic implications rarely argued or understood as partnerships evolve. Ask realtors in a community what often drives a new resident's housing decision. Whether the homebuyer has children or not, the existence of modern, successful schools or campuses has an impact on the decision to purchase in a particular community. Resale values also are affected. In turn, the tax base and economic opportunities are improved. Allowing uninformed and overly conservative judgment in a community to go unchallenged when it defeats creative education/corporate partnership possibilities inevitably diminishes education improvement opportunities. It impacts on school and community self-concept, and that translates to image. Outside perceptions of the community become negative, which minimizes economic development opportunities. The goal would better be: Every community a model, and every school or campus involved in a partnership. Dreaming tends to bring out the best in people. Often what appear to be impossible dreams are not impossible at all.</P>

<P>Of course, partnerships must be based on some realistic parameters. Dreaming and risk today cannot be limitless. Economic realities must be understood relatively. Goals can be achieved over time, as long as a commitment to a long-term project of real merit is in place. It is always better to set one ambitious goal early and achieve a significant portion of it at first than to be so conservative in your dream as to fail to attract local support or partners of substance.</P>

<LI><B>Expecting a Free Lunch.</B> Some partners are not worth having because they can bring little to the table. An example is third-party providers versus manufacturers of technology. All the former usually can provide is reduced margins due to the nature of their business. Also, partnerships do not just mean &#147;freebies&#148; for education. Remember the mutual benefit issue. I have seen education institutions take significant generosity from a corporate partner, then turn around and give competitors of this generous partner basic business without regard for overall quality or system-related interests. That is self-defeating and all too typical of petty bureaucrats with short-term heroics in mind rather than long-term system advantages. It is not a matter of favoritism. Corporate partners must factor in the cost of attending to deal making and system change, as well as immediate economics, when they make the decision to become involved in a partnership. These things often change the bottom line.</UL>

<P><B>That Winning Attitude</B></P>

<P>The primary lesson I have learned from doing partnerships for the last decade is this: The objective of every project, if you have enough experience to understand how much you do not know, should be a &#147;partnership attitude.&#148; That means the education institution and the vendor or partner on a technology project consciously work together from the same side of the table to solve project problems. What often happens is that they sit opposite each other and, instead of fighting the problem, fight each other. I have seen educators take pride in kicking their vendor around, and I have then seen the vendor cause the education entity to spend more for less during a miserable relationship. Win-win partnership attitudes are eminently more fun, more productive, more beneficial to users, and more profitable. Whether economic-development based, showcase based, or simply vendor-product-provision based, the creation of a partnership attitude may be the most beneficial lesson I can share. It has served my clients and employers well when used, and I have always realized a greater return on my efforts when it resulted.</P>

<HR>
<P>In a time of overall fiscal belt-tightening, it is likely that many states will draw back from launching new multimillion-dollar distance education network projects&#151;costs are high and technological change makes any long-term investment somewhat risky. Instead, states are more likely to concentrate on regulatory initiatives that stimulate the deployment of affordable advanced services by the private sector. This article will discuss the
limitations of the regulatory strategies used by states in the past in light of the emerging competitive communications marketplace. In fact, states are already using the evolving demand-side-based &#147;advanced universal service&#148; (AUS) concept to help their schools, hospitals, libraries, and other public entities get connected to the services that are at the core of the information highway. Federal legislation could have a significant impact on state AUS programs.</P>

<P>If you read the Conference Committee report on the recently passed Telecommunications Act of
1996, you would get the impression that education was a prime focus of the bill. Getting public schools connected to the &#147;information highway&#148; was on every speaker's lips. In reality, however, educators were given few direct resources&#151;no new funds to purchase network services, no grants to build or buy broadband facilities. Instead, the act focuses on opening the local communications market to competition while creating incentives to bring affordable advanced communications services to education and health-care institutions. While states are empowered to create educational discount programs, they are prohibited from using many traditional regulatory tools that have helped educators in the past&#151;tools that have been quite effective, but are no longer viable as competition undermines the monopoly-provider environment.</P>

<P><B>Traditional Tools for Developing Infrastructure</B></P>

<P>In the past, state utility commissions have used a number of strategies to &#147;push the infrastructure&#148;
in both technical directions (mandating modernization and specific features) and in geographic and social scope (setting service levels to include rural areas and/or features and discounts to special classes of customers). These tools have included (1) technology mandates, (2) over-earnings reinvestments, (3) targeted discount programs, and more recently, (4) infrastructure investments in exchange for regulatory relief. These strategies have benefitted educators in a number of ways, but they have also been controversial. </P>

<P>The &#147;FYI Tennessee&#148; Plan is a good example of an aggressive mandated technology plan. The
state required all of its major communications companies to modernize their switching equipment&#151;including the availability of inter-office fiber, ISDN capacity, and SS-7 at all major central offices&#151;based on a targeted schedule, with all upgrades completed by the year 2000. The majority of the costs were paid for by a $111 million over-earnings fund. This approach has provided Tennessee with ISDN years ahead of its neighbors (near-statewide availability). The only problem is that the state's rate-payers have supported these investments (with higher phone bills) for a number of years without seeing the benefits of a boom in ISDN-based services or the promised ISDN-related jobs.</P>

<P>More common is the use of over-earnings settlements to fund network upgrades. Under these
arrangements, telephone company profits&#151;which are set by utility commissions in exchange for
protecting the company from competition&#151;are reviewed every few years. When profits exceed
the established rate, customers usually get refunds and/or lower bills. In some cases, however, a
portion of the &#147;excess&#148; has been redirected to both network improvements and specific
educational services discounts. State over-earnings settlements have funded a number of distance
learning projects. </P>

<P><B>States Use Over-Earnings Settlements</B></P>

<P>Arkansas ($231 million) and Michigan ($23 million) have used over-earnings settlements to
support major network modernization commitments, including significant investments in school
video links, classroom computers, and teacher training institutes. In Georgia, a portion of
Southern Bell's over-earnings ($58 million) has been supplemented by state lottery contributions
to fund a Telemedicine and Distance Learning Board. </P>

<P>Michigan has directed $23 million from an Ameritech rate settlement to distance learning projects.
The Missouri PSC agreed to forgo a rate review of Southwestern Bell until 1999 in exchange for
a price freeze on local phone service and a commitment to support a fiber-optics network for
public entities in Kansas City, to fund a number of distance education networks, and to develop
up to five Tele-Opportunity Training and Information Centers in that state's rural areas. </P>

<P>Special discounts for educational applications have also been approved by a number of state
regulatory commissions. These discounts have been funded by utility company contributions,
over-earnings settlements, or special legislative action granting the commission the right to modify
common carrier rules to allow one class of user&#151;education&#151;to benefit at the expense of higher
rates for other customers. States have authorized discounts for everything from basic telephony (a
phone line in each school used to connect with Learning Link in Rhode Island) to ISDN (in
California and Tennessee) and interactive video (in Alabama, Delaware, Kansas, Maryland,
Missouri, and Texas).</P>

<P>Recently, the promise of lessened regulation has been the main bargaining tool for securing
promises of infrastructure investments and school connections from regulated carriers. According
to the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), in the last two years
nearly 30 states have combined some form of lightened regulation (such as profit-sharing plans,
price caps and/or price freezes, and moves to price-based regulation) in exchange for telephone
company agreements to deploy digital services and fiber-optics networks at a pace faster than the
companies might have done on their own. </P>

<P>New Jersey Bell's &#147;Opportunity New Jersey&#148; Plan, for example, includes a promise to bring fiber
to 100 percent of NJB's subscribers by the year 2010. Residential rates are capped through 1999, and company revenues over 13.7 percent on rate-regulated services are to be shared with customers in the form of rebates on a 50-50 basis.</P>

<P>In exchange for surrendering its local phone monopoly and agreeing to sell services to its new competitors, Ameritech has won the right in most of its territory to move to price regulation. In exchange for ending rate-based reviews on its earnings, the company's promised Illinois investment is more than $1.2 billion in new fiber, switching upgrades, ISDN availability, and digital connection to 340 high schools, 35 community colleges, 850 public hospitals, 50 correctional centers, and 350 libraries.</P> 

<P>In Wisconsin, the company's infrastructure investment plan requires it to invest $700 million by
1999, along with an agreement to &#147;bring fiber to the doorstep&#148; of every public and private high
school, regional library, hospital, correctional facility, college, and university by 1998. The company has also agreed to contribute $13 million to a newly created Wisconsin Advanced Telecommunications Foundation. Similarly, the company's &#147;Opportunity Indiana&#148; Plan offers $120 million for similar connections; an additional $30 million is to be contributed to a new nonprofit telecommunications technology training center. </P>

<P><B>Advanced Universal Service</B></P>

<P>The difficulty with all of these programs is that they are becoming harder to implement as
competition threatens the monopoly status of the incumbent (regulated) carrier. As states move to
open their local communications markets, both the regulated communications providers and their
challengers are resisting carrier-specific regulatory mandates. The regulated providers resist
because they can no longer pass the costs (and the risks) on to their captive customers, and the
challengers resist because they do not want one provider's subsidized discounts to undercut the
potential market for competitive services. </P>

<P>The new Telecommunications Act requires states to introduce greater competition into local
communications, and to use &#147;price cap regulation, regulatory forbearance, or other regulating
methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment,&#148; not directed technology mandates to
bring services to their citizens. In fact, carriers are given new powers to challenge state
regulations that limit market entry or direct specific-service investments and offerings. Should the
FCC find that deployment is lagging due to burdensome regulatory constraints, it may preempt
state and local rules or set aside its own regulations. Thus, it is unlikely that we will see many
more over-earnings settlements, technology investment mandates, or required educational service
orders from utility commissions. </P>

<P>The required abandonment of supply-side push regulation will leave state regulators with few
bargaining chips when negotiating on behalf of educational customers. Fortunately, a number of
states have begun to experiment with market-based incentives to pull advanced offerings into the
community. These incentives are based upon extending the concept of universal service from its
core concern with delivering affordable basic telephony to rural and other high-cost areas to a
wider interest in promoting the availability of a range of advanced services to all network
customers. Education, health care, library, and local government institutions are at the cutting
edge of this new approach. By becoming the pioneer customers for such services, they help
promote advanced infrastructure applications to other potential customers. </P>

<P>Wisconsin's Information Super-Highway Act (enacted in July of 1994) established a Universal
Service Fund Council to advise the public service commission as to basic service elements as well
as &#147;a set of advanced service capabilities&#148; that should be available at affordable prices throughout
the state. Funded by a tax on the intrastate revenues of the state's communications companies, the
new universal service fund (USF) could be tapped to underwrite the costs of bringing advanced
services to &#147;education, library, and health care information services.&#148; The council has
recommended that a portion of USF funds be used to pay for vouchers allowing public and
private schools, public universities and technical colleges, libraries, and nonprofit hospitals to
order discounted interactive video and/or high-speed internet connections from any network
company that contributes to the USF. </P>

<P>Texas' new Public Utility Regulatory Act establishes an Infrastructure Development Fund to
support grants and loans to schools, hospitals, and other public institutions. Funds can be used for
equipment, services, and inside wiring. The fund is to be capitalized at $1.5 billion over a ten-year
period.</P>

<P>A similar expansion of universal service definitions is taking place in Hawaii, where the state's
new telecommunications law sets a goal of access to advanced services that provide &#147;a
combination of voice, data, image, and video&#148; for all consumers at reasonable rates. One notable
provision will extend the universal service program to promote &#147;enhanced government
information and services, including education, health care, public safety, and other government
services.&#148; Another provision dedicates universal service funds to &#147;provide service drops and basic
service at discounted rates to public institutions.&#148;</P>

<P>Several other states recently enacted state AUS programs that include advanced service elements,
while many more are studying how best to implement these new funding mechanisms. </P>

<P><B>Federal AUS Regulations</B></P>

<P>The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 also recognizes the importance of extending the
universal service concept. Its current formulation, however, is much more restrictive than many of
the programs of the state USF pioneers. The current legislation is more restrictive than last year's
Senate draft bill, for example, which was fairly generous in its definitions of (1) the customers
who could qualify for advanced services (public schools, libraries, hospitals, local public television
stations, and &#147;other public or non-profit community telecommunications users&#148;); (2) the applications to be made available to those customers (allowing the FCC and states to define what universal service would include for them); and (3) the rates for these services to be underwritten by state fees on carrier revenues (&#147;not higher than incremental cost&#148;).</P>

<P>Section 254(h) of the federal act declares that &#147;essential&#148; telecommunications services must be
made available to K&#150;12 public schools, public libraries, and nonprofit health-care institutions at
reasonable rates. These basic telephony services, which initially are limited to those already
deployed and subscribed to &#147;by a substantial majority of residential customers,&#148; are to be offered
at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. The amount of these
discounts will be determined by the FCC for interstate and by the states for intrastate services.
The difference between the rates is to be subsidized from provider-neutral USF mechanisms to be
established by the states and (for interstate services) by the FCC. </P>

<P>Advanced services for these targeted civic institutions [Section 254(c)(2)] are also to be
discounted compared to prices charged commercial customers in the same region. Based upon the
discussions in the Conference Committee, high-speed internet access and video conferencing are
expected to be included in most state programs. Health-care facilities in rural communities are
singled out for additional discounts. Fees for advanced services must not only be less than those
charged for commercial organizations in the same service area, but must also be &#147;reasonably
comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State.&#148; Advanced services
are defined as those &#147;necessary for the provision of health care services&#148; and include instruction
relating to such services [Section 254(c)(1)(h)]. Thus, videoconferencing to support instruction
appears to qualify for such geographic parity pricing.</P>

<P><B>Towards a More Inclusive Definition of AUS</B></P>

<P>Many advocates of advanced infrastructure deployment had hoped that the federal legislation
would mandate a timetable for adding specific technology features into the nation's
telecommunications networks. Some of the more expansive definitions of universal service
considered&#151;and rejected&#151;by Congress included the addition of digital network (ISDN) elements
into the phone system, a cap on the surcharge for such service over basic voice telephony, and a
call for bringing broadband service to all communities at affordable rates. Notably absent from the
federal AUS definitions are discounts for linking higher education, civic (freenet) bulletin boards,
public broadcasting and community access centers to the nation's communications infrastructure.
(See the excerpt from the Benton Foundation's report in the sidebar for a more inclusive vision of
universal service.)</P>

<P>While the federal act encourages states to meet the specific advanced telecommunications services
needs of their &#147;[e]lementary and secondary schools and classrooms, healthcare providers, and
libraries,&#148; the range of experimentation may turn out to be somewhat limited. States, such as
Wisconsin, that have added specific infrastructure technology milestones to their deregulation
plans may be challenged by carriers arguing that any such mandate is an &#147;unnecessary regulatory
burden.&#148; More to the point, although Section 254(f) of the federal act allows states to &#147;provide
for additional definitions and standards&#148; for AUS, such standards must be linked to &#147;specific,
predictable, and sufficient Mechanisms to support such definitions.&#148; They must be economically
reasonable to the carriers and not &#147;rely on or burden Federal universal service support
mechanisms.&#148;</P>

<P>Educators interested in telecommunications issues will face major legislative challenges in the
coming year. At the federal level, they will fight to preserve the major research and network
funding programs under the budget ax. At the state level, they may try to pass new initiatives for
education technology or save endangered programs. It would be a shame, however, if in their
focus on these efforts they miss the opportunity to build new models for universal service. The
next set of negotiations will occur at state regulatory commission and legislative
levels&#151;negotiations that will determine how public service goals will be met under the new rules
of the competitive communications marketplace. Educators and other civic agencies dependent
upon the information highway should be sitting at these tables.</P>

<P><I><B><IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/2dillon.gif" align=right hspace=10>Who owns intellectual property? According to this industry spokesman, the developers and publishers do. While they acknowledge the need for fair use in educational settings, they are adamantly opposed to the pirating of their property by those who would use it otherwise. This essay is an argument for strong regulation of content, especially as it is disseminated on line.</B></I></P>
<BR>
<P>The exponential growth of the Internet has given an estimated 20 million users access to the enormous amount of information available on the system. Seen as a prototype for the developing National Information Infrastructure (NII), the Net is both the subject of and a medium for the debate over protection of digital information. How can intellectual property&#151;commonly referred to as content&#151;be protected on the NII? An increase in federal prosecution of copyright infringers on the Internet illustrates the government's interest in protecting intellectual property rights on these networks and the problems inherent in doing so. But the most important questions surround ownership of software on the Net. Is it technologically feasible to protect digital intellectual property? More to the point, how do we reconcile competing values, such as the free flow of information vs. protection of intellectual property rights?</P>

<P>The evolution of technology provides users with many benefits. But these must be weighed against the potential economic losses if content is not adequately protected. Methods for ensuring protection, such as access control and encryption, and educating the public on copyright law, could prove effective. Ultimately, strong intellectual property laws worldwide will instill respect for the proper use of copyrighted material on line and will deter many from abusing the system.</P>

<P><I>The Wall Street Journal</I> reported that in 1992, over 800 security breaches were reported on the Internet. Over 1,000 were estimated in 1993. Once the information has been taken, it is often disseminated onto Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), such as the illegal BBS recently raided at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.*  Illegal BBSs can spread the unauthorized use of copyrighted works and the disclosure of valuable trade secrets and confidential personal information on a grand scale. The number of BBSs is estimated at over 50,000 in the United States today, and 17 percent of these are dedicated to software piracy. The Software Publishers Association (SPA) alone monitors nearly 2,000 BBSs for unauthorized copies as part of its campaign to reduce software piracy. Illegal BBSs are a prime example of the problems inherent in protecting goodies in the digital candy store.</P>

<SMALL><P>(*MIT student David LaMacchia was indicted on one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud in April 1994 by a federal grand jury. He is accused of running a BBS that allowed its users to copy illegally more than $1 million worth of copyrighted software.)</P></SMALL>

<P>Once a copyrighted work has been stolen and placed on a BBS for further dissemination, the economic damage has already been done to the copyright holder and is almost impossible to completely reverse. The SPA reports that worldwide economic losses to piracy of business applications software was $7.45 billion in 1993, illustrating that additional steps must be taken to protect works against infringement before software is placed on an electronic system.</P>

<P>The development of the information super-highway holds the potential for widespread copyright infringement if we fail to clearly state and protect the copyright of information on the electronic medium. Without adequate trust in the networks, copyright and patent holders will not make their works available to the public or to schools, and the full potential of the information highway will never be realized.</P>

<P>The emerging battle is between content owners and millions of users that potentially could have limitless capability to download (i.e., copy) and further distribute copyrighted materials. This issue is unique to the world of digital content. The software industry is the only industry in the world that empowers its customers to become manufacturing subsidiaries. For every other product we consume, we cannot easily make a second one because we lack the tools, capital, or technical know-how to do so. With software, however, the user of each and every one of the 70 million PCs in use in North America has all of the equipment he or she needs to make a perfect copy. Our industry's only defense is moral suasion or legal enforcement.</P>

<P>The advantage of the emerging NII is that vast volumes of content will be accessible to everyone, including teachers and students. But universal access does not mean that those enormous digital libraries will be available at no charge. The models of the existing on-line services such as America On-Line, the news services, Prodigy, CompuServe, etc., have been successful in blending access to free information with a mechanism to charge for content the owner does not wish to place in the public domain.</P>

<P>The issue here, as in many political issues is that of choice. Content owners, or copyright holders, have the right to decide for themselves if, when, and how much to charge for their works.</P>

<P>The copyright law provides a few exceptions that allow copying under specific exemptions for certain educational and charitable uses and under the aegis of &#147;fair use&#148; of a copyrighted work. In deciding whether a particular use is fair use under the copyright law, one must consider the following:<BR>
<OL TYPE=1> 
<LI>The purpose and character of the use, including whether it is for commercial or nonprofit educational purposes.</LI>

<LI>The nature of the copyrighted work (i.e., copying from factual works is tolerated more than copying from more creative fictional works).</LI>

<LI>The amount of material that is used in relation to the entire work (i.e., the more that is copied, or the more significant the portion that is copied, regardless of the quantity, the less likely that fair use will apply).</LI>

<LI>The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work (i.e., if the use has an adverse impact on the market for the original work, it will not constitute fair use.)</LI>
</OL> </P>

<P>These considerations are wholly applicable to the use of digital goodies. When an illegal BBS downloads an entire work, whether it is in an educational setting or not, that is clearly not a case of fair use.</P>

<P>As is evident by the amount of piracy currently occurring on the Internet, placing copyrighted works on the Net or on a BBS without some type of protection would be unrealistic. Without adequate protection from infringement, only those who were careless or ignorant of the problems would trust confidential or valuable information to a system rife with hackers and thieves who could easily violate the system.</P>

<P>There may be some technological solutions to the problems of protecting intellectual property on networks. The use of access control and encryption technology is seen by many as the best way to ensure widespread use of the NII. Access control ensures that only authorized users gain access to the work, and encryption is a failsafe; even if a cracker gets in, he can't read the content.</P>

<P>Present security on the Internet is not sufficient to protect confidential electronic messages from being intercepted. The coinventor of public key cryptography, Martin Hellman, notes that while the National Security Agency refuses to use the Internet for just this reason, it is the driving force behind restricting public usage of adequate encryption.</P>

<P>There are also non-technological means of protecting digital goodies. While controlling and preventing unauthorized access to copyrighted works through the use of encryption is the most aggressive means of preventing copyright infringements, the SPA has found that educational programs are very effective in deterring unauthorized reproduction and use of copyrighted works. By educating Internet and future NII users&#151;including teachers and students&#151;of the copyright law and the penalties for infringements, copyrighted works placed on these systems may be protected from massive illegal use.</P>

<P>Not only do we need to ensure that users within the United States understand and respect the copyright law, we must also ensure the same understanding on a global level. SPA research shows that while Western countries lead the world in the magnitude of revenues lost in 1993, with U.S. losses estimated at $1.57 billion, the piracy rates in the emerging economies far exceeded this number. In 1993, India and Pakistan had the highest piracy rate at 95 percent, with Korea and Brazil at 89 percent, Malaysia at 88 percent, and Taiwan and Mexico at 82 percent.</P>

<P>To ensure that any copyrighted works placed on the Internet will be protected abroad, stronger intellectual property protection laws must be implemented on a global scale. Through support of U.S. ratification of multilateral agreements, like GATT-TRIPS and NAFTA, that will protect the dissemination of copyrighted works, the United States can continue to provide an example and influence the need for strong intellectual property protection. It is ultimately through implementation and knowledge of strong worldwide copyright laws that we can hope to protect intellectual property on the Internet and the NII.</P>

<P>The evolution of national and global networks cannot be allowed to undermine intellectual property protection. Some contend that tough penalties for infringement can be eliminated in favor of good cryptography on networks, and the development of high moral standards among users who would never dream of copying works illegally.</P>

<P>Well, the times are a-changin'&#151;but not that fast. Copyright laws are a long way from becoming obsolete. Privacy and security are paramount issues, but the concerns of law enforcement about the widespread availability of cryptography cannot be cast aside. And although education to instill proper behavior on the networks is important, it is not a panacea. U.S. software publishers need to rely on the certainty of good intellectual property laws in order to feel comfortable enough to make adequate research and development investments. It is naive to believe that everyone on the networks will behave responsibly.</P>

<P>While technological advances will assist the general public in coming to a greater awareness and respect for intellectual property rights, ideological and cultural differences among the wide variety of users necessitate constant vigilance in the form of strong and progressive intellectual property protection.</P>

<H1 align=center><I>Interview with Luther S. Williams</I></H1>
<H3 align=right>By Carole Novak, Editor, <I>TECHNOS Quarterly</I></H3>
<HR>
<P><IMG SRC="/journal/bios/lwilliams.gif" align=right>
<STRONG><I>Luther Williams is assistant director for Education and Human Resources at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Prior to his appointment, Williams established a distinguished record as a scientist, educator, and administrator. One of his major contributions at NSF has been creating the <A HREF="sb4williams.htm">Office of Systemic Reform</A> in 1992. The office is dedicated to supporting educational systemic reform activities and improving the academic research capabilities of states that traditionally have been underrepresented in the nation's science and technology efforts. In fall 1995, TECHNOS talked to Williams about the progress made through the Office's initiatives and the challenges still ahead for American public school systems.</I></STRONG></P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Since your appointment as assistant director, NSF has chosen a path that leads to school reform. Why?</B></I></P>

<P>I recognized that while NSF was supporting an array of notable projects, these projects were not necessarily consistent with the American K-12 school system. While math and science education standards were evolving, our programs focused on the professional development of math and science teachers, brought technology into school systems, or developed instructional materials. These activities are most effective when you periodically invest resources to enhance one part of a quality K-12 system. Four or five years ago, however, there were few quality K-12 school systems in America.</P>

<P>Three fundamental problems had to be addressed. First, challenging math and science education has been optional in the American public school for most of its history. We need to change the attitude that math and science are optional. Second, the existing infrastructure will not support the kind of school system needed today. We need to meet the demands of the workplace. Third, the reform ventures since the early 1980s have created chaos, not unity. We need to realize that simply implementing many programs may only increase the chaos level.</P>

<P>I decided we were going to create systemic reform programs that would require school systems to unify the policy, government, and fiscal components and add a coherent math/science educational sequence that is standards-based. This has to be organized as a continuum. The instruction youngsters receive in fifth grade must build on what happened in grades K-4 and provide the groundwork for grades 6-12. Otherwise, there's no point in investing in the fifth-grade program.</P>
<BR>
<p><I><B>How do you manage to get everyone to agree that this is a role NSF should assume?</B></I></P>

<P>The NSF program requires the participation of the political leadership. If it's a state program, the state legislature is involved; if it's a city program, the mayor's office and city councils are involved. Connecticut is one of the states funded under the Statewide Systemic Initiatives [see &quot;The <A HREF="sb4williams.htm">Office of Systemic Reform</A>, National Science Foundation&quot;]. When it couldn't assemble this large group of players from the school system, the university, or the political structure, it created the State of Connecticut Math/Science Education, Inc., a body of leaders from the business community and others who are running exemplary programs, such as [Dr. James] Comer's School Development Program. They are responsible for meeting the demanding expectations of the NSF proposal.</P>

<P>You can't successfully apply to the NSF program if you're not willing to bring synergy to these district activities. In fact, we found that synergy characterized the most exemplary things Connecticut was doing. Plans should be comprehensive, but they must also be coherent.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>You've also singled out the state of Louisiana as a good example.</B></I></P>

<P>It's done an absolutely remarkable job. Large sections of Louisiana are rural, but you also have suburban and urban schools, including those in New Orleans, which are dominated by parochial school systems.</P>

<P>The state created an incredible structure that includes the governor's office and the legislature, which matched the NSF monies. It's not so important that they do so, but what was important was their ownership of the process and their decision to reconsider the issue each fiscal year. What they've  accomplished over five years is simply outstanding, and the ultimate results are now beginning to appear in the students' improved performance in math and science. We test student performance in the fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades. The results have been remarkable at each of these levels, especially in grades four and eight.</P>

<P>I suspect that the successes we've seen are strongly correlated with the high accountability NSF has built into these programs. These five-year awards provide money for one year and a promissory note for the subsequent four. At the end of each year, we conduct a comprehensive review.</P>

<P>With Louisiana, we operate under a cooperative agreement in which the state and NSF determined what the deliverables would be in the first year. If the state achieves 15 of the 16 deliverables, that's acceptable, and the second year of the award is triggered. If progress isn't acceptable, major changes must occur in order for the second year of the award to begin. We had to terminate the award to Rhode Island.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Are some of these deliverables test scores?</B></I></P>

<P>The ultimate deliverable is the test score. The first-year deliverables are based on the three fundamental problems. First, you have to agree that you're really going to have K-12 operations.</P>

<P>If a state does not already require that, one of the first-year deliverables is a revision of the state's graduation requirements for math and science education. Another first-year deliverable is to determine whether teachers have the basic competencies and, if they don't, to initiate major professional development efforts. A decent assessment system is also a first-year deliverable. You've got to get these capabilities in year one in order for them to be used in year two. Around the third year, the state must begin submitting student test scores.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>And graduation rates might be a deliverable?</B></I></P>

<P>Absolutely.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Acceptance into college, or...</B></I></P>

<P>Workforce and college both.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>There are three systemic reform initiatives, and the states, cities, and rural areas participate by choice?</B></I></P>

<P>That's right. By choice--and by competition. The opportunity to apply was extended to all sister states and all applied. As I have said, bringing order to the chaos in most states is a daunting task, and many of them could simply never get it done. We've been successful in these programs because many of the  critical decisions needed for genuine reform have to be made before an award is granted.</P>

<P>We initially had 25 states and Puerto Rico. Two years later, we started the Urban Systemic Initiatives because the states with large urban populations were responding well to the statewide program but did not have sufficient resources for their urban areas. So we decided to concentrate on the cities with the largest populations.</P>

<P>One thing I've learned in working with states is that for a modest amount of money the foundation can really drive reform by requiring a comprehensive planning process even before an award is made. So we gave a grant of $100,000 to each of the 25 cities, and they spent a year in very serious planning.</P>

<P>The second thing I learned is that you can't really drive reform unless you engage the public. So the state or city school system has to develop public support and then negotiate a series of policy changes for tracking systems, etc. We had a competition among the 25 cities and initially made awards to nine of them. In 1995, we made seven additional awards.</P>

<P>One comment on the value of planning. You would think one of the major problems in Detroit would be infrastructure, right? Obviously, you can't provide technology-based education in a cost-effective way in a building constructed in 1950. During this planning year, the Detroit Board of Education ran a very effective grass roots-based operation and passed a bond issue with something like 60 percent approval--a remarkable achievement. For the first time in 27 years, the citizens of Detroit voted to provide $1.5 billion for infrastructure. The bond issue was prompted by the NSF award program because we kept stressing that Detroit didn't have the infrastructure to meet its goals. But with planning, the bond issue passed.</P>

<P>The city of Dallas also passed a bond issue for $300 million. And before their first-year planning was funded, both Cincinnati and Fresno passed bond issues. To summarize, citizens in seven of those 16 cities have elected to invest significant resources in their schools, an incredible development leveraged by our efforts. More importantly, those seven cities now have the means to sustain reform because the citizens have become players.</P>

<P>A city differs from a state in that it usually has a group that represents its leading businesses and industries. (I don't mean the chamber of commerce.) In the last 20 years, these groups have not been close to the school systems--certainly not inner-city school systems. However, because they are motivated by their workforce needs, these groups have come to think of their cities' school systems as likely places to find potential employees. As a result, interest in their school systems has increased dramatically.</P>

<P>For example, Texas Instruments is almost a co-manager of the program in Dallas. The company has contributed computers and instructional software, assisted Dallas schools with their infrastructure, and brought added accountability to the venture through its co-leadership. The Dallas Urban Systemic Initiative must meet two reporting obligations before it reports to NSF: one to Texas Instruments because of its major investment and a second to the local O'Donnell Foundation that gave the school system millions after the NSF award was granted.</P>

<P>How does all of this refer back to my comment about chaos? How do the efforts by Texas Instruments, the O'Donnell Foundation, and NSF equal a synergistic whole? The synergy is created when these efforts are guided by the program plan operated under the NSF proposal. Texas Instruments has simply assumed responsibility for the technology, and the O'Donnell Foundation is funding two other components of the proposal. So in a venture-capital context, NSF is simply contributing to one unified operation.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Rumor has it that it's getting very crowded on the Internet and that some universities have withdrawn their access for local schools. What can NSF do about that?</B></I></P>

<P>What we are increasingly doing is making awards to 'distributed performers.' Most of these performers are in universities, and access for groups of K-12 schools is an integral part of their jobs. We're making progress with a program called Networking Infrastructure for Education. This program seeks to implement models and prototypes so we can demonstrate how electronic networks, the Internet, and others can support education reform. This capability is needed, not only for rural areas but also for Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami. We now support research and development that helps us understand how to implement large-scale and cost-effective networking. I'm talking not only about infrastructure but also about policy issues, training, learning tools, etc. The only difference between our effort and the efforts of others is in the product, which is education and training.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Would NSF ever pull funding from a university that removed a K-12 school from its network?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Is the growth in the use of networking related to the decision to allow the Internet wide-area network to become basically a free market?</B></I></P>

<P>Yes.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Is it a decision that anyone at NSF regrets?</B></I></P>

<P>Well, there might have been some regret because there's a sense that it's ours. But I think that the federal government through NSF has served the government's role. We recognized that it was time to make the Internet public, since it was a public domain operation. Part of the concern now is that the increased use of the Internet occasions a more rapid response than we had anticipated. It's probably going to take three to five years for the Internet to achieve the steady state that truly reflects the best interests of the civilian, government, business, and education sectors. What I'm excited about is that as the Internet develops, we can link it with community-sited or even state-sited digital libraries.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>And that's another way of helping schools that have little or no funding for technology.</B></I></P>

<P>The three systemic initiative programs represent incredibly important test sites because they provide the opportunity to learn how to help provide for school systems with limited resources.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>What do you think about the Clinton Administration's call to redo our science policy with Science in the National Interest?</B></I></P>

<P>The most important part of this recommendation is the synergy required throughout education. First, all kinds of collaborations, partnerships, and linkages within research are important, as is including the public and private sector. Second, the broad issue of education is not a separate enterprise. One reason the three fundamental problems developed in school systems is because of the separation between education and research that occurred over the last three or four decades. Math, science, and technology education were treated as separate enterprises from the research that promoted them. This policy will continue to be useful in discussions on public policy, planning, strategies, etc.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Considering the present political climate, how do you feel about federally funded efforts to  encourage diversity programs?</B></I></P>

<P>The Department of Justice has asked each agency to examine all diversity programs. We're in the process of doing so, which means we're answering questions such as: What are you doing? Why are you doing it? and Could you achieve this objective without such programs? For gender-specific programs, the answer is an easy 'no,' since there are no options. But the implied question to that answer is, what price would society pay if the program didn't exist?</I></P>

<P>I don't really know what's going to happen, but I think the environment in Washington with respect to diversity programs is very distressing and incongruous. NSF has made incredible progress in this arena, and all of our programs focus on solving a problem. If you want to improve the representation of minorities in science and technology, you need to set a baseline and establish goals. When the goals are met, the program is terminated. Although we've done very well, there's a distinct possibility that that progress will be disrupted. That's disconcerting.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Would you agree with the statement that America lacks the will to educate everyone equally?</B></I></P>

<P>You can find an answer by considering the American workforce. We live in the high-tech information era. That's the economic landscape; that's what determines workforce requirements. The affective components that bear on education suggest it isn't 1995 but is 1955--at best. Our challenge is to confront social-political constructs whose goals are incompatible with our programming. In some areas of the country, for example, citizens do not feel that most students need quality math and science education.</P>
<BR>
<P><B><I>You're also bringing up the idea that our young people lack hope. I'm referring to what William Raspberry of</I> The Washington Post <I>wrote about young black men in particular.</I></B></P>

<P>Yes, that's right.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Is this your way of trying to give back some hope?</B></I></P>

<P>When I'm asked what we are trying to contribute through these programs, I have two responses. First, I'm responsible for ensuring that more Americans have the education they need to become quality  performers in the country's scientific and technical workforce. Second, our agenda will improve the quality of life for many young citizens who have very few options or, to  echo Bill Raspberry, who don't have hope.</P>

<P>I was in St. Louis recently visiting a new middle school. During the tour, several African-American seventh- and eighth-graders proudly shared with me their performances in math. What I found remarkable was that this was only the second or third time since they had been in school that they had performed with excellence. Now they were hopeful.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>And it's basically simple.</B></I></P>

<P>It's not nuclear medicine! It's simply helping young people who understand--despite the fact that they might seem to be losers--the quality of life that more prosperous members of society have. Even if they appear to disdain it, it doesn't mean they don't desire it. Suddenly, these students were, in effect, telling me that they were of value and they were going to do well.</P>
<BR>
<p><i><B>Part of that is something else you've spoken out about, and that is high standards. We might as well expect the best.</B></i></p>

<p>That's exactly what happened. One reason our school systems are struggling is that people have believed America's efforts to address equity-based issues should be made with indifference to standards and expectations. Most programs under desegregation orders were only transportation programs. If you're going to promote desegregation, you should require education-specific deliverables. Schools should know what they are expected to accomplish. Unfortunately, those monies are gone. But, as you said, young people will perform to the level you expect of them. It's almost criminal to lower the standards because many young people will never realize what their talents are or what they could do.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>When your tenure at NSF is complete, what do you want to be remembered for?</B></I></P>

<P>I would like to be remembered for having established public K-12 school systems that provide young people with the math and science preparation they need to be effective and productive citizens and workers.</P>
<BR>
<P><I><B>Are you feeling pretty good about that at this point?</B></I></p>

<P>Yes, I am. Consider these examples of the program's success. Although the Urban Systemic Initiative in Detroit has only been in place for a year and a half, you would think the initiative was in its third or fourth year. The major changes Detroit has made with the community's support are very gratifying. Almost every indicator of the existing Detroit school system was decidedly negative. Recently I was visiting with the leadership in Chicago to ensure that they understood the deliverables expected by NSF. Not only did they understand them, they also invited me to help them consider how our reform approach in math and science education could be expanded to all subjects. So we have the opportunity to do something rather novel in Chicago, too.</P>

<HR>

<P>What if you could offer students in the K&#150;12 environment access to a resource that was described as one of the most important tools in tomorrow's workplace? This resource, you were told, was like the world's largest bookstore, one in which the selection changes from one minute to the next every day of the year. Think of it as the Wild West of communication, the pitch continues, a &#147;last frontier&#148; that allows all participants&#151;from third graders in Barrow, Alaska, to twelfth graders in Fort Myers, Florida&#151;equal status, regardless of age, sex, race, or culture. Place your students on the information superhighway, and you place them on the fast track to information and global discourse with one of the workplace's most potent tools. How would you respond?</P>

<P>As you consider your response, you learn that the bookstore also stocks erotic material and pornographic images. The Wild West of communication includes &#147;outlaws&#148; who can ride out of the electronic hills and flame their angry responses across your students' computer screens. And the information superhighway includes drivers who cruise the electronic byways in search of young children. This wonderful resource, apparently, has its road hazards.</P>

<P>When parents, schools, and communities consider providing children with access to the Internet, they find themselves not only discussing these benefits and hazards but also debating censorship, liability, and the student's right to information and privacy. Should children be given access? How much guidance and supervision are needed? Who is responsible for what is accessed? The person posting the information? The on-line service? The school? The student downloading the material?</P>

<P>The essays published here pose answers and possible solutions to these questions and problems. The first discusses past and present legal cases that may set a precedent for future litigation involving liability and electronic access. In the second and third essays, two teachers describe their schools' experiences with on-line access.  As always, your comments on this continuing debate are welcome. Contact TECHNOS by fax, U.S. mail, or e-mail to participate.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Of Luddites, Learning, and Life</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="../bios/npostman.htm">Neil Postman</A></H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I>&#147;I would bar educators from talking about technical improvements until they have disclosed their
reasons for offering an education in the first place.&#148; So wrote Neil Postman in his cautionary tale,
&#147;Deus Machina,&#148; in the Winter 1992 issue of TECHNOS. Here he takes his challenge one step
further, to those who say that new technologies will soon make schools extinct. They have it all
wrong, Postman says, because they don't understand the real purpose of schools.</I></B></P>

<H4>Luddites</H4>

<P>I think it is a fair guess to say that my role in the pages of TECHNOS is to serve as the resident
Luddite. If this is so, then there are two things you need to know. The first is that I do not regard
my association with Luddism as, in any way, a disgrace. As perhaps readers will know, the
Luddite movement flourished in England between 1811 and 1818 as a response to the furious
growth of machines and factories. Notwithstanding the excesses of their zeal, the Luddites
seemed to be the only group in England that could foresee the catastrophic effects of the factory
system, especially on children. They did not want their children to be deprived of an
education&#151;indeed, of childhood itself&#151;for the purpose of their being used to fuel the machines
of industry. As William Blake put it, they did not want their children to labor in the &#147;dark Satanic
Mills.&#148;</P>

<P>It is true that the Luddites busted up some textile machinery from which their unsavory reputation
originates, but when did we decide to mock or despise people who try to protect their children
and preserve their way of life?</P>

<P>The second thing you need to know is that despite the respect I have for them, I am not at all a
Luddite. I have, for example, no hostility toward new technologies and certainly no wish to
destroy them, especially those technologies, like computers, that have captured the imagination of
educators. Of course, I am not enthusiastic about them, either. I am indifferent to them. And the
reason I am indifferent to them is that, in my view, they have nothing whatever to do with the
fundamental problems we have to solve in schooling our young. If I do harbor any hostility
toward these machines, it is only because they are distractions. They divert the intelligence and
energy of talented people from addressing the issues we need most to confront.</P>

<P>Let me begin, then, to make my case by telling you about a conversation I had with an automobile
salesman who was trying to get me to buy a new Honda Accord. He pointed out that the car was
equipped with cruise control, for which there was an additional charge. As is my custom in
thinking about the value of technology, I asked him, &#147;What is the problem to which cruise control
is the answer?&#148; The question startled him, but he recovered enough to say, &#147;It is the problem of
keeping your foot on the gas.&#148; I told him I had been driving for 35 years and had never found that
to be a problem. He then told me about the electric windows. &#147;What is the problem,&#148; I asked, &#147;to which electric windows are the answer?&#148; He was ready for me this time. With a confident smile,
he said, &#147;You don't have to wind the windows up and down with your arm.&#148; I told him that this,
too, had never been a problem, and that, in fact, I rather valued the exercise it gave me.</P>

<P>I bought the car anyway, because, as it turns out, you cannot get a Honda Accord without cruise
control and electric windows&#151;which brings up the first point I should like to mention. It is that,
contrary to conventional wisdom, new technologies do not, by and large, <I>increase </I>people's
options but do just the opposite. For all practical purposes, you cannot go to Europe anymore by
boat, which I can report is a thrilling and civilized way to go. Now you have to take an airplane.
You cannot work for a newspaper unless you use a word processor, which eliminates me, since I
do all of my composing with a pen and yellow pad and do not wish to change. You cannot buy
records anymore; you must use CDs. I can go on with a thousand examples which demonstrate
the point that new technologies drive old technologies out of business; which is to say that there is
an imperialistic thrust to technology, a strong tendency to get everyone to conform to the
requirements of what is new. Now, this is not always a bad thing, although sometimes it is very
bad. I bring it up to call attention to the fact that what we too easily call &#147;progress&#148; is always
problematic. The word comes trippingly to the tongue, but when you examine what it means, you
discover that technology is always a Faustian bargain. It giveth and it taketh away. And we would
all be clearer about what we are getting into if there were less cheerleading about, let us say, the
use of computers in the classroom and more sober analysis of what may be its costs intellectually
and socially.</P>

<P>A second point my Honda story illuminates is that new technologies may not always solve
significant problems or any problem at all. But because the technologies are <I>there</I>, we often invent
problems to justify our using them. Or sometimes we even pretend we are solving one problem
when, in fact, the reason for building and employing a new technology is altogether different.
There are two expensive examples I can think of on this point. The first concerns the construction
of the superconducting supercollider in Texas. It was justified by no less a person than Stephen
Hawking, who told us that the research the supercollider would permit would give us entry to the
mind of God. Since Hawking is an avowed atheist, he cannot possibly believe this; but even if he
were not, it is equally sure he does not believe it. Nonetheless, it was good public relations. A
Christian nation would be likely to go for it (though its Congress, after a $2 billion investment, did
not), since the mysterious ways of the Lord have always been a serious problem for most of us.
This is not to say that there aren't some interesting problems in cosmology that the supercollider
might have solved. But since the people who would have been required to pay for this machine
did not have any background or interest in these problems, it was best to talk about the mind of
God.</P>

<P>The second example is the information superhighway that President Clinton and especially Vice
President Gore are so ardently promoting. I have not yet heard a satisfactory answer to the
question &#147;What is the problem to which this $50 billion investment is the solution?&#148; I suspect that
an honest answer would be something like this: &#147;There <I>is </I>no social or intellectual problem, but we
can stimulate the economy by investing in new technologies.&#148; That is not at all a bad answer, but
it is not the answer the vice president has given. He is trying to sell the idea by claiming that it
solves the problem of giving more people greater access to more information faster, including
providing them with 500 TV channels (or even a thousand).</P>

<H4>Learning</H4>

<P><IMG SRC="4postman.gif" align=left hspace=10>This leads me directly to the question of schools and technology. In reading Lewis Perelman's book, <I>School's Out</I>,* and the work of those who are passionate about the educational value of new technologies, I find that their enthusiasm is almost wholly centered on the fact that these technologies will give our students greater access to more information faster, more conveniently,
and in more various forms than has ever been possible. That is their answer to the question &#147;What
is the problem to which the new technologies are the solution?&#148; I would suggest a modification of
the question by putting it this way: &#147;What was the 19th-century problem to which these
technologies are an irrelevant solution?&#148; By putting it this way, I mean to say that the problem of
getting information to people fast and in various forms was the main technological thrust of the
19th century, beginning with the invention of telegraphy and photography in the 1840s. It would
be hard not to notice that the problem was solved and is therefore no longer something that any of
us needs to work at, least of all, become worked up about. If anyone argues that technology can
give people access to more information outside of the classroom than could possibly be given
inside the classroom, then I would say that has been the case for almost 100 years. What else is
new?</P>

<P><SMALL>(*See Lewis Perelman's article, &#147;Hyperlearning and the New Economy,&#148; in <I>TECHNOS Quarterly</I>, Vol. 2, No. 4.)</SMALL></P>

<P>In other words, the information-giving function of the schools was rendered obsolete a long time
ago. For some reason, more than a few technophiles (like Perelman) have just noticed this and
are, in some cases, driven to favor eliminating our schools altogether. They err in this, I think, for
a couple of reasons. One is that their notion of what schools are for is rather limited. Schools are
not now and in fact have never been <I>largely </I>about getting information to children. That has been
on the schools' agenda, of course, but has always been way down on the list.</P>

<P>One of the principal functions of school is to teach children how to behave in groups. The reason
for this is that you cannot have a democratic, indeed, civilized, community life unless people have
learned how to participate in a disciplined way as part of a group. School has never been about
individualized learning. It has always been about how to learn and how to behave as part of a
community. And, of course, one of the ways this is done is through the communication of what is
known as social values. If you will read the first chapter of Robert Fulghum's <I>All I Ever Really
Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten</I>, you will find an elegant summary of the important
business of schools. The summary includes the following: Share everything, play fair, don't hit
people, put things back where you found them, clean up your own mess, wash your hands before
you eat, and, of course, flush. The only thing wrong with Fulghum's book is that no one has
learned all these things, along with an affection for one's country, at kindergarten's end. We have
ample evidence that it takes many years of teaching these values in school before they have been
accepted and internalized. Some would say that this function of schooling is the most difficult task
educators must achieve. If it is not, then the function of providing the young with narratives that
help them to find purpose and meaning in learning and life surely is.</P>

<P>By a narrative I mean a story of human history that gives meaning to the past, explains the
present, and provides guidance for the future. If there is a single problem that plagues American
education at the moment, it is that our children no longer believe, as they once did, in some of the
powerful and exhilarating narratives that were the underpinning of the school enterprise. I refer to
such narratives as the story of our origins in which America is brought forth out of revolution, not
merely as an experiment in governance but as part of God's own plan&#151;the story of America as a
moral light unto the world. Another great narrative tells of America as a melting pot where the
teeming masses, from anywhere, yearning to be free, can find peace and sustenance. Still another
narrative&#151;sometimes referred to as the Protestant Ethic&#151;tells of how hard work is one of the
pathways to a fulfilled life. There are many other such narratives on which the whole enterprise of
education in this country has rested. If teachers, children, and their parents no longer believe in
these narratives, then schools become houses of detention rather than attention.</P>

<H4>Life</H4>

<P>What I am driving at is that the great problems of education are of a social and moral nature and
have nothing to do with dazzling new technologies. In fact, the new technologies so loudly
trumpeted in TECHNOS and in other venues are themselves not a solution to anything, but a
problem to be solved. The fact is that our children, like the rest of us, are now suffering from
information glut, not information scarcity. In America there are 260,000 billboards, 17,000
newspapers, 12,000 periodicals, 27,000 video outlets for renting tapes, 400 million television sets,
and well over 400 million radios, not including those in automobiles. There are 40,000 new book
titles published every year, and every day in America 41 million photographs are taken. And, just
for the record (thanks to the computer), over 60 billion pieces of advertising junk mail come into
our mailboxes every year. Everything from telegraphy and photography in the 19th century to the
silicon chip in the 20th has amplified the din of information. From millions of sources all over the
globe, through every possible channel and medium&#151;light waves, air waves, ticker tapes,
computer banks, telephone wires, television cables, satellites, and printing presses&#151;information
pours in. Behind it in every imaginable form of storage&#151;on paper, on video and audio tape, on
disks, film, and silicon chips&#151;is an even greater volume of information waiting to be retrieved.
Information has become a form of garbage. It comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in
particular, disconnected from usefulness. We are swamped by information, have no control over
it, and don't know what to do with it.</P>

<P>And in the face of all of this, there are some who believe it is time to abandon schools.</P>

<P>Well, if anyone is wondering whether or not the schools of the future have any use, here is
something for them to contemplate. The role of the school is to help students learn how to ignore
and discard information so that they can achieve a sense of coherence in their lives; to help
students cultivate a sense of social responsibility; to help students think critically, historically, and
humanely; to help students understand the ways in which technology shapes their consciousness;
to help students learn that their own needs sometimes are subordinate to the needs of the group. I
could go on for another three pages in this vein without any reference to how machinery can give
students access to information. Instead, let me summarize in two ways what I mean. First, I'll cite
a remark made repeatedly by my friend Alan Kay, who is sometimes called &#147;the father of the
personal computer.&#148; Alan likes to remind us that any problems the schools cannot solve without
machines, they cannot solve with them. Second, and with this I shall come to a close: If a nuclear
holocaust should occur some place in the world, it will not happen because of insufficient
information; if children are starving in Somalia, it's not because of insufficient information; if crime
terrorizes our cities, marriages are breaking up, mental disorders are increasing, and children are
being abused, none of this happens because of a lack of information. These things happen because
we lack something else. It is the &#147;something else&#148; that is now the business of schools.</P>
