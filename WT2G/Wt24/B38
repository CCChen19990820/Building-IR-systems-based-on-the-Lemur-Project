to these budding ecologists.  Jill Baron has already
taken the class to Rocky Mountain National Park,
and the students have begun a field experiment on
aquatic ecosystem function across an N deposition
gradient from the alpine to subalpine forest, then
in a few weeks to agricultural watersheds and
urban effects.  This is a great opportunity for
getting very high quality undergraduates involved
in your research, and for getting an annual, long-
term dataset going!  Call Indy if you have
interest!!<P>

DOE/NSF/USDA Joint Program on Collaborative
Research in Plant Biology has issued a RFP for
Feb. 14, 1994.  Focus is on fundamental plant
biology, but draws on research approaches from
a broad range of scientific disciplines.  Of
particular interest are research topics not
currently receiving sufficient attention or those
considered difficult to resolve because of technical
or conceptual impediments.  More information
can be obtained from the VP for Research, CSU.

Jill Baron and Dan Binkley were funded on a proposal to the
National Biological Service, "Effects of Increased Nitrogen
Deposition on Subalpine Forest Growth".  The research is
funded for four years.  <P>
<I><em u>Abstract</em></I>.  Eleven years of continuous
monitoring and evaluation of precipitation chemistry,
ecosystem processes, and surface water chemistry in the Loch
Vale Watershed has led to the concern that excessive nitrogen
(N) deposition has caused some Front Range high elevation
ecosystems to pass the threshold of nitrogen saturation; others
are very close to this threshold where plants no longer take up
all N, causing some to leach into lakes and streams (Williams
et al. submitted, Baron and Campbell, submitted). 
Simulations of terrestrial ecosystem responses to different
levels of N deposition suggested that alpine tundra ecosystems
are currently saturated, while high elevation subalpine forests
are rapidly approaching a level where they, too, will become N
saturated (Baron et al. 1994).  Investigations into the validity
and biological consequences of the model results for alpine
tundra are underway at the Niwot Ridge LTER (Bowman et al.
1993).  This research proposed here begins to address the
validity of the model results and the ecological consequences
of N saturation for old growth subalpine forests.  <p>

The National Biological Service (NBS) funded the proposal
"Large Mammalian Herbivores, Plant Interactions, and
Ecosystem Processes in Five National Parks" submitted by
Frank Singer, Jeff Welker, Mike Coughenour, Dave Valentine
and Ted Elliott.  <P>
<P>
The NBS funded the proposal "Ungulate-Prairie Dog
Interactions in Badlands National Park" submitted by Jim
Detling.  <P>
<I><em u>Abstract for Both NBS Projects</em></I>.  The
purpose of our investigations in Five National Parks in the
Intermountain West and prairie regions (Yellowstone, Rocky
Mountain, Bighorn Canyon, Badlands and Wind Cave National
Park units) is to document plant biomass production, plant
species diversity, plant fitness, and soil ecosystem processes
influences of large ungulate herbivory and to study their
relationships to other ecosystem perturbations, such as fire
suppression, climate change, and declines in keystone species,
such as beaver.  In particular, we will focus on the declining
willow and woody draw communities in Rocky Mountain, Wind
Cave and Yellowstone parks (Singer, Welker, Valentine,
Elliott), and the grassland-prairie dog-bison complex in
Badlands National Park (Detling and students).  Mike
Coughenour will take the lead role in the ecological carrying
capacity and ungulate management risk assessment modeling
aspects of the studies, building upon his own SAVANNA model
and the prior work on ungulate carrying capacity modeling in
Wind Cave by Dave Swift and students.  Significant nonNREL
scientists involved are:  (1) Rex Cates (Bringham Young
University), Gus Cothran (University of Kentucky, Equine
Blood Typing Research Lab) <P>

<h3><u><i>BIOTEX 1 (Biological
Investigations of Terrestrial
Antarctic Systems)</i></u></h3>
<p>

Diana Freckman participated in a major
research expedition (BIOTEX 1) supported by
NSF at the McMurdo Dry Valley LTER (77 S)
and the  XI Italian Antarctic Research Expedition
at Terra Nova Bay in Victoria Land (74 S),
Antarctica in December and January.  This was
the largest international team of terrestrial
biologists to work in Antarctica and included 4
Italian, 5 British and 1 US scientists from Univ.
Siena, Univ. Trieste, Univ. Roma, British
Antarctic Survey (Cambridge, UK), Anglia
Polytechnic Univ (Cambridge), Wye College,
Univ. London, and Colorado State Univ.  The
study was supported by the Scientific Committee
of Antarctic Research (SCAR), the international
body of the Antarctic Treaty that advises and
coordinates scientific research in Antarctica. 
The expedition brought together, for the first
time, a team of specialist scientists to make an
intensive  and detailed multidisciplinary study of
all terrestrial organisms and their living
environment at one site.  Diana Freckman joined
the BIOTEX group and Dr. W. Vincent (Univ.
Laval, Quebec, Canada; Chair, International
Planning Group on Environmental Management
of Dry Valleys) at the Lake Hoare LTER Site. 
Cloches (open and closed UV-opaque and
UV-transparent chambers) were established on
the soil, close to long-term open-top ITEX
(International Tundra Experiment) chambers, for
comparative studies on microalgal and
nematode colonization. Both types of cloches
were also placed at the Edmonson Point
BIOTEX Site.  Cloches are being used to
investigate the effect of elevated temperature in
relation to global warming, and UV-radiation on
colonization by microorganisms and mosses, the
biochemistry of cold-adapted bacterial
populations, and the distribution and diversity of
nematodes, springtails and mites.   In mid
December, the BIOTEX team moved to the main
expedition camp set up for the researchers at
Edmonson Point.<p>

The proposal "Pathway Assessment of
Exposures to Residents Living near Cotter
Corporations Canon City Uranium Mill" by Tom
Kirchner and Thomas E. Hakonson, Sr.
Research Scientist, Center for Ecological Risk
Assessment and Management, CSU was funded
by Cotter Corporation.  This project will estimate
exposures to individuals living near a uranium
mill.  The assessment will consider external
inhalation and ingestion pathways.  Gaps in the

The proposal titled "Forecasting Impacts of Land
Use Change on Elk Habitat in the Mountains:
Tools for Planners and Citizens" by Tom Hobbs,
John Gross, Dave Theobald and Bill Riebsame
was funded by the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation.  Tools for use by citizens, planners,
and agencies will be developed to anticipate the
large scale impacts of development on elk
populations and habitats.  These tools will identify
priorities for land acquisition or protections, and
will evaluate the consequences of alternative
land use plans and practices for maintaining
high quality elk habitat.  The system will consist
of modules to forecast the pattern of land use
under user-specified scenarios, evaluate habitat
quality for elk, and simulate elk populations.  The
system will exploit the capabilities of the
ARC/INFO GIS, a software package that is
already in widespread use by local, state, and
federal agencies.  <p>

<b>	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENTIST</b><P>

	USDA UVB Monitoring Program<BR>
	Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory<BR>
	Colorado State University<P>

A program at Colorado State University designed to measure surface
ultraviolet radiation at approximately thirty sites throughout the
continental U.S. including Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico has an opening for
a full-time scientist with a strong background in the atmospheric sciences
with an emphasis on radiation transfer.  This position will support the
development of algorithms for the processing of data from approximately
thirty field stations measuring total horizontal, diffuse and direct normal
solar spectral irradiance in the ultraviolet and visible The successful
candidate will be expected to work with various user communities (biological
effects, atmospheric science, etc.) to develop data summaries or other data
products to support their research, and to carry out a basic studies such as
the assessment of long-term trends and the effects of aerosols and clouds on
surface UVB radiation. The successful applicant will be expected to work
with and provide an interface with other government and university
scientists to carry out these objectives.<P>

The program is supported by a grant initiated in 1992 from the U. S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the establishment and operation of a
national network of solar radiation monitoring sites.  Emphasis is on the
region of ultraviolet radiation commonly referred to as "UVB", an area of
the solar spectrum (approximately 290-320 nm) identified as responsible for
plant and materials damage as well as human health problems.  Since UVB
radiation is expected to increase in the future as a result of stratospheric
ozone reduction, knowledge of current radiation levels, geographic
variability, natural variations, and trends is critical to the understanding
of the potential impacts on agricultural productivity and to warning the
public to guard against exposures which may affect human health.  The USDA
program is coordinated  with other federal agencies with UVB measurement
programs as well as those in Canada, New Zealand, and Europe and is working
with the U.S. Weather Service, Canadian Atmospheric and Environment Service,
and will be a contributor to an international data base for UVB radiation
sponsored by the World Meteorology Organization (WMO).<P>

Processing of these data will involve providing UVB values corrected for
various instrument calibrations and characterizations as well as developing
products such as biological action spectra weighted values, daily doses etc.
Other products that can be developed from the UV and visible surface
spectral irradiance will be column ozone and optical depths.  This data may
eventually be combined with satellite ozone data and other radiation
measurements to form the program's data base to provide information basic to
our understanding of factors affecting the amount of UVB radiation reaching
the earths surface.   In addition to working with the biological and
atmospheric science community to support their research needs, a major
responsibility of the position will be  to carry out basic studies on the
nature of UV-B radiation and factors affecting its transfer through the
atmosphere. <P>

Minimum qualifications for the position include:<P>
<UL>
<LI> 	PhD degree in the atmospheric sciences, radiation physics or related field
or a MS degree and ten years of relevant experience.
<LI> 	Demonstrated experience in atmospheric science research with emphasis on
radiation transfer (publications, reports, presentations)
<LI> 	Demonstrated ability to interact effectively with other scientists to
carry out the programs objectives.
<LI> 	Good communication and public speaking skills.
<LI> 	Demonstrated high level numerical programming skills and familiarity with
various programming languages such as C, Fortran, etc and UNIX operating
systems.
</UL>
<P>

Preference will be given to candidates with  radiation transfer research
experience involving collaboration with other scientists and who demonstrate
strong numerical programming and modeling skills as well as a knowledge of
spectral measurements and the importance of instrument characteristics such
as angular response, band pass (slit or filter functions), stray light,
calibration etc. to the establishment of a quality data base.<P>

This is a fully-funded, full-time, non-teaching, non-tenure track general
faculty position.  Continued funding for the position is dependent on
continued support of  the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  While this is
supported as a long-term program (projected over ten years) funding is not
guaranteed.<P>

Salary:  In the range of $40,000 -- $60,000:  Negotiable depending on
qualifications.<P>

<h2>Scientific Societies</h2>
<p>

<u><i>Society of Nematologists</i></u><p>

<p>

Diana Freckman was elected a Fellow of the
Society of Nematologists and attended the
awards ceremony in Little Rock, AR in August. 
<p>

<i><u>Ecological Society of America</u></i><p>

<p>

Alan Covich has been named Chair of the
Ecological Society of America, Special
Committee on Membership.  Some of the
questions and issues they will be addressing
are: (1) Can or should anything be done about
the rather high (ca. 10%) annual turnover in
membership?  (2) Many people who are
members of the Society do not subscribe to any
of our subject matter journals.  Who are these
people and why have they become members
even if they do not take one of our journals?
What do they tell us about the current meaning
of membership in ESA?  (3) What incentives, if
any, should be offered in the future to induce
people to become/remain members of ESA? 
Should specific efforts be made to encourage
types of people who are not now members to
join ESA?  How large is the pool of potential
members?  <p>

<p>

<p>

Mike Coughenour, Dexing Chen and Roger Pielke were
awarded a 3-year grant from the NSF/DOE Terrestrial
Ecology and Global Change Program.  The proposal is
entitled "Grassland-atmosphere interactions: analyses
using coupled ecophysiological, ecosystem,
micrometeorological, and mesoscale atmospheric models." 
The broad objective is to use ecological-atmospheric
models to examine responses to increased atmospheric
CO2 and changed climate.  Some of the responses may be
altered by feedbacks between the ecosystem and the
atmosphere.   They will coordinate with C. Owensby et al.
at Kansas State, as well as others at NREL and at the
CPER/LTER who are conducting CO2 exposure studies in
grasslands.  <p>

<p>

The proposal "Integrated Assessment of the Effects of
Climate and Land Use Change on Ecosystem Dynamics,
Stability and Resilience on the Mongolian Steppe" by Jim
Ellis, Mike Coughenour, Kathy Galvin and C. J. (Jim)
Tucker (Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD) was
funded by the Methods and Models for Integrated
Assessment Program of NSF, for 3 years.  The proposal
aims to combine remote sensing, GIS, simulation modeling,
decisions support analysis and ground survey information
to provide a means for determining how regional patterns
of climate and land use interact to influence several aspects
of ecosystem dynamics as well as human offtake from
steppes of Mongolia and northern China.  As a correction,
the proposal announced in the last issue of NREL News
Notes from NASA to Ellis, Price and Galvin to conduct
research in Mongolia was not funded, but K. Price from the
University of Kansas is a collaborator on the MMIA
proposal, which has similar objectives.  <p>

<p>

The proposal "Fungal Contributions to Soil Organic Matter
Formation" by Keith Paustian, Ted Elliott and Serita Frey
was funded by USDA/CSRS.  The use of alternative tillage
practices, in particular no-till, is rapidly increasing in many
areas and is likely to become the predominant practice in
the future.  Differences in tillage may cause fundamental
changes in the structure of the microbial community, with a
greater predominance of fungi under no-till.  Increased
rates of soil organic matter formation observed in no-till
soils may be attributable, at least in part, to enhanced
fungal populations and activities in these soils.  Our overall
objective is to exaine fungal contributions to soil organic
matter accumulation and stabilization in no-till
agroecosystems.  <p>

<p>

The NIH/University of Texas at Austin proposal titled
"Population and Environment in the U.S. Great Plains" by
W. Parton, L. Bohren, I. Burke, K. Galvin, and W. Riebsame
was funded for 5 years.  This is a multidisciplinary study of
long-term aspects of the relationship between population
and the environment in the Great Plains of the U.S.  This
project will collect and analyze county-level data about land
use decisions and their consequences for the population
and environment over more than a century in order to
understand long-term, interactive, and recursive
relationships.  The study will validate its findings and
develop new hypotheses with in-depth research about a
small sample of communities within the Great Plains.  The
final stage will be to follow these analyses with a model-building and simulation exercise that will first build long-term
models of environmental change using the CENTURY soil
model system.  Then investigators will integrate the
analysis of demographic and environmental change by
building a demographic and social change component to
add to the CENTURY model and comparing the results of
this modeling exercise with the historical record for the
Great Plains.  <p>

<p>

Jeff Welker has been funded by the Alaskan National
Biological Service group to study the isotopic relationships
between arctic tundra vegetation from the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and that in caribou from the Porcupine
Herd.  Mark Larson, a Ph.D. student will be working with
Jeff on this study.  <p>

<p>

Bill Parton received funding from NSF/Oregon State
University for his continuation proposal titled "Long-Term
Intersite Experiments of Leaf and Fine Root
Decomposition."  <p>

<p>

Richard Flagler has been funded by EPA/University of
Massachusetts for his proposal titled "Assessing the
Response of Three North American Pine Species to Ozone
Using Ethylenediurea and Sodium Eythorbate".  Ozone is
a widespread air pollutant that causes damage to many
crop plants and forest trees.  The usual method of exposing
trees to ozone involves growing trees inside chambers to
contain the level of ozone desired.  This research uses a
novel approach of treating trees with two different
antiozidant chemicals that destroy ozone.  The advantage
of this approach is that trees can be grown in the ground
without any artificial barriers that may modify other
components of the environment.  Through this technique,
the response to ozone of three ecologically and
economically important pine species can be determined.  <p>

<p>

The proposal titled "Oregon Coast Range Province
Adaptive Management Pilot Project: application of AR/GIS,
Collaborative GIS..." by Ted Elliott has been funded by
USDA/Forest Service.  To pilot  test application of the Active
Response Geographic Information System (AR/GIS) with
the Oregon Coast Range Province Adaptive Management
Pilot Project cooperatively between the USFS Siuslaw NF,
BLM Salem District, USFS-Research PNW Corvallis &amp;
Rocky Mountain Stations, TERRA, IBM Government
Systems, Inc. And CSU.  In particular to explore use of the
system to aid geographically based discussion and
application of models (or other suitable analytic tools) to
improve collaboration and decision-making.  <p>

<p>

Tom Stohlgren received $10,000 from the U.S. Geological
Survey (via the NPS) for "Bibliographies of USGS Mapped
Information In and Around the National Parks".  Krista Alper
will be transferring, editing, and formatting the data into Pro-Cite.  <p>

<p>

Dennis Ojima, Tom Kirchner and Bill Parton received
funding from NSF(MMIA)/Univ. Nebraska for the proposal 
titled "Integrated Assessment of Climate and Land Use
Changes in the Central U.S."  In this period of rapid
environmental and human-system changes, an integrated
approach to assessment of the ecological and human-system dynamics is fundamental to our understanding and
assessment of ecosystem dynamics.  Changes in land use
and climate systems are contributing to rapid changes in
how ecosystems behave.  Ecosystem and socio-economic
models are needed to investigate the differential causes
and effects of land use changes in the central region of the
U.S.  These models also need to be developed within the
context of a policy formulation decision support system, so
that the results will be not only of scientific interest but of
direct policy relevance.  <p>

Two of Tom Stohlgren et al.'s publications that discussed
the need for biotic inventories in National Parks were used
by freelance writer George Wuerthner, who wrote a nice
"Forum" article in this month's issue of <i>National Parks</i> (Vol.
69 No. 9-10, pages 45-46).  Stohlgren was quoted in the
Fort Collins Coloradoan (September 30) about budget cuts
in the NBS.  He was optimistic, but also mentioned that
fewer USDI Bureau needs will be met with the proposed
deep cuts.  <p>

Change has funded a three-year project to investigate responses of the
shortgrass steppe to CO2 enrichment.   The work is to be performed at the
USDA/ARS Central Plains Experimental Range near Nunn, Colorado, with
principal investigators located with USDA/ARS and Colorado State University
in Fort Collins, CO.  Six open-top chambers will be constructed to evaluate
how 2X ambient CO2 concentrations influence plant and soil responses.  Three
of the chambers will operate at present ambient CO2 concentrations, and the
other three will be enriched with CO2 to twice current ambient
concentrations.  The person hired for this position will be responsible for
the construction and day-to-day operation of the open-top chamber facility.
They will also be responsible for some data collection and data processing.
After an initial orientation of various micrometeorological and gas exchange
equipment, the person hired will be responsible for integrating
plant\soil\atmospheric monitoring equipment into a data acquisition/control

Ted Elliott has been appointed as
Director of the CSU Office of
Ecosystem Research and Mangement
(OERM).  The office is the result of
the Colorado Agricultural Res.
Station-Plant Sci. Strategic Planning
review and external evaluation, for
which Ted was chair.  OERM was
established to investigate the
development of a University-wide
Program of ecosystem research and
management.  It is being supported
for an initial two years by the
Colorado Agricultural Experiment
Station, the Office of the Vice-
President for Research, the College of
Natural Resources and the College of
Agriculture.  The Office is working
towards identifying the Program's
organizational structure, defining
expectations and clarifying it's
relation to departments, colleges and
organized research laboratories,
centers and institutes.  Potential
clientele are being identified within
Colorado, the region and the nation. 
Initially, the Office is extending the
reach of ecosystem efforts both within
and beyond campus to assist driving
 research agenda-setting processes. 
In this regard, OERM has coordinated
the submission of a proposal to
establish the National Center for
Environmental Decision-Making
Research (NCEDMR) at CSU, to be
funded by the National Science
Foundation.  An embellished version
of the NCEDMR proposal is contained
within the OERM homepage (see

A proposal titled Characterizing the Biologic and Economic Components
Necessary for the Integrated Management of Alfalfa Stem Nematode&#34;,
submitted to the Agricultural Experiment Station by Robert Niles, William Brown,
Diana Freckman, Donald Lybecker, and Calvin Pearson was funded for two years. 
<I><em u>Abstract</em></I>.  This interdisciplinary project will assess the
ecology, pathology, and economics of alfalfa stem nematode in Colorado. 
<P>
Keith Paustian (PI) and Ted Elliott received funding for a new NSF Ecosystems
project titled "Environmental and management controls on soil structure and
organic matter dynamics."  The research will combine experiments and modeling
studies to elucidate the interactions between soil structure dynamics and organic
matter turnover as a function of environmental and management controls on
agroecosystems.  The proposed study will build on new developments in the theory
of organic matter stabilization in soil and new soil organic matter fractionation
techniques developed at NREL.  Experiments (including stable isotope (<em
sup>13</em>C,<em sup>15</em>N) studies) will  utilize three long-term field
experiments, representing gradients in climate, soil texture and management
regimes.  The results will be used to develop and test a revised agroecosystem
model to analyze organic matter dynamics and its consequences for productivity
and nutrient cycles. The research will be of direct relevance for the analysis of
management effects on soil quality, the prediction of organic matter and nutrient
dynamics in low-chemical input and conventional cropping systems, and for
analyzing land management effects on soil C balances and global change.  
<P>
Ted and Keith were also recently funded by the USDA Competitive Grants
program for a project titled "Fungal contributions to the formation of soil organic
matter."  Serita Frey also contributed to the preparation of the proposal and will
be a graduate student on the project.  The overall objective is to examine fungal
contributions to SOM accumulation and stabilization in NT agroecosystems.  More
specifically, we will examine (1) factors controlling fungal dominance in NT
systems, (2) physiological mechanisms contributing to SOM retention and (3) the
role that fungi play in the formation of stable aggregates within which SOM is
physically protected.  Several characteristics of hyphal growth may confer a
competitive advantage on saprophytic fungi in the surface soil of NT systems. 
Soils containing fungal-dominated microbial communities may retain more SOM
than bacterial dominated soils because (1) fungi have higher carbon assimilation
efficiencies than bacteria (2) they produce by-products that are more recalcitrant to
decomposition than bacteria and (3) they form and stabilize aggregates within
which SOM is physically protected against decomposition.  Assessments of
alternative management strategies will be based to a large degree on models, and
therefore a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling C and N dynamics
in no-till soils will help improve the quality and reliability of these predictions. 
The research described in this project advocates a re-emphasis on fundamental
biological processes in soil to explain formation and stabilization of soil organic
matter, which in turn, impacts entire agricultural ecosystems.

Ted Elliott, Bob Woodmansee and Jack Hautaluoma were PIs with over twenty
other scientists on a proposal submitted to NSF for a National Center for
Environmenal Decision-Making Research (NCEDMR).  The NCEDMR will produce
and disseminate knowledge about specific environmental issues applicable to policy
and decision makers.  It will also produce and disseminate fundamental knowledge
to other researchers and decision making centers about the synthesis processes
leading to the production of this knowledge.  Activities will focus primarily on (1)
knowledge synthesis and research assisted by (2) information exchange methods
and (3) communication science and technology.  The Decision/Policy Systems
Analysis program included the activities of information needs, issue typology,
collaboration processes, database analysis, case studies, test projects and
implementation studies.  Within the program, the test projects include
implementing ecosystem management in the Rio Puerco watershed, land-use policy
in Colorado, evaluation of North American carbon policy, environmental policy on
the US/Mexico border and national policy on toxic waste in the environment.  The
program of Protocols for Environmental Decision-Making includes the areas of
structured analysis methodology, risk assessment, adaptive management,
integrated assessment, law analysis and economic analysis.  <P>
   The NCEDMR is built upon a host of existing strengths including the Natural
Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University (CSU), the Natural
Resources Law Center at the University of Colorado and the University of Victoria,
British Columbia, School of Public Administration.  A key strength of placing the
headquarters of the NCEDMR at CSU is the vast array of expertise and data
available at the University that is related to environmental issues, including
biophysical, social and non-technical areas.  Add to this the expertise and
databases available from the over 800 federal, state, and private scientists and it
is no wonder that Fort Collins has earned the reputation as one of the natural
resource and environmental centers of the world.  Establishment of the NCEDMR
in the Colorado Front Range would tremendously enhance collaboration among
these groups and make NCEDMR a premier vehicle for funneling environmental
information to policy and decision makers. <P>

Mike Coughenour had a very productive visit at the National
Rangelands Program of CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology
in Canberra, Australia.  There was considerable interest in using
the SAVANNA spatial ecosystem modeling approach to scale up
process level understanding of pastoral ecosystems in Australia,
particularly the semi-arid woodlands.  It is likely that Mike will
be collaborating with the Australians to apply the model there. 
The broad<P>
objective would be to use spatially explicit ecosystem modeling to
develop scenarios of plant, soil, biodiversity, and livestock
production responses to alternative land and herd management
practices and land use allocations at local through regional
(~25,000) spatial scales and 5-100 year time scales.<P>

Keith Paustian received funding from USDA Competitive Grants Program for
a 3-year project titled Analysis of production, N dynamics and profitability in
complex cropping systems&#34;, which includes a subcontract to J.T. Ritchie
at Michigan State University.  This project will use a newly developed
simulation model, SALUS, to analyze crop, soil and economic variables in
complex cropping systems.  The model is designed to perform multi-year
simulation of multi-species crop rotations and a wide variety of management
options.  The model will be tested using existing data from 11 long-term field
experiments located in 10 different states, representing a high diversity in
climate, soil and management conditions.  The model is intended to serve as
a decision support tool for policy analysts, managers and extension specialists
and to support strategic agricultural research.  <P>
<P>
The proposal titled Analysis of past and current changes in grassland
ecosystem dynamics in Asia and North America&#34; was funded by NSF. 
This proposal was submitted by Larry Tieszen (Augustana College), Dennis
Ojima, Jim Tucker (NASA), and Chuluun Togtohyn.  This is a proposed 3 year
project to investigate the role and consequences of changes in climate, land use,
vegetation, and soils of the temperate grassland ecosystems of Asia and North
America.  The objective of this study is to characterize the factors controlling
ecosystem integrity relative to changes in climate and land use of North
American and Asian grasslands, and to understand these changes relative to
the presence and distribution of C3 and C4 species in these two regions.  The
project will utilize the information gathered over the years at long-term
research sites of the grasslands in Asia and North America and collect new
data where needed for isotopic analysis of soil and vegetation for cross-
comparisons of grassland productivity and ecosystem structure and function. 
The integrating techniques of isotopic fractionation, remote sensing, and
ecosystem modeling to evaluate the status of these ecosystems will be used.

Characterization of environmental stability and susceptibility to climate
change and human disturbance: A case study of the arid and semiarid steppes
of northern China and Mongolia&#34;.  The dry steppes of northern China
(Inner Mongolia) and Mongolia have a long and well documented history of
changing climate and changing land use.  The region of Inner Mongolia, now
part of China, is essentially a transition zone between the relatively stable,
moderately productive farming zones of northern China and the unstable
rangelands of western Inner Mongolia and southeastern Mongolia.  This
transition zone, plus adjacent farming and rangeland zones, provide a unique
opportunity to evaluate how climate variability and climate change influence
the stability of dryland ecosystems and how human land use further impinges
(or does not impinge) upon the relationship between climate variability and
ecosystem dynamical stability.  In this study these interactions using multi-
temporal and interregional comparisons of remotely-sensed vegetation index
(NDVI) values in conjunction with on the ground analyses of vegetation
dynamics, land use patterns and land use intensity will be explored.  A
successful conclusion will result in a new level of understanding of the
influence of climate variability and change on ecosystem stability and a
satellite based analytical procedure for assessing the relative stability of global
ecosystems.  <P>

Jill Baron and Diana Freckman received funding from NSF for their proposal
titled Biogeochemical and hydrologic controls on nutrient fluxes in freshwater
ecosystems: linking isotopic information with spatially distributed models:
Collaborative Proposal to NSF from CU, CSU, UA and USGS.  This proposal
will trace sources and sinks of nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate in alpine Niwot
Ridge and subalpine Loch Vale Watershed, Colorado.  The objective is to
address how these solutes are affected by seasonal and storm-related changes
in flowpaths.  <P>
<P>
Arvin Mosier (USDA), Jack Morgan (USDA &amp; Soil &amp; Crop Sci.), Dave
Valentine, Bill Parton and Dennis Ojima received funding from NSF-TEGCO
for the proposal titled Shortgrass steppe ecosystem dynamics and trace gas
exchange under elevated CO<em sub>2</em>".  The three basic objectives in this
research are to determine the impact of doubling CO<em sub>2</em> in the SGS
on photosynthesis, productivity, water and N use efficiency, plant water
relations, and C and N allocation in above and belowground organs in two
dominant grass species, <I>Bouteloua gracilis</I> (C4) and <I>Pascopyrum
smithii</I> (C3); determine the impact of doubling CO on soil water and N
 dynamics; and to incorporate knowledge gained from these studies into
simulation models that will allow for realistic extrapolation through time and
space of soil moisture, nutrient cycling, plant productivity and overall
ecosystem response.  The research proposed is primarily a field program that
will be conducted at the USDA/ARS Central Plains Experimental Range
(CPER)-Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.  Close association and
coordination will be maintained within the CPER and LTER programs and the
information gleaned from these studies will be used directly within both long-
term programs.  <P>

Dennis Ojima, Tom Kirchner and Bill Parton received funding from the
University of Nebraska/NSF (MMIA) for their proposal titled Integrated
assessment of climate and land use changes in the central U.S.&#34;  In this
period of rapid environmental and human-system changes, an integrated
approach to assessment of the ecological and human-system dynamics is
fundamental to our understanding and assessment of ecosystem dynamics. 
Changes in land use and climate systems are contributing to rapid changes in
how ecosystems behave.  Ecosystem and socio-economic models are needed to
investigate the differential causes and effects of land use changes in the central
region of the U.S.  These models also need to be developed within the context
of a policy formulation decision support system, so that the results will be not
only of scientific interest but of direct policy relevance.  
<P>
Bill Parton, Lenny Bohren (Dept. of Industrial Science), Indy Burke, Kathy
Galvin and Bill Riebsame (Univ. Colorado, Boulder) received funding from
NIH/Univ. Texas, Austin) for their proposal titled Population and
Environment in the U.S. Great Plains&#34;.  The main goal is a
multidisciplinary study of long-term aspects of the relationship between
population and the environment in the Great Plains of the United States.  This
research involves an examination of the demographic experience of the region
and toward a model of recursive change in population and environment, one
in which changes in one of these factors in one time period influence the other
in a subsequent time period, and so on.  The project will also examine
hypotheses that see land use change as a process of spatial or of cultural
diffusion.  Researchers will collect and analyze county-level data about land
use decisions and their consequences for the population and the environment
over more than a century in order to understand long-term, interactive and
recursive relationships.  The study will validate its findings and will follow
these analyses with a model-building and simulation exercise using the
CENTURY soil model system, then will integrate the analysis of demographic
and environmental change by building a demographic and social change
component to add to the CENTURY model.  <P>

The TRAGNET Steering Committee met during the
American Geophysical meetings in San Francisco,
Dec. 5.  Members attending were Beth Holland,
Arvin Mosier, Dennis Ojima and Phil Robertson. 
Other participants were Keith Smith (Edinburgh,
Scotland) and W. H. Su (Beijing, China).  The
Committee approved establishing a database and a
model analysis that will be useful in determining a
general relationship of trace gas exchange across a
broad environmental gradient and to better
quantify fluxes of biogenic radiatively active trace
gases across North America.  This effort will begin
setting up the basics for the database and system
for accessing the database that should be
reasonably usable.  This effort will be conducted at
NREL.  More information is forthcoming on the
database development.  TRAGNET will hold a data
meeting at the ESA meetings July 29 and 30 in
Snowbird, UT.  The purpose of the Workshop is to
implement site data input and begin the steps for
model use of these data.  All who want to input
data to TRAGNET or use the data for modeling
should plan to attend.  If there are any questions or
comments about TRAGNET, please contact Arvin
Mosier or Dennis Ojima.  <P>

<H3>Scientists from Colorado go to the end of the Earth for a

<U>By Joseph B. Verrengia</U><BR>
<I>Rocky Mountain News Science Writer</I><p>
<p>
<B>W</B>hen the polar sky turned gray and clouds started filling Antarctica's remote Dry 
Valleys, a team of Colorado scientists scanned the rapidly shrinking horizon for their 
afternoon helicopter.    What was that noise -- the faint whisper of the chopper's rotors 
or more wind howling down the transantarctic mountain range? Or was it the blood 
pounding in their ears as they waited anxiously in a landscape so bleak and lonesome 
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration uses it to test-drive equipment 
for future Mars missions?<p>
<p>
     Between the seven researchers and their cozy laboratory at McMurdo Station lay 
more than 50 impassable miles of jagged peaks, vast glaciers and frigid ocean bays. A 
blizzard -- rare despite the polar locale -- bore down on their party, and the scientists 
knew they risked being added to the roll call of explorers the White Continent has 
claimed.      How long would they be stranded in the Dry Valleys?<p>
<p>
    Three days, as it turns out. The members of the team led by Colorado State 
University biologist Diana Freckman, were bored and dirty. During brief breaks in the 
weather, they had hurdled the ice formations on frozen Lake Hoare to sample the thin, 
salty soil on its shores for microscopic life forms.      "It was colder than blue blazes, 
and we watched the cloud ceiling get lower and lower," said Freckman, who had not 
been stranded in three previous expeditions there.<p>
<p>
      Colorado scientists said this research season was a productive one, in large part 
because NSF opened a new laboratory and computer system at McMurdo. Among its 
achievements:      
<p>

<UL>
<LI>The CSU team made at least 13 forays into three intermountain dry valleys. Unlike 
temperate deserts, these desert valleys at the bottom of the world have no insects, 
birds or plants larger than lichen.  Consequently, it is a virtually silent, odorless 
environment. 
<LI>Dale Vincent of the U.S. Geological Survey spent part of the field season at the 
South Pole station.  Among his duties: He calculated and marked this year's south 
magnetic pole.  The location might move 5 miles a year.
<LI>University of Colorado polar geologist John Andrews and others took a three-week 
voyage in the Ross Sea to investigate ice-pack trends over the past 20,000 
years.      Ice acts as a climate calendar because it accumulates in annual layers, 
much like tree rings.  Andrews will look for indications of global warming and ice 
changes.
<LI>Michael Proffitt of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, 
a joint CU Department of Commerce lab, continued ozone-hole studies.  Other 
CIRES scientists will test a radar system that profiles upper-level wind patterns. 
</UL>
<p>
     Stratospheric ozone depletion was first spotted in the polar vortex over Antarctica 10 
years ago.      In 1992, the most severe year on record, the Antarctic ozone loss 
exceeded 50% in spots and spread over an area three times as large as the United 
States.<p>
<p>
     "There was no way a helicopter was coming in.  We knew it was getting late", she 
said.      What saved the group, which included her husband, geologist John Freckman, 
and two CSU research associates, were their standard-issue survival kits, which 
included protective clothing, tents and meager rations.      "They're dropping you off in a 
very hostile climate," Freckman said.  "The helicopter might be going only 10 minutes 
away, but they still might not be able to get back and get you.  Every time they off-load 
you, they toss out these 200 pound survival bags." 
<p>
     A trio of U.S. research stations -- the South Pole, Palmer and McMurdo -- team with 
500 scientists working on 120 federally supported atmospheric, biological, astronomical 
and geological investigations during the summer research window from Halloween to 
President's Day weekend.<p>
<p>
The stations, funded by the National Science Foundation, are part of a web of five 
dozen year-round and temporary laboratories run by several nations and the 
environmental group Greenpeace.      Colorado contributed several dozen researchers 
from university and federal labs, environmental engineering firms and Antarctic 
Support Associates, an Englewood firm that operates the American bases for NSF.<p>

THE SEATTLE TIMES <B>SPECIAL REPORT</B> JANUARY 29-FEBRUARY 1, 1995
<HR><P>

CONTINUED FROM <A HREF="seattle4.html">PREVIOUS PAGE</A><P>

   The simplest is a roofed trench, frantically
scraped to get out of a killing wind.<P>
   More elaborate is a snow hut made by heaping
survival gear in a huge pile, shoveling and packing
snow over it, pulling the gear out, and hollowing
and refining the interior. Half our class does that.<P>
   Montgomery, who guides white-water-rafting
trips in Idaho in the northern summer, prefers the
geometrical artistry and challenge of an igloo --
even though construction of one would be impractical
in a real storm.<P>
   Inspired by his ambition, the rest of us pitch in
with enthusiasm, despite having already had a
brisk workout in the morning practicing halting
falls on a nearby slope with an ice-ax, then pitching
tents that have to be laboriously prepared
against potential blizzards by anchoring them in
snow.<P>
   We start a quarry first. The ice-shelf surface is
a field of crusted, wind-sculpted snow that grows
colder and denser with depth, eventually congealing
into true ice. Both men and women in our
group shovel off the top two feet or so and then
saw snow blocks from the firmer snow under that.
The foundation blocks are shaped into wedges and
laid in a climbing spiral.<P>
   It is about 20 degrees, and in short order we
are hot and sweaty; our jackets begin to come off.<P>
   Our clothes have been issued to us in
Christchurch, New Zealand, by the U.S. government.
They are remarkably warm. Long
polypropylene underwear and thick wool socks
are followed by a polar-fleece jacket and pants
and then nylon bib overalls.<P>
   Our feet are kept toasty in bulbous white plastic
"bunny boots," clumsy but effective. They got
the name because we look like cartoon rabbits.<P>
   There is a neck gaiter, a balaclava, or head
cover, a warm hat with ear flaps and ski goggles to
replace sun glasses in stormy weather. A nylon
and goose-down parka with a fur-rimmed hood
provides the outer shell. Gloves depend on the
required dexterity: wool mittens and gloves,
leather gloves, ski gloves, giant fur-covered "bear
claws" for coldest conditions and so on.<P>
   The full set of gear can weigh 35 pounds and
would probably cost nearly $1,000 to purchase.<P>
   Just in case we don't believe Antarctica can
still be a dangerous place, we are also required to
supply a full set of dental X-rays and wear dog
tags. The reason is for possible identification of
our remains.<P>
   Now we labor to turn snow into housing.<P>
   I am joined on this trip by colleagues from two
newspapers; Usha McFarling of the Boston Globe
steadily turns out snow blocks while Pat Brennan
of the Orange County Register climbs into the rising
igloo and braces it as we slowly dome over the
top. Then he burrows down and out. The surface-
level entrances drawn in cartoons let in too much
cold air; a tunnel is a more effective heat trap.
Snow is heaped and packed on the igloo's exterior
to seal wind cracks.<P>

<IMG SRC="seattle5a.gif"><BR>
<B></B><I></I><P>

   Our result is more beehive than dome in shape
but has a beautiful interior geometry. The sunshine 
seems to outline each block with blue neon,
and Register photographer Leonard Ortiz snaps
my picture inside.<P>
  The task took several hours but despite our
half-exhaustion we are not allowed to quit. We
pitch another tent, build a wall of snow blocks
around the quarry to shield our supper stoves, and
then wearily eat freeze-dried stew and drink hot
chocolate.<P>
  The sun does not set but it dims as it dips
lower in the evening sky, and the temperature
begins to fall. The pale Antarctic light plays across
a stunning panorama: a 12,500-foot steaming volcano
named Erebus, the stark frozen platter of the
Ross Shelf, the crags of the Royal Society Range.
The beauty is irresistible.<P>
  There are cross-country skis modified to fit
our bulky boots and so with the National Science
Foundation's media representative, Beth Gaston,
I ski down an ice road after dinner, still pumped
from the cold and clarity of the air. We carefully
keep to the lane marked by green and orange flags
to avoid straying into snow-hidden cracks in the
ice.  By 9 p.m., I am chilled, exhausted, and climbing
into my sleeping bag in a Scott tent. A balaclava
is over my head to ward off the cold and two
foam pads keep me warm on the sea ice. Warming
rapidly, I drift off.<P>
  Five people crowd into our igloo, even though
it is only about seven feet in diameter. By morning,
their combined body heat has made them too
hot.<P>

<H3>HUGE AND REMOTE PLACE</H3>
  Antarctica can trace its name to the Greek
word for a northern star formation, "Arktos," or
The Bear. That led to the name Arctic, and
Antarctica means "opposite" the former. The
ancient Greeks, who realized the world was a
globe, postulated that a southern continent must
exist to balance the frozen ocean in the north.<P>
  It is a huge and remote place: a rough circle
about 2,800 miles across and 5.4 million square
miles in area. In the southern winter, the 
surrounding ocean freezes enough to more than 
double the area of Antarctica's ice cover, a lid that
influences weather worldwide.<P>
  The continent is separated from the other 
continents by the unbroken Southern Ocean, a ring of
chill water that rotates around Antarctica from
west to east with a current flow equal to about
7,500 Mississippi rivers. The water boundary
between this ocean and those to the north is a
sharp break in temperature and color called the
Antarctic Covergence.<P>
  In the 24-hour daylight of summer, life
explodes in these waters to feed a cornucopia of
seals, penguins and whales. Higher life stops
abruptly at the land's edge, however, beyond the
coast it is limited to primitive plants and a couple
of Corals and insects. The polar plateau is sterile.<P>
  Antarctica is a long way from anything: the tip
of South America is 600 miles away, Australia
1,550 miles and Africa 2,500 miles. The continent
was probably not seen by any human until the
Russian Thaddeus non Bellingshausen discovered
it in 1820.<P>
  The South Pole was not reached by Roald
Amundsen until 1911. After a competing British
party led by Robert Falcon Scott arrived a month
later and subsequently froze to death, the Pole
was not visited again until 1956, when a U.S. Navy
skiplane landed to scout a site for the first permanent
polar base.<P>
  Since then, scientific investigation in Antarctica
has exploded. By the time it ends, this season
will have seen about 4,115 people from 24
countries fan out to 60 permanent research stations
and scores of field camps. About half those are
Americans.<P>
   Some 1,046 are scheduled to winter over, 370
of them Americans.<P>
   Supply is laborious and expensive. By one esti-
mate, it costs an average $80,000 to $90,000 to
sustain one American in Antarctica each year.<P>
   The United States does not have the most
bases in Antarctica -- Argentina does, with five
-- but it has by far the biggest. We have the only
base at the South Pole, a main base at McMurdo
Sound that peaks at more than 1,000 inhabitants
and a biological research base called Palmer on
the Antarctic Peninsula. The United States has
the only fleet of large, ski-equipped aircraft that
can easily support large bases away from the
coast.<P>

<A HREF="seattle5b.gif"><IMG SRC="seattle5bicon.gif">Map of the McMurdo Base</A><P>

  Arnericans journeying to Palmer pass through
Chile, but the majority of U.S. citizens go to
McMurdo, flying from Christchurch in New
Zealand.<P>
  Getting to Antarctica is tedious and uncornfortable
at best, simply frustrating if the weather is
bad. Flight time from Seattle to Christchurch is
about 14 to 16 hours, and going on to Antarctica
requires eight hours on military LC-130
propeller-driven transport planes. <P>

THE SECOND OF FOUR PARTS.</H2>

         STORY AND PHOTOS BY BILL DIETRICH<BR>
<I>         Seattle Times science reporter</I><P>


ROSS ISLAND, Antarctica -- One secret of
building an igloo is to start with about 20 uniformly
sized, carefully shaped, sawn blocks of snow.
Foundations are important.<P>
The other secret is that it is darned hard work.<P>
   Fine weather during a two-day field-safety
school required of Antarctic newcomers-more
commonly known as "Happy Camper" school -- 
inspired our instructor, Brooks Montgomery, to
persuade us to give tricky igloo construction a try.<P>
   Like all Americans who come to Antarctica and
who plan to spend time away from its main bases,
we have found ourselves building a night's camp
on the Ross Ice Shelf, a permanently frozen part of
the ocean some 150 feet to 3,000 feet thick that
forms a vast white plain about the size of Texas.<P>
   In the direction of the South Pole are Black and
White Islands, so named because of the amount of
bare rock and snow showing on each. The slot
between them is a funnel for the fierce polar
storms called "Herbies" -- the origin of the slang
is unclear -- which can catch the unwary miles
from shelter.<P>
   A few weeks before my arrival, a scientist had
violated every safety rule by taking out a snowmobile
without survival gear, radio or a companion.
Trying to make a quick 20-mile dash across the ice
toward a hut covering an ice-fishing-research
hole, he was caught by a storm. Missing for almost
seven hours before being found, he survived by
tipping over his machine as a windbreak and
huddling under a tarp.<P>
   As part of our introduction to the continent, we
get other grim stories and pictures. We are shown
sickening slides of blackened, frostbitten feet and
fingers. We are told of the hiker who took a shortcut
a few miles from our igloo and died in a
crevasse. There are stories about a helicopter that
hit a mountain and a transport plane that clipped a
snow trough and sent a propeller spinning through
its own fuselage.<P>
   Four Canadians will die in a plane crash at the
British base at Rothera before I leave the continent,
killed when their Twin Otter ski plane hit an
iceberg at the end of their runway.<P>
   In the brilliant sunshine of a snow-white world
we are asked to imagine zero visibility, will-
destroying cold, and scenarios in which the ability
to operate a radio or light a stove might make the
difference between life and death.<P>
   And how to build an emergency snow shelter.<P>

<B>At an ice cave</B><I> inside the
Mount Erebus ice
tongue, a visitor is
transfixed by ethereal
light that seems spiritual
and humbling</I><P>

<H2> EXPENSIVE SURVIVAL GEAR PART
OF THE COST OF LIVING</H2>

CONTINUED FROM <A HREF="seattle5.html">PREVIOUS PAGE</A><P>

For our flight, we
were asked to report at 3:15 a.m. for a plane that
would not depart for 5 1/2 hours, giving far more
time than necessary to don hot and bulky clothing,
have our luggage snuffled by a drug dog and hand
in paperwork.<P>
   Even after such preparation, it is not uncom-
mon for flights to be canceled at the last minute
because of weather, sometimes the cancellation
coming in midnight. Scientists have waited up to
two weeks to get from Christchurch to McMurdo.
   I did not experience such a delay; in fact, our
flight was moved up a day. While a three-star
admiral claimed a seat in the cockpit, the rest of us
were crammed without rank into the gray, dimly
lit fuselage, sitting on webbed seating around pal-
lets of cargo. It was usually either too hot or too
cold, so noisy that earplugs were necessary, and
so crowded there was scarcely room to plant our
bulky bunny boots. We were required to keep out-
door gear on as a safety measure in case we
crashed.
   We crossed the Antarctic coast at the Anare
Mountains, about 500 miles from MchFurdo, and
flew along a section of the 2,000-mile-long
TransAntarctic range, a picket wall of icy peaks
that dams the great East Antarctic ice sheet
beyond and divides the continent in two.
   At Cape Washington, there was a penguin
colony of 100,000 birds, the snow gray from their
guano, or droppings. Elsewhere, in all directions,
was Antarctica's startling purity: blinding whites
and chisel-edged blacks, ice cliffs that seem
stained with blue-green absinthe, icebergs frozen
and unmoving in pack ice, and occasional "poly-
nas" of open water, dark as ink.

                A VISIT TO "MACTOWN"
   "Mactown," as it is nicknamed, is on 43-mile-
long Ross Island, about 30 miles from the Antarc-
tic mainland. It takes its name from the strategic
sound that has been a primary Antarctic base for
nearly a century because it is the most southerly
point a ship can penetrate.
   The sound gets its name from Lt. Archibald
McMurdo, an officer on the Terror, one of the
ships that discovered the sound. McMurdo is at 77
degrees south, roughly equivalent in its nearness
to the South Pole as the U.S. Thule base in north-
ern Greenland is to the North Pole.
   This is where many early Antarctic explorers
based their expeditions. Some of the shelters they
erected still remain, kept so cold in this vast nat-







t's as fun as I
thought it would
be and twice as
beautiful. It's like
being on another
planet, like being
in a dream state.

does not decay and their furs do not disintegrate.
  Scott's Hut, above the small bay where ships
still dock at McMurdo, is a 93-year-old time cap-
sule.
  Built in 1902 and used in four subsequent
expeditions, it was a storeroom, workshop,
kitchen and galley. Musty from the smell of wood
smoke and faintly odoriferous seal blubber, it still
contains old haunches of meat, clothing, blankets,
rope and leather. The commercialism of turn-of-
the-century England is pre-
served by the barely rusted
food canisters: Fry's Cocoa,
Beck's Red Gooseberry Pre-
serves, Hunter's Famed Oat-
meal, Bird's Baking Powder.
   Such bizarre preservation
is not unique to human arti-
facts: In the Dry Valleys sci-
entists have found the mum-
mified carcasses of frozen
seals up to 3,000 years old.
   McMurdo Sound was
solidly frozen with about 9
feet of ice when I visited in
November, and a plowed strip
on its surface served as
McMurdo's airfield. Late each
summer, however, the ice
weakens enough that a Seat-
tle-based Coast Guard ice-
breaker (either the Polar Star
or the Polar Sea) can break a
path for fuel and food ships.
The airfield is then moved to
the thicker, permanently
frozen Ross Ice Shelf, which
is less convenient to McMur-
do because it is several miles
farther.
   The ships unload supplies
for the ensuing year. Most of
the food we eat in Antarctica has had been deliv-
ered by ship 10 months before.
   They also haul off about 5 million pounds of the
previous year's garbage. The waste is transported
back to the Navy ammunition depot on Indian
Island on Puget Sound, sorted and recycled or dis-
posed of by Seattle's Burlington Resources at var-
ious sites in Bellingham, Tacoma, Port Townsend
and Seattle.
   U.S. Antarctic bases have a far more compre-
hensive recycling program than Seattle, achieving
a recycling rate of 75 percent.
   This rigor is overdue. McMurdo used to be a
solid-waste eyesore, with an incinerator releasing
a plume of dirty air, gull-like skuas fighting over
kitchen garbage and other waste bulldozed into
the sea. The incinerator is shut down; the birds
have mostly left because of the recycling program,
and studies are under way to clean the harbor and
install a sewage-treatment plant.
   A nuclear-power generator that operated until
the early 1970s is also gone, replaced with simpler
diesel fuel.

                 NOT A PRETTY SIGHT
  If McMurdo is not as dirty as it used to be, it

still has the sprawling, gritty, untidy look of an
Alaska mining town. Sturdy but unlovely, the clus-
ter of about 85 buildings was started in 1955 and is
built in a saddle of volcanic dirt between Obsena-
tion and Crater hills, its snow melting away by
midsummer.
  The view beyond the settlement is as pretty as
McMurdo is ugly. There is a lovely little chapel
that looks out across the frozen sound to the coast
30 miles away. The vista is not altogether alien.
One range is called Olympus, and Mount Discov-
ery's shape is a 9,000-foot stand-in for Mount
Rainier.
  Buildings range from a glittering new Crary
Laboratory that steps down a steep dirt hillside
(named for the first man to set foot on both the
North and South Poles) to an old quonset hut
turned into a weight room and bowling alley. The
latter consists of two worn, pitted lanes as tilted as
a golfing green. The pins have to be reset by hand.
  McMurdo has two bars (smoking and non) a
coffee house, a barber shop, and a small store for
gifts and sundries. There is a greenhouse to sup-
plement the vegetable supply.
  Socially, the base is similar to being on a big
university campus, says Terry Trimingham, a
chef-turned-radio-operator who calls Ballard
home. "You live in a dorm. You eat in a galley. At
meals, I can sit next to a bulldozer operator or a
scientist from NASA," she says.
  Meals and lodging are free.
  I share a college-dormitory-type room with
geologist John Freckman of Colorado. Because all
water has to be desalinated from McMurdo Sound
-there is no unfrozen fresh water available on
Ross Island-showers were limited to two, two-
minute sessions per week when I arrived. This
was increased to one a day shortly afterward
because a new "reverse-osmosis" process has
increased water supply while cutting the fuel
needed to produce each gallon by 80 percent.
  Managing water and power is Al Martin, a vet-
eran of nine summers and three winters on the
continent and Antarctica's only U.S. marshal. The
title allows him to legally investigate the rare
crime (two male drinking companions once beat
each other with lead pipe, then made up) but he
has no gun or jail. "You can run, but you can't
hide," he quips. "It's a heck of a swim."
  Mactown runs to a seasonal rhythm. The sun
sets on April 25 and does not rise again until Aug.
18. From May 10 to Aug. 1, there is not even a lin-
gering twilight. No planes arrive and the core of
maintenance personnel live a quiet, indoor life of
deep cold, snow, storm, camaraderie and isolation.
  One of Martin's management headaches is the
way biorhythms are thrown off by the constant
darkness. Some winter-overs find it hard to sleep,
eventually becoming "walking zombies," he says.
  Many who winter over, however, love the
silent beauty and the quiet removal from the has-
sles of normal life. Friendships form quickly, occa-
sional romances blossom, and on Sundays, the
winter crew stages candlelight dinners. They are
pioneers on the world's "last remaining frontier,"
in the words of National Science Foundation sta-
tion representative David Bresnahan, "you
against the elements to some degree." Their job is
not to develop the continent but preserve it.
   Some fresh food, mail and high-priority cargo
are parachuted once in midwinter, and then the
isolation begins to end with the glimmer of spring
sun in late August. This is when the first planes
return in a resupply operation called "Winfly."
   Regular flights and the first scientists return in
October, and a trickle of newcomers becomes a
flood by November, the Antarctic spring. McMur-
do is jammed with researchers sorting out equip-
ment, refining their plans and queuing up for air-
plane or helicopter flights into the interior.
   By mid-December, most are deployed and it is
high summer at Mactown, the temperature some-
times climbing above freezing. Things are quiet
until the end of January and then the human
migration reverses itself, and scientists begin to
leave to escape the approaching winter. Activity
peaks in February as the ships arrive and 14 mil-
lion pounds of cargo are off-loaded in five days.
Then the base begins to slide toward its winter
slumber.
   Modern communications have eliminated some
of the historic isolation. There is limited satellite
television and the Internet is used to send elec-
tronic mail. Telephone calls can be made to the
United States for a dollar a minute.

                 ANTARCTIC SOCIETIES
   American society in Antarctica is split into
three groups. They mix without pretensions, but
still form separate societies.
   Giving purpose and direction to the activity are
the scientists, dubbed "beakers." Their work is
overseen by federal employees of the National
Science Foundation who coordinate the research
and logistics.
   Freeing the scientists of housekeeping chores
are the employees of Denver-headquartered
Antarctic Support Associates, the company that
provides cooks, carpenters, janitors, "Happy
Camper" instructors and so forth.
   "We like to have our science people doing sci-
ence," explains Bresnahan. With most science
projects restricted to essentially a three-month
window of acceptable weather, maximizing
research hours-rather than, say, sorting gro-
ceries-becomes critical.
   This support works well. "It is easier for us to
do research here, coming all the way from Fair-
banks, using NSF logistics, than to go to Barrow in
my own state, which is an hour's plane ride away,"
notes Mike Castellini, a seal expert from the Uni-
versity of Alaska. "In Barrow we have to get our
own air supply, our own boat, our own driver and
so on."
   It is common to meet people from the North-
west: computer operator Randy Lind from Kent,
professional mountaineer and meteorite hunter
John Schutt from Ferndale, or seal biologist Jen-
nifer Moss from Seattle.
   Finally, there is the military, which provides
aerial transportation, a dangerous occupation
where a shift of weather can mean "flying around
in a bowl of milk," as Navy Lt. Charlie Ryan
describes.

   The helicopter squadron has adopted the name
"Ice Pirates" and flies a skull and crossbones from
the hut by its gravel pad.
   "I wanted to come down here for a long time-
it was a childhood dream," explains helicopter
crewman Immanuel Albrecht, who volunteered.
"It's as fun as I thought it would be and twice as
beautiful. It's like being on another planet, like
being in a dream state. There are no cars, no
horns, no smog, and no one trying to sell a religion
or a product at your front door."

                  A HUMBLING BEAUTY
   Mactown is necessary but prosaic, unromantic.
The magic of Antarctica comes alive when you get
out of town.
   There is a lava lake in the crater of Mount Ere-
bus (a spindle-legged robot named Dante tried
unsuccessfully to climb down to it a couple years
ago) and an "ice tongue," or glacier, that spills into
McMurdo Sound at the volcano's base. The
tongue is about 20 feet higher than its enclosing
sea ice, and its creeping flow has opened crevass-
es that have evolved into ice caves.
   Outdoor instructor Kathy Young drives our
journalist group to the caves in a tractor snow cat,
following a flagged route across the slowly weak-
ening sea ice and gunning ahead to bounce over
growing ruts. With the spring breakup of ice
beginning, we are the last group to visit the caves
this year.
   The wall of the ice tongue undulates with
almost sensuously smooth ripples along its face,
glistening like polished metal. Sunlight shines
through a cornice at the top and ice crystals blow
off in the cold wind like diamond dust.
   The glacier has shouldered away some sea ice,
buckling it and creating a small hill. We scramble
up that and then slip down the other side into a
blue-white grotto, leading into the tongue's interi-
or. Ice chamber leads to ice chamber, joined by
shoulderwide cracks or sinuous tunnels.
   The result is stunning. Ice crystals adorn the
walls and roofs of the chamber in a crystal lattice
of astonishing delicacy, more intricate than any
chandelier. It is like a miniature, upside down for-
est. Icicles grow to become stalactites linking
floor and ceiling. Light leaks through the snow
that roofs these cold crevasses, filtering down in a
subtle spectrum of delicate grays and deepening
blues.
   The effect is ethereal, mystic, timeless-and
humbling.
   Here, nature reveals its beauty with a struc-
ture so simply elemental-frozen water and sun-
light-and so simultaneously complex as to mock
human pretensions. It is like an tmveiled peek into
the underlying unity of the universe. Despite the
cold, we stay in the cavern a long time.
   In Antarctica, the continent is commonly
referred to as "The Ice." People leave The Ice and
return to it, fear The Ice and fall in love with it.
Inside this tongue of Erebus, I began to under-
stand where the term came from.

simply urinate into a funnel, the regular outhouse
has a removable bucket. An experimental addition
is what the scientists have dubbed the "rocket 
toilet," an outhouse with a propane burner to turn 
human waste into ashy sludge. Its success is mixed.<P>
   Within this world of snow and ice the most
mundane task is to obtain drinking water. Lake
Hoare is too briny and too thickly frozen, so the
scientists break up blocks of glacier ice that 
periodically calve off Canada Glacier, pull them to
camp on "banana" sleds (named for their shape)
and pop them in a large pot of the furnace to melt
slowly.<P>
   It is water with history. My first night I'm
treated to Bailey's Irish Cream poured over
glacial cubes estimated to be 15,000 years old.<P>
   The camp was opened for the summer season
Oct. 23 and will be occupied until early February
with graduate students staying most of the season
and senior scientists rotating in and out.<P>
   There are 27 people in all, seven of them on
hand when I was present: three women and four
men. That ratio is typical of American personnel
in Antarctica as a whole, a big change from a
decade ago when it was still largely a male
domain.<P>
   All seven are single, they range in age from 24
to 41, and they form a communal family of 
familiarity and friction.<P>
   Field science sounds glamorous, providing an
almost ideal mix of intellectual challenge and hand
labor. But it can also be hard, mundane work.
Anya Butt's permafrost mapping requires a 
backbreaking unreeling of a grid of electrical cable
across steep rock and snow. Hydrologist Harry
House hand-builds small dams to help measure
water flow. Gayle Dana and Karen Lewis 
handcrank drills into glacial ice. Peter Soper, a Clinton
administration Americorps volunteer, is pressed
into helping on all these tasks.<P>
   Everyone has an interesting background.
Soper served in the Gulf War, Lewis has taught
mountaineering in the North Cascades, and
House tells funny stories about his days taking
tourists on camel rides through the Australian
Outback.<P>
   Like everyone in Antarctica, the scientists cel-
celebrate Thanksgiving on Saturday instead of
Thursday to minimize time lost to the holiday.
They pause long enough to cook turkey with
dressing, potatoes and gravy, yams, pumpkin pie,
and add cranberries and salad, a remarkable meal
for a Martian landscape.<P>

<H3>THE POWER OF ANTARCTICA</H3>
   It is when I roam away from such camps that I
get a taste of the full majestic power of Antarctica.<P>
   In late summer the edge of Lake Hoare melts
to form a "moat" around its permanent ice in the
middle. This refreezes in winter to form a 
relatively smooth walkway that persists into spring, a
peripheral sidewalk free of the frozen "waves" in
the lake's center.
   On a brilliantly clear morning after a night of
periodic snow squalls, I follow Gayle, Karen and
Peter Soper along the still-frozen moat past the
foot of Canada Glacier to a broken part of its face.
There they don crampons and scramble to the top
to search for a place to set up a weather station,
part of the ongoing ecological monitoring here.<P>
   Some Antarctic glaciers march at rapid speed
with the Shirase holding the current record at 1.2
miles per year. The Canada is so stable that 
scientists aren't sure yet if it is growing or shrinking
and, if so, why. The weather station will provide a
clue.<P>



<IMG SRC="seattle3a.gif"><BR>
<B>Fierce polar</B><I> winds carve knife edges of ice
at the lip of Canada Glacier.</I><P>


   I continue along the glacial base to the dirt
slopes of the Kukri Hills, and then climb a
rock-strewn ridge where the absence of normal color
makes the rubble of pink granite pop out like a
field of flowers.<P>
   I'm soon high enough to watch the trio of
scientists trudge like tiny ants across the rounded
roof of the glacier, and then higher still to see the
fogged basin of frozen McMurdo Sound 12 miles
to the east. The wind is cold enough to begin
freezing the water bottle in my parka pocket, yet I
overheat when climbing with my back to the wind.
Going uphill, I leave my down parka unzipped.<P>
   The expanding view is hypnotic and exhilarating.
Glacial boulders are wind-carved into Henry
Moore sculptures, and new peaks slowly reveal
themselves as I ramble.<P>
   There is no sound but the wind, no visible life,
and no hint up here of human intrusion. Most of
the peaks I am looking at don't have names so I
amuse myself by giving them variations of my
own; I run out of possibilities before I do 
mountains. The crackle of a communications radio in
another pocket reassures me I am not truly alone.<P>
   The sand-and-rock-strewn ridge looks like
Viking Lander pictures of Mars. Too dry on its
surface to freeze into a crust and yet underlain by
permafrost, it still contains life. Fifty million years
ago, continental drift positioned Antarctica far
enough to the north to support beech forests; as
recently as 3 million years ago the forests still
reached within 400 miles of the present Pole.<P>
   The continent's drift south and the ensuing Ice
Ages finally extinguished most species. Tiny 
remnants cling here: bacteria, 96 counted species of
algae, and even some lichens and moss in tlle
cracks of rock or along the beds of the meltwater
streams that run just a few weeks per year.<P>
   Yeast has been found within 183 miles of the
South Pole. Algae grows in summer meltwater
pools on glaciers.<P>
   Life survives here only with extreme patience.
One of the most curious creatures is a nearly
microscopic worm called a nematode.<P>
   At the foot of the dirt ridges not far from Lake
Hoare, a team of women scientists led by Diana
Freckman of Colorado State University, assisted
by her geologist husband, John, works on a project
to learn the density and curious lifestyle of these
worms: a tale of the ability of a seemingly dead
husk to return to life with the gift of a drop of
water.<P>
   Nematodes are a common animal and routine
agricultural pest -- Diana Freckman estimated
there are 50 to 100 nematode species in every
handful of Seattle soil -- but their presence in 60
to 70 percent of the soil of the Dry Valleys came
as a surprise. The only way they can survive in
such extremes is to lead a Rip Van Winkle life.<P>
   Their normal life of growth, reproduction and
death might take nine months to play out 
elsewhere, but they depend on a film of liquid water to
persist. That is such a rarity in the Dry Valleys
that they must wait as desiccated husks until a
trickle of snowmelt brings them briefly back to
life. Once active, they feed on bacteria, continue
their life cycle as long as weather permits, and
then curl back into a state of suspended animation
when a snow squall or shadow again freezes their
realm. One theory is that their husks are then
scooped up and redistributed by the wind.<P>
  Scientists believe the nematodes awaken with
meltwater each brief summer, thrive for hours or
days, and then refreeze, continuing this interrupted
life indefinitely. "They might be years old,
decades, centuries," said John Freckman. "We
don't know."<P>
  What makes nematode research so useful in
Antarctica is its relative simplicity. "Imagine my
delight in finding a place were I have only three to
six species of nematodes," said Diana Freckman.
"Here we can really try to track down what this
group of animals does in ecosystems, at the
species level."<P>
  Because the soil biology here is so simple, the
Freckmans can measure environmental influences
on the worms at their "nematode farm" on
the shore of Lake Hoare. On different plots they
are increasing temperature, adding water, fertilizing
the soil and taking other steps that should give
some parameters to the fragility and tenacity of life.<P>
  The nematode's cyclic seizure of opportunity
is a bit analogous to visiting humans in Antarctica.
The majority of Americans migrate in each summer,
scatter under the sun, and leave before winter.
That our species, which likely evolved in
Africa, can survive here at all is a story of ingenuity
and determination.<P>

  Space Administration (NASA) for future space
colonies may first be tested there.<P>
  The continent also is the world's last true wilderness.
Probably no human ever saw it until 1820. There are no true towns, only research
bases. There are no children, and nothing is
green. Since 1994, even non-native animals such
as dog teams have been banned.<P>
   Researching Antarctica costs American taxpayers
about $198 million this year. It is both a
huge effort -- dwarfing by many times, for example,
the worldwide cost of field hunting for
dinosaur bones and other prehistoric fossils -- and 
a fraction of the federal budget, which is 7,500
times as large.<P>
   Science reporters compete annually to join a
National Science Foundation program that brings
a handful of journalists to see firsthand what the
money is spent on.<P>

<H2>NOT MUCH ALIVE</H2>
   No place better illustrates why scientists come
here than the Dry Valleys.<P>
   The rocky landscape harbors what is probably
the simplest ecosystem on Earth. Only a few
species interact here, exchanging carbon and
exhaled gases. Scientists hope the valleys will
yield theories that could later be successfully
applied to more complex ecosystems in warmer
places.<P>
   Accordingly, the Dry Valleys have been piked
as one of several Long Term Ecological Research
sites established by the United States. Others
range from tropical rain forest to hot desert: The
HJ. Andrews old-growth forest east of Eugene is
the closest site to Seattle.<P>
   "There's so much pressure on our ecosys-
tems," explained glaciologist Gayle Dana, "that
we need to understand their processes to under-
stand how they will respond to those pressures."<P>

  The ice cover on Lake
Hoare, for example, has
thinned from 18 feet in
1978 to 11 feet today, and
the lake level is rising. Is
this an indication of global
warming? Scientists don't
know yet. Summer temperatures in the Antarctic
Peninsula are averaging 4
degrees warmer the past
few decades, lengthening
the growing season there
by two weeks.<P>
  While extremely dry,
the valleys warm enough
each summer to generate
streams of meltwater
from glaciers. The continent's longest river, the
Onyx, runs about 20 miles
in the nearby Wright Valley, emptying into Lake
Vanda.<P>
  Meltwater is the
source of lakes that may
be as much as 5 million
years old. Their ice cover
prevents normal mixing,
produces briny layers, and does peculiar things:
While Lake Hoare is bitterly cold, Lake Vanda
warms under ice, which acts like a greenhouse. In
its lower layers the water reaches 70 degrees.<P>
   Nearby Lake Fryxell is so oxygen starved,
nutrient poor and unmixed that a science team
from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in
Massachusetts is using it as a test bed for ideas
about pollution in places ranging from Boston
Harbor to the Black Sca.<P>
   "All the lakes are different," Andersen says.
"Why life? Why here?"<P>

<H2>A SURREAL VIEW</H2>
   As Andersen disappears underwater, my view
from the ice of Lake Hoare is harsh, surreal and
stunning. There is no pollution, no dust and very
little water vapor in Antarctic air. One can see
with astonishing clarity for stupendous distances;
a mountain 30 miles away looks like it is only 10.
It is easy, and dangerous, to misjudge distance
when walking.<P>
     Lake Hoare is dammed at one end  by blue-white
Canada Glacier and walled at the other by Suess 
Glacier, named for an Austrian geologist.  Its sides
are framed by the 6,000-foot peaks of the Asgard Range,
named for the home of the Norse gods, and the Kukri Hills,
named after the jagged edge of a Gurkha knife.  Mountains
stack up upon mountains to ultimately hold back the deep and
vast East Antarctic ice cap, forcing it to slowly
spill toward the sea in twisting glaciers between
the peaks.<P>
   The lake's ice surface is curiously uneven,
carved into slippery "waves" 1 to 3 feet high. Dust
blown onto the lake forms dark patches that promote
more surface melting in the brief summer.
Over the centuries these warm pockets have
slowly deepened to produce a frozen, choppy surface
difficult to scramble over.<P>
   When Andersen makes his Sunday-night dive,
the waves of ice are still coated with a light powder 
of snow lingering from the Antarctic winter,
when temperatures here routinely dip to 40 below
zero and the sun does not rise for 125 days.<P>
   The timing of Andersen's "nighttime" swim
does not strike the seven scientists camped at
Lake Hoare as peculiar. While meals and sleep
adhere somewhat to conventional schedules
much of the ordinary rhythm of life falls away in
the field. The researchers work all the time, but at
a deliberate pace with self-chosen breaks. Weather
is a greater determinant of activity than the circular
swing of the sun around the mountains.<P>
   Nothing is easy in such extreme locations. The
act of making a hole in the frozen lake took some
thought.<P>
   "We didn't know how to get through the ice," 
Andersen recalls from his first visits to Antarctica, 
which began in 1978. Ordinary drills 4 feet in
diameter and attached to Caterpillar tractors could
not be flown or driven to the remote valley.<P>
   "You could start with a chain saw, but how
would you cut through (but not fall through) when
you got to the bottom?" Andersen says. "You 
could blast a hole, but that would pollute the lake 
and air. Then Art DeVries (a fish biologist) was
lying on a couch at McMurdo and saw a plumber
walk by with a coil of copper wire. That's where
he got the idea."
<P>
  The researchers pumped heated antifreeze
through a flat coil shaped like the burner on an
electric stove. Set on top of the lake ice, it slowly
melted a hole.<P>
  Because Andersen can only get out of the lake
through the same hole he enters, safety concerns
are paramount. Andersen's helpers this evening
are Peter Doran, a Canadian scientist who has
worked in the Arctic or Antarctic the past 11
years, and Anya Butt, a graduate student mapping
the valley's permafrost. They tend a line that
allows the diver to be pulled toward the surface in
an emergency. Andersen can also speak into his
regulator and be heard over a radio set on a fuel
drum.<P>
  We monitor his heavy breathing and periodic
progress reports as he laboriously fills water-sample
bottles to make gas measurements, his air
bubbles causing the ice hole to boil like a Jacuzzi.<P>
  Emerging after 40 minutes and flopping out
like a seal, Andersen walks the quarter-mile
across the lake ice back to a hut on Lake Hoare's
shore. The water quickly freezes into a layer of ice
on his dry suit. He has to wait a few minutes in a
heated hut before he can work his zippers and
shed his neoprene skin.<P>
  He dismisses the cold. Doran and Andersen
have the quiet, unflappable air of self-confidence
encountered among longtime Antarctic adventurers.
In 1991-92 they visited a Russian base at
another Antarctic dry area called the Bunger Hills,
where winds average 30 mph and winter storms
are so fierce -- up to 200 mph -- that four buildings
were destroyed before their party arrived.<P>
  The scientists lived for four months on potatoes,
an onion and garlic every day, plus noodles
and frozen and salted fish. Their Russian cook was
also their doctor. "We knew he couldn't cook, and
it was doubtful he could be a doctor," Andersen
recalls.<P>

   As winter approached in April, winds accelerated,
and the two were caught in a cyclonic storm
blowing at more than 100 mph. Andersen, who
was alone on a glacier, took shelter behind a
"nunatak," a rock spire poking up through the ice.
Doran, caught in the howling storm on a frozen
lake, began crawling the 10 miles back to the
Russian base to try to get help, forced to inch forward
on his knees, using his ice ax as an anchor to
avoid being blown away.<P>
   By the time Doran reached camp, visibility was
too poor to allow a search for Andersen. The
NASA scientist huddled alone in a bivouac sack,
digging out periodically from slumps of snow that
avalanched on him from the nunatak. When the
storm began to slacken, he was in a pit so deep it
took him four tries to clamber out.<P>
   On the slick glacier Andersen found the wind
still strong enough to blow him across the ice like
a leaf, despite putting his full weight on his ice ax
to slow himself. When he finally staggered into
camp, half-dead from cold and exhaustion, his face
was bleeding from flying ice chips.<P>
   "That was a dark couple of days," Doran says.
"Mother Antarctica was telling us it was time to
go."<P>

<H2>THE HUMAN SIDE</H2>
   If the Dry Valleys are a world apart, the human
habitat is a mix of the familiar and the bizarre.<P>
   Antarctic field-research camps range from a
cluster of a few pyramidal "Scott" tents (named
for the British explorer who invented them, and
later froze to death in one) on the subzero cold of
the polar plateau to elaborate encampments of up
to 50 people using quonset-shaped "Jamesway"
shelters of insulated fabric stretched on a wooden
frame.<P>
   Lake Hoare is one of the most pleasant field
camps. Built in the lee of the 100-foot wall of
Canada Glacier for wind protection, it includes
seven small, wooden laboratory modules and stor-
age buildings, a main 16-by-40 day building where
meals are eaten, and mountaineering tents for
sleeping that are perched like yellow mushrooms
on rocky knolls.<P>
   The small tents allow a rare thing in 
Antarctica -- privacy -- and sleeping in the bracing 
air is surprisingly pleasant. When the sun shines, the 
temperature in the tents can climb above freezing;
during a snow squall or when the sun hides behind
a peak it can be cold enough that I wore a wool
baclava, or head cover, inside the sleeping bag.<P>
   The main hut is heated and comfortable, brightly
lit by five skylights and eight windows and 
supplied with electricity from a solar panel array
designed by NASA. There are communication
radios, laptop computers, a stove, a refrigerator, a
microwave oven, a portable CD player, and metal
folding tables and chairs.<P>
   Quirky touches can creep in. At the nearby
Fryxell camp there is an inflatable palm tree, a
pink flamingo in the snow and a plastic shark.<P>
   The problem with constructing such a base is it
can contaminate the ecosystem scientists have
come to study. The carpenters who assembled
Lake Hoare's camp vacuumed sawdust to prevent
it from adding nutrients to the environment.<P>
   All garbage and human waste is flown out.
There is a gray-water evaporator to concentrate
dirty sink waste into a smaller volume of water.
Human waste goes into 55-barrel drums: Males

 YET, FOR SCIENTISTS, ANTARCTICA IS A TREASURE-TROVE OF RESEARCH
 OPPORTUNITIES, AND EVEN A SOURCE OF ADVENTURE. SEATTLE TIMES

       STORY AND PHOTOS BY BILL DIETRICH<BR>
<I>     Seattle Times science reporter</I><P>

<B>LAKE HOARE</B>, Antarctica -- At
9:10 p.m. Sunday of the Thanksgiving
weekend, under the glittering blaze
of a never-setting sun, NASA scientist
Dale Andersen tugs on his flippers
slips through a hole in ice
11 feet thick.<P>
  He is diving toward a lake bottom
coated with mats of algae similar to
the primitive life that dominated the
earth 3 billion years ago. In a sense,
Andersen is diving both back in time
and across the void of space.<P>
  In the water and on surrounding
land, algae, bacteria, lichens and moss
cling to life in a valley cold and dry
enough to mimic Mars. If there is life
on Mars, or a fossil remnant of it from
that planet's earlier, wetter history, it
may most closely resemble these
Antarctic colonies.<P>
  "Once we learn about life here,"
Andersen explained to me earlier as
he zipped up his dry suit, "we can
better design robot spacecraft to go
to Mars and look for it there."<P>
 
<IMG SRC="http://insider:8080/MCM/seattle1b.gif" align=top><BR>

<B>NASA scientist</B><I> Dale Andersen dives into Antarctica's
frigid Lake Hoare.</I><P>

It is late spring in the Southern
Hemisphere. At Lake Hoare the air
temperature is about 15 degrees,
light wind pushing the effective wind
chill toward zero. The near-freezing
water is warmer.<P>
  The planetary scientist has made
dozens of these dives over the years,
prowling ice-capped lakes so weird as
to be scientifically instructive. They
exist in this continent's Dry Valleys, a
rare snow-free Antarctic landscape of
barren sand and rock that is the driest
place on Earth.<P>
  Liquid has probably not fallen here
for at least 2 million years. About 4
inches of water falls as snow each
year, but it mostly evaporates or is
blown back out of the valleys before it
can melt, pushed by fierce "katabatic"
winds that roll down from the high ice
plateau beyond the surrounding
mountains.<P>
  Perversely, however, the bleak Dry
Valleys are called an "oasis." All but 2
percent of Antarctica is shrouded in
an ice cap up to 3 miles thick. The
valleys are a rare spot where a human
can stand on dirt.<P>
  Each year hundreds of American
scientists come to Antarctica and fan
out across an unforgiving continent
bigger than the United States and
Mexico combined.<P>
  They make the journey partly
because Antarctica's extremes have
proved to be a superb laboratory of
nature's peculiarities, and partly
because they can't resist the lure of a
place so unexpectedly beautiful,
intoxicating and surprising.<P>
  The continent's oceans are one of
the richest storehouses of life on
Earth. Evolution has allowed its penguins
and seals and whales to develop
ingenious survival strategies. Yet its
interior is so cold that not even bacteria
survive on the polar ice cap.<P>
  The annual growth and retreat of
Antarctica's sea ice affect weather
and ocean currents worldwide. "We
can't understand climate dynamics if
we can't understand what happens
here," explained David Bresnahan,
the National Science Foundation's
station manager at the main American
base, in McMurdo.<P>
  Antarctica is the best place to find
meteorite fragments from the birth of
our solar system. It is also where the
alarming ozone hole was discovered,
which in turn led to a phaseout of
chlorofluorocarbons.<P>
  The South Pole, 9,500 miles from
Seattle, provides the cleanest,
thinnest air on Earth to study the 
universe overhead. And the Pole is so
harsh that prototype systems developed

<center><I>As anyone who lives in the region can attest, rapid population<BR></center>
<center>growth is changing the character of much of the West (Cromartie 1994) </I></center>
<BR><BR>

Loss of intact, high quality habitat represents the foremost threat to 
maintaining vigorous and diverse populations of wildlife in the Rocky Mountain 
region.   Demographic and economic trends throughout the region suggest that 
residential development on private land is likely to become the predominant 
influence on wildlife habitat during the coming decade and beyond.  Such 
development will occur to accommodate approximately 3 million new residents in 
the region during the 1990's alone (Cromartie 1994).  These increments in 
the human population equate to an annual growth rate approaching 3% per annum, 
a rate that exceeds the tempo of population increases in most third world 
nations.<P> 

Increases in the West's population will force fundamental changes in land 
use and land cover throughout the region.  For example, about 90 thousand 
acres of agricultural land in Colorado are annually converted to other uses, 
primarily to residential development and associated infrastructure (Colorado 
Department of Agriculture 1995).  The area included in these conversions is 
roughly equivalent to a swath of land, 1 mile wide, extending 140 miles long--
the distance from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. Before it was developed, 
more than 60% of this agricultural land was native grassland that provided 
important wildlife habitat.
<P>
Many of the high mountain valleys of the West are growing at a particularly 
rapid pace, primarily as a result of  immigration.  Immigrants are 
increasingly attracted to the valleys of the West because these areas offer 
environmental amenities found nowhere else. Of course, these same valleys 
provide critical habitat for many species of wildlife.  Careless development 
of these areas will undoubtedly cause fundamental, long term deterioration 
in the abundance and distribution of many species.
<P>
Regional changes in land use are the result of many local decisions made one 
at a time--a ranch is converted to a subdivision; a mountainside is 
developed for skiing; a valley is dotted with vacation homes.  Because these 
decisions are inherently local, the regional effects of growth on wildlife 
habitat are simply the collective outcome of many local decisions.  This is 
problematic because there is often an unstated assumption in planning for such 
growth; we have assumed habitat lost in one place can be compensated by 
habitat remaining undisturbed elsewhere.  However, it is becoming clear that 
this assumption cannot hold forever--we have realized that 
many small, seemingly benign impacts can accumulate to cause large, harmful 
effects on environmental values like wildlife habitat.  As a society, we are 
challenged to anticipate and manage those effects.
<P>
We have a timely opportunity to meet this challenge.  In many counties in 
the West, geographic information systems (GIS) are being developed by counties 
to guide land-use planning.  Such planning focuses on infrastructure (roads, 
water lines, schools etc.) as well as environmental values (open space, 
wildlife habitat).  At the same time, state and federal agencies are 
assembling spatial data on vegetation, hydrology, and current distributions of 
many wildlife species.  As a result of these efforts, there is a large 
amount of data accumulating in county and agency offices throughout the 
West, data that could help citizens and decision makers foresee the way that 
small changes in land use will add up to cause large changes in the region's 
environmental values.  However, although there is great potential in using 
such data to guide insightful land use planning and habitat protection 
efforts, the tools needed to provide such insights have not yet emerged.
<P>
To provide such tools, we initiated a project in Colorado called a System 
for Conservation Planning, hereafter, SCoP (pronounced "scope").  The goal 
of the SCoP project is to support planning by local communities by providing 
them with readily accessible information on the consequences of development 
for wildlife.  To meet that goal, we proposed to produce interactive 
GIS that would allow planners, decisions makers, 
and citizens to foresee how changes in land use land are likely to 
accumulate over time and space, and how these cumulative changes might 
affect the extent and distribution of habitat for wildlife. Our proposal was 
funded by the Great Outdoors Colorado Trust Fund during July of 1995 to 
support a pilot project in Summit County, Colorado.
<P>
<A NAME="Study"><H3>Study Area</H3></A>
Summit County extends across a high mountain valley approximately 100 km 
west of Denver. The county is one of the few in Colorado that embraces a 
complete watershed-- the Blue River bisects the county along its north-south 
axis, extending its headwaters in the Ten Mile Range to a confluence with 
the Colorado River.  The current population numbers about 17,000 year-round 
residents, and the county has been growing at a rate greater than 6% per 
year since 1990 and if this rate is sustained, will number upwards of 28,000 
by the year 2020. The economy is based primarily on tourism attracted to 
several ski areas. As a result, the peak population often exceeds the resident 
population by threefold. In addition, there are 1.1 dwelling units for each 
permanent resident. The county is predominantly public land, about 80% of 
the total area of the county is managed by the US Forest Service.  Private 
land is concentrated in the valley bottoms, while the surrounding uplands 
and mountains are public. 
<P>
<A NAME="System"><H3>System Development</H3></A> 

<H4>The Process of Collaborative Design</H4>

From the outset, we were committed to designing a system reflecting the 
needs of users. In particular, we wanted to avoid developing an analytical 
tool influenced by the viewpoint of scientists alone. Instead, we believed 
that the utility of the system that we produced would depend on the extent 
to which we could integrate a scientific view with the diverse views of 
information users, particularly those users who have a stake in the 
decisions that the information system would support. 
<P>
To assure that the information system would meet the needs of a diverse set of 
clients, we assembled a team of users and experts to help us  design the 
information system (Figure 1).  The users included a county commissioner, a 
planner, a developer, a land owner, environmental advocates, and a wildlife 
manager from the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
<P>
<UL><UL><UL><IMG SRC="scop.htg/img.gif"><BR>
</UL></UL></UL>
<UL><B>Figure 1.</B>  The SCoP information system was designed by a collaboration between
users and experts.
</UL>
<P>

The expert group consisted of a GIS analyst, a land use attorney, an 
ecologist, a geographer, and a scientific programmer.
<P>
We initiated the design process with a series of 1-day "primers" on subject 
matter relevant to land use change and habitat conservation. Topics of these 
sessions included principles of conservation biology and landscape ecology, 
land use law and planning, human geography, and GIS. The purpose of the 
primers was to provide a common understanding of some of the technical 
issues relevant to the information system.
<P>
Following these primers, the team met to set goals for the system.  We did 
this by asking the users several questions, including the following:
<P>
<LI>Imagine a situation (real or hypothetical) that is typical of your 
role in working with wildlife and development in Summit County.  What insights 
about impacts of development on wildlife would help you play your role more 
effectively?  
<P>

<LI>Describe a situation when you wanted to include wildlife 
concerns in land use planning or in your work in development, but were 
unable to do so effectively.  Be as specific as possible and try to choose 
an example that differs from the first one you discussed.
<P>
<LI>The goal of the SCoP project is "To support land use planning by 
local communities by providing state-of-the-art information on the impacts 
of development on wildlife and by identifying actions that can be taken to 
minimize those impacts."  What do you consider to be some important, 
tangible measures of success in meeting that goal?
<P>
<LI>Imagine yourself 10 years from now in Summit County.  What 
specific things would you look for to indicate that Summit County was 
succeeding in meeting its goals for wildlife protection?
<P>
The comments that emerged in response to these questions were drawn together 
into statements of goals for the information system.  These goals focused on 
four general areas--education, screening, habitat value, and cumulative 
impacts.
<P>

<H4>Goals for Education</H4>

The collaborative design team felt strongly that one of the things that SCoP should do 
is to educate the citizens of Summit County about their wildlife. The 
information system should allow citizens to learn about the distribution of 
wildlife species and their habitats; it should inform about species status, 
their life histories, habitat requirements and sensitivities to impacts.  
The user should be able to locate an area on a map and find out what species 
have habitat in that area.  He or she should also be able to identify a 
species and learn about the distribution of its habitat.
<P>

<H4>Goals for Screening</H4>

The developer and a citizen advocate on the design team asked that the 
system be able to offer a "coarse screening of impacts" of future 
development at a given site.  The developer wanted to be able to identify an 
area on a map that he might develop and learn about the potential concerns 
that would be raised about impacts on wildlife habitat at that site.  This was 
important because the developer was willing to do his best to avoid 
sensitive areas, but he needed to know about such sensitivities "up front", 
that is, before he had invested a great deal of time and money in preparing 
a formal development proposal for review by the county.
<P>
The citizen advocate asked for virtually the same function.  He wanted to 
allocate his "advocacy time" in commenting on the develoment that had the 
greatest potential to impact wildlife.  So, he wanted a tool to "screen" areas 
in urgent need of comment from those that were less urgent.  He also wanted 
a sound, scientific source of information to use in formulating his comments.

<H4>Goals for Habitat Value</H4>

All of the members of the design team felt that SCoP should map areas of the 
landscape according to their relative value as a the problem that must be 
overcome if planning is to be effective in conserving wildlife habitat.  
Such a map would be useful in identifying alternative paths for development 
during master planning by offering a rationale for steering development away 
from valuable areas toward areas of lesser value.
<P>

<H4>Goals for Cumulative Impacts</H4>

The design team was unanimous in identifying the problem of "cumulative 
impacts" as a fundamental impediment to wise land use planning. It is clear 
that impacts of development accummulate over time and space, and that the sum 
of these many impacts must be overcome if planning is to be effective in 
conserving wildlife habitat. The impacts of a single developent on the 
abundance and distribution of wildlife is arguable, but the impacts of 100 
developments are not. So, the design team asked that we work on an approach to 
forseeing how future development will spread in relation to existing 
wildlife habitats. They asked that the system help them evaluate different 
approaches for managing population density (e.g., clustering, zoning, transfer 
of development rights, etc.).

<A NAME="Implement"><H3>Implementation of System</H3></A> 

<H4>Available Data</H4>

We built the system to make use of currently available data. Distribution maps 
that show areas of the county known to be routinely used were available for 18 
species of vertebrates (mostly game mammals and fish) in Summit County. In 
addition to these species, the design team asked to extend the range to 
include all 239 vertebrate species found in the county. Because it is 
practically impossible to map actual distribution ranges for this number of 
species and because it is important to identify likely habitat, we modeled 
potentially suitable habitat map using the best information available on 
factors influencing known ranges. Our approach is based on identifying species 
affinities for vegetation types using elevational and water constraints. 
Potentially suitable habitat for each species was delineated (Figure 2) by 
identifying all 30 m x 30 m cells in a raster map that met 3 criteria:
<P>
<UL>
 	1) The cell must contain vegetative cover appropriate for the 
species.<BR>  
	2) It must be at an elevation within the upper and lower elevation 
limits for the species.<BR>
	3) It must sufficiently close to water for species that require 
lakes or streams as part of their habitat.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<UL><UL><UL><IMG SRC="scop.htg/img1.gif"><BR>
</UL> </UL> </UL>
<UL><B>Figure 2.</B>  Habitat for each species was defined by its affinity
for vegetative cover, its elevation range, and requirements for proximity
to lakes and streams.
</UL>
<P>
Vegetation was mapped by unsupervised classification of a Landsat 
Thematic Mapper satellite image and resulted in 14 vegetative cover types 
(Table 1). Species affinities for each type were derived from literature 
sources as well as by consultation with local experts.

<H4>Analysis Procedures: Habitat Value</H4>

We developed five separate indices of habitat value (<a href="#Table2">Table 2</a>). The Local 
Diversity index shows the number of species that have potentially suitable 
habitat at each grid cell. User Defined Local Diversity was similar, except 
that the user could specify which species (of the 239 possible) would be 
included in the diversity calculation. Neighborhood Diversity was calculated 
by centering a circular window (1 km radius) on each grid cell, determining 
the number of species that had potentially suitable habitat within the circle, 
and assigning that number to the grid cell.
<P>
<P>  
The Corridor index was calculated by first identifying groups of species using 
similar vegetation types through cluster analysis.  The 5 largest, intact 
patches of habitat for each of the 16 clusters were then delineated.  We 
then calculated an impedence map assuming that resistance to movement was 
least among cells that included habitat for the cluster of species.  We then 
summed the impedence map across the clusters of species and normalized it to 
range between 0 and 1.  High impedence was taken to mean low corridor value.  

<P>
The Patch Value index was calculated for all patches of vegetation 
containing greater than 50 contiguous cells.  For each patch we calculated the 
statistic V, 
where V is a relative index of patch value, S is the number of species that 
have potentially suitable habitat within the patch, and Pi is the proportion 
of the total habitat for the ith species within the county that is contributed 
by the patch.  The value of V was then mapped using a relative color scale.  
Large intact patches of vegetation offering habitat for specialist species 
receive high scores for patch value.

<H4>Analysis Procedures: Simulating Land Use Change</H4>

We developed a stochastic model forecasting the distribution of housing units 
across the county. The model is based on historical data (from the tax 
assessor) on housing density in each quarter-section of the county. The 
probability that an undeveloped cell (i.e., housing density is zero) will 
develop during any given year is a function of the densities of the 
neighboring quarter-sections, so that areas with higher neighborhood housing 
density are more likely to develop. We then fit a linear regression to the 
historical density data describing the growth rate of developing cells. The 
predictions of the model can be adjusted by changing assumptions on population 
growth rates, the likelihood of development in certain areas (e.g., by 
phased development), the spatial restrictions (e.g., zoning) which limit the 
maximum number of building units, and the spatial pattern of development 
(e.g., clustering). To convert housing density to wildlife habitat 
disturbance, we assume that each building is the center of a circular 
disturbance zone extending outward 50-500 m (Figure 3), and that the value 
of habitat is substantially reduced within the disturbance zone. This method 
is sensitive to both density and pattern (Figure 4). Cumulative impacts are estimated 
by summing the total area contained within disturbance zones.

<H4>Interface</H4>

The system runs a set of ARC/INFO AML's. A user interface provides point and 
click access to 5 main functions: Help, Education, Screening, Habitat Value, 
and Simulation (Figure 5).
<P>
<IMG SRC="scop.htg/mainmenu.gif">

	The Help function provides context-sensitive access to an online 
manual describing how to use the system.
<P>
	The Education function allows the user to obtain a variety of 
spatially-referenced information on wildlife species.  The user can locate 
him/herself on a map, specify an area of interest, and bring up a list of 
all of the species that have potentially suitable habitat within the specified 
area. After choosing an individual species, the user can view habitat and 
range maps for the species and obtain a text description of its life 
history, sensitivities to management practices, and habitat requirements  
(Figure 6).

<IMG SRC="scop.htg/elk.gif">
<br>
<UL><B>Figure 6.</B>  Data can be obtained for each species in the area chosen by the 
user.
</UL>
<P>
	The Screening function allows users to get information on 
potential impacts of development at a particular site. The user can 
identify an area to be developed using two approaches. Developments currently 
under review are shown as points on a map of the county and the user can 
select an area, clicking on a point, the user can find out about impacts of 
the proposed development. Alternatively, the user can specify an area to 
be developed in the future by drawing a polygon on a map. In either case, a 
list of concerns about impacts on wildlife can be accessed after the 
development area has been identified (<a href="#Table3">Table 3</a>).
<P>
	The Habitat Value function shows a variety of maps shaded to 
reveal differences in habitat value indices described above (i.e., <a href="#Table2">
Table 2</a>).  These can be presented as panels (Figure 7), sequentially (i.e., like a slide show), 
or as an RGB color composite.

<P>
<A NAME="Access"><H3>Access to System</H3></A> 

The system resides on a Sun Microsystems Sparc 5 server at the Natural 
Resource Ecology Laboratory of Colorado State University.  Citizens, planners, 
and decision makers will be able to access the information system in a 
couple of ways.  We have provided a terminal available to the public in the 
Summit County government offices.  This terminal is networked to the server 
via a 56K frame relay.  We will also offer direct connections via telnet 
over the Internet.  Such connections will require a Unix terminal running X, 
or a PC with X emulation software.
<P>


<A NAME="Evaluation"><H3>Evaluation of System</H3></A> 

The ultimate goal of the SCoP project is to help citizens and their 
governments make choices about land use that achieve a reasonable balance 
between the needs of wildlife for intact landscapes and the needs of people 
for economic vitality.  A short term objective is to deliver information 
systems that users believe will contribute towards our ultimate goal.  This 
short term objective is currently being evaluated in Summit County.  A beta 
version is now being tested by the Design Team and other interested 
citizens.  The system will be modified based on their suggestions.
<P>
Many of the notable successes of bringing science to bear on environmental 
policy have involved a top down model where scientific information flows 
upward in a government hierarchy and regulations and policy flow downward 
through that hierarchy.  This model does not serve in the case of land use 
change, because the political authority for decisions on land use reside at 
the local level.  As a result, scientists are challenged to bring their 
knowledge to many local decisions, choices that are inherently diffuse in time 
and space.  The System for Conservation Planning project is working to meet 
that challenge.

Collegian Reporter</I>
<P>
     Colorado State researchers have been training a recent high
school graduate to dig up worms to test in Antarctica during an
expedition to the continent this winter.  Joel Feldman, graduate
of Chaparral High School in Las Vegas, Nev., will accompany
researchers and a Montana middle school science teacher James
Schulz, to assist in collecting nematodes, also known as
roundworms, and in performing tests on the effects of increasing
temperature on biodiversity.<P>
     A nematode is simply a microscopic roundworm which can be
found in marine, fresh-water, and terrestrial environents, and
also as parasites of plants and animals.  A bacterial feeding
nematode Scottnema lindsayae, is the dominant species of
nematodes that Feldman and researchers will study.<P>
     Leading this expedition as chief scientist is head of
Colorado State's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory, Diana
Freckman.  Freckman was awarded a $325,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation and was writer of the proposal to
trek to Antarctica.  The expedition will take place from November
to January.  She will oversee and investigate with the research
staff, who will be monitoring changes in population, life stages,
species, and sex of the nematodes as the results of soil warming
on this ecosystem.  The nematodes will be tested to see how they
will be able to accomplish the decompositional process under the
conditions of an warming climate.<P>
     Feldman will test the environmental factors contributing to
size of the nematodes as well as other ecological changes.  Using
an extraction method called sugar centrifugation which involves
soil, water, and sugar in a centrifuge, Feldman is able to
separate the microscopic nematodes from the soil.  He will also
be doing field work -- sampling soil, extracting  and identifying
the nematodes, and studying the differences in treatments.<P>
     His training at Colorado State covers work with extraction
systems, in addition to using an image analysis system, which
enlarges the nematode, and helps in determining
its area, length, and width. <P> 
     Last summer, Feldman attended a mechanical engineering
workshop sponsored by the N.S.F.  at Denver University.  It was
through his involvement in that program that he received an
application for the expedition to Antarctica, and not
until after a elaborate screening process did be get accepted.
Excluding Feldman, there were four other high school graduates
from across the country who were selected by the N.S.F.  They
will also travel to Antarctica, but each at different times and
with different research groups.<P>
     Freckman feels that high school students are aware of the
dangers and possess enough maturity to handle the journey to
Antarctica.  And she has confidence that it will also be quite a
learning experience.<P>

<H1>Be proud to fund constipated worms studies</H1>
<IMG SRC="images/dave_barry.gif">

     Mutant constipated worms. It's a topic we all THINK about a lot; but what do we really KNOW about it?<P>
    The answer, I am pleased to report, is: more every day, thanks to the efforts of a professor named Jim Thomas in the Genetics Department of the University of Washington in Seattle. Thomas has an entire laboratory devoted to studying irregularity in worms. He is the world's leading authority on this topic. I say this with no small amount of pride, because he graduated from my alma mater, Haverford College (motto: "Small, But Weird").<P>
    l learned of Thomas' work through one of his alert graduate students, Creg Darby, who sent me a lengthy scientific paper that Thomas had written. In an accompanying letter, Creg wrote: "Notice that Jim was not merely content to describe how worms poop. Oh no. We geneticists are a twisted lot, because we LOVE mutants, so Jim went and zapped worms with nasty chemicals to make MUTANT WORMS THAT ARE CONSTIPATED. Really, it's all there in the paper. I know you can't understand most of it, so I have highlighted the word 'constipated."'<P>
    Creg who is not afraid to use capitalization for desired emphasis added that "JIM'S RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT! HE IS SPENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY TO MAKE CONSTIPATED WORMS!!!!!!!!!"<P>
    Let me state that, as a taxpayer, I would much rather see my tax money spent on
mutant constipated worms than on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Not that there is such a huge difference.     But as a journalist, I feel a fundamental responsibility to you, the public, to check out stories that involve the use of your tax money for scientific projects in cities that have good microbrewery beer. So I went to Seattle.<P>
    Thomas' office is located in the university's Health Sciences Building, which is very scientific. I say this because of the bulletin boards. Back in the '60s, when I was in college, our bulletin boards were covered with announcements of festive social events such as dances, concerts and the violent overthrow of the U.S. government. Whereas the first bulletin board I saw in the Health Sciences Building had the following announcement posted on it: "A KERATIN 14 MUTATIONAL HOT SPOT FOR EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA SIMPLEX-DOWLINGMEARA."<P>
    I wasn't sure that it was medically safe for a layperson to even LOOK at these words, so I scurried on up to Jim Thomas' laboratory. It was
cluttered with scientific items such as petri dishes, beakers, test tubes, radioactivity warnings, deadly chemicals and graduate students eating their lunch. I did not immediately see any worms; Professor Thomas explained that the ones he studies, called Caenorhabditis elegans, are only 1 millimeter long. (To give yourself an idea how long that is, hold your thumb and forefinger 1 millimeter apart.)<P>
    A LOT of scientists study these worms. They (the scientists) even have their own magazine, and they regularly gather at events such as the West Coast Worm Meeting. One news report begins: "Almost all worm people in Japan assembled in Sendai on, 29th November . . ."<P>
    Jim Thomas loves his worms.<P>
"We think they are the coolest organisms in the world," he told me, and his corps of graduate students nodded in proud agreement.  What makes these worms especially cool for constipation studies is (1) You can see right through them, and (2) They poop every 45 seconds. I know this because I saw them myself. First Thomas showed me a videotape of one of them in action.  "OK, watch this," he said, as the worm contracted itself. "He's getting ready . . ." The worm made a sudden motion.<P>
 "POOP!" said Thomas, thrusting his fist forward in a football-fan-like gesture of triumph. <P>
    Next Thomas led me to a microscope, where I saw some live worm action. Basically what these worms do all the time is crawl around in dishes full of food, eating, pooping and having sex. It is guy heaven. All they need is tiny TVs with remote controls.  The male worms, by the way, are total sex fiends. They try to do it with everything they bump into, including other males.   Sometimes they try to mate with their OWN HEADS (a graduate student told me this is called "wanking").<P>
    I also looked at some mutant constipated worms, who were bloated and definitely not as lively. They reminded me of people in laxative commercials. <P>
PHARMACIST WORM: You don't look so good today, Ed. Is it ... irregularity?<P>
CUSTOMER WORM: You said it, Mr. Feemley! I haven't pooped in over 90 seconds!<P>
    I asked Jim Thomas if there was any possibility that his research would ever, in a zillion years, have any practical benefits for humans. He couldn't think of any offhand, but he allowed that it might conceivably be possible.<P>
    That is good enough for me. I'm glad that we're funding this research. In fact, I would strongly support spending more money in this area, as well as any scientific endeavor that has the  potential to benefit mankind. And here I am thinking of the microbreweries.<P>

<BODY BACKGROUND="pt1.jpg" BGCOLOR="#808080"

<center><H1>SCoP User Interface</H1></center>
Below are some examples from the SCoP user interface.
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icons/look.gif">
<P>
The opening screen for SCoP showing the four main modules of SCoP:
Education, Screening, Habitat Value and Simulation.
<P>
<img src=scop.gif>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icons/look.gif">
<P>
<H3>Education Module</H3>
The Education module displays information, pictures and statistics about
wildlife and vegetation in a user selected area.  For example, the next 
image shows detailed information on Mountain Goat habitat in
Summit County.  The pink area shows potentially suitable habitat
composed of areas that have suitable vegetation, elevation, and distance
to water.  The light blue and orange hatched areas show known range, and
mineral licks from the WRIS data base.  
<P>
<img src=mntgoat.gif>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icons/look.gif">
<P>
<H3>Screening Module</H3>
The Screening module provides a coarse screening of potential threats to
wildlife habitat and rare vegetation types due to proposed development
sites.  The example below shows a proposed development site outlined
in orange and the list of concerns that can be addressed.
<P>
<img src=screening.jpg>
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icons/look.gif">
<P>
<H3>Habitat Value Module</H3>
This screen shows four measures associated with habitat value for the 
   northern part of Summit County.  In all four panels, areas of high habitat
   value are shown as dark green while areas of low habitat value are shown
   in red.  The four measures shown in this example are:
<P>
   Local Diversity:  the relative abundance of the 239 vertebrate species 
     known to exist in Summit County for each 30m-by-30m square on the ground.
     This measure is derived from potentially suitable habitat (PSH) models for
     each species which characterize the landscape as PSH when vegetation,
     elevation, and (when appropriate) distance to water criteria are met.
<P>
   Listed Species Diversity:  the relative abundance of the forty-two species
     that are listed by State and Federal agencies or the Colorado Natural
     Heritage Program as threatened, endangered, sensitive, or imperiled.  
     This measure is calculated simialar to the Local Diversity measure using
     PSH models for each of the listed species.
<P>
   Patch Quality (Willow Flycatcher):  the relative quality of "core patches"
     of PSH for the Willow Flycatcher bird.  Core patches represent contiguous
     cells of PSH which are large enough to support 200 individuals.  The 
     core patches were then overlaid with road density data to determine the
     quality for every 30m-by-30m cell in the patch.
<P>
   Corridors (Willow Flycatcher):  the relative probability of the landscape 
     for use by the Willow Flycatcher metapopulations as migration conduits
     connecting core patches as defined above.  The model uses an impedance
     model to calculate accumulated costs involved with the movement from one
     core patch to its "most-accessible" neighboring core patch.
<P> 
   Within the Habitat Value module, the user has the ability to view the 
   measures in sequential format ("slide show"), or to combine three of the
   measures as a color composite using the red, green, and blue guns of the
   CRT to display the three measures simultaneously.

<P>
<img src=habval.jpg>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icons/look.gif">
<P>
<H3>Simulation Module</H3>
The Simulation module allows county planners to test different land use
scenarios and see what the impact will be on wildlife habitat and population
dispersal.  Results can be viewed as graphs or maps.  Below is an Expected
Disturbance map for the year 2000 in Summit County.  Ten percent of the 
wildlife habitat is disturbed for the yellow areas and all of the wildlife
habitat is disturbed for the red areas.  These maps were generated using
a 100 meter buffer zone around each housing unit.  If housing units are closely
distributed the buffer zones overlap and less habitat is disturbed.  The
grey area represents private land.

                                 PREFACE

     A workshop to plan the development of a trace gas network in the
US was held September 27 to 30, 1992, at Pingree Park, Colorado.  The
impetus for the workshop came from two diverse directions - from
scientists seeking to better integrate on-going work on trace gas
fluxes in diverse terrestrial ecosystems, and from representatives of
U.S. federal agencies seeking to explore the feasibility of
formalizing a "network of networks."  The goal was to explore
potentials for a network of native and managed ecosystem research
sites which would serve as a network for coordinated measurement of
trace gas fluxes.  The workshop explored a variety of linkages between
the scientific needs and agency programs and resources.   In the
following document we describe the purpose and objectives of the
workshop (both scientific and organizational background), and a
preliminary lists of sites. Many of the ideas herein have been
articulated at 3 previous workshops:

     The network described in this document will be the US component
of an international network, coordinated by the IGBP/IGAC Focus 5
group.  This group, recently reorganized as IGAC Focus 5.2 "Trace Gas

(TRAGEX - K.A. Smith and G.P. Robertson, co-convenors).  This U.S.
network will also be linked with existing U.S. networks of ecological
sites, such as the NSF's LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network
of 18 North American sites, the Department of Energy's ParkNet
network, and selected other sites at which long-term gas measurement
programs are underway or proposed.

                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


     The northern temperate region has a significant influence on
global fluxes of important atmospheric trace gases, particularly CO2,
CH4, and N2O.  Fluxes from mid-latitude regions are especially
important because the region is densely populated and most of its
ecosystems have been altered directly by humans.  Large areas of
forests and grasslands have been converted to crop and rangeland and
most of the remaining forests are second growth.  Such disturbances
directly affect the soil physical and biological properties that
control trace gas fluxes.  In addition, altered chemical climates as a
result of industrial activity may further affect fluxes across broad
portions of the region.    
     Natural systems are both sources and sinks of trace gases, but
the magnitudes of the fluxes are very poorly known for most
ecosystems.  Despite a long history of trace gas flux measurements in
temperate ecosystems, measurements are typically infrequent, short-
term (rarely extending over one to several years), small-scale, and
often not comparable to flux data collected at other sites.  An
integrated, coordinated network for trace gas flux measurements is
essential for providing a framework for comparable, sufficiently
rigorous measurements at a variety of sites and thus for providing the
necessary understanding of regional sources and sinks for these
important gases.  
     These three research needs require different research plans. 
Flux estimates require a long-term monitoring effort at a coordinated
network of sites.  Long-term monitoring can also provide short-term
data on daily and interannual temporal variation.  Manipulative
experiments provide information on factors that control fluxes.  The
modeling efforts will use both monitoring and manipulative data to
develop and validate models, and to predict future scenarios of trace
gas fluxes under altered climates.  
     Participants at a September 1992 planning workshop developed a
concrete, integrated program to measure fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O at a
network of sites in the U.S.  Other gases (carbon monoxide, non-
methane hydrocarbons, etc.) may be measured by individual sites, but
will not constitute the core program.  This U.S. network will be
integrated with international efforts being implemented by IGAC, a
core project of the IGBP.  

     The U.S. network is meant to accomplish the following two goals:

to document contemporary fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O between
  regionally important ecosystems and the atmosphere;
to determine the factors controlling these fluxes and improve our
  ability to predict future fluxes in response to ecosystem and
  climate change.

  Achievement of these objectives will involve three types of
  network activities:
Measurement of trace gas fluxes at an international network of
  representative sites; 
Identification of the factors that control fluxes at each site;
  and
The development and implementation of quantitative flux models at
  several geographic scales.  

  The trace gas measurement and modeling network outlined in the
following pages is designed to address these goals and activities
explicitly.  Proposed activities, both scientific and organizational,
were developed at a planning workshop held at Pingree Park, Colorado,
27-30 September, 1992.  



                    Objectives of the Network

  The proposed network is designed to contribute to our
understanding of trace gas fluxes to the atmosphere through six
principle objectives.  These are:  
1. to promote the comparability of trace gas flux measurements among
  sites; 
2. to promote measurements in a more extensive coverage of ecosystem
  
3. to facilitate data synthesis;
4. to coordinate and foster interactions between measurement groups
  and modeling groups.  
5. to provide ready means for testing and comparing gas flux models;
  and
6. to establish a long-term data archive for trace gas flux and
  associated data.    

  The need to develop a network of trace gas measurements and
analysis follows from the fact that the northern temperate region is a
major net source of these gases.  Human activities modify gas fluxes
both directly and indirectly.  Directly, agricultural and forest
management practices affect soil physical and biological properties,
including those that control gas fluxes.  Indirectly, air pollution
and acid deposition affect fluxes by modifying biogeochemical cycles
associated with trace gas fluxes.  Natural systems are both sources
and sinks of trace gases, but the magnitudes of these fluxes are not
known.  Although trace gas flux measurements in temperate ecosystems
have been made for decades, measurements are infrequent (rarely
extending beyond a growing season), usually small-scale, and rarely
comparable to other flux data collected at other sites.  An
integrated, coordinated network for trace gas flux measurements is
essential to understanding these sources and sinks in a regional to
global context.  
  There are three critical research needs at present:  (1) improved
estimates of net methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide fluxes from
regionally important ecosystems, (2) a quantitative understanding of
the factors that control these fluxes, and (3) manipulative
experiments and development of models to quantify how trace gas fluxes
will respond to changes in both physical and chemical climate.  
  The network will meet these objectives principally via four
activities:  (1) by conducting an annual workshop at which both
measurement and modeling groups will present and discuss current data
and models; (2) by providing a central clearinghouse for network site
data; (3) by facilitating communication both among network scientists,
and between network members and scientists initiating trace gas
measurement programs at non-network sites, and (4) fostering the
development of comparable methodologies.  

                       Network Management
  The network will be managed by a steering committee whose
chairperson will act as network coordinator.  The steering committee
is now comprised of Drs. Elizabeth A. Holland, Jerry M. Melillo, Arvin
R. Mosier, Dennis S. Ojima, and G. Philip Robertson.  The coordinator,
who acts on behalf of the steering committee, will oversee the day-to-
day activities of the network and organize an annual all-site
workshop.  The Steering Committee also recommends to the general
membership the acceptance of new sites to the network and the deletion
of existing sites.  Members of the steering committee will be elected
on a rotating basis by network members at the annual workshop; members
will rotate on and off of the committee on a staggered basis to
maintain network continuity.  
  Data management is an essential element of network management. 
Without efficient means to contribute to and access a network-wide gas
flux database, individual sites will be comparatively of little
scientific impact.  While we do not propose to establish an exhaustive
centralized facility to manage all network data, we do envision a
formalized process that meets the needs of both measurers and
modelers, that multiple investigators will use, and that is
affordable.  We propose a plan for establishing a database that will
be both a requirement for and benefit of membership in the network.                               


1.  INTRODUCTION

  The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are increasing
substantially. These increases are expected to result in global
warming and changes in precipitation patterns, and may directly affect
terrestrial ecosystems.  Our understanding of the contemporary fluxes
of these gases between the land and atmosphere is incomplete.  There
are large regions of the earth, including most of the former Soviet
Union and China, for which we have very little information on trace
gas fluxes.  Furthermore, for no region do we fully understand how
global change, including land-use change, will affect gas fluxes.
  The northern temperate region has a significant influence on
atmospheric trace gases.  Fluxes from mid-latitude regions are
especially important because the region is densely populated and most
of its ecosystems are subject to human influence.  For example, large
areas of forests and grasslands have been converted to row-crop
agriculture and rangeland.  Agricultural practices affect soil
physical and biological properties, and hence can alter trace gas
fluxes.  In addition, many systems experience altered chemical
climates as a result of upwind industrial activity.    
  Natural systems are both sources and sinks of trace gases, but
the magnitudes of these fluxes are not known.  Although there have
been numerous trace gas flux measurements in temperate ecosystems,
these measurements are often infrequent (rarely extending over one to
several years), small-scale, and not always comparable to other flux
data collected at other sites.  An integrated, coordinated network for
trace gas flux measurements is essential to understanding these
sources and sinks.  
  Three critical research needs are:  (1) improved estimates of net
fluxes of methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide and of
environmental factors which control these fluxes; (2) identification
and quantification of other potentially important regions of
significant fluxes, particularly those from geographic areas that have
been neglected in past research; and (3) manipulative experiments and
development of models to quantify how trace gas fluxes will respond to
climatic and land management changes.  
  These three research needs require different research plans. 
Estimates of fluxes require a long-term monitoring effort at a
coordinated network of sites.  Long-term monitoring can also provide
short-term data on daily and interannual temporal variation. 
Manipulative experiments can complement the monitoring program and
provide information on factors that control fluxes.  The modeling
efforts will use both monitoring and manipulative data to develop and
validate models, and to predict future scenarios of trace gas fluxes
under altered climates.  
  An integrated program to measure trace gas fluxes of CO2, CH4, and
N2O at a network of sites in the U.S. will be established.  Other gases
(carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, etc.) may be measured by
individual sites, but will not be part of the core program.  The U.S.
network will be integrated with the larger network activity being
implemented by IGAC; a program designed to study trace-gas fluxes in
mid-latitude ecosystems has been identified as an activity of the IGAC
Project of IGBP.  
  Although there have been many studies of trace-gas fluxes in many
regions of the United States, few have developed flux estimates based
on frequent measurements made over an entire year. Most studies have
focused on small areas (e.g., individual fields or forest plots) and
these study sites have generally been selected to address specific
local research questions; thus they are not, necessarily, comparative
in nature and are not always readily incorporated into regional
estimates of trace gas fluxes.  Moreover, the consequences for trace-
gas fluxes of converting "natural" lands to agricultural lands and the
effects of loading ecosystems with nutrients (N and S) and toxins have
received relatively little attention.  We propose a trace gas network
that addresses this major gap in our knowledge about trace-gas fluxes
in mid-latitude ecosystems.
  We propose to establish a U.S. trace gas network to accomplish
the following two goals:

to document contemporary fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O between
  ecosystems and the atmosphere;

to determine the factors controlling these fluxes and improve our
  ability to predict future fluxes.

Achievement of these goals will involve three types of network
activities:

Measurement of trace gas fluxes at a national network of
  representative sites; 
Manipulation of perceived controlling variables to determine
  their impact on fluxes;
Modeling of the processes responsible for trace gas fluxes.

  The trace gas measurement and modeling network outlined in this
document is intended to help achieve the objectives of IGAC Activity
5.2.  This report outlines the results of a planning workshop held at
Pingree Park, Colorado, 27-30 September, 1992.  The workshop
participants: (1) outlined the objectives of a trace gas network in
the context of the IGAC science objectives; (2) established criteria
for site selection and participation; and (3) carried out in-depth
discussions on issues relating to methods comparability, sampling
design, data management, rules governing access to network data, and
modeling and synthesis activities.  The following sections of this
document describe the outcome of those discussions.

1.1.  Objectives of the Network

  The trace gas network is designed to contribute to our
understanding of the trace gas fluxes to the atmosphere through six
principle objectives.  The objectives of the network are:



1.     The network will promote the comparability of trace gas flux
  measurements.  As discussed later in this report, the network
  will provide guidance on sampling designs that are site
  appropriate; provide suggestions and updated information on
  appropriate analytical and sample collection methods; and
  facilitate intercomparisons and intercalibrations.

2.     The network will provide for more extensive coverage of ecosystem
  variability. Identification of regions where no long-term
  measurements are available, or where replication is needed, will
  be assessed; the network participants can then encourage the
  development of research sites in such areas.  

3.     Data synthesis will be facilitated by the network.  Data
  collected from sites that span a range of controlling factors or
  that represent a range of ecoregions will be available to the
  group for synthesis and hypothesis setting.

4.     Interactions between measurement and modeling groups will be
  facilitated by the network.  Data collection at appropriate
  frequency and spatial scales will allow model development and
  model testing.  Hypotheses generated from the model synthesis
  activities will foster new field research.

5.     Intercomparisons of model results will be facilitated.  It will
  be possible to make comparisons that utilize identical estimates
  of input and output.  In addition, model modularity will be
  developed where possible, facilitating the identification of
  reasons models produce different results.

6.     A long-term data archive for trace gas flux and other ecosystem
  processes will be established as a component of the network.  The
  purpose of the network is to foster a better understanding of
  mid-latitude trace gas contributions to the global budget by
  facilitating data access and interactions among those measuring
  and modeling gas fluxes.

  The network will meet these objectives principally via four
activities:  (1) by conducting an annual workshop at which both
measurement and modeling groups will present and discuss current data
and models; (2) by providing a central clearinghouse for network site
data; (3) by facilitating communication both among network scientists,
and between network members and scientists initiating trace gas
measurement programs at non-network sites, and (4) by fostering the
development of comparable methodologies. 



                 2.  DEVELOPMENT OF A COORDINATED NETWORK

  The proposed network will be inclusive and probably consist of
30-40 sites.  Site participation in the network will be based on
specific criteria with participation open to all sites meeting these
criteria.  The geographic distribution of potential charter sites is
depicted in Figure 1.  We fully expect the network to be dynamic: 
some initial sites will persist longer than others, new sites will be
added as they are established or brought up to network standards, and
some established sites may become inactive for periods of time.  
  We propose two membership categories:  site members and model
members.  Membership is limited to those research groups with active
gas measurement or modeling programs that meet the criteria outlined
below.  

2.1.  Site Membership Criteria

1. a continuous, on-going measurement program for N2O, CH4, or CO2
  made within protocol guidelines established by the network;
  
2. an initial and (where appropriate) continuous measurement program
  for ancillary variables such as climate, soil properties, land
  use practices, and C and N inputs;
  
3. active participation in the annual network workshop; and
  
4. a willingness to share data via established protocols.  

  Measurement protocols will be in most cases tailored to site-
specific needs, however, in order that the data collected be
comparable and appropriate to the overall goals of the network,
established measurement protocols must be followed.  For some sites
sampling frequencies of only a few times per year will be adequate;
for others, more event-driven strategies of several times per week
during certain parts of the year will be needed.  It will be up to
site members to define the sampling frequency for their sites. 
Regardless of sampling frequency, the sampling protocols will be
established by network members as a group both for flux measurements
and for site-related support measurements such as climate (see
Appendix II, Analytical Techniques - for a detailed discussion of
protocol/methodological issues).  
  The network will hold annual workshops to which each site will be
required to send at least one participant to satisfy membership
criteria.  We expect this participant to be one of the site's
principal investigators.  The purpose and format of these workshops
are outlined below under Network Activities.  Also, each site must
agree to share gas flux and support data in a timely manner via
protocols developed by the network.  (see Section 3 for a description
of proposed data protocols).  

2.2.  Model Membership Criteria

  Modelers are not expected to provide primary data to the network
but are nevertheless expected to make concrete contributions related
to extrapolation and hypothesis testing.  Criteria for model
membership include:

1. a continuous, on-going modeling program that includes the
  development of simulation models for N2O, CH4, or CO2 fluxes;

2. active participation in the annual network workshop; and
  
3. a willingness to share model algorithms with both the site
  members and other model members via established protocols.


2.3.  Network Activities

  As noted earlier, the purpose of the network is to foster a
better understanding of mid-latitude trace gas contributions to the


Fig. 1
global budget by facilitating data access and interactions among those
measuring and modeling gas fluxes.  The network will meet this
objective principally via four activities: (1) by conducting an annual
workshop to present and discuss current results; (2) by providing a
central clearinghouse for network site data; (3) by facilitating
communication both nationally and internationally among network
scientists and between network members and those initiating trace gas
measurement programs at non-network sites, and (4) by fostering the
development of comparable methodologies. 
  The annual workshop will be held at a different network site each
year.  At this workshop, each member site will send at least one
parincipal investigator (funding for one participant to attend the
workshop will be provided by the network office) who will describe the
site's previous year's results.  Each site will bring to the meeting
(or send beforehand) an abstract of this description and the
supporting data files in the prescribed format.  Each modeling group
will also send a participant who will describe current progress with
specific models; modelers will also be required to provide an abstract
and an updated version of models on disk. 
  A substantial portion of the workshop will be devoted to
synthesis issues:  detailed discussions of additional measurements,
additional sites, and additional experiments that are needed to
further current understanding of gas fluxes.  We view workshops as
prime opportunities for sites to compare results and share
methodological advances without the delays and inefficiencies
associated with communication via standard scientific channels. 
Equally important, workshops will offer the opportunity for modelers
to interact directly with those providing flux measurements to the
network database; these interactions should greatly facilitate model
development and validation, as well as to promote integration of site
data into process-level understanding of trace gas fluxes.
  A second major network activity is to provide a  clearinghouse
for flux and ancillary data and for model distribution.  This function
must be accomplished through a centralized activity to distribute the
data in order to simplify and to ensure timely responses to requests
for data and models.  
  Thirdly, the network will facilitate communication among members
and provide non-members access to the network by publishing and
distributing an annual network report (to contain, among other things,
the annual site abstracts and addresses of site PI's); by distributing
a within-network newsletter; and by maintaining an e-mail network for
site members.  
  Finally, the network will foster the development of comparable
methodologies by including methodological issues in its annual network
meeting and by sponsoring -- where appropriate -- workshops devoted to
the inclusion of new methodologies and intercalibration activities at
network sites.  

2.4.  Network Management

  The network will be managed by a steering committee whose
chairperson will act as network coordinator.  The steering committee
is now comprised of Drs. Elizabeth A. Holland, Jerry M. Melillo, Arvin
R. Mosier, Dennis S. Ojima, and G. Philip Robertson.  It is the
responsibility of the coordinator to oversee the day-to-day activities
of the network as outlined above.  The coordinator acts on behalf of
the steering committee, which guides the overall direction of the
Network.  The Steering Committee also recommends to the general
membership the acceptance of new sites to the network and deletion of
existing sites from the network.  Members of the steering committee
will be elected on a rotating basis by network members at the annual
workshop; members will rotate on and off of the committee on a
staggered basis to maintain network continuity.

2.5.  Implementation

  The network will be funded with external support that will be
used to carry out the activities outlined above; network support will
not be used for measurement or modeling activities per se.  Initial
support will cover the annual workshops (travel and accommodations for
participants), salary and office support for an administrative
assistant to manage network

requests for information and data/models, and (as needed) partial
salary support for the network coordinator.  
     The network will be formally established in the spring of 1993. 
A letter of opportunity will be distributed to all known trace gas
measurement and modeling programs in the USA.  This letter will
announce the formation of the network and invite recipients to apply
for membership.  In addition, network activities will be presented at
appropriate scientific meetings, such as annual meetings of the
American Geophysical Union (AGU), Ecological Society of America (ESA),
American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Soil Science Society of America
(SSSA), etc.  Membership will be based on the criteria described
above.  Later in 1993 we will hold the first network workshop.  At
this meeting network participants will present descriptions of their
sites and provide overviews of current and past flux measurement
activities.  Modelers will likewise provide overviews of their current
trace gas models.  As for all subsequent workshops, substantial time
will be devoted to discussions of synthesis issues.

2.6.  Charter Sites

     Based on criteria noted above we have identified 28 sites as
potential charter members of the network.  All of these sites meet the
criteria of the network and have agreed to join.  The geographic array
of these sites appears in 

Figure 1; a brief overview of their trace gas activities appears in Table 1.

     In order to accomplish the objectives listed above,  the Network
will be comprised of three components:  (1) a trace gas measurement
component, (2) a modeling and regional analyses component, and (3) a
data management component.  These three components are closely coupled
to each other and described briefly in a following section.  

2.7.  Coordination with National and                International
Programs

     The Trace Gas Network proposed in this document is designed to
fulfill the U.S. contribution to the world-wide program being
established under the auspices of IGBP/IGAC.  The network relates
particularly to the IGBP/IGAC Activity 5.2, which is specifically
aimed at characterizing trace gas fluxes in the mid-latitudes, a
region encompassing all of the continental U.S.  
     The U.S. Trace Gas Network will join comparable networks in other
continents also under the loose coordination of IGAC Activity 5.2.  It
is expected that a European network will be established soon, building
on an existing national network research programs such as TERN
(Germany), the Nordic Research Program (Scandanavia), and the TIGER
program (United Kingdom), as well as international projects supported
by the European Community STEP and Environment Programs.  Also, links
are being made with a proposed Australian network program; part of the
CERN network in China has been recommended as part of the Activity and
attempts are being made to initiate work in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and temperate South
America.  Cooperation between and among these regional and national
networks provide the opportunity for comparison of trace gas fluxes
across similar and different climates, across broad geographical
distances.  
     Within the U.S., we envision the Trace Gas Network to be part of
the U.S. Global Change Program.  We are striving to foster
interactions with the National Academy of Science Global Change
Committee, National Science Foundation, NASA, EPA, DOE, and USDA.  

2.8.  Network Components:  Measurement,         Model and Regional
Analysis, and             Data Management

     We propose a sampling network that includes the main temperate
ecosystems in North America and specifies data that should be
collected within this network.  One of the key components of this
program is to understand how trace gas fluxes in natural ecosystems
are likely to change in response to changes in climate and
anthropogenic inputs.  This need to understand how fluxes will change
in response to physical and chemical changes in climate requires
manipulative experiments at both the laboratory and field

Fig. 2
scales and the development of mechanistic models to describe the
production or consumption of trace gases in the biosphere. 


     Long-term monitoring programs that encompass a wide range of
temporal variation will help in understanding how fluxes change as
conditions change.  However, these data will not include combinations
or extremes of conditions beyond those that have occurred in recent
times.  Manipulation experiments are needed to address these new
ecosystem states.  The long-term monitoring data and manipulation
experiments will allow us to develop trace gas flux "response
functions" that will account for the diverse factors that control
these gas exchanges.  These response functions will form the nucleus
of models capable of depicting trace gas exchanges at the ecosystem
scale.  Manipulation studies should be based at sites where gas fluxes
are already well characterized.
     Many of the data collection activities within the trace gas
network will need to be long-term, encompassing a wide range of
temporal variation that will be helpful for understanding how fluxes
will respond to global change.  Data acquired from manipulation
experiments will complement those obtained from the network.  Both
will be used for the development of trace gas flux models that will be
used to quantify the diverse factors that control these exchanges. 
These models will form the nucleus of a larger modeling activity
capable of predicting trace gas exchanges at ecosystem scales. 
Linking ecosystem models to atmospheric chemical transport models and,
ultimately, to general circulation models, will permit elucidation of
trace gas fluxes at regional and global scales.
     One of the primary objectives of this activity is to improve our
ability to predict future mid-latitude fluxes of CH4, N2O, and CO2 in
response to global climate change. A set of models arranged in a
hierarchy will serve as an important tool for achieving this
objective.  This hierarchy includes:

(1)  process-based models of specific gas fluxes, 
(2)  process-based models of soil biogeochemistry,
(3)  higher-level models, including; process-based models of ecosystem
     biogeochemistry,
(4)  plant population/community models.

     These models will have a modular structure so that different
versions of a module can be used as part of the overall modeling
approach.  One critical aspect of the modular approach is that the
inputs to and the outputs from a particular module will be clearly
defined.  This will permit all versions of a module to be used
interchangeably, facilitating model comparisons and future revisions
(Figure 2).  
     We refer to this entire hierarchy of models as the Terrestrial
Community Model--a model developed by and available to the terrestrial
ecosystem research community (Figure 3). The process-based models for
specific gases represent the first level of the hierarchy; these
define exchanges between soils and the atmosphere and the factors that
control them (temperature, moisture, carbon and nitrogen
availability).  Inputs that define these controlling factors come from
the next level in the hierarchy, the process-based soil biogeochemical
models.

                            3.  DATA MANAGEMENT

     Data management is an essential element of a national network
whose goals include the synthesis of research from individual sites
and investigators.  Practical solutions to data management are needed 
that work, that multiple investigators will use, and that are
affordable.  Data management should therefore be formalized early in
the organizational process of the network.  Participation in
developing and maintaining databases must be considered a necessary
focus of all participants in the network.
     There exist two levels of benefits to this activity.  At the
general scientific level, well-documented multi-site data will provide
a baseline data set for future scientific investigations.  The
availability of this data offers the potential to advance the science
more rapidly and in directions previously unavailable to individuals. 
More generally, these data provide the basis for cross-site
comparisons and synthesis, permitting regional model building and
validation.  Finally, well-managed data will facilitate international
investigations beyond the scope of the national network.  
     At the individual investigator level, benefits must be provided
to compensate for an activity not directly related to site-specific
scientific questions.  The major benefit is the more comprehensive
perspective provided by cross-site comparisons that are facilitated by
clear data management at individual sites.  In particular, the nesting
of "add-on" individual investigator projects to ongoing trace gas
studies should provide a mechanism of cost-effective science. 
Leverage of funding from granting agencies is a clear benefit. 
Individuals need to be "rewarded" for their data management efforts
with opportunities to participate in network workshops, symposia and
synthesis publications.  
     Data management of the network must address the following issues. 
A consensus of data needs must be established at various levels.  Data
storage and distribution must be centralized and well supported both
financially and philosophically.  Simplicity of access and use must be
balanced with appropriate quality control criteria.  These criteria
include adequate documentation and use of accepted methodologies.  
Finally, the network must establish data access and use protocols. 

3.1.  Data Needs

     Data acquisition needs are determined by network goals.  Figure 2
suggests a conceptual model for the scientific processes and data
exchanges involved in regional and global trace gas research.  The
figure identifies categories and specific kinds of data needed within
the framework of this network.  The foci of this diagram are trace gas
models which operate at local to global scales.  Models strive to
embody our best understanding of trace gas fluxes and allow projection
to larger space/time scales.  
     Expanding upon Figure 2, we recognize that five general types of
data are essential within this network: (1) intensive site data; (2)
extensive site data; (3) remotely-sensed and other data appropriate
for G.I.S.; (4) tower/aircraft data; and (5) model output and
documentation of models.  Research at intensive sites will conduct
process level and manipulative studies to better understand what
controls trace gas flux at their specific site.  Extensive site data
with limited measurements expand spatial resolution with respect to
controls identified by the intensive site studies.  Geographically-
based information, typically organized with G.I.S., provides the
opportunity for model validation, regional flux estimation, and
identification of regional driving variables.  Tower/aircraft data
will be used to validate projected flux values at the meso-scale.  
     It is clear that data collection will vary significantly from
site to site depending on the specific scientific questions relevant
to the site, and on personnel and technological resources available. 
There is a basic set of "site characterization" data that is required
for all sites (Table 2).  Information is required on fluxes of
methane, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and carbon dioxide at each site,
although the methods of flux measurement will vary from site to site. 
Carbon monoxide and non-methane hydrocarbon fluxes will be measured at
some sites.  At some sites, manipulations of soil water content, soil
temperature and/or nitrogen availability will be carried out, to
investigate the processes controlling fluxes, and to provide
information for modeling.  At these sites, additional data will be
collected from manipulative and process studies (Table 3).  It would
be preferable if these data were available in a spatially explicit
format, e.g., in a geographic information system (GIS).  In addition
to the flux data, basic site characterization data are required from
all sites (Table 2).  It will be desirable to establish protocols for
intercalibration, data handling and storage, to be used generally
throughout the network.

3.2.  Data Storage and Distribution

     The complexity inherent in the proposed network requires a data
management system that provides: (1) maximum ease of data
documentation and archiving at the local level; and (2) flexibility
for data retrieval and manipulation to address a diversity of
scientific issues germane to the network (e.g., flux estimation,
elucidation of mechanisms controlling flux, identification and
quantification of driving variables, and development of predictive
models for trace gas flux).  Two primary aspects include the
individual site archives and the central database structure,
management, and distribution protocols.  With respect to the central
database, management supported by the network is needed.
     For individual sites, data manipulation and storage will use a
wide variety of existing software and hardware.  Accordingly, we
propose a generic file structure similar to that advocated by Conley
and Brunt (1991) be adopted.  The generic ASCII file structure will
contain the following features:

(1)  log: history of file, date created, site, author name and
     address.

(2)  doc: text description of dataset, including specific methodology
     and organization.  

(3)  type: description of the basic nature of the data, such as
     - Statistical files (rows and columns of data)
     - Text files (bibliographical data)
     - Models
     - Metadata files(model-generated data)
     - Graphics files (information that can write directly to printers
     or plotter)
 
(4)  Header: for statistics files, labels for data columns

(5)  Data: with provisions for imbedded comment lines.

     It is proposed that a generic ASCII file structure be used in
both archiving site files to the central data base as well as
dissemination of information from the data base to users at individual
sites.

3.3.  Data Access and Use Protocols

     Centralized data management requires accessibility both by
contributors to the database and by users not directly involved in
data collection.  The primary users will be the contributors; the
ultimate users will be the modeling community.  Contributors will want
to know how their flux rates compare to fluxes from other sites with
different climatic and process-level controls.  Such comparisons
should lead to the development of new hypotheses about the
distribution and control of fluxes, and should also allow contributors
to identify potential collaborators elsewhere for testing these
hypotheses.  Modelers will need access to data in order to develop,
test, and extrapolate models at different scales.
     Protocols to govern access to network data and model algorithms
must balance the individual contributor's  right of first publication 
against the larger community's need for access to this data in a
timely manner.  Additionally, individual investigators will likely
want to maintain some oversight with respect to how their data is
being used and interpreted by others.  There are numerous examples of
past and on-going projects in which these potentially-conflicting
needs have been successfully balanced.  Current examples

include the LTER network, the NADP network, and the EPA's Soil Organic
Matter Network.  
     For the Trace Gas Network we expect to institute an access
protocol that allows all network participants full access to the
entire database, but with publication restrictions for at least a one-
year period.  This means that information will be readily accessible
to contributors and modelers as the data are compiled (following an
annual meeting), but that inclusion of data in a submitted manuscript
requires the explicit permission of the data contributor for one year
thereafter.  We expect that in most cases, especially for model
development and regional syntheses, permission will be readily granted
by contributors within this period, especially if contributors are
brought in as co-authors.  After one year in the database all data
enters the public domain, open to both network and non-network
scientists to use.  The network will strongly encourage (but not
require) users to contact contributors when the data are requested;
this will allow users to issue additional caveats as appropriate and
perhaps add more recent information.  The network will, however,
require proper attribution of data in any publications that ensue.

         APPENDIX II:  ANALYTICAL AND FIELD METHODOLOGY


     A number of analytical techniques will be employed in order to
achieve a better understanding of controls on trace gas exchange and
to estimate regional fluxes of trace gases.  In the field, chamber and
micrometeorological techniques available for trace gas flux
measurements cover a wide range of time and space scales, so meeting
goals 1 and 2 will require several techniques applied over time to
resolve the documentation and control factor questions.  The
techniques, their operating assumptions and practices, their
strengths, weaknesses and intercomparability are discussed below. 
Techniques to analyze the observations of trace gas fluxes range from
statistical correlative studies to more detailed process-level
modeling to regional extrapolation of known fluxes.  The linkages
across these various techniques are given below.

II.1.  Field Techniques
     II.1.1.  Chambers.  Chamber measurements involve enclosing a
volume of atmosphere adjacent to the soil surface and measuring
increases or decreases in chamber trace gas concentration over time. 
The trace gas flux is computed using the rate of concentration change
over a given period of time and the area of ground the chamber is
sampling.  Chambers represent a compromise as they influence flow
field, temperature and concentrations at the soil:air interface, but
if they are operated over short time periods and minimize disturbance,
they yield reliable flux measurements.  They also have other
significant advantages.  Their sensitivity can be adjusted to site
conditions by varying volumes.  Of the methods available, chamber
techniques are the only method that can unequivocally measure soil
uptake of trace gases.  They can operate within the variability scale
of a given system and are a logical choice for trace gas measurements
in 1-10 m2 scale manipulation experiments.  A great deal of
understanding has resulted from chamber-based trace gas flux
measurements in a wide variety of systems.  Rapid data turn-around is
another advantage.  Chamber measurements have been used to measure and
estimate annual fluxes with some confidence.  Further, these
techniques have been used in inter-annual comparisons.  Chamber
techniques are a logical choice for determining the effects of land
use change and disturbance on trace gas fluxes.  Chamber techniques
are used extensively because of their low cost and easy deployment. 
Chambers can be operated dynamically or statically.  Dynamic
measurements involve air flow through the chamber and are usually
associated with measurements of highly reactive and/or gas species
that can only be detected by continuous flow-through detectors. 
Static chambers involve no air flow, but must be provided with a means
of pressure equalization to avoid bias following sampling.
     II.1.2.  222Rn-calibrated fluxes.  The radon 222 technique (Dorr
and Munnich, 1987) provides an independent check on chamber flux
determinations, and involves determining chamber flux measurements of
222Rn and soil concentration gradients of 222Rn and another gas. The
technique involves use of naturally-occurring 222Rn, which is inert and
affected only by radiodecay and diffusion, to estimate fluxes of other
gases.  The technique s major advantage is that it operates on a time
and space scale similar to chambers and offers a more direct
comparison as well as the ability to calibrate chambers independently. 
The technique has been used extensively in Germany by the originators,
but has seen limited application elsewhere.  An intercomparison
experiment involving CH4 and CO2 is underway at Bonanza Creek (Whalen
et al. 1992).  Trace gas fluxes can be calculated as follows:

     JCH4 = JRn (DCH4/DRn)(DCH4/DRn) ,

where the J s are fluxes (mg m-2d-1 or dpm m-2d-1), the D s are binary
diffusion coefficients in air, and the DC s are soil concentration
gradients.  The technique assumes homogeneous soils and uniform 222Rn
production rates, so waterlogged soils and low-radium soils represent
a limit.  In cases where the zone of trace gas production or
consumption are not well distributed throughout the soil profile, the
222Rn method may give spurious results.  An advantage of the technique
is concurrent determination of soil diffusivity.  
     II.1.3.  Micrometeorological measurements.  Micrometeorological
methods offer the researcher an additional tool with different time
and space scale characteristics than chambers for measuring
ecosystem:atmosphere trace gas exchange rates.  They are made in the
atmosphere's surface layer.  Trace gas flux densities measured at a
given height are assumed to represent the flux density to or from the
underlying surface.  This assumption is valid when the concentration
of the scalar being studied is steady with time and the underlying
surface is uniform and extended for an appreciable distance upwind; as
a rule of thumb, the upwind surface should extend 75 to 100 times the
flux measurement height.  To insure that flux measurements are valid
at a given site, practitioners seek closure of the surface energy
balance, which involves measurements of sensible and latent heat
exchange, soil heat conduction and the surface radiation balance.  The
strength of micrometeorological methods is a capability to measure
fluxes from a wide area, with minimal disturbance to the underlying
surface.  These methods can be automated and are useful in studies of
diurnal and seasonal variations in trace gas fluxes.  There are,
however, only a few instances where these measurements have been
conducted continuously over an entire year (above canopy CO2, Harvard
Forest); they are most generally associated with short-term campaigns
several times during a season.  Weaknesses associated with the methods
include the need for expensive and sophisticated instrumentation and
surface and meteorological constraints that limit use at all times and
places.  
     Several popular methods exploit micrometeorological theory to
measure fluxes directly or to infer them by means of
micrometeorological measurements and models.  Direct methods include
the eddy correlation and eddy accumulation methods.  Indirect methods
include gradient, mass balance, and variance techniques.  These
methods are briefly described in the following sections:

     (a)  Eddy correlation.

Fluctuations in wind transfer trace gases between the surface and free
atmosphere.  The eddy correlation methods determines flux densities
from the covariance between vertical wind velocity (w) and scalar
concentration fluctuations.  To determine this covariance, the
frequency and duration of wind and chemical measurements must include
all turbulent events that contribute to the flux.  In general,
sampling rates of 5 to 10 time per second and sampling durations of 30
to 60 minutes are desirable to measure a given flux.  At present, the
eddy correlation method is limited to chemical species that can be
measured with rapid response sensors; the method can be applied to
measuring fluxes of CO2, water vapor, CH4, O3, and NO; fast response
instrumentation for N2O is underdevelopment.  Fluctuations in humidity
and temperature cause density fluctuations and a mean vertical flow. 
This results in a bias flux that must be applied to the direct eddy
correlation measurements; evaluation of the bias flux requires
concurrent measurements of latent and sensible heat during any trace
gas flux measurement experiment.  The relative magnitude of this bias
flux depends on the ratio between the flux and its ambient
concentration.  It is greatest for N2O (50-100%), substantial for CO2
(10-40%) and small for ozone.  

     (b)  Eddy Accumulation and Conditional Sampling

     The eddy accumulation method partitions gas samples into two bins
according to whether an updraft or down draft occurs.  Early attempts
to implement the method sampled air proportionally to the vertical
wind velocity.  Fluxes were then proportional to the mass difference
between the updraft and down draft sample.  This method is complex in
an engineering sense, requiring precise flow control that responded to
atmospheric turbulence and precise analytical measurement of small
concentration differences between the up and down draft bins.  Simpler
methods have recently been proposed that have promise.  The
conditional sampling methods samples updrafts and down drafts at a
constant rate.  Fluxes are proportional to the standard deviation in
vertical velocity, a coefficient equal to 0.6 and the concentration
difference between up and down bins.  This method is most attractive
for measuring fluxes of non-methane hydrocarbons and reduced sulfur
species, which at present are dependent on slower analytical methods
such as gas chromatography.  Initial demonstration studies with the
conditional sampling method, on CO2 and water vapor are promising.

     (c)  Gradients

     Gradient methods assume turbulent transfer is analogous to
molecular diffusion.  This assumption is valid in the atmospheric
surface layer when the scales of turbulence are fine compared to the
scale that defines the curvature of the concentration profile.
Gradient fluxes equal the product of the vertical concentration
gradient and a turbulent diffusivity, K.  Concentration gradients of a
particular species are measured with standard analytical procedures. 
The difficulty in this procedure is evaluating K, the turbulent
diffusivity.  Methods exploit the surface energy balance, momentum,
heat, vapor, CO2 and radon as tracers.  Because diffusion varies
relative to the proximity to a source or a sink, K for one species may
differ from another.  For example, K  for water and momentum differ. 
There are trade-offs on where one measures the concentration
gradients.  When close to the surface, gradients are easier to
measure, but counter-gradient transfer may occur, making gradient
methods invalid.  Further from the surface, turbulent mixing is
greater, so gradients are smaller, but conditions where K s for
different species do not match are rare.

     (d)  Mass Balance Methods.

     Mass balance methods are the only micrometeorological technique
that can be applied to small area manipulated treatments.  The most
successful method is the integrated profile method.  In this case
profile measurements of wind speed and concentration are made at the
center of a circular treatment and integrated with height.  The method
has worked best to study fluxes associated with fertilizer,
insecticide, and herbicide treatments.

II.2.  Regional Flux Measurement

     Scientists desire to scale trace gas fluxes from leaves and plots
to canopies and landscapes.  Leaf and soil cuvettes address leaf and
plot scales, tower based micrometeorological measurements address
canopy scales and airplane and planetary boundary layer measurements
address landscape fluxes.  
     II.2.1.  Aircraft flux measurements.  Aircraft mounted turbulence
and chemical instruments can measure spatially integrated fluxes over
a landscape.  Fluxes require aircraft transects ~10 km long, so the
method is not as practical as towers for measuring temporal trends. 
     Airplane systems apply the eddy correlation method on a movable
platform.  The movement of the aircraft relative to the wind and
ground motion increases the complexity of the system and determination
of fluxes.  To account for the movement of the aircraft relative to
the wind and land surface vectors, exact measurements of aircraft
position in the vertical and coordinate space must be made at
relatively rapid rates, along with other measurements.  Rapid data
acquisition by many instruments also creates a data storage and
processing problem, yet these problems have been overcome (Ritter, in
press).  Another problem with the method derives from a safety need to
fly 10s of meters above the surface.  As one rises above the ground,
the assumption of a constant flux layer is less valid.  Hence,
corrections are needed to extrapolate aircraft fluxes to the surface. 

     II.2.2.  Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) Budgets.  The inversion
of the temperature profile in the atmosphere's planetary boundary
layer (PBL) acts as a lid and defines the boundary of a 'box' on which
one can perform a mass balance study.  In this case the surface flux
can be defined from knowledge of changes in PBL concentration, the
height of the PBL and the rate of material flowing in and out
laterally and at the top.  While these variables are difficult to
attain, the method has the power of being a means to assess the
integrated surface fluxes.  Aircraft can be used to assess components
of the regional mass balance box budgets, such as entrainment fluxes,
PBL height and horizontal advection.  Tethersondes and remote sensing
techniques can be used to measure time changes in concentration and
PBL growth rates.


II.3.  Intercomparison of Methods

     Chamber and micrometeorological flux determinations have
developed on parallel paths, and because of the vast differences in
time and space scales sensed, there have been few opportunities to
conduct valid intercomparisons, in part because of the difficulty in
determining the  footprint  of micrometeorological techniques, the
actual land surface are accounting for the trace gas measurements
being observed.  However, recently several large projects have
specifically addressed intercomparison of CO2 and methane flux
measurements, namely, the recent ABLE-2 experiments in Alaska and the
Hudson s Bay Lowlands (ABLE-3/NOWES), International Satellite Land
Surface Climatology Project in Kansas, FIFE, and also Verma s
Minnesota wetland study.  The results have been presented at AGU
meetings and are in press in dedicated issues of JGR-Atmospheres. 
They show agreement between chambers and several micrometeorological
methods at the 10% or better level, which promotes confidence in a
multi-method approach.  Parrish and colleagues have shown that tower
and chamber measurements of NO from soils give comparable rates. 
Aircraft-tower intercomparisons have been conducted by the Desjardins'
group and NOAA's Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division.  The
results from these comparisons are encouraging, but instances occur
where differences that may be physically real are observed.  Rigorous
intercomparison between tower and aircraft flux measurements may need
further interpretation by boundary layer models.

II.4.  Chamber Design and Operation

     Workshop participants were polled for information about chambers
used in their research programs.  Three general design types were
represented at the workshop:  (1) Aluminum construction, with deep
skirts and water seals between chamber components, PVC bases with (2)
rigid, and (3) plastic sheet, variable volume chambers.  All chambers
had footprint areas and chamber volumes that ranged between 0.06 - 0.1
m2 and 2 to 12 L, respectively.  Dimensions and materials for various
chamber designs can be characterized as follows:  
   Permanently-deployed square Al collars (27.4 x 27.4 cm) (0.075
     m2) with water seal and skirt (10-20 cm deep).  
   Stackable chamber units (24 x 24 cm x 7.3) (4.2 L) or (24 x 24 x
     14.5) (8.5 L),  lid (24 x 24 x 7) (3.7 L) equipped with septum
     for syringe sampling and capillary bleed to equalize pressure. 
     Chambers and lids fabricated from lucite sheet or Al sheet.  
   Circular PVC collars (20 cm to 28 cm diam); Steudler - 28.7 cm
     diam x 9.3 cm high (0.065 m2, 5.4 L); Keller 25 cm diam x 20 cm
     high; Mosier 20 cm diam x 10 cm high.  
   NCAR flexible chamber model, base:  20-50 cm diam; cover made of
     sheet teflon tube supported by internal wire frame.  Can be
     adjusted to cover wetland plants; must determine volume by
     standard addition of a tracer, usually SF6.  
Perhaps the largest point of divergence among chamber operators is the
depth to which permanent bases are installed; the differences reflect
root structure (horizontal vs. vertical) in the range of systems
studied.
     The methods used for chamber gas sample collection (syringes) and
storage (vials and syringes) were similar and represent a great deal
of practical experience. Mixed results have been obtained for storage
of samples in vacutainers.  All-glass syringes lubricated with
distilled water and nylon syringes are good for storing CH4 and CO2 and
N2O, however storage times are variable and should be checked.  Glass
syringes with butyl rubber pistons are suitable for CH4 and CO2. 
Carbon monoxide concentrations typically increase on storage due to
photochemical reactions involving precursor compounds.  Serum vials
with clear silicone rubber stoppers, glass syringes with teflon
pistons, and painted polypropylene syringes seem suitable for
short-term storage of CO samples.  We emphasize that storage and
compatibility tests should be a continuing part of any trace gas flux
measurement program, as there are substantial batch to batch
variations in the gas storage properties of plastic and rubber items. 


II.5.  Gas Analyses

     Methane concentration determinations are most commonly made by
gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, although gas
filter correlation infra-red detection has been used for real-time
detection in field studies. Nitrous oxide concentrations are
universally determined by gas chromatography and electron capture
detection.  Carbon dioxide can be detected by infra-red absorption, or
by gas chromatography with thermal conductivity or electron capture
detection.  Carbon monoxide is determined by gas chromatography
followed by either reaction with a HgO column followed by mercury
vapor detection, or by methanization followed by flame ionization
detection.

II.6.  Standards

     Chamber measurements do not necessarily require high accuracy
absolute concentration measurements, as the slope of concentration
change vs. time, a relative measure, is used in flux determinations. 
However, because of the precision requirements, it is advisable to
make concentration measurements using absolute standards as a means of
determining instrument performance.  Periodic intercalibrations are
recommended.  Field intercomparisons involving chambers as well as
meteorological methods should continue in well-understood systems.  

II.7.  Sampling Design

     Experience in a wide range of systems (agricultural systems, such
as paddy rice and other grains, forests, tundra, wetlands, and
grasslands) has demonstrated that trace gas fluxes are extremely
variable in space and time.  For any site there will be a minimum
level of exploratory measurements to scale and evaluate spatial and
temporal variability.  Sites should incorporate obvious topographic
and floral heterogeneity, and their selection should be tempered with
an ecological understanding of the system driving parameters. 
     Spatial variability - One approach to estimating spatial
variability is to perform a large number of flux measurements at
different sites to determine the sample number required to reach a
desired coefficient of variation.  A study of spatial variability of
field-measured denitrification gas fluxes by Folurunso and Rolston
(1984) provides a concrete example.  They found coefficients of
variation of 282 to 379% in chamber measurements of N2O flux.  Using
geostatistics, they calculated that it would require as many as 350
measurements to estimate the true mean flux within 10% on a 3 m x 36 m
plot.  Because n varies as a quadratic function, obtaining a value
within 20% of the mean flux requires less than 20 samples or ~350
samples.  Realistically, there are equipment, time, and human
limitations on implementation of this strategy and most published
studies fall well short of the desired precision levels.  In practice,
15 to 30 chamber flux measurements can be routinely performed per day
at closely located sites, which is close to a 20% estimate. 
     Temporal variability - It is advisable to fix or limit spatial
variability by operating at permanent sites to determine temporal and
seasonal variability.  As with the determinations of spatial
variability, flux measurements should incorporate diel, daily, and
weekly measurements at several periods during the year, especially
when the biological system is most active, to characterize the system. 
Sampling frequency can also be guided by experience at other sites,
e.g., weekly measurements for CH4 appear satisfactory, but N2O sampling
strategy must be guided by rain events. 
     Two types of sites will be required to meet goals 1 and 2: 
intensive and extensive.  A characteristic intensive site will involve
trace gas flux measurements plus the parameters described in Table 2;
an extensive site might involve less frequent trace gas flux
measurements and a more limited selection of parameters as shown in
Table 2.  At intensive sites, we recommend regular sampling
(determined by site temporal and spatial variability requirements), as
well as event-driven sampling to capture rainfall, thaw, and time of
fertilization events (Table 3).  In order to contribute to objective
2, both field and laboratory experiments may be performed at intensive
sites to develop relationships between factors controlling trace gas
fluxes.  Soil temperature, carbon, nutrient and moisture manipulations
are one means of determining the sensitivities of trace gas fluxes
across a range of factors.  Additional whole-system CO2 fertilization
experiments with and without irrigation would also be informative.  
 
II.8.  Additional Measurements

     The following tables list the required measurements needed to
interpret and model trace gas flux from a network of sites.  
     II.8.1.  Controlling factors--nitrogen.  In a general sense, soil
N reflects overall ecosystem productivity and acts as a driving
variable in trace gas emissions.  Mineralization of N and C are often
tightly coupled as the breakdown of organic N compounds results in the
production of CO2 and NH4+.  Nitrogen fertilization, by increasing plant
productivity, may increase organic inputs, especially over the long-
term, and thereby enhance soil respiration and methane production.  In
some cases, there  has been a short-term depression of soil
respiration following inorganic N additions, possibly by inhibiting
lignin degradation.  
     Biological production of N2O occurs as the result of both
nitrification of NH4+ to NO3- (an aerobic process) and in the anaerobic
reduction of NO3-  by denitrification.  Higher rates of nitrification
are commonly observed in soils with either high concentrations of NH4+
or high rates of N mineralization.  Similarly, denitrification rates
have been positively correlated with either NO3- concentrations or
nitrification rates (Robertson and Tiedje, 1987).  
     Emission of CH4 from soils is the net process of methane
production by methanogenesis (an obligately anaerobic process) and CH4
oxidation by methylotrophic and/or NH4+-oxidizing bacteria.  The
oxidation of CH4 can be inhibited by high concentrations of NH4+.  
     Because of these various positive and negative interactions
between N mineralization and nitrification and CO2, N2O, and CH4
emissions, it is important to characterize net N mineralization and
nitrification in the field at appropriate spatial and temporal scales
in relation to these trace gas emissions.  These measurements will
likely be valuable in explaining fluxes of other trace gases, such as
NO, as well.  
     II.8.2.  Net N mineralization and nitrification measurements. 
Numerous methods for expressing net N mineralization and nitrification
have been developed, including:  potential activity assays, laboratory
incubations, and in situ field measurements.  Field measurements are
most appropriate for the purposes of evaluating trace gas models and
determining the driving factors relevant to field gas fluxes.  
     Three major in situ methods for estimating net N mineralization
and nitrification have been evaluated:  buried bags, cores, and cores
with an ion exchange resin trap.  Cores have the advantage of more
easily preserving soil structure and can allow for more natural
temperature and water fluctuations.  The use of cores, either capped
or not (Raison et al., 1987), are simpler than those used with resin
bags and may more accurately measure net rates (Binkley and Hart,
1989).  
     We propose using open cores to estimate in situ net N
mineralization and nitrification rates for both intensive and
extensive sites.  Open cores were chosen over capped cores to allow
more natural water content dynamics.  The potential for leaching
losses, particularly of NO3-, will be minimized by using a sampling
schedule keyed to major precipitation periods.  That is, more frequent
sampling during wetter seasons because wet conditions are periods of
higher trace gas emissions.
     Cores can be conveniently made from PVC pipe.  Diameters between
2.5-5.0 cm are adequate.  The length of the core should approximate
the biologically active depth of the soil (e.g., rooting depth or A
horizon).  Sharpening one end of the core facilitates its insertion
using a small sledge hammer.  
     The number of cores per sampling site is dependent upon the
spatial variation of net N mineralization and nitrification.  Ideally
this will be determined at each site, but in practice it might equal
the number of gas emission chambers.
     At each gas emission sampling date, two PVC mineralization cores
will be driven into the soil within close proximity to an emission
chamber.  One core will be removed for water content and zero-time NH4+
and NO3- concentrations.  The other will be left in place until the
next gas emission measurement when this sampling procedure will be
repeated.  At times when there are frequent gas emission measurements,
mineralization cores will be left in place for at least two weeks. 
Concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- will be determined by standard KCl
extraction and colorimetric determinations (ASA Methods book, 1982). 
Data are to be expressed on a surface area basis.
     In addition to the listed data, atmospheric deposition of N
species (i.e., NH3 and NO3-) and SO4-2 are desirable.  At the present
time this can be obtained from the National Atmospheric Deposition
Program.  In addition to the suggested measurements, some discussion
on other desirable measurements would include biomass allocation, soil
aggregate distribution, organic matter size fractions, microbial
biomass, depth profile of methane oxidation, profile measurements of
soil gases, (N2O, CH4, CO2) microbial activity (respiration), and
denitrification potential.
     II.8.3.  NO measurements for trace gas network activity.  We
recommend using dynamic chambers for NO measurement.  Because it is a
moderately reactive gas, storage of NO in simple cheap containers such
as the syringes used for N2O and CH4 is impractical.  Measurement of NO
is normally done at the field site by drawing air through field
chambers for detection by using fast response chemiluminescence
instruments.  Chambers of the same configuration and materials used
for N2O and CH4 assays may be used for NO.  Comparisons of PVC and ABS
plastic chambers with teflon coated aluminum chambers showed no
consistent bias (Davidson and Keller, unpublished data).  Dynamic
chambers can produce artifacts when chamber pressure falls below
ambient pressure.  It is necessary to design plumbing and flow rates
to avoid mass flow from the soil.  Flow rates of 150 to 250 mL/min are
suitable for many field conditions.  We recommend testing NO flux
versus air flow rate for site-specific conditions.  
     There are two chemiluminescence techniques commonly used to
quantify NO.  A highly specific technique directly measures photons
produced by the reaction of NO + O3.  These instruments generally
require line power.  A battery operated, portable instrument is
commercially available which measures the chemiluminescence from the
reaction of NO2 with luminol.  NO must be converted to NO2 prior to
measurement usually by reaction with O3 or by reaction of NO on a CrO3
catalyst.  Ozone, PAN, and SO2 interfere with the luminol based
detection although these compounds react with the soil in the chamber
and do not affect flux measurements.  The CrO3 catalyst is sensitive to
moisture.  Changes in relative humidity in the sample stream, affect
the efficiency of NO to NO2 conversion.  The luminol instrument is not
linear below 1 ppb NO, therefore we recommend a standard addition of
NO to the sample stream to bring concentrations within the linear
range for analysis.  Concentration measurements are usually
standardized by diluting a high concentration (1 ppm) standard of NO
in oxygen-free nitrogen into the sample stream.   
     NO emissions have different drivers than N2O and CH4 hence
different temporal and spatial sampling strategies are necessary.  NO
emissions are particularly sensitive to soil temperatures.  We
recommend diel sampling schemes to avoid bias in NO emission
estimates.  Measured NO emissions should not be treated as system
fluxes.  NO emitted from the soil may be lost to plant canopies either
directly or after conversion to NO2 by reaction with O3.
     II.8.4.  Measuring ammonia flux.  The main factors which control
ammonia loss from the terrestrial system are wind speed, and the pH,
temperature and ammoniacal (NH3 + NH4+) nitrogen concentration of the
soil solution(at the surface) or water-body.  As ammonia is a reactive
gas it readily combines with water, and accumulates where ever water
accumulates.  In addition ammonia is readily absorbed and lost from
plant surfaces, and the exchange depends on the compensation point of
the plant and the ammonia concentration of the atmosphere near the
plant surface.
     As a consequence of these factors it is not appropriate to use
chambers to monitor ammonia volatilization.  The micrometeorological
method most useful for assessing ammonia volatilization in studies
such as these is the gradient technique described above.

APPENDIX III:  MODEL AND REGIONAL ANALYSES


     Many of the data collection activities within the network will
need to be long-term, encompassing a wide range of temporal and
spatial variation that will be helpful for understanding how fluxes
will respond to climate and land management changes.  This information
will be critical for the development of trace gas flux models that
will be used to quantify the diverse factors that control trace gas
exchanges.  Table 2 and 4 list the data needs at various resolutions
of model application.  The models developed will include detailed
process models, which will represent the proximal relationships of
controlling variables to trace gas processes.  In addition, simplified
models that represent these processes in a more aggregated fashion
will be developed and tested against the more detailed models.  These
more simplified models will have less detailed input requirements and
will be useful for extrapolating across larger spatial scales.  
     The role of models in the network is two fold:

    to test causal relationships of environmental factors affecting
     trace gas fluxes
    to provide a basis to extrapolate site level findings across a
     regional data base that is geographically delineates the spatial
     pattern of the driving variables.

     Essential to the development of these models and to the further
understanding of trace gas fluxes will be the close interaction of the
field measurement scientist and the modeler. There must be a constant
two-way dialogue among modelers and data gatherers.  The
experimentalist will observe results that will challenge the models,
while the models will assist in determining the desired temporal
resolution of data collection.  This exchange of ideas between
modelers and data gatherers should be encouraged through a series of
annual or biannual network workshops.  Furthermore, as models are
developed, they should be documented and placed in the network data
archives where they would be available to member sites for testing. 
This interactive development of data collection, analysis and model
development and application is a vital component of the network that
will ensure future development of our basic understanding of the
processes controlling trace gas fluxes.
     The overall objective of modeling efforts should be to derive a
series of modular algorithms of abiotic and biotic soil processes that
allow for estimates of current fluxes and predictions of future fluxes
of important trace gases including CO2, N2O, and CH4.  
     Modeling activities will assist in the experimental design of
manipulative experiments, collection of data, and selection of sites
among the network.  For example, site selection should be made with
regard to the range of existing abiotic and biotic conditions
identified as important controlling variables.  Theorists and
empiricists alike agree on a suite of variables identified as
significant biotic and abiotic controls of trace gas flux.  Given our
current level of understanding of abiotic and biotic controls of CO2,
N2O, and CH4 flux, a reduced suite of control variables that can be
routinely measured at extensive monitoring sites, and an expanded
suite of variables at intensive sites can be identified.
     A significant product of the modeling effort should be
development of detailed, process-oriented models that would serve to
generate testable predictions of CO2, CH4, and N2O flux from soils of
representative biomes, disturbance regimes (e.g., clear cut forest),
and land use (e.g., land fills, feed lots, etc.).  These models will
place a high demand on data collection activities and will be
developed in conjunction with efforts at a number of network sites
identified for their ability to generate intensive data sets and their
representation of a range of abiotic and biotic conditions.  The
process level model should include sufficient detail to allow for
integration of discontinuous flux measurements.
     The long term goal of the modeling effort should be the
estimation of spatially and temporally integrated fluxes (regional and
continental scales) of trace gases from soils.  The models should be
capable of generating current flux estimates as well as estimates of
the range of trace gas fluxes under a variety of climate change or
land use scenarios.  We recognize that the data

intensive, process level models will require a level of spatial detail
among the suite of proximal, independent variables that is impractical
to achieve.  Therefore, the process level models will be simplified by
searching for relationships between trace gas flux and the more easily
quantified distal variables such as, but not limited to, soil and
vegetation type, precipitation, and temperature.  These distal
variables should be available through existing GIS data archives
and/or achieved by remote sensing techniques.  

III.1.  Modeling Architecture

     One of the primary objectives of this activity is to improve our
ability to predict future mid-latitude fluxes of CH4, N2O, CO2, and CO
in response to global climate change.  A set of models arranged in a
hierarchy will serve as an important tool for achieving this
objective. These models will form the nucleus of a larger modeling
activity capable of predicting trace gas exchanges at ecosystem
scales.  The linking of ecosystem models to atmospheric chemical
transport models and, ultimately, to general circulation models will
permit elucidation of trace gas fluxes at regional and global scales. 
This hierarchy includes:

(1)  process-based models of specific gas fluxes, 
(2)  process-based models of soil biogeochemistry,
(3)  process-based models of ecosystem biogeochemistry,
(4)  plant population/community models.

These models will have a modular structure so that different versions
of a module can be used as part of the overall modeling approach.  One
critical aspect of the modular approach is that the inputs to and the
outputs from a particular module will be clearly defined.  This will
permit all versions of a module to be used interchangeably,
facilitating model comparisons and future revisions.
     We refer to this entire hierarchy of models as the Terrestrial
Community Model--a model developed by and available to the terrestrial
ecosystem research community (Figure 3).  The process-based models for
specific gases represent the first level of the hierarchy; these
define exchanges between soils and the atmosphere and the factors that
control them (temperature, moisture, carbon and nitrogen
availability).  Inputs that define these controlling factors come from
the next level in the hierarchy, the process-based soil biogeochemical
models (IGAC TER-EX report Colorado, 1992).
     The soil biogeochemical models define how soil carbon and
nitrogen dynamics are influenced by abiotic factors (temperature,
moisture, soil texture) as well as by plant processes.  In addition to
conveying information "down" to the gas flux modules, the soil
biogeochemical modules permit transfer of information "up" to the
whole-ecosystem biogeochemical models. 
     The development of these trace gas modules will be linked to the
"soil biogeochemical" module through input and output variables that
control C substrate availability, N availability, and through physical
parameters related to driving variables (e.g., moisture, temperature). 
The value of developing the modular approach is provided by allowing
various modules to be tested using an identical modeling environment.

III.2.  The Role of Process Modeling

     The core of the network modeling effort will be towards the
development of soil process models which can be linked to higher level
ecosystem and regional models.  Process models relate environmental
variables to fluxes though mathematical representation of the biology
of the system.  Many process models consist of a set of difference
equations.  In contrast to strictly empirical approaches, process
modeling allows the examination and manipulation of factors
controlling carbon and nutrient fluxes, in addition to making
predictions of trace gas fluxes.
     Trace gas process models generally simulate decomposition of
organic matter by microbes, which leads to production of CO2, N2O and
CH4.  Modeling can occur at several levels of detail.  Detailed models
include representation of soil microsite biochemistry and/or
population dynamics of microbes which mediate specific trace gas
fluxes (i.e., N2O, CH4) are modeled.  In this case, information is
required on growth and death rates of one or more microbial
populations and is attainable only with an intensive research effort. 

     Alternatively, trace gas fluxes may be estimated more simply
through calculation of the overall turnover of carbon and nitrogen
that form the substrates for soil microbial maintenance.  Although
this is an aggregate approach, it is conceptually intuitive, since
decomposition of carbon and nitrogen mineralization results in the
production of CO2, CH4 and N2O -- the gases of interest.  This approach,
which relies chiefly on determination of rates of soil organic carbon
turnover, may be more appropriate approach for modeling in an
extensive network of trace gas measurement sites.  
     Rates of microbial activity are commonly constrained by
temperature, moisture/aeration and organic matter quality.  There are
various mathematical representations of these controls.  Levels of
regulation can range from proximal (i.e., soil moisture) to distal,
whereby precipitation inputs are used in a hydrological model to
derive soil moisture values.  Likewise for temperature, in situ soil
measurements are the proximal level of regulation required, whereas
air temperature can be used in a soil heat flux model to derive scalar
values.  Regardless of the level of detail represented in a given
model, each network site can contribute to and benefit from modeling
efforts by providing the following list of variables to serve as
inputs to the process modeling network.  Many of these data correspond
to distal variables that can drive soil biophysical models.  
     At intensive study sites, we anticipate that manipulation
experiments will be conducted.  These experimental manipulations and
their associated gas flux measurements will facilitate parallel tests
of model performance under different management practices and regional
extrapolation studies.  Irrigation, fertilization, liming, and
vegetation manipulation are priority examples for manipulation
experiments.

III.3.  Regional Analyses - Scaling, Extrapolation and Validation

     III.3.1.  Data sources.  Scaling and extrapolation of a network
of tower-flux measurements to regional scales requires a hierarchy of
additional flux measurements made on appropriately broader scales. The
goal of the regional analysis activity is the projection of trace gas
fluxes at mesoscale or regional distances (100 - 1000's kms).  This
might be accomplished with a hierarchical series of scaling steps,
from plot level to watershed level to sub-regional levels to regional
scales.  The models used to scale across spatial and temporal factors
will include models such as process models, watershed-scale models,
and regional models.  The process level models will not necessarily be
directly used for regional estimates of trace gas fluxes due to the
inadequacy of input data, large computational demands, and difficult
to scale particular processes directly to large scales.  However,
these more detailed models could be used to develop simplified
algorithms to extrapolate from plot level studies to sub-regional
(e.g., watershed areas) and regional scale areas.  
     Other techniques that could potentially be used include
appropriate empirical modeling methods such as, non-linear parameter
estimation or neural-net AI approaches.  Previous studies using FIFE
data indicate that evenly weighted driving functions across 100 m
spatial scales are adequate to scale chamber measurements to tower
level flux measurements of CO2.  Tower data was heterogeneous at
broader spatial scales, however. At the regional to continental level
of synthesis, direct griding of sub-regional scale models will be
within computational capability.  The sub-regional level models will
be appropriate for direct interface to circulation models.  
     III.3.2.  Experimental design to allow spatial model development. 
Scales of variability of the driving functions identified for the
canopy level process-specific models will be different.  Experimental
design at both the inter- and intra-site levels must recognize the
need for both flux and controlling variable measurement across a broad
gradient.  Without such cross-gradient measurements it will be
impossible to develop spatially robust broad scale flux models.  For
some controlling variables (e.g., temperature and moisture), this
implies use of inter-site data, perhaps cross-continental or inter-
continental data.  Effects of other controlling variables might be
addressed by cross-gradient chamber measurements within a single site.

     Manipulation of controlling variables will be an important source
of information for identification of factors controlling fluxes at the
plot, landscape, and regional scale, in addition to different temporal
scales.  Manipulation of similar controlling variables at different
sites will be useful for identification of variable interaction
effects which may not be apparent at a single site.  
     While the fundamental models at the chamber level must be
mechanistic and process specific in order to allow extrapolation,
scaling to broader spatial scales can utilize empirical modeling
methods.  It is reasonable to expect that functional mechanisms at the
plot level which control a flux, will have analogous shapes in
response to appropriately aggregated controlling variables at a
broader spatial scale.  For example, CO2 evolution may have a
temperature optimum for a given system state and level of other
driving functions, at a small scale level.  At a watershed level, the
aggregate flux should also exhibit an optimum to a synoptically
measured temperature, as by a radiometer.  The exact temperature of
the optimum may be different at these two scales, however.  This is
due both to subtle differences in the method of defining the relevant
temperatures at the two spatial scales, as well as to the aggregation
at the watershed scale of heterogenous plot level functions.  It is
also possible that the shape of the response function may vary in the
broad scale system and that the shape and optimum may vary among
watersheds across broader scale gradients.  
     The process of flux aggregation in response to a heterogenous
mixture of controlling variables, together with a synoptic or
aggregated measure of controlling variables, will yield a spatial
model varying from the small plot scale model to regional or sub-
continental scale models.  Identification of the appropriate spatial
model format, for several gas species and a broad range of controlling
variables and system states is important to estimate fluxes at
different scales.  It may be appropriate to use automated model and
parameter identification methods in this situation.  These are not
anticipated to be fitting of data to arbitrary functions, but
operations guided by experimental data and knowledge gained from small
scale process studies and models and knowledge of the aggregating
methods used for spatial variable measurement. 
     A number of techniques are being used, including neural net
methods, for exploration of large parameter spaces to relate complex
signals with a large set of causal variables.  Their prediction error
is always quantifiable by subdivision of data into independent
"training" and "testing" sets.  In order to develop spatially robust
flux models, neural nets may be developed independently for single
sites and with various multiple site data sets.  Development of a net-
based flux predictor for two distinct sites across a gradient and
testing against an intermediate site is useful for detection of
homogeneity of response mechanisms across that gradient.

               Between 5/3/94 and 7/5/94 measurments were collected only on the non plow Duncan site.
               From 7/5/94 to 10/25/94, the same initial six rings in the Duncan non plowed were paired aging with
                The new cultivated site was plowed and received one lime application (7/5/94 to 10/25/94)

<TITLE>UNITED STATES TRACE GAS NETWORK OBJECTIVES</TITLE>
<H2>TRAGNET OBJECTIVES</H2>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P>The proposed network is designed to contribute to our
understanding of trace gas fluxes to the atmosphere through six
principle objectives.</P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> The network will promote the comparability of trace gas flux
measurements.  As discussed later in this report, the network
will provide guidance on sampling designs that are site
appropriate; provide suggestions and updated information on
appropriate analytical and sample collection methods; and
facilitate intercomparisons and intercalibrations.
</P>
<P>
<LI> The network will provide for more extensive coverage of ecosystem
variability. Identification of regions where no long-term
measurements are available, or where replication is needed, will
be assessed; the network participants can then encourage the
development of research sites in such areas.
</P>
<P>
<LI> Data synthesis will be facilitated by the network.  Data
collected from sites that span a range of controlling factors or
that represent a range of ecoregions will be available to the
group for synthesis and hypothesis setting.
</P>
<P>
<LI> Interactions between measurement and modeling groups will be
facilitated by the network.  Data collection at appropriate
frequency and spatial scales will allow model development and
model testing.  Hypotheses generated from the model synthesis
activities will foster new field research.
</P>
<P>
<LI> Intercomparisons of model results will be facilitated.  It will
be possible to make comparisons that utilize identical estimates
of input and output.  In addition, model modularity will be
developed where possible, facilitating the identification of
reasons models produce different results.
</P>
<P>
<LI>A long-term data archive for trace gas flux and other ecosystem
processes will be established as a component of the network.  The
purpose of the network is to foster a better understanding of
mid-latitude trace gas contributions to the global budget by
facilitating data access and interactions among those measuring
and modeling gas fluxes.
</P>

<LI><H3>Instrument Description</H3>
<P>Permanent plots for gas flux measurement were established by driving 
20.3 cm inside diameter PVC pipe, 8-cm into the soil.  We measured CH4, 
N2O and CO2 flux by placing closed, vented chambers over the established 
anchors and taking gas samples from inside the chambers at prescribed 
intervals, totaling one hour or less, with polypropylene syringes fitted 
with nylon stopcocks.  The 7.5 cm high chambers were constructed from PVC 
pipe and sheeting and the tops were covered with reflective tape.  The 
vented chambers were preparred according to Hutchinson and Mosier (1981, 
Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 45:311-316).  Gas samples were analyzed for CH4, N2O 
and CO2 by gas chromatography.  Refer methodology questions to A.R. Mosier 
(amosier@lamar.colostate.edu).

<H2>What are nematodes?</H2>
<A HREF="diagram.html">Click here to display diagram of a <I>Rhabditis</I>

<BR>
&quot;nem-a-tode\`nem-a-t&otilde;d\n: any of a group of elongated cylindrical
worms parasitic in animals or plants or free-living in soil or water.&quot;
<I>Excerpted from <U>Merriam Webster College Dictionary</U> (1994), Merriam-Webster,
Inc., Springfield, MA.</I> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nematoda: A phylum of invertebrates comprising the roundworms. They
are characterized by a smooth narrow cylindrical unsegmented body tapered
at both ends. They shed their tough outer cuticle four times during life
to allow growth. The microscopic free-living forms are found in all parts
of the world, where they play an important role in the destruction and recycling
of organic matter. The many parasitic nematodes are much larger; they include
the filaria <I>(Wuchereria)</I> and Guinea worm <I>(Dracunculus)</I>, which
cause serious diseases in man.&quot; <I>Excerpted from <U>A Concise Dictionary
of Biology</U> (1990), Oxford University Press, Oxford.</I> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The nematodes, poor beasts, do not furnish hides, horns, tallow, or
wool; they are not fit for food, nor do they produce anything ornamental-
in fact, when they are displayed in museums the public votes them hideous.&quot;
<I>Attributed to N. A. Cobb. Excerpted from Poinar, Jr., Geoge O. (1983).
<U>A Natural History of Nematodes.</U> Prentice Hall.</I> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just what is a nematode? The more one learns the more difficult it
becomes to provide a clear answer because of the exceptions encountered.
However, nematodes are generally defined as appendageless, nonsegmented,
wormlike invertabrates possessing a body cavity and a complete digestive
tract. By complete digestive tract it is meant a mouth, an alimentary canal,
and an anus. There is no specialized respiratory or circulatory system;
however, nematodes possess a well-developed nervous system, an excretory
system, and a set of longitudinal musicles.&quot; <I>Excerpted from Poinar,
Jr., Geoge O. (1993). <U>A Natural History of Nematodes.</U> Prentice Hall.</I>

<FONT SIZE=+2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</FONT></P>

<P><BR>
Soils are one of the most poorly researched habitats on earth. The functioning
of this thin dark covering on the surface of the earth is vital for the
survival of the biosphere in its present form. The impact of burgeoning
human populations has destroyed the soil physico-chemical environment and
the soil's species through activities such as: inputs of chemicals from
the atmosphere, disposal of waste products in soils, ground water contamination,
and physical modification or removal of soil by cultivation and erosion.
Soil degradation has also resulted in the mobilization of carbon and nitrogen
as greenhouse gases forcing climate change. Information on the effect of
these impacts on the loss of soil biodiversity and the loss of key functions
[e.g., biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), potassium
(K), phosphorus (P), oxygen (O)] in the biosphere is fragmentary. Ecological
principles derived from macroscale above-ground research have been transferred
without basis to soil organisms that function at the microscale, providing
an incomplete foundation for predicting sustainability. Nevertheless, ecologists
have shown the importance of soil biota to ecosystem processes such as nutrient
cycling, carbon storage, and maintenance of plant diversity, through studies
that combine a number of taxa into functional or trophic groups. Global
change research examining the effects of soil warming has revealed the key
role of the soil biota in regulating methane (CH<FONT SIZE=-3>4</FONT>),
nitrous oxide (N<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>O), and carbon dioxide (CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>)
losses from soil, which impact processes in aquatic and atmospheric systems.
Research has continued to show the value of soil biota to the biological
control of human and agricultural pests, in biotechnology, and for remediation
of hazardous wastes. Clearly, species of soil biota are tightly linked functionally
to above-ground biotic interactions. They perform ecological services that
strongly impact the quality of human life and have enormous potential for
providing economic benefits, e.g., the isolation and identification of the
soil fungus Penicillium that led to a large pharmaceutical industry of antibiotics.<BR>
<BR>
Soil biota remain among the vast unknown life on our planet, a dark frontier,
despite their critical importance to understanding ecosystem function. For
example, thousands of species of microbes and invertebrates inhabit just
a square meter of temperate grassland soil, organisms whose identities and
contributions to sustaining our biosphere are largely undiscovered (Figure
1). The elucidation of species diversity of soils in conjunction with sustainability
assessments of soil-mediated ecosystem processes must be a high priority
in global biodiversity efforts. Yet, although biodiversity efforts at the
global level have consistently highlighted the need for studying soil organisms,
there are few scientists with soil taxonomic or soil ecological expertise.
For example, soil research was a priority recommendation in a 1980 USA National
Research Council Report, Research Priorities in Tropical Biology, because
of a lack of knowledge linking soils to vegetation diversity in the seasonal
and humid tropics. The recommendation emphasized movement of nutrient and
trace-element ions through the soil biota as a means of learning about soil
species and food webs. <BR>
<BR>
In 1989, the National Science Board of the National Science Foundation (1994)
issued a report (Loss of Biological Diversity: a Global Crisis Requiring
International Solutions) which targeted soil biodiversity for immediate
international collaborative research. More recently, several international
efforts have recognized the compelling link between the above- and below-ground
biota and proposed characterization of soils (Heal et al., 1993) and soil
biota (Groombridge, 1992; Hawksworth and Ritchie, 1993; National Research
Council, 1993). </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR>

<P><BR>
Unfortunately, biologists have historically given less urgency for identification
of soil organisms and elucidation of their roles in soil ecology when faced
with the magnitude of change and loss of above-ground biodiversity. Traditionally,
the systematics and ecology of soil species have been the purview of forestry
and agricultural research, particularly in the United States. Agricultural
management generally has been driven by production and, in many cases, the
use of pesticides and fertilizers, which has masked the importance of the
soil biota. Consequently, there is an acute lack of baseline data on the
critical roles played by soil biota -- and the individual roles of soil
taxa -- in maintaining soil structure, soil fertility, and mediating important
ecosystem processes such as decomposition. The best known soil species belong
to groups such as the ants, symphylans, plant pathogens and termite pest
species, along with key beneficial taxa such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
mycorrhizae and predaceous fungi and earthworms. <BR>
<BR>
At a workshop at the Natural History Museum in London (August 30 to September
1, 1994) jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (US) and the
Natural Environmental Research Council (UK), systematists, ecologists and
conservationists addressed soil biodiversity as related to ecosystem function.
This report summarizes the three days of deliberations. The workshop discussions
were based on the initial understanding that (A) soil biota are integral
to ecosystem function; (B) baseline data on most soil species, their ecological
role, their systematic position, geographic occurrence, and abundance does
not exist; and (C) there are insufficient resources and time to inventory
all of Earth's biota. Therefore we view as urgent priorities:<BR>
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>the need to study soil biodiversity using research projects and designs
  that relate the systematics of soil taxa to key ecosystem processes, and
  </LI>
  <LI>the need to make these research projects international for compelling
  reasons: individual nations lack a critical mass of expertise for identifying
  the soil biota; communities at present cannot be compared; therefore, ecological
  comparisons across biotic zones and ecosystem regimes and economies of
  scale in ecosystem and systematic analyses are a priority.</LI>

<FONT SIZE=+2>GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
</FONT><A NAME="interdisc ints"></A><BR>
<I>Interdisciplinary interactions</I></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Involve a wide array of scientists including: biologists (microbiologists,
  molecular biologists, zoologists, ecologists, biochemists, botanists and
  physiologists), soil chemists, soil physicists, geologists, hydrologists,
  modelers and information management specialists in research efforts relating
  soil biodiversity to ecosystem function. Primary beneficiaries of this
  research effort, and thus, necessary participants, would include funding
  agencies that support the basic sciences, as well as non-government organizations,
  and international and national agencies with priorities in global change,
  land use management, restoration of biodiversity, prevention and mitigation
  of pollution and creation of a sustainable global environment (for example,
  in the USA, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Soil Conservation
  Service, Experiment Stations, and Forest Service; the Department of Energy;
  the Environmental Protection Agency; the Department of Interior's National
  Biological Survey and US Geological Survey).</LI>
  <LI>Employ the concepts and techniques of molecular biology in soil biodiversity
  studies. Applications of molecular biology are dependent on genetic analyses
  of the still to be identified planet's biota that resides largely in the
  soil and sediments.</LI>
  <LI>Make efforts to establish the economic importance of soil biota. Provide
  support for a review and synthesis based on the direct and indirect values
  of soil species. </LI>
  <LI>Encourage experts in other scientific disciplines, including engineering,
  computing science, atmospheric sciences, medicine, chemistry and physics,
  to develop and transfer techniques for use in taxonomic protocols, information
  management, and discrimination of life at the microscale in soil.</LI>
  <LI>Ensure research experiments on plant physiology and plant growth, and
  on soil processes, are made with knowledge of the soil organisms present.
  Omission of organisms, e.g., soil fauna, can lead to erroneous results.<BR>
  <A NAME="taxonomic efforts"></A></LI>
</UL>

<P><I>Taxonomic efforts</I></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Provide resources (personnel and funds) for analyses and syntheses
  of systematic and biogeographical information on soil biota. For example,
  there is insufficient knowledge to test the correlation between soil and
  above-ground species diversity and richness, or to determine the range
  of soil microbes, fungi and invertebrates that exist in habitats. However,
  there is data on the geographical distribution and balance of different
  groups of soil biota. In the warmer climes, the decomposition process is
  related to termite activity, whereas in colder parts of the world, termites
  are absent, and different groups of organisms are involved with the decomposition
  process. Biogeographical and systematic knowledge would be beneficial in
  many ways, e.g., identifying species of economic importance, comparing
  rates of decomposition, predicting impacts of loss of species.</LI>
  <LI>Take steps to increase the global pool of taxonomic experts in soil
  biota. Identify immediately the location and stage of career of existing
  taxonomists to enable (A) the contribution of those near retirement, particularly
  through training of graduate students and postdoctorates, and (B) the production
  of taxonomic products on poorly known soil organisms. Innovative training
  approaches using parataxonomists and soil ecologists must be considered.
  Additional sources of funding and university and national agency administrative
  support may be required to train students internationally, because for
  many soil taxa only one or two systematists may remain worldwide. Training
  students in novel methods and identification should be enhanced through
  Internet accessibility, video links, satellite transmission links, workshops
  and other means.</LI>
  <LI>Develop new methods that take advantage of the latest technological
  breakthroughs for detecting, sampling, collecting, culturing, and identifying
  microfauna and microorganisms. No single method can extract or discriminate
  all soil taxa, but common methods may be applicable across diverse groups
  of invertebrates and microbes. The intent is to inventory a diversity of
  organisms from different soils as soon as possible. Therefore, organize
  a workshop to determine, recommend and publicize standardized approaches
  for sampling, extracting and identifying soil taxa across ecosystem regimes.</LI>
  <LI>Provide resources for synthesis of a comprehensive manual for soil
  ecologists and taxonomists, combining a number of recent protocols and
  handbooks, as well as some of the older protocols. Assure that the manual
  is available in tropical countries for training purposes.</LI>
  <LI>Develop ways to incorporate an ecological approach to taxonomy to ensure
  that the skills of taxonomists will be supported by long term funding.
  New students as well as current researchers should be provided with the
  resources to build a new interdisciplinary discipline of taxonomy and ecology,
  that will enhance the knowledge of species and address the critical problems
  regarding loss of species.</LI>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS</FONT></P>

<OL>
  <LI>We recommend the initiation and establishment of a world-wide program
  consisting of a multi-site network for monitoring and working with global
  biodiversity of soils. The long term research network will provide, in
  a focused manner, the connections of soil taxa to sustainability, to economics
  and valuation of soils, to education, to the biosphere and to theoretical
  biology. The network will contribute on a global scale to understanding
  the relationship of the diversity of soil organisms to the diversity of
  life, to the discovery of ways in which the soil biota are unique, and
  will tell us about biological phenomena in a general, comparative way.</LI>
  <LI>We recommend that the priority investigations of soil global biodiversity
  in the multi-site network should be experiments designed to connect and
  inter-relate ecosystem processes to taxonomic studies (soil all taxa biotic
  inventories). The experiments should provide a common focus for multi-site,
  integrated, interdisciplinary, collaborative, and international work.</LI>
  <LI>We recommend two experiments that were discussed and outlined at the
  workshop, carbon flux and decomposition, as examples of initial experiments
  that would capture the linkage between a soil all taxa biotic inventory
  and ecosystem processes. We suggest that these two experiments be conducted
  as a package experiment in as many sites as possible. As an additional
  experiment, we recommend that all taxa biotic inventories be conducted
  in soil depth profiles at a few selected sites to relate pedogenesis and
  the distribution of soil chemical and physical factors to soil taxa.<BR>
  <BR>
  We believe these two processes, carbon flux and decomposition, represent
  excellent models for examining how an ecosystem process determines or is
  driven by the composition of the soil biota. Specifically, the experiments
  chosen are model processes for exploring the relationship of soil biodiversity
  and ecosystem function because: (1) the experiiments are major processes
  common to all ecosystems; (2) the processes involve a diversity of soil
  biota, from microbes to earthworms; (3) C and N flux and decomposition
  are dynamic processes that occur across varying spatial scales and involve
  different taxa at different periods of time (succession); (4) the study
  of these processes and their relationship to biotic diversity requires
  a range of expertise across disciplines and involves many kinds of technology;
  (5) previous research has established the major features of the processes
  and their controls; (6) hypotheses on the relationship of the soil biota
  to ecosystem function remain poorly explored, and are presently limited
  to a few groups of organisms; and (7) the links between ecosystem vegetation
  type/diversity and the diversity/type of soil biota are best explored at
  sites dedicated to long term ecological research, where a good deal of
  baseline, historical, ecosystem and biotic knowledge has already been achieved.
  <BR>
  <BR>
  Specific criteria for selection of sites should include: well-characterized
  soil systems typical of the ecosystem and preferably where GIS grids are
  established; historic data bases on vegetation and previous land management;
  ongoing and future environmental monitoring; and limited public access
  to the long term experiments.</LI>
  <LI>We recommend the formation of a multi-disciplinary task force to address
  new approaches for identifying soil biota, using the new technologies.
  This could be initially be implemented by interchanging suggestions for
  technology through Internet following advertisements placed in Science,
  Nature and other journals.</LI>

  biotic databases and to participate in a cross-site synthesis/comparison.
  Analyze and interpret existing comprehensive data on soil biodiversity
  from a limited number of well-described sites. The purpose of this initial
  study would be to identify trends with which to formulate/develop hypotheses
  and plan the next stage of biodiversity/ecological research at particular
  sites. Additional information compiled would be valuable in any inventory
  work.</LI>
  <LI>At a workshop, present synthesized cross-site information, identify
  gaps in knowledge and establish hypotheses. Formulate research plans for
  investigating the relationship between soil biota inventories and ecosystem
  processes (e.g., carbon flux and decomposition experiments) at particular
  sites. Publish results in print and electronic form. </LI>
  <LI>Establish a small working group to design a generalized study of the
  relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem processes of carbon flux
  and decomposition. This should include the scientific rationale, experimental
  approach(es) and outline of appropriate methods to investigate both biodiversity
  and the processes selected.</LI>

<A NAME="problem"></A><FONT SIZE=+3>THE PROBLEM</FONT></P>

<P>Soils are a critical and dynamic center for the majority of ecosystem
processes in both natural and managed ecosystems. Nutrient turnover, nutrient
uptake by plants, soil fertility, formation of soil organic matter, nitrogen
fixation, methane production, CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT> production, soil
development, and production of organic acids that weather rocks, are all
dynamic processes contributing to the sustainability of the planet. Soils
are the major global storage reservoir for carbon in the form of organic
matter (estimates of about 1500 X 10x15 gC are stored in soils). The living
microbes, fungi and invertebrates that comprise the soil food web are responsible
for changing carbon and nitrogen through several steps of decomposition
to forms available for plant growth, while at the same time contributing
to the rate of production and consumption of CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>, methane,
and nitrogen. The annual flux of CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT> that returns to
the atmosphere as a result of decomposition and other soil processes amounts
to approximately 68 X 10x15 gC/yr (Schlesinger, 1991). Global modifications
that alter the balance of the carbon fluxes, such as land use and climate
change, also affect the spatial and temporal distribution of ecosystem resources,
and impact not only vegetation diversity and landscape vegetation patterns,
but the soils and soil biota involved in processes such as decomposition
and the rate of release of greenhouse gases.<BR>
<BR>
Soils, like water and air, are natural resources that unify terrestrial
ecosystems, and which, like water and air, are being degraded by humans.
We have caused soil pollution, ground water contamination and erosion, human
impacts resulting in a loss of carbon and nutrients from the soil. These
actions are taken without knowing how resilient and stable the soils or
the ecosystem processes will be in different environments. Today, scientists
realize that soil is not just a &quot;buffer&quot;. Instead, the soil, including
the transition zone between surface soil and groundwater (Marmonier et.
al., 1993; Stanford and Ward, 1992) and between soil and aquatic habitats,
and the soil biota within these diverse habitats, are all interlocking components
interacting with vegetation and climate and necessary for the functioning
of terrestrial ecosystems. <BR>
<BR>
Despite some knowledge of how soil organisms maintain critical processes
such as carbon storage and nutrient cycling and influence plant species
diversity (Huston, 1993), or how soil organisms participate in forming soil
structure, the organisms themselves remain a &quot;black box&quot; in our
understanding of how soil systems function. Without accurate knowledge of
soil biodiversity, the structure and interactions of the soil organism community,
and the relationship of soil biology to ecological processes, management
of ecosystems, and the models of ecosystem functioning upon which management
is based, will always be less than rigorously understood. <BR>
<BR>
The biodiversity in soils is structured into food chains and webs which
are important determinants of ecosystem function (Heal et al., 1994; Hendrix
et al, 1986; Moore and de Ruiter, 1991). The soil food webs are also the
basis of food supply for food chains above-ground, for example, small mammals.
A few experiments have indicated that a loss of biodiversity can diminish
the functioning of ecosystem processes (Verhoef and Brussaard, 1990). That
anthropogenic activities can decrease soil biodiversity is well-documented,
particularly in the fauna of agroecosystems, where the addition of fertilizers
increases plant productivity but masks the importance of soil biota in providing
available nutrients to plants. Complimentary evidence from experiments has
shown that increases in biodiversity can enhance plant growth, nutrient
mineralization and resistance to stress (Clarholm, 1989; Couteaux et al.,
1991; Elliott et al., 1979; Lavelle et al., 1992). Even after human disturbance,
soil biodiversity generally is greater than above-ground diversity. Species
composition within soil food webs may change due to this disturbance, making
the impact of species loss more difficult to determine. <BR>
<BR>
Few of the soil organisms can be identified to species. Why is there so
little information on key soil species and their ecological roles in maintaining
the functioning of ecosystems? Why can't all species in a soil habitat be
identified? Some of the reasons are: (1) the soil is an opaque medium and
the in situ identification of most organisms is impractical; (2) organisms
in the soil represent a number of phyla (microbes to earthworms) making
interactions and ecological roles difficult to assess; (3) organisms range
in size from microscopic to macroscopic, and morphology within a taxon can
vary throughout the life cycle; (4) the methods for extracting many microorganisms,
fungi and mesofauna from soils have not been determined and techniques for
culturing them are not developed, presenting problems for identification
and enumeration; (5) lack of emphasis on soil taxa as resources and as critical
parts of ecosystem function has contributed to the extinction of systematists
who can identify the organisms involved in critical roles in soil; (6) the
temporal and spatial scale of their habitat (soil particles to landscape)
varies with the organism; and (7) the taxa of soil food webs change with
the physico-chemical environment, the quality of organic matter, climate
and geography, resulting in few comparisons of the ecological roles of soil
taxa in different ecosystems. Currently, due to the difficulties enumerated
above, many of the ecological roles of soil biota are attributed to trophic
groups, or groups of species with similar morphology, not to species. Consequently,
our science has limited ability to apply knowledge for the management of
soil biodiversity to promote the sustainability of soil quality. Therefore,
for the soil system, it is essential and urgent that we establish the cause
and effect relationships between the loss of species and the impact on terrestrial
and global ecosystem processes. <BR>
<BR>
The greatest barriers to research in soil biology are methodological. Sampling
and identification methods are taxon-specific, and many techniques are in
their developmental infancy. There is no single extraction or collection
method that will quantitatively extract or collect all soil organisms, or
even one phylum. The scientist chooses a sampling and extraction method
based on the experimental question, the soil habitat, and the scientific
knowledge of method limitations. The status of techniques for the identification
of taxa has advanced in the past 5-10 years with molecular methods, but
still, there is no single method for identification of the members of a
phylum. <BR>
<BR>
The present taxonomic knowledge of soil biota has been recently summarized
(Groombridge, 1992; Hawksworth and Ritchie, 1993; O'Donnell et al., 1994;
Systematics Agenda 2000, 1994). In general, our knowledge of species distribution,
abundance, population structures, and ecological roles and requirements
are poorly known or understood. The status of identification and ecological
roles of the soil biota, by size, could be assessed as follows:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Larger soil fauna (invertebrates) -- these can be collected quantitatively
  and qualitatively from soils, many may be identified to species and their
  ecological roles are known in general. These roles include: (a) Direct
  processors of organic matter (e.g., snails, earthworms, enchytraeid worms,
  woodlice, millipedes, silverfish, bristletails, termites), (b) Predaceous
  regulators (e.g., spiders, centipedes, true bugs, carabid beetles, ants),
  (c) Secondary consumers (e.g., springtails, mites, other beetles), (d)
  Creators of soil structure (earthworms, millipedes, termites, and many
  members of other categories). Taxa that cannot currently be reliably identified
  include: enchytraeid worms, many mites, larval beetles and flies, parasitic
  wasps and bark lice. Knowledge of these soil organisms varies dramatically
  with locale. Only a few locations have well described invertebrates.</LI>
  <LI>Micro- and Mesofauna (invertebrates) -- assays vary in the ability
  to quantitatively and qualitatively extract these organisms from the soil.
  Knowledge of the ecological functions of this group is generally lacking.
  Many are predators, consumers of bacteria and fungi, and are involved in
  regulating the rate of decomposition. Springtails (Collembola) and other
  insects appear to have a reasonable base of taxonomic specialists although
  in some taxa, only one or two such individuals may exist. However, reliable
  identifications may be impossible or difficult to obtain for many groups
  of protozoa, rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes and mites. There are few
  molecular methods available for these diverse taxa, and their ecological
  roles are based primarily on trophic group estimates of their ecological
  function in ecosystem processes. </LI>
  <LI>Microbes -- advancements over the past 10 years have been substantial
  and additional methods are available for the assessment of bacterial and
  fungal biodiversity. However, each method suffers from technical or interpretative
  limitations, and no single method provides an unequivocal estimate of bacterial
  or fungal diversity. Species that can be identified by culture techniques
  or visual techniques are not necessarily important in situ. There are &quot;indirect
  methods&quot; that can be used to correlate diversity with processes between
  sites, and once their relationship to a process is shown, &quot;direct&quot;
  and new methods could be used to determine species diversity. Some of the
  methods for bacterial diversity presently include chemosystematic-based
  determinations of taxon-specific cellular constituents (fatty acids, sterols,
  secondary compounds, proteins, etc.), nucleic acid based approaches [whole
  community nucleic-acid hybridization, community DNA reassociation kinetics,
  and cloning and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified
  16sRNA gene sequences from community DNA samples] and nucleic-acid function-based
  methods such as hybridization of probes to genes (potential function) or
  mRNA (expressed function) unique to particular enzymatic activities. Traditional
  morphological methods combined with molecular identifications provide important
  tools for the assessment of fungal diversity. As with bacteria, assays
  of fungal chemical diversity (e.g., enzymatic and chemosystematically important
  cellular constituents) and new technology can contribute to identification.

<P><BR>
Integrated projects to assess soil biodiversity have been suggested at many
scientific levels, but efforts have been generally targeted to conservation
efforts of disappearing habitats. The following is not a comprehensive list,
but illustrates the breadth and global consensus for increasing the priorities
for research in soil system function and soil biodiversity. <BR>
<BR>
In 1980, a National Research Council Report (Research Priorities in Tropical
Biology) noted, &quot;A comprehensive understanding of ecosystems must ultimately
depend on basic knowledge of the organisms that make up these systems.&quot;
The report stressed the need for resources to advance knowledge on soil
biota. A National Science Foundation LTER-sponsored Workshop on Systematics
and Ecology of Soil Organisms outlined the need for joint research efforts
on soil biota (Corvallis, OR, 1985). The Hungarian Society for Soil Science
dedicated a conference to Soil Biology and the Conservation of the Biosphere
(Szegi, 1984). In 1989, the National Science Board of the National Science
Foundation (Loss of Biological Diversity: A Global Crisis Requiring International
Solutions) emphasized soil biodiversity as an immediate focus for international
collaborative research. A National Research Council Report (1993) noted
that &quot;Our lack of knowledge of microorganisms and invertebrates, which
are estimated to make up as much as 88% of all species, seriously hampers
our ability to understand and manage ecosystems.&quot; USA federal research
efforts such as the National Biological Survey (NBS), the Long Term Ecological
Research (LTER), the Environmental Protection Agency's EMAP, the USDA's
Soil Conservation Service, the USDA Forest Service, the USDA Experiment
Stations and the US Geological Survey, have been suggested as means to increase
research and understanding of soil biodiversity. More recent international
workshops (International Conference on Soil Resilience and Sustainable Land
Use, October 1992, Hungary; Soil Biodiversity, Soil Ecology Society Meetings,
April 1993, Michigan, USA; Beyond the Biomass, Compositional and Functional
Analysis of Soil Microbial Communities, March, 1993, Wye, England; Scientific
Committee on Problems of the Environment, Program on the Ecosystem Function
of Biodiversity, March, 1994, California, USA) have concluded that priority
efforts of soil research should be to understand the functional roles of
the diverse but poorly understood below-ground organisms. These reports
have recognized the connection of the below-ground biota to sustaining the
function of our biosphere and to solving the ecological problems related
to soil systems (Groombridge, 1992; Hawksworth and Ritchie, 1993; National
Research Council, 1993). </P>

<A NAME="critical"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>CRITICAL AREAS OF RESEARCH<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P>We have concluded from discussions at the workshop that the best way
to identify and develop an understanding of how the diverse soil taxa operate
in ecosystems is to coordinate studies of inventories of soil taxa and selected
ecosystem processes. We propose these studies occur across a network of
intensive and extensive sites that are presently funded as long term research
sites in different ecosystems and countries. It is necessary to focus initially
on comparative studies on these few sites and processes because of the considerable
expenditures required and the limited number of scientists that could reasonably
become involved. We suggest that this research needs to link scientists
internationally in many disciplines and agencies, since a critical mass
of expertise for identifying all the soil biota does not appear to exist
in any one nation. <BR>
<A NAME="experiments"></A><BR>
EXPERIMENTS<BR>
<BR>
The two ecosystem process experiments prioritized for detailed biotic inventories
are addressed here as separate experiments, but are, in fact, best executed
as linked so that maximum detailed results can be obtained for minimal costs.
They address key issues that were discussed during the workshop, and have
as strengths the incorporation of many of the recommendations of both systematists
and ecologists. <BR>
<BR>
We have concluded that two processes, carbon and nitrogen flux and decomposition,
represent excellent models and experiments for examining how ecosystem processes
determine and are related to the composition of the soil biota. Carbon flux
would represent an experiment of a whole process (C transformation in soils)
that could be conducted with the decomposition experiment at a few intensive
sites. Decomposition is an important component of the carbon transformation
in soils, and would be an experiment that could be conducted both with C
flux at the intensive sites and singly at a wide range of extensive sites.
<BR>
<BR>
Carbon flux is the measure of the exchange of carbon as gaseous CO<FONT
 SIZE=-3>2</FONT> between ecosystems and the atmosphere, and the balance
between photosynthesis by vegetation, and respiration by animals, plants
and microbes. All the major &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; (CH<FONT SIZE=-3>4</FONT>,
N<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>O, CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>) are to a large extent
produced and/or absorbed by the soil, depending on the environmental conditions.
More importantly, their production (CH<FONT SIZE=-3>4</FONT>, N<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>O)
or absorption (CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT> via plants or algae) in soil is
biologically mediated by the soil biota. Similarly, nitrogen can be measured
as it changes forms during nitrogen cycling and is released to the atmosphere.
Carbon flux would represent an experiment of a whole process that could
be conducted with the decomposition experiment at a few intensive sites.<BR>
<BR>
Decomposition is viewed as an integrative process involving all taxa, and
inevitably involving nutrient cycles (C, N, S, P, etc.). The organisms responsible
for decomposition of litter in soils respire CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>, and
thus play an important part in the global carbon balance. The process of
organic matter decomposition [the cascade from plant litter to resistant
soil organic matter (SOM)] is dependent on three factors as noted in the
OPQ triangle (Swift, Heal and Anderson, 1979): Organisms (O), Physico-chemical
environment (P), and the chemical composition or Quality of the organic
matter (Q). It is well recognized that the variation in Q determines the
rate of decomposition and the composition of the biota. When the quality
of the litter has a low C/N, fast decomposition of litter is mediated by
fast growing organisms (r-selection). When litter has a high C/N quality,
K-selection of organisms occurs and the decomposition is slow. Therefore,
the biodiversity of soil organisms is determined by the quality of organic
matter input to soil, and that in turn is dependent on the composition of
the vegetation. Thus there is a link between the diversity (and type) of
vegetation and the diversity (and type) of decomposers through litter quality.
<BR>
<BR>
These processes were selected as models for which experiments can be designed
to explore the relationship of soil biodiversity (a soil all taxa biotic
inventory) and ecosystem function for reasons addressed in the Executive
Summary. In addition, (1) hypotheses on the relationship of the soil biota
to ecosystem function remain to be explored, and are presently limited to
particular groups of organisms; (2) the link of ecosystem vegetation type
and diversity to the diversity and type of soil biota provides relevance
and logic to an inventory on sites of long term ecosystem research; (3)
decomposition and carbon flux experiments could be coupled to trace gas
emissions and global climate change experiments on many sites; and (4) the
historical database which exists for decomposition and carbon flux, and
the well developed methods for analysis of these processes would form a
firm foundation for the application and testing of new technologies as well
as for interpretation of these processes on soil biodiversity.<BR>
<BR>
These experiments have similar requirements:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Implementation at sites with well-described soil systems, preferably
  where GIS grids are established; sites should have historic data bases
  on previous land management, ongoing and future environmental monitoring,
  limited public access to the long term experiments (site security), and
  preferably, data of existing soil biota.</LI>
  <LI>Involvement of biologists (microbiologists, molecular biologists, zoologists,
  systematists, ecologists, botanists and physiologists), soil chemists,
  soil physicists, geologists, hydrologists, modelers and information management
  specialists, would enhance planning. Cross-training to increase participants'
  knowledge base of methodological procedures and priorities would be promoted.</LI>
  <LI>Inclusion of taxonomists and biologists for continued and lasting connectivity
  between the taxonomic and process components of the experiments.</LI>
  <LI>Detailed inventory of soil biological diversity at sites varying in
  climatic and plant species diversity (e.g., varying organic matter (Q)uality
  and (P)hysico-chemical environment).</LI>
  <LI>Quantitative assessment of the role of neglected taxa and encouragement
  of increased attention to the systematics of these groups.</LI>
  <LI>Deposition and preservation of voucher specimens and/or other biological
  materials (e.g., DNA samples). This will require that the culture collection
  centers and the museums are involved at an early stage and necessary preservation
  protocols are followed or developed. </LI>

EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGIES<BR>
<A NAME="integrated"></A><BR>
<I>The Integrated Biodiversity and Function Experiments<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>1. The soil biodiversity and decomposition experiment</B></P>

<P>The experiment was selected by workshop participants as one of the priorities
because it is a major process occurring in all ecosystems involving a wide
range of taxa. Besides ecosystem processes, this experiment could be particularly
useful in identifying indicator groups involved in sustainability or for
monitoring environmental perturbation, since the key species would be associated
with the main functions of the decomposition process. We suggest that a
model for this experiment should be the successful and ongoing US LTER Long-term
Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET) that compares decomposition
rates and the changing chemical status of the same quantities and types
of organic matter at many ecosystems of differing climates. A comparable
experiment was undertaken in a transect across a number of European countries
in the Decomposition (DECO) project, and across Canada with the Canadian
Intersite Decomposition Experiment (CIDET). However, the succession of soil
taxa involved in decomposition were not measured as part of LIDET, DECO
or CIDET. Our experimental strategy would be to incorporate a new decomposition
experiment in climatically different ecosystems to allow temporal and spatial
monitoring of soil biota as decomposition of selected standard organic matter
substrates proceeds. A coordinated effort in identifying the succession
of organisms as the residues decompose will relate the taxa to the decomposition
process. <BR>
<BR>
The major questions addressed by this experiment are: (1) How does quality
of organic matter influence soil biodiversity in different climatic regimes?
(2) How are soil taxa linked to decomposition processes and the physico-chemical
environment spatially and temporally? (3) To what extent does the structure
of the soil community influence decomposition processes and are similar
functions performed by different taxa in different environments?<BR>
<BR>
We suggest that a few initial sites be selected for intensive analysis of
the soil biota. Sites with a base of, and present taxonomic experience and
knowledge of soil organisms would be good initial sites for an intensive
study, but must also have ongoing environmental monitoring, soil characterization
and other criteria listed previously. The ECN and LTER sites are suggested
as fulfilling these criteria. The experimental framework would be established
by scientists following analyses of databases on decomposition and soil
taxa at selected sites (see Timeline). Similar protocols and procedures
would necessarily be used at each of the sites. The types of measurements,
the standardized organic materials to be distributed for the decomposition
experiment, the time frame for sampling and the methods for inventorying
the organisms and decomposition process, will need to be agreed upon by
participants before setting up the intensive site experiments. The standard
quantities of organic matter will be placed in litter bags, which are sealed
mesh screen envelopes (Anderson and Ingram, 1993). The mesh size selected
for the different bags will exclude organisms of different sizes; thus,
all soil biota could be included, or just the smaller invertebrates and
microbes. We propose that an all taxa biotic inventory of soil biota (ATBI)
should occur as related to mass loss of the standard organic resources distributed
at each of the sites. Organisms that cannot be identified quickly will be
catalogued and preserved according to the process agreed upon by the participants
in the experiment. </P>

<P><BR>
<B>2. The soil biodiversity and carbon and nitrogen flux experiment</B></P>

<P>The main approaches of these experiments will be to manipulate the biodiversity
and observe the effect on C and N fluxes, manipulate the C and N fluxes
and observe the effects on biodiversity, and disrupt the system and observe
the consequences on both biodiversity and C and N fluxes.<BR>
<BR>
The major questions addressed by this experiment are: (1) How does soil
biodiversity affect the carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes? Related to
this is, how do the magnitudes of carbon and nitrogen flux through the soil
sub-system and how does organic matter quality (Q) affect the diversity
and structure of soil organisms? (2) Is spatial distribution of the soil
taxa dependent on the quality and quantity of carbon and nitrogen inputs
in addition to their placement?, and (3) What is the relationship between
biodiversity and resilience in soils? Does biodiversity change as soil systems
recover from disturbance? What are meaningful measures of resilience?<BR>
<BR>
We suggest that the measurement of carbon and nitrogen fluxes through the
soil biota should be followed using stable isotopes (Table 1). For this
approach to work, experimental sites must be selected where plant communities
are dominated by either C3 or C4 species, such as exist in temperate grassland
ecosystems. We suggest that both disturbed (agroecosystems) and natural
sites (containing multiple species) be compared at each location. For example,
use of ecosystems in the US and the UK would allow us to test the generality
of the observed phenomena. <BR>
<BR>
We do not intend to dictate a specific experimental design without more
discussion and analysis of the one year synthesis at a future workshop as
noted in the suggested timeline. At present, we propose an outlined experiment
that, in our collective discussion of experimental options, appeared to
address the workshop priorities. We have concluded that treatments should
incorporate a realistic series of manipulations so that we may observe the
impact of disturbance on soil biotic structure and function, and on changes
in carbon and nitrogen fluxes and movement. Manipulations could include:
(1) application of one or more biocides, which would remove or reduce selected
taxa. Candidate biocides are insecticides, nematicides, fungicides, antibiotics
and other metabolic inhibitors that have some degree of taxonomic specificity.
Although there are limitations to this technique, it has been used successfully
to determine changes in soil foodwebs and ecosystem properties. This treatment
could also be used to investigate the resilience of the soil system if the
treatments were applied over the long term; (2) removal of grass litter
(following mowing) from one set of plots and its addition to others; and
(3) application of a pollutant (e.g., a heavy metal, which we do not condone
but use as an example of the type of manipulation) which would affect most
taxa. An intensive study of litter decomposition would be possible within
this overall experimental design, concentrating on food webs, the particular
role of different groups of microorganisms and the differential spatial
distribution of fungi compared to bacteria. Plant sequestration of carbon
is almost universally aided by mycorrhizal fungi, a group that needs substantial
attention by systematists and biologists.<BR>
<BR>
Experiments will necessarily be designed for long term use to effectively
measure changes in carbon and nitrogen fluxes and detect changes in soil
biodiversity. We suggest that these studies be set up sequentially, with
the first phase lasting approximately two years so that we may obtain an
inventory of organisms and to establish their patterns of distribution and
movement within the soil. The second phase would establish manipulation
treatments for three to four years, with half the biocide plots released
from treatment after 1 year and allowed to recover. The third part of the
experiment would last two years or more, allowing all plots to recover so
that we may measure resilience by following the change in biodiversity and
concomitant dynamics of C and N fluxes. During this final phase, biodiversity
will again be assessed to determine if species loss is related to key ecosystem
processes. If appropriate, additional funding could be sought to extend
this recovery period. <BR>
<BR>
As with the decomposition experiment, similar protocols must be used at
the intensive sites within each country for the C and N flux experiment.
We anticipate that novel and improved methods that combine enumeration with
chemical and isotopic analysis will be required for some groups of organisms
so that we may observe the interrelationship between population dynamics
and flux of C and N. Table 1 shows 1) the taxa to be identified for both
the C-N flux and decomposition experiments, 2) the techniques available
for their characterization, and 3) the level of information on carbon flux
within each group:<BR>

Movement of tracers through the components of the ecosystem (including the
soil taxa) would be followed after the application of a single, strong pulse
of isotopically distinct CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT> by fumigation using FACE
technology and of 15N (topical application as NO3). A source of CO<FONT
 SIZE=-3>2</FONT>, that offers the maximum contrast with the isotope signal
of the existing vegetation and organic matter should be selected. The isotope
should be assayed as it occurs within individual taxa. Isotope loss by respiration
and leaching should also be measured. The resolution to which individual
taxa can be used for stable isotope measurements of carbon flux has yet
to be determined. It will certainly be feasible for more abundant and important
taxa, and even where individual taxa cannot be assayed separately, it will
be possible to relate ecological processes to the overall diversity of the
soil trophic network. Measurement of carbon flux within microbial taxa may
require the development of novel techniques. For example, gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry can be used to identify the isotopic content of species-specific
molecules. The stable isotope method is precise, accurate and safe, but
ultimately limits the scale of the experiment to the maximum area for which
it is practical to fumigate with CO<FONT SIZE=-3>2</FONT>. Grasslands are
preferred to forest, since the isotope will enter process pathways quickly,
and since fumigation is feasible with current technology.<BR>

<h2><li><strong><a name="philosophy">PHILOSOPHY</a>:<br></h2>
<h4> The Hunterdon Central Regional High School is a compre-
hensive high school actively concerned with the development of
complete individuals. To further define this purpose, that is to
give it direction and range, as well as boundaries, the following
statements have been set down as guides for decision-making.<p>
Since each serves uniquely to complement the whole, no attempt
has been made to arrange them on a scale of relative importance.
The result of the harmonious interplay of these four ideas is the
Hunterdon Central Regional High School philosophy:<br><p></strong></h4>


<li>  Each individual has the right to be guided to as much
education as he/she is able and willing to obtain. Each indi-
vidual has the responsibility to develop himself/herself
as a human being to the extent that will most benefit
him/her and the society in which he/she lives.<br><p>


<li> The function of education is in essence the same for every
individual; it is to prepare each, whatever the scope of
his/her abilities and aspirations, to make the wisest deci-
sions of which he/she is potentially capable.<br><p>

<li> Each individual, to make the most of his/her life and to
make wise decisions concerning it, needs a variety of
intellectual, moral, physical, social, aesthetic and the
development of the intellectual ability of the individual,
but in a democratic society the school must also participate
with the home and the community at large in the
development of other attributes which, in combination
with his/her intellect, make an individual truly whole.<br><p>

 <li> A good school is people working and growing together-
 pupils, teachers, administrators, parents and community
members. No school can be better than the people in it;
no people can be greater than the ideas that govern its
operation. These two philosophic principles are the main-
springs of a good school.<br><br><hr>

Welcome to the Student Area.  It is here that you will find  information relating to students at Hunterdon Central.  There are currently three areas of student involvement on the Web at Central.  As you will see, a great amount of work and effort has gone into each of these endeavors.

<HTML><TITLE>Underneath Hunterdon </TITLE>
<body background="/gif/backgrnd.jpg" >
<center><H1>Underneath Hunterdon</H1>
<H4> by Paul Ransavage</H4></center><HR>

       The changing of the seasons, the shedding
of the leaves, the loss of the  <a href="gif/color.gif"><B>Earth's colors</B></a> create
a feeling.  Its akin to the removal of a cosmetic
layer: the Earth stripping away a face it has worn
for the summer to display its underlying form and
structure.  Greens, yellows, and reds in all their
fullness and bloom are gone to be replaced by a
stark barrenness.<P>
Change.  The one thing this planet has never stopped doing. 
 But it is the form underneath that interests me.  In science its
called geology, a subject that often brings forth
visions of rock collections and oil-wells.  However
it is much more than that.  A Sunday drive along
a back road, a hike along a <a href="gif/stream.gif"> <B>favorite stream</B></a>, a walk
in the woods and one cannot help but wonder
how the landscape of Hunterdon County was
shaped and molded.  Has it always been like this? 
What was this County like before human eyes
were to see it?  What kinds of life have walked,
lived and died on this ground?  What events have
occurred to produce the hills and valleys we see
each day?  Somehow these questions seem more
real as winter approaches.<P>
       Studying the Earth's form is made easier by
cuts, scars, and openings which will expose even
more.  Water does this naturally, man does it
deeper and faster.  Road cuts, quarries, railroads...
all expose what is underneath and offer an insight
into geologic history.<P>
       An excellent path to travel in exploring the
County's geology is Highway 29 from Stockton to
Milford and then the <a href="gif/narrow.gif"><B>Narrows' Road</B></a> north to
Holland.  Here one can discover and explore the
clues man has exposed of the hidden Earth.<P>
       Just north of the <a href="gif/church.gif"><B>small church</B></a> in Holland
are a number of tree and bush covered hills.  The
rock there, called <a href="gif/gneiss.gif"><B>gneiss</B></a>, is old.  It is the
basement rock of Hunterdon County, the
foundation all the rest is built on - formed over
600 million years ago before any higher life forms
existed on this planet.  It speaks of endless ages
of mountain-building and erosion.  It has
experienced the entire spectrum of the evolution
of life, from algae to man.<P>
       South of Holland, just past where the road
narrows for the first time along the steep cliffs of
the  <a href="gif/river.gif"><B>Delaware River</B></a>, there is a short trail that leads to an
outstanding sight - a natural <a href="gif/grotto.gif"><B>grotto</B></a> with a small
waterfalls perhaps forty feet high.  The rock is
different, very different. It is composed of
fist-sized pebbles and stones cemented together to
form layer after layer - named <a href="gif/conglom.gif"><B>conglomerate</B></a>.  The rock is much younger
than the rock in Holland.  It is about 200 million
years old - formed when dinosaurs were in their
early evolution and just beginning to dominate
the planet.  The rock was formed by land and
rock slides that descended from steep cliffs
formed by huge breaks in the earth's crust known
as faults.  This was a time of upheaval and
mountain-building.  The Ramapo fault with its
infrequent trembles and earthquakes, serves as a
reminder of this time in geologic history.<P>
       To keep the sequence sensible, progressing
from the oldest rock to the newest, drive south to
Stockton.  Just north of Stockton lies an active
quarry.  The rock here is a  <a href="gif/sandston.gif"><B>sandstone</B></a> that is
rough to one's touch.  This rock, like the one in
the grotto and the others to follow, is 200 million
years old, formed during the  Triassic time period. 
Fast-flowing streams deposited the sand here -
streams that had their origin in mountains that no
longer exist.  Here in Stockton that same sand
was buried, compacted, and squeezed to form
Stockton sandstone, the " <a href="gif/brown.gif"><B>brownstone</B></a>" that was
used to build in New York City.<P>
       Farther north along Route 29, near Tumble
Falls, huge masses of rock stick out of the ground
at angles of ten degrees or more.  They seem to
be pointing to some far off place.  The rock is
hard and difficult to break.  Its name is  <a href="gif/argil.gif"><B>argillite</B></a>, a
type of compacted shale.  This rock has been
formed in shallow lakes, ponds, and swamps that
existed in this area.  Fossilized mud-cracks can be
seen everywhere, <a href="gif/mudcrack.gif"><B> mud-cracks</B></a> that mark ancient
shorelines, shore lines where dinosaurs waded in
the mud and muck.<P>
       Just a mile or so farther north is the Devil's
Teatable.  High above the river it peers down on
its surroundings, a monument to erosion.  But
erosion has not yet won for the Teatable and
nearly one-third of Hunterdon County is
dominated by the rock found here - <a href="gif/shale.gif"><B> Brunswick
shale</B></a>.  This shale was the last of the great Triassic
sedimentary rocks to form and is composed of
unimaginable amounts of clay that in some places
formed a rock structure over 9,000 feet thick, It is
simply impossible to gauge the formation of this
rock in terms of lives and years.  Endless streams
for seemingly endless amounts of time washing
sediment into a basin that extended in part from
Connecticut to Alabama.<P>
       A good example of the County's last rock
formation is near the river village of Byram.  Here
is a  <a href="gif/byram.gif"><B>bow-shaped outcrop</B></a> with none of the
markings that one has seen on the other rocks. 
This rock is different - fire-formed, an igneous
rock.  It is a gray rock with small crystals barely
visible to the eye formed from magma flows that
ate their way along fault lines towards the earth's
surface.  Here in Byram one flow slowed, cooled,
and hardened to form this rock called  <a href="gif/diabase.gif"><B>diabase. </B></a>
Across the river in Pennsylvania the diabase is
even more unusual forming a geologic feature
known as the "ringing rocks".  Rocks so hard and
resistant to erosion that they ring when struck
with a hammer.  Thus a drive through the County
will reveal six <a href="gif/strat.gif"><B>major rock layers</B></a>.<P>
       The question arises how is it possible to
view each separate formation.  The answer is
simple.  The Earth does not rest comfortably with
these structures so thick and widespread on its
surface.  Throughout their formation it would
periodically buck and break, pushing up here,
depressing there - movements that have caused
each of these rock units to  <a href="gif/outcrop.gif"><B>pierce the surface</B></a> and
show itself to man; there today for all of us to
see.
 <P>      The seasons change and the rocks that are
here today erode to form new stuff for the
mountains and valleys of new generations.  New
mysteries for new minds to unravel.

  <HR>  <A NAME="hunterdon"><B>Hunterdon County</B></A> lies within two of
the four major physiographic provinces
in New Jersey; the Highlands and the
Piedmont.  The Piedmont is located in
the southern two-thirds of the county
and has two main elements, including
the Hunterdon Plateau and the Raritan
Valley Lowland.  The plateau is
underlain primarily by dense argillite
and hard shale, and reaches its
greatest elevation, nearly 900 feet,
about one mile south of Pattenburg,
sloping gently southeastward from the
Highlands.
<P>
    The Raritan Valley is east of the
Hunterdon Plateau.  It is a low rolling
plain, sloping gently southeastward
from an elevation of 200-300 feet near
the plateau to 100-200 feet near the
Hunterdon- Somerset County border.  A
number of ridges and isolated hills,
underlain by highly resistant igneous 
rock, rise several hundred feet above
the softer shale and sandstone of the
Raritan-Valley Lowland.  The highest of
these ridges, Cushetunk Mountain rises
about 500 feet above the plain and 834
feet above sea level.
<P>
    The New Jersey Highlands are a
portion of the Reading Prong of the New
England Province.  This province
consists of several flattopped ridges
separated by narrow deep valleys.
Valleys within the Highlands are
underlain-by more easily eroded
limestones and shales, while the ridges
are composed of more resistant igneous
and metamorphic rock.  The average
elevation of the ridges is between
800-1000 feet above sea level.  Except
where they merge with the Hunterdon
Plateau in the western part of the
county, the Highlands rise abruptly
above the Piedmont.  

<H3><A NAME="pre-cambrian">Pre-Cambrian</A> Period</H3>
The oldest rocks
in the county were originally
sedimentary rocks deposited in a sea
and later altered by a process called
metamorphism.  Deep beneath the earth's
surface, heat and pressure caused the
rock to be folded, faulted, and
metamorphosed.  Subsequent intrusion of
molten igneous rock into the
metamorphosed sediments caused further
alteration.  The resulting coarse
grained gneiss possess alternating
bands caused by the concentration of
dark and light minerals.
<P>
    The<B><A NAME="losee"> Losee Formation</A></B> is a complex
metamorphic rock consisting primarily
of gneiss with occasional flakes of
graphite.  Exposure of this rock today
is due to erosion of several miles of
overlying Pre-Cambrian rock during the
millions of years that followed its
deposition.
<P>
    Life during the Pre-Cambrian was
probably plentiful, but very primitive.
Most life forms were soft bodied so
that preservation was almost
impossible.  In New Jersey there is no
fossil evidence in the gneiss.
However, it is possible that the
graphite in the Losee Formation is the
metamorphosed carbon residue of organic
remains.
<P>
     At the beginning of<A NAME="cambrian"> <B>Cambrian time</B></A>,
sediments derived from the southeast
were deposited in the basin by streams
and reworked by the encroaching sea.
Currents and wave action mechanically
reduced the sediments to a uniform
size, forming a well-sorted sandstone
composed almost entirely of the
minerals quartz and feldspar.  At the
base of the formation there is a
conglomerate containing Pre-Cambrian
grains and pebbles which were
originally rock debris of the
Pre-Cambrian surface.  These sands and
gravel constitute the Hardyston
Formation.  This formation is mostly
the metamorphic rock known as
quartzite.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ordo">Ordovician Period</A></H3>
    During the latter part of the
Cambrian and the beginning of the
Ordovician Period, warm shallow seas
prevailed throughout most of the basin.
The abundant lime organisms and the
conditions of the quiet seas resulted
in the precipitation of calcium
carbonate , which formed dolomitic
sedimentary limestones called the
Kittatinny Formation.  Following uplift
and a long period of erosion, a warm
sea again invades the area, depositing
the Jacksonburg Formation, another
limestone on top of the Kittatinny
Formation.  The variety and number of
fossils found in this dark colored
limestone indicate that favorable
conditions existed at the time of
Jacksonburg deposition.
<P>
    Following this deposition, more and
more silt was deposited, cutting off
the deposition of calcium carbonate.
The deepening of the basin cut off all
deposition of the Jacksonburg limestone
and the silt continued to be
introduced.  This created a gradational
contact between the Jacksonburg
limestone and the newer sedimentary
rocks known as the Martinsburg
Formation.  The Martinsburg Formation
contains mostly sandstone and shale.
<P>
    It is likely that life existed for
100 million years before the Paleozoic
Era, but pre-Paleozoic rocks have
preserved little or no evidence of
life.  In New Jersey, the first fossil
evidence is worm tubes found in the
Hardyston Formation.  Although the New
Jersey Cambrian fossil record is scant,
over 500 species of invertebrate
(without backbone) animals have been
found in other North American rocks.
The meager N.J.  record was caused by
the prevailing type of deposition.
Generally, the seas were shallow, very
warm, and rather stagnant, producing an
environment where most animals could
not flourish.  Only a few fossils are
found in the Kittatinny Formation.  Two
of the more common are primitive types
of algae and the scaphopod Hvolithellus
micans.  When the Jacksonburg limestone
was deposited, the environment had
become very favorable for a variety of
sea organisms to live.  The limestone,
therefore, contains abundant fossil
seashells, crinoid stems, conodonts,
and bryozoa.
<P>
    The types of fossils found in the
Martinsburg Formation, combined with
their relatively rare occurrence,
indicate that this deposition was not
favorable for abundant life.
Graptolites, jellyfish like animals
with individuals living along hanging
branches, are found in the Formation.
These animals lived in an open sea near
the surface and are best preserved in a
muddy bottom.
<P>
    At the conclusion of Ordovician
time there was a period of mountain
building known as the Taconic
Disturbance.  Evidence of this
disturbance in Hunterdon County can be
seen by the folded and faulted
Paleozoic sediments.
<P>
    The Paleozoic Era came to a close
with a period of uplift known as the
Appalachian Revolution.  During this
time the PreCambrian and Paleozoic
rocks were gradually uplifted thousands
of feet, creating a mountain range
probably similar to the present day
Rocky Mountains.  After increased
uplift the seas may never again have
invaded the area underlain by these
Paleozoic rocks.  Thus, the Hunterdon
County area may have been undergoing
erosion ever since the end of the
Paleozoic Era.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="triassic">Mesozoic Era</A></H3>
    At the beginning of the Mesozoic
Era a great fault, known,as the<B><A NAME="border"> Border
Fault</A></B>, formed southeast of the New
Jersey Highlands.  The fault formed
several block mountains with basins on
either side.  These intermontane basins
were filled with sediment from the
uplifted blocks that bordered them.
The mountains have long since been
eroded away, and only parts of the
sedimentary basins have been preserved.
They occupy a belt extending from
Canada along the eastern side of the
Appalachian mountains as far south as
North Carolina.
<P>
    The sedimentary rocks of Middle and
Late Triassic time that fill these
inter-mountain basins are known as the
<A NAME="newark"><B>Newark Group</B></A>.  The group includes four
sedimentary rocks; coarse conglomerate,
sandstone, argillite, and shale.
Throughout much of the Triassic,
fast-flowing streams originating in the
nearby high mountains washed sediments
into the valleys.  Near the edge of the
valleys and basins these streams
quickly lost their velocity and
deposited their load of pebbles and
boulders.  This material accumulated in
the slowly subsiding basins forming the
<B><A NAME="hammer">Hammer Creek conglomerates</A></B>.  Boulders
up to three feet in diameter illustrate
the tremendous capacity of the streams
flowing from the high relief of the
faulted mountains.  The conglomerates
were deposited contemporaneously with
the three other Triassic sedimentary
units and interfinger.  The Hammer
Creek conglomerates have very little
economic value.
<P>
    Further into the valleys, the
streams and rivers deposited finer
sediments. Much of this early sediment
was a reddish sand.  It was derived
from the gneiss of the Highlands.  The
red color is due to the fact that the
sand is composed mainly of the mineral
feldspar.  The compaction of this sand
formed the <B><A NAME="stockton">Stockton Formation</A></B>, a
sedimentary sandstone.  At places in
the Stockton Formation, the sandstone
interfingers with shales and
conglomerates.
 <P>   
    Among the most profitable and
important contributions of Hunterdon
County in the past were its numerous
quarries of sandstone in the Stockton
Formation along the Delaware River.
The sandstone was used as a building
stone and known as "<B>brownstone</B>".  Much
of the building stone for the
"brownstone" houses of the 18th, 19th,
and early 2Oth centuries was quarried
from workings near Lambertville,
Stockton, and Byram, giving Hunterdon
County an important role in the
brownstone era.  Today, the only
building stone quarries which remain in
operation in New Jersey are those near
Stockton.
<P>
    The Triassic valleys were large
valleys into which streams and rivers
deposited coarse sand in the wet
seasons (Stockton Formations).  When
drainage from these valleys was slow or
interrupted, large lakes and swamps
were formed.  Various colored clays
were laid down.  These clays were later
compacted and now constitute the
<B><A NAME="lockatong">Lockatong Formation.</A></B>  This formation
contains the sedimentary rock
argillite.  Argillite is a
well-cemented, dense, rock type which
may be black, dark green, gray, brown,
or red.
<P>
    The Lockatong Formation is the most
fossiliferous of all of the sedimentary
rocks in the Newark Group.  In
Hunterdon County, though, fossils are
rare.  From other exposures near
Princeton, crustaceans, coelecanth
fish, sharks, reptile bones, mollusks,
and plant remains have been found.  All
of these fossils indicate that the
Lockatong Formation was deposited in an
environment of lakes and swamps.  Due
to it's hardness, the Lockatong has
been used as a road filler in various
places in the County.  Besides this, it
has little economic value.
<P>
    The fourth rock type in the Newark
Group is known as the <B><A NAME="brunswick">Brunswick
Formation</A></B>.  It was deposited when the
Lockatong lakes were overwhelmed with
red mud during wet weather cycles.  It
is now seen as a red, sedimentary
shale.  It is the most wide-spread of
all the rocks composing Hunterdon
County covering over 30 percent of its
surface area and extending to depths of
over one mile.
<P>
    The Brunswick Formation has yielded
very few fossils.  In other exposures
outside of Hunterdon County, there have
been reported finds of dinosaur
footprints.  It is also a rock with
very little economic value.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="bform">Igneous Intrusions</A></H3>

    During the Triassic, deep-reaching
faults formed changes along which
igneous magma from great depths
approached the surface to form dikes or
sills or poured out on the surface as
lava flows.  This magma cooled and
hardened and now forms the Byram
Formation, This formation contains the
igneous rock diabase.  Diabase is a
very fine-grained rock which indicates
that it cooled quickly very near the
earth's surface.
<P>
    Diabase is exposed in the <B><A NAME="watchung">Watchung
Mountains</A></B> in adjacent Somerset County.
It can also be seen at Sourland and
Cushetunk Mountains (<B><A NAME="cush">Round Valley</A></B>).
The crystal structure of diabase
indicates that the rocks never reached
the surface at the time of formation
and their exposure today is the result
of erosion.
<P>
    The intrusion of magma into the
sedimentary rocks of the Newark Group
caused some local metamorphism.  In
places, the argillite and shales of the
Lockatong and Brunswick Formations can
be found to have been "heated" or
"baked".  These metamorphosed
sedimentary rocks are usually referred
to as hornfels.
<P>
    The state's most important source
of<B><A NAME="trap"> road material, concrete aggregate,
and crushed stone</A></B> has been from the
diabase ridges of the Sourland
Mountains, Raven Rock, and
Lambertville.  Diabase is known as
"traprock" in the building trades.
Traprock Industries is one of the
state's largest mining companies with
active quarries in the Oldwick,
Lambertville, and Kingston areas.
<P>
    Near the end of the Triassic
Period, deposition of the Newark Group
was brought to a close by further
uplifting and faulting.  The sills,
dikes, flows, and sediments were
shifted and tilted into their present
position along a new set of faults.
<P>
<H3>Jurassic Period</H3>
    There are no rocks of Jurassic age
in New Jersey because erosion was the
dominant geologic process.
<P><H3>
</H3>Cretaceous Period
  During the Cretaceous, seas from the
southeast invaded southern New Jersey.
The shoreline may have reached
Hunterdon County, but subsequent
erosion has removed any evidence of
deposition that may have existed.
<P>
  Deposition of coastal plain sediments
continued in southern New Jersey and
erosion continued in what is now
Hunterdon County, along portions of the
Triassic Border Fault, exposing the
underlying Paleozoic rocks.
<P>
     Commonly known as the <B><A NAME="glacier">ICE AGE</A></B>, the
Pleistocene Epoch represents the last
million years of geological history.
The epoch is divided into three glacial
and four interglacial stages.  Ice
probably invaded New Jersey during each
of the three glacial stages, but the
<B><A NAME="wisc">Wisconsin</A></B>, the most recent ice advance,
apparently obliterated all but a few
remnants of earlier glaciation.
<P>
    The materials deposited during the
earliest glaciations are so badly
weathered that it is impossible to
determine to which glacial stage they
belong.  In Hunterdon County, there are
scattered patches of rock debris found
on hilltops and in valleys around
Clinton and east of Round Valley.
<P>
    The ice of the last glacial epoch,
the <B>Wisconsin Stage</B>, did not enter
Hunterdon County. However, streams
flowing away from the glacier deposited
sediment in the river valleys of the
<B>Musconetcong, Raritan, and Delaware
Rivers</B>.  This material, left by the
melting glacial waters, is called
drift.  Drift is composed of clay,
gravel, and sand in distinct layers,
the larger rock fragments on the bottom
gradually grading upward into particles
Of silt.

<DD>Bantam Doubleday Dell  (BDD), one of the largest US book publishers, is proud to formally announce the launch of BDD Online (http://www.bdd.com), a World Wide Web site on the Internet  devoted to marketing BDD titles and authors.  The site has been awarded "Cool Site of
<BR>
the Day" (Glenn Davis), "Top 5% of the Web" (Point.com), and is recommended
<BR>
by Yahoo as the first site to go to when looking for book-related information
<BR>
on the Web.
<BR>

<BR>
The goal in designing BDD Online has been to meet the needs of the new wave
<BR>
of consumers just now gaining access to the Internet.  BDD's hope is to help
<BR>
foster an active community of online readers by offering a unique combination
<BR>
of access to text excerpts and audio samples from our books and the ability
<BR>
to communicate with authors, editors and each other.
<BR>

<BR>
BDD Online offers weekly visits with different authors and monthly previews
<BR>
of its top releases.  While each author visit adapts to the unique nature of
<BR>
the particular author, each revolves around a few key features: readers are
<BR>
given the chance to read excerpts from the author's books or, in some cases,
<BR>
to listen to selections from the audio editions, to learn about the author
<BR>
through profiles and interviews, to check in on the author's schedule of
<BR>
readings and media appearances, and to communicate with the author through
<BR>
e-mail.

<h1 align=center>Welcome to Electric Soup</h1>

607
people have visited ESOUP since April 1, 1996.

<p><STRONG>Welcome to </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Electric Soup</STRONG></EM><STRONG>, Hunterdon Central's Online Literary Magazine. The name of the 
magazine comes from a student poem by Frederique de Lame: &quot;Quickly seeping into open 
minds/twisting neurons/electric soup blurring into a novel image.&quot;</STRONG></p>
<p><STRONG>Many of the pieces found within the magazine are written by Hunterdon Central Students, 
Staff, and Alumnae as well as pieces written by the &quot;Young&quot; Writers from the sending 
districts of Hunterdon Central. However, </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Electric Soup's</STRONG></EM><STRONG> goal is to be an inclusive, 
responsive literary magazine. We seek work from ALL writers, and contributors need not be 
associated with Hunterdon Central. We invite all submissions supportive of the inquisitive, 
imaginative writing process. But now, please come in!</STRONG></p>

<h1><center>Editorials</center></h1>
<hr>
<strong>As Christmas gets closer and closer, more people
are rushing to get last-minute Christmas shopping
done. Malls, parking lots, and outlets are packed
with lines, people, and lots of angry voices.
Holiday shopping can provide a lot of pressure,
especially for procrastinators, but gift-buying
should not be down-right stressful.  The
craziness of the holidays sometimes makes people
lose sight of the spirit of the times.  Among the
malls, hunderds of last-minute shoppers push past
each other. People fight over who has the right
to the last Tickle Me Elmo in stock and who was
in line first. Angry fists thrust receipts into
clerks hands, demanding a return, tired children
whine about what time it is, and the walk between
stores is like filltering through a maze.
<br><br>
Everywhere one looks, there are unhappy faces and
voices. This is not what the holidays are all
about.  Holidays can certainly make people crazy.
But holidays are supposed to be a fun time to
spend with loved ones. People should not stress
if they cannot find that perfect gift for the
last person on their shopping list.  
<br><br>
They certainly should not take it out on the
sales clerk. People should keep in mind when they
are yelling at the man who just stole their
parking space that this is supposed to be the
most wonderful time of the year.<h4>

This camera is a beta test set-up in preparation for a 
'construction-cam' for our new renovation.  It takes a
picture every hour, converts it to JPG format and transfers
it over to our web page.  The camera is a simple Panasonic
VCR camera (about 7 years old) and the conversion is accomplished  
by means of a SNAPPY video converter.  A batch file, running under WIN95
sends the image over to the web server via a FTP transfer.

Development of a reflective and active citizenry is the primary aim of social studies education.  To achieve this aim, the HCHRS social studies program emphasizes four interrelated areas of study: knowledge, skills, values/attitudes, and social participation.  Knowledge is drawn from a wide range of the humanities and social sciences, and is coordinated with emerging national trends and state requirements.  Skills are taught developmentally, with significant emphasis on research, critical thinking, and geography skills.  Attitudes and values deemed crucial to the understanding of a democratic society and diverse world cultures are examined with emphasis on the reflective study of value conflict throughout the required program. Social participation behaviors are infused throughout the required and elective programs to assist in the training of students for lifelong active citizenship upon their entrance into adulthood.<BR><BR>

The social studies faculty is committed to the ongoing revision of the curricular, instructional, and evaluative components of its program, and welcomes community input.  Send comments to Dr.  Bill Fernekes at BFerneke@star.hcrhs.hunterdon.k12.nj.us<BR><BR>

The systematic application of technology characterizes the social studies program.  Students use word processing in U.S. History I , U.S. History II, and Comparative World Studies for research, while other classroom activities and electronic data collection encompass diverse software applications such as  simulations, databases, and multimedia presentations.  Elective courses for juniors and seniors employ laserdiscs, databases, spreadsheets and simulations related to course topics and future careers.  Multi-media applications are employed using the MacIntosh platform in the U.S. History I Program, while windows multimedia projects are used in U.S. History II and Comparative World Studies .<BR><BR>

Many careers are strengthened by learning in social studies at both high school and college/university levels.  Among these are careers in business (economist, accountant, financial analyst, banker,), education (teacher, museum director, archivist, librarian, professor, school administrator, counselor), government (attorney, political analyst, lobbyist, agency director, researcher, planner, geographer, judge), service professions (psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist, caseworker, nurse, medical technician/assistant, sociologist). the media (writer, newspaper reporter, or editor, television or radio commentator/reporter, screen writer), and many others too numerous to list.  A broad-based social studies education comprising four full years of study in high school best serves students who want to make informed decisions about their future.  <P>

<u><h2><center>The Essential Question</h2></u><br>

<h4>The main aspect of this unit was to answer the question:</h4>
<h3>HOW WAS HUNTERDON COUNTY FORMED??</h3></center><br>

	<h4>To figure out the answer to this question, the Hunterdon Central Freshmen Science classes will go on a Fall Field 
Trip.  The students will stopp at different stops collecting rocks to help determine which rocks were formed first and where they 
were formed.<br><br>

	Besides rock types, students have to determine what natural causes effected the county's formation, ie: wind and water
erosion.<br><br>
	Students will do several activities to examine the geologic history of Hunterdon County.  These activities in addition
to the field trip, included:
		

             <UL>   a.  rock classification and composition<br>
		b.  multimedia project<br>
		c.  the geology booklet</h4></UL>

<h4>The answer to how Hunterdon County was formed is:
<UL>
The formation of Hunterdon County occured about 200 million years ago.  Hunterdon County started out as a valley of Losee-Gneiss (the
basement rock).  Over time a boarder fault was formed, causing the groung to slowly uplift making a mountain.  The mountain
started to erode causing an avalanch of Hammer Creek-Conglomerate.  Then the mountain eroded some more so Stockton-Sandstone
came down.  This process continued with Lockatong-Argillite and Brunswick-Shale.  At the base of the mountain there were three
layers of rock, they were (in order):
	<UL>
	<LI>Stockton-Sandstone
	<LI>Lockatong-Argillite
	<LI>Brunswick-Shale </UL>
With Losee-Gneiss underneath it all.  <br>

For some undnown reason the ground uplifted forming jagged edged cliffs make out of Stockton-Sandstone, Lockatong-Argillite, and
Brunswick-Shale.  When the ground uplifted, the the ground cracked making magma come up through those cracks.  The magma
is known as Byram-Diabase.  Over a longperiod of time, the matural elements eroded down these jagged edged cliffs. forming
smooth curves.  Those curves are what is now known as Hunterdon County.</h4></UL>

<u><h2><center>"Ringing" Rocks</center></h2></u><br>

<h4>One of the most interesting places students will visit during their field trip is 'Ringing Rocks' in Bucks County. <p>

Ringing Rocks is four acres of boulders of all sizes.  At a first glance it looks as if someone just dumped them all there.  But
as you will learn this is not the case.  Ringing Rocks was not formed by glaciers or avalanches, but by erosion.<p>

For about a century Ringing Rocks have been a mystery.  But now scientists believe they know why these rocks ring.  They
say it's a matter of stress and location.  Scientists say that ringing rocks are diabase boulders (that is they are igneous).  The
chemical composition also plays an important role in why the rocks "ring".<p>


Students will do some dittos on the ringing rocks for example:
<UL>
1.  The ringing rocks formation   &<br>
2.  Ringing Rocks worksheet (Geology of ringing rocks park) </UL>
</h4>

<h4>After doing these dittos and going to Ringing Rocks park, they will be able to answer the question:<br>
<center> How were the Ringing Rocks formed?</center><br><br>

The answer to this question is:<br>
<UL>
At first Ringing Rocks was igneous rock underneath arched layers of rock.  There was no field of boulders.  Just trees and some think
the Delaware River.  Over time wid or water slowly eroded away the tree, dirt, and the soft layers of rock on the surface.  When the egneous rock core was visible,
rain froze in the cracks in the rock, thus making the cracks grow wider.  When the cracks finally got big enough, they forced the 
rock to break into two parts.  This process continued until there was a pile of smaller rocks, instead of one giant igneous rock.<br><br>

Others think that the formation of Ringing Rocks was because of the Delaware River.  The Delaware River could have once flowed
straight over the Ringing Rocks pile.  Slowly, over time, the river eroded away the trees and soft rock on the surface.  Since igneous rock is hard, the
river couldn't wear it away.  Not being able to run through this rock anymore, the river changed its path so it flowed around the rock.
Over time, rain froze in cracks on the rock.  This make the cracks larger until the rock split.  This process continued until the igneous rock became a pile of boulders.  </UL>

<DL>
<DT> <h4><b>Metamorphic Rocks</b>
<DD>  Rocks changed either by heat or by heat and pressure, resulting from chemical 
and structural changes that occur in solid rock underneath the earth's surface.
<DD>  Metamorphic rock can be formed from igneous or sedimentary rock (the two other main types of rock).

<b>Types of metamorphic rocks:</b>
<UL>
a.  Amphibolite<br>
b.  Marble<br>
c.  Slate  </UL>

<b>How Metamorphic rock is formed (metamorphism):</b>
<OL>
<LI>Metamorphic rock can be changed by heat produced from nearby <i>magma</i> (molten igneous rock) or by
 heat and pressure altering the rock.  <br>
 <LI>The minerals in rock are broken down to form new mineral.  During this process, called recrystallization, 
the texture may change and the rock's grains become larger.  </OL>

<DL>
<DT> <h4><b> Igneous Rocks</b>
<DD>  Rocks formed by the hardening and crystallization of molten material that originates deep within the earth.  
This material, <i>magma</i>, is a mixture of liquid rock, gases, and mineral crystals.
</DL>


<b>Types of igneous rocks:</b>
<UL>
a.  basalt<br>
b.  granite  </UL>

<b>How igneous rock is formed:</b>
<OL>
<LI>Scientists classify igneous rocks into two categories-<i>extrusive</i> and <i>intrusive</i>.
<LI>Extrusive rocks form when magma flows onto the surface of the earth or ocean floor.  The magma reaches the 
earths surface through fissures (deep cracks) or volcanic vents.  Once the magma reaches the surface it is known as lava.  
As the lava cools, it either forms rocks of microscopic crystals, smooth volcanic glass or porose volcanic glass.
<LI>Intrusive rocks form when magma solidifies beneath the earth's surface.  As the magma solidifies, it forms rocks with
large crystals.

<center><u><h2>Density of Field Trip Rocks</h2></u>

<h3>Density=Mass/Volume</h3></center><br>

<h4>The density of rocks can help to determine the weather conditions that the rocks were in.<br>

For instance if there was heavy rain, than the rocks that fell from a cliff were large.  When they landed on top of each other there was more
air in between them.  And so they are less dense because there is more air.<br>


If there was light rain, than the rocks that fell from the cliff were smaller.  When they landed on top of each other there
was less air in between them.  This means that they are more dense.</h4>

<h4>The freshmen did a ditto about the density of the Field Trip Rocks.  They used the four sedimentary rocks they collected from:
<UL>
<LI>Busik Quarry
<LI>Tumble Falls
<LI>Mudrock
<LI>Pebble Bluffs  </UL><br>

Students were asked to determine the following:
<OL>
<LI>The actual mass.
<LI>The mass in water.
<LI>The difference between the actual mass and the mass in water.
<LI>Using the formula, D=Actual Mass/Difference in Masses, to find the density for each rock.  </UL>

<h2 align=center><u>Hunterdon County Geology Computer Project</u></h2>

<h4>Students work on their own project with a partner. They use the software
package called Multimedia Scrapebook.
<br>
<br>Each student is responsible for at least one page. For this project
students have to answer the question &quot;How was Hunterdon County formed?&quot;.
Students will use the knowledge they learned during class and on the field
trip. (Peers will grade the projects not the teacher!)
<br>
<br>Each scrapebook is to have: </h4>

<ol>
<li>A credits screen (with a picture of both authors on it)
<br></li>

<li>Information on the authors
<br></li>

<li>Text, graphics, and sound </li>
</ol>

<p>Before starting to work in the multimedia scrapebook, students have
to turn in an outline of what they plan to do. 
<br>This outline must include: </p>

<ul>
<li>A title page </li>

<li>A credits page </li>

<li>Initials of which partner did each page </li>

<li>One graphic per page </li>
</ul>

<center><p>
<hr><u></p></center>

<h2 align=center>Peer Evaluation</h2>

<center><p></u>When evaluating students have to look for: </p></center>

<ol>
<li>Completness </li>

<ul>
<li>Is the scrapebook finished? </li>

<li>Do all the pages seem complete? </li>

<li>Does it come to a logical ending? </li>

<li>Are there initials on each page? </li>

<li>Is the credits page reasonable? </li>

<li>Are you satisified that they used their time wisely? </li>
</ul>

<li>Creativity and Originality </li>

<ul>
<li>Is the scrapebook different? </li>

<li>Is there evidence of effort to make it special? </li>

<li>Does it catch your eye? </li>

<li>Does it make good use of graphics? </li>
</ul>

<li>Information Accuracy </li>

<ul>
<li>Is the geology correct? </li>

<li>Are there any mistakes, misspellings, or inaccuracies? </li>

<li>Does it teach you? </li>
</ul>

<li>Overall </li>

<ul>
<li>In general, how did you feel about the other students scrapebooks?
Were they good? </li>

<li>Do you think the owners worked seriously during the four weeks? </li>

<li>Where does it rank among others? </li>
</ul>

<li>Comments </li>

<ul>
<li>Indicate somethings that explain your marking system. </li>

<li>Good or not so good. Anything that caught your eye. </li>

<li>Misuse of graphics or slang? </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Of course, nothing could have been accomplished without our teacher,
Mr. Greaney. He showed us how to use the program and helped us along. Here

<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcome to my Home Page</h3>
<p><IMG align=right SRC="gif/soccer.gif" BORDER=3>

<h2>Why I have a home page</h2>
Actually, it all started out as a science project.  I, along with Kristi Carver, wrote it over the summer of 1995.  After learning how to use the program, we basically summarized the topics we covered in Freshman Science and put them into the computer.  The purpose of the program is to help the future freshman students and also to let the world learn a little bit about Hunterdon County.  We're currently in the process of updating the page, so bear with us<p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
Besides working on the computer, I enjoy doing many other things.  I'm big into sports and play soccer, lacrosse and enjoy running.  I also play the piano and volunteer at the hospital and  food pantry.  After school, you'll usually find me in some sort of a club, whether it be Class/Student Council, SADD, Students for the Environment, or Speech and Debate.  In my spare time (when I can find some), I like to read, sail, and listen to music.  My ideal life would be to spend the winters skiing and the summers on the beach.<br>
Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.  Feel free to leave any type of feedback (I love getting messages!!)  Hope you enjoyed our page!

<h1 align=center><EM><STRONG><img src="/esoup/gif/702_c.jpg" align=bottom width=138 height=98></STRONG></EM></h1>
<pre><STRONG>     Hunterdon Central Regional High School has an on-line
electronic magazine which can offer readers and writers the immediacy and
depth of electronic delivery.  The cyber-mag is developed upon a belief in
the energy and importance of words and the writing process.  Poet
Adrienne Rich writes that &quot;The words are purposes/The words are maps.&quot; 
We invite you to share in words which need to be spoken, words given
creative depth and meaning in the diverse features and the multiple,
technology-assisted presentations of Electric Soup.
     A text-only version of Electric Soup is placed on the Hunterdon
Central BBS, and it can be accessed from home with computer and
modem.  Call in through your modem to our BBS at 284-7183 to find out
about our electronic bulletin board system and to register electronically for
BBS usage.  A colorful, graphics version of Electric Soup can be read
on the HCRHS network computer system through any school computer
on campus capable of running Windows.  The magazine appears under
English options.   For electronic access from anywhere in the world, our
World Wide Web version of Electric Soup offers the magazine in lively
Internet format as part of the Hunterdon Central home page located at
http://www.hcrhs.hunterdon.k12.nj.us/ on the Internet; simply select the
electronic literary magazine option after Entering the School.  Connect to
the cybermag at
http://www.hcrhs.hunterdon.k12.nj.us/esoup/welcome.shtml for quick
access.  In addition, portions of the cyber-mag can be heard on-the-air on
WCVH, FM 90.5 every other Thursday at 2:30.  Readings from Electric
Soup are presented by on-the-air student editors during the show, Jack
Rabbit Slim's.  Only a few, rare copies of Electric Soup are available in
print form to maintain the built-in immediacy of electronic delivery,  but all
contributors do receive a print copy.  
     Electric Soup's goal is to be an inclusive, responsive, literary
journal, and we seek submissions in poetry, short story, essay, free
writes, and any form of writing supportive of an inquisitive, imaginative
writing process.  We have a special young writers section as well as
sections devoted to the writing of alumnae, teachers, parents, and 
writers of any age.  We seek to support the writing process as a way of
life, rich and full in its immediacy and energy.
     We invite submissions in either electronic or print form. 
Submissions can be made electronically over the HCRHS BBS system,
through our Internet site, over the HCRHS network, or submissions can be
sent to us on electronic disk through the mail.  Be sure to label the disk
with name, grade, school, address, teacher, format and word
processing program used; it is always wise to include print copy with your
electronic disk.  In addition, Electric Soup accepts print only submissions.  
Contributors other than students may follow the disk or print submission 
procedure, but be sure to include name and address.  Disk or print copy
submissions or further inquiries about Electric Soup should be directed to
Mrs. Florence McGinn/HCRHS, 84 Route 31, Flemington, New Jersey 
08822, at 908-284-7200 Voice Mail Box 8595, or at the address
fmcginn@star.hcrhs.hunterdon.k12.nj.us for Internet mail delivery.</STRONG></pre>

<hr>
<strong>As Christmas gets closer and closer, more people
are rushing to get last-minute Christmas shopping
done. Malls, parking lots, and outlets are packed
with lines, people, and lots of angry voices.
Holiday shopping can provide a lot of pressure,
especially for procrastinators, but gift-buying
should not be down-right stressful.  The
craziness of the holidays sometimes makes people
lose sight of the spirit of the times.  Among the
malls, hunderds of last-minute shoppers push past
each other. People fight over who has the right
to the last Tickle Me Elmo in stock and who was
in line first. Angry fists thrust receipts into
clerks hands, demanding a return, tired children
whine about what time it is, and the walk between
stores is like filltering through a maze.
<br><br>
Everywhere one looks, there are unhappy faces and
voices. This is not what the holidays are all
about.  Holidays can certainly make people crazy.
But holidays are supposed to be a fun time to
spend with loved ones. People should not stress
if they cannot find that perfect gift for the
last person on their shopping list.  
<br><br>
They certainly should not take it out on the
sales clerk. People should keep in mind when they
are yelling at the man who just stole their
parking space that this is supposed to be the
most wonderful time of the year.<h4>

<strong>Overall, the new block scheduling system has
benefited the entire Hunterdon Central community.
Longer, more intense periods allow students to
absorb information in half the length of the time
that the previous system required for completion.
Still, an unanticipated problem persists. The
timing of certain block classes conflicts with
requirements needed for summer programs.  
<br><br>
For instance, nominations for Governors Schools
Creative Writing Class were made well into the
first semester. Nominees were chosen from the
Honors Imaginative Process semester class. A
requirement for nomination was a creative writing
portfolio which was completed during the course.
<br><br>
Unless a student was in class at the time
nominations were made, previously aware of the
details pertaining to the selection process and
found out information on his or her own, he or
she would not be considered for Governors
school.  With block scheduling relatively new to
Central, other similar problems may arise. The
school should try to anticipate these problems
and accommodate for them.<h4>

<strong>The rush of seniors and staff leaving after the
2:03 bell causes a lot of traffic at the
intersection of Route 31 and the entrance to the
Fountain parking lot. To ensure the safety of
students, there are rules for both drivers and
pedestrians. 
<br><br>
Some students, though, have become impatient and
are causing problems. They are putting themselves
in potentially fatal situations because they are 
<br><br>
being irresponsible.  Instead of waiting for the
light on 31 to turn red, allowing pedestrians to
safely cross, some students have decided to
brave the road and to cross while the 31 light
is green. 
<br><br>
On Wednesday, this caused a big jam in the middle
of the intersection because some cars had stopped
(so as not to hit the kids) right in the middle,
as the lights were changing.
<br><br>
Rather than wait a few seconds, students are
carelessly neglecting motorists, and some have
come close to getting hit by a driver suddenly
surprised by a student jumping out in front of a
car. These students need to remember that a
travelling vehicle weighing over one ton is no
force to be reckoned with and they should
recognize that, when an accident happens, the
driver who hits the kid is just as affected as
the kid who gets hit by the driver.

<strong>The recent bomb scare has reminded students that
Central is not 100% safe from intrusion by
outsiders. With this in mind, we ought to
question the lack of Code C drills this year.
These drills, designed to practice techniques of
avoiding danger from an armed person within the
building, were instated last year. 
<br><br>
So far this year, there have been no such drills.
During a Code C, teachers are supposed to turn
their lights off, and students should gather in
the back of the room, out of the line of sight of
a dangerous person.  
<br><br>
Taking a little time to practice such a drill may
someday prove a good investment, and out of
safetys sake, the school should occasionally
call a Code C over the loudspeaker.<h4>

<strong>The school recently laid down gravel on a walkway
frequented by students coming from the senior
parking lot. In between the Freshman Building and
the Fieldhouse, there were the remains of a paved
path. 
<br><br>
This path, though, has been cracked and has seen
its time. Thus when it rains students invariably
find that there are puddles in the way that can
be avoided only by walking in the mud.  
<br><br>
The gravel, though, has fixed that problem, and
it is a great relief for seniors and others who
do not like dirty shoes.<h4>

	The Shared Decision Making Steering
Committee conducted a survey last week during
lunches. The survey questions focused on block
scheduling, exams, and workload. There were 204
students chosen randomly to answer the eight
question survey.  The purpose of the survey is to
help evaluate block scheduling and get feedback
on what changes need to be made in the school
day. Students answered the questions according to
their experience in quarter one.
<br><br>
	Thirty two percent of the students
surveyed took three exams at the conclusion of
the quarter, and 28% studied for two of the exams
they took.  Forty four percent of the surveyed
students, however, voted that they didnt have
enough time to prepare for their exams last
quarter.  When asked how they felt about having
exams and classes on the same day, 30% answered
acceptable.
<br><br>
	The survey also addres-sed the subject of
workload.  Question #5 asked, How many of your
classes last quarter required about one half hour
or more of homework per night? Twenty seven
percent of the students answered two, and 41%
said that they have more homework this year than
last year.
<br><br>
	When asked about study halls and how much
work gets done during studies, 33% of students
answered that they did not have a study hall
during the first quarter and did not feel they
needed one.
<br><br>
	The final question asked was If given
the choice, would you stick with block scheduling
or return to traditional 45 minute periods?
Thirty four percent of the students surveyed said
that they prefer block scheduling.
<br><br>
	The survey results were reviewed by the
Shared Decision Making Steering Committee and are
currently being studied by the SDM Curriculum
Committee.  If you are interested in working on
the Curriculum Committee, please contact Erica
Goetz, your SDM Student representative, at
extension 8999 or mailbox J-2.

<strong><h3>by Sara Donnelly
</h3><br><br>
When local resident Chris Englehart learned about
Bostons First Night New Years Eve celebration,
she knew that the program would have a wonderful
effect on Flemington if it could be brought to
the town. With the help of fellow resident Sonya
Comstock, Ms. Englehart set out to find a
non-profit organization to back the event.
After several failed attempts, the two women
found a sponsor in Flemington Partnership for
Progress and an organizer, director, and leader
in Rosie Efthim, another local citizen. First
Night debuted successfully last New Years Eve,
and the sequel is set for December 31, 1996.
<br><br>
	First Night, an alcohol- and-smoke-free
event, is billed as a one night renaissance in a
cool little town. At a recent organizational
meeting, Ms. Efthim explained, The reason that I
do this is because we are creating the New Years
Eve that we want to attend.
<br><br>
It can safely be said that we applies to a huge
chunk of the local population, as last years
First Night was flooded with enormous crowds of
revelers. The event is actually a series of
mini-events, a nine-hour extravaganza of singing,
dancing, and eating, in addition to a range of
unique performance arts.  Last years attendees
could have busied themselves with anything from
swing dancing at the Flemington Jewish Community
Center to hurling themselves at a velcro wall at
Reading Fleming Middle School. These events and
dozens more will be repeated this year.
<br><br>
	There will also be new features. This
years attendees can experience Chilean-Bolivian
jazz fusion, which melds the native music of the
Andes Mountains with a uniquely American form of
music and throws in some techno as well.  The
Celluloid Courthouse will be open in the evening,
and it will continuously run animated shorts. A
ventriloquist-comedian will perform operatic
farce centering on Sonny, Cher, and Luciano
Pavarotti.
<br><br>
	During the afternoon, the middle school
will be a kids fun zone, featuring
Bubble-mania, a show in which an audience
volunteer is engulfed by a huge bubble.  At the
end of the afternoon, the children will decorate
Main Street with chalk, and an enormous, informal
Merry Makers Parade will make its way down Main
Street. At midnight, an extensive fireworks
display will take place over the middle schools
playing fields.
<br><br>
	A $10 button must be purchased to attend
First Night, and it will gain patrons entry to
any of the dozens of sights. There is, however, a
way to participate in First Night free of charge.
Volunteering at First Night entails working a
three-hour shift at any of the sites, directing
revelers to their destinations, answering phones,
checking buttons, introducing acts, or delivering
supplies.  There is a volunteers meeting on
Saturday, December 21, at 10 a.m. at the
Flemington Baptist Church, and all are welcome.
<br><br>
	In discussing the event, Chris Englehart
stated, Its nice to bring as much culture as
possible to this little town. She added that it
is a safe, family-oriented, fun night which costs
very little.  Thanks to the efforts of organizer
Rosie Efthim and dozens of volunteers, thousands
of local citizens will have the opportunity to
ring in the New Year with a celebration of
community.

You wouldnt think that many people would be
hanging around the school at 9 a.m. on the day
after Christmas.  However, on December 26, 100
members of the Hunterdon Central Marching Red
Devil Band and their nine chaperones will leave
for an eight-day trip to Florida. The band will
be performing on December 28 in a parade at Epcot
Center.
<br><br>
	The group will spend three days at Disney
World, Epcot Center, and Disneys MGM Studios
before transferring to Tampa on the evening of
December 29. On the next day, the band will be
competing for the opportunity to play during the
pre-game show at the Outback Bowl on New Years
Day.
<br><br>
	The MRD will compete with the first two
songs of their award-winning 1996-97 field show.
They will also be performing the halftime show at
the Outback Bowl with over 20 other bands.  The
results of the contest will be announced at the
awards ceremony and New Years Eve party at the
Sun Dome on December 31.
<br><br>
	The Outback Bowl will be on January 1,
1997 at 11 a.m. and can be seen live on ESPN.
Senior band member Kirsten Jason said, This trip
will be one of the highlights of the season. I
can hardly wait.

<h1><center>Sports At Central</center></h1>
<hr>
<strong><img align=right height=200 width=200 src=/lamp/sports1.jpg><h3>by Mike Basford
</h3><br><br>
In what is widely considered to be the sport
steeped with the most tradition at Hunterdon
Central, the 1996-97 wrestling season will begin
on the home mats of the Red Devils at the
Hunterdon/Warren Tournament on Saturday, December
21.
<br><br>
Central, 11-5 last year, will test itself against
local rivals including North Hunterdon, Voorhees,
South Hunterdon and Delaware Valley.
For the Devils, though, the tournaments do not
end there.  After Christmas, Central will host
the annual HCIWT.
<br><br>
Aside from hosting a pair of tourneys, the Devils
also host both the District 17 and Region 5 in
March. The season concludes in Atlantic City with
the NJSIAA State Finals on March 15.
<br><br>
Eight wrestlers return from last years team,
including state qualifier junior Nick Harrington,
who posted a 24-11 mark last year. Also returning
are Pete Tarricone (18-10), Matt Hennessey
(16-12), Jeff Harris, Mike Omilio, and JR
Rynearson (16-8). The other varsity letter men
include juniors Mike Gramiccioni and Evan Krinis
(18-10).  Central also boasts a pair of
impressive newcomers, junior Eric Rucker (275
lbs.) and senior John Martino (215 lbs.).
<br><br>
Following the pair of tournaments, the Red Devils
will embark on a schedule that includes facing
county powerhouses North Hunterdon (Jan. 18) and
Voorhees (Feb. 8).
<br><br>
Last year, Central dropped a 40-34 decision at
the hands of the Vikings. They also began the
season 9-1 before losing four of their last six
matches.
<br><br>
In the midst of their 9-1 start, the Devils beat
the likes of Washington Township, 48-24;
Somerville, 46-20; Hillsborough, 46-24;
Bridgewater, 48-25; Franklin, 64-15; and Delaware
Valley, 39-32.
<br><br>
For the Lions, talent will definitely not be a
problem. The Lions feature Eric Eisenhart (25-8),
Eric Balut (23-5) at 112 lbs., Brian Powers
(22-6) at 119 lbs., Mike Jeffry (25-8) at 125
lbs., Kelly Pierce (19-7) at 130 lbs., Dan Degan
(23-5) at 145 lbs., and Justin Bagley (21-4) at
160 lbs.
<br><br>
At Voorhees, the term rebuilding can best be
used when describing the Vikings.  Voorhees lost
six quality wrestlers to graduation last season
but still have John Brienza (28-6) at 125 lbs.,
Ed Piasecki (16-12) at 119 lbs., Sky Wade (18-12)
at 130 lbs., Scott Cox (19-10) at 145 lbs., and
Karl Rittger (28-4) at 160 lbs.

<strong><img align=right height=200 width=200 src=/lamp/sports2.jpg><h3>by Harrie Copeland
</h3>For the past couple of years, the boys swim team
has been shortchanged when it comes to the number
of swimmers on the team, but, for once, there are
enough swimmers to fill all the slots.
<br><br>
This is largely due to the high number of
talented freshmen on the team this year. They are
expected to strengthen the performance of this
years team.
<br><br>
Seniors Dave Skocypec, Jason Pollock, Jim
Mekovitz, and Tim Kurlyo, who have been swimming
together for years, will surely lead the team to
success.
<br><br>
However, the team would not be complete without
the juniors and sophomores. The juniors aiming to
take things over next year are Dan Fatton, Jeff
Hudson, Harrie Copeland, and Brian Sung.
<br><br>
The boys have competed in three meets so far this
season, and they remain undefeated. However, the
Devils look forward to some challenging matches
in the near future.
<br><br>
Bridgewater will be a difficult match,
considering they are unbeaten, but this is the
kind of challenge the Devils look forward to.
<br><br>
Central swimmers plan to shift into high gear to
make sure they are in top shape and get more
serious in practice.
<br><br>
An important upcoming meet is the Pirate
Invitational on January 11 at West Windsor High
School.
<br><br>
This gives Central a chance to see how theyll do
when they are up against many teams at once.
<br><br>
At this all-day meet, the Devils hope to beat
both individual and team records. The boys team
is looking forward to a successful new season.
<br><br>
Were out for their jugulars! Coach Bob Devoto
said.

<hr>
<strong><h3>To the Editor:
</h3>I am writing in response to last weeks article
about the bomb threat at Hunterdon Central. As
you know, when these kinds of serious situations
arise, details of the investigation need to
remain confidential. We take our direction from
the police or other authorities who may be
involved. I am also sensitive to the importance
of keeping everyone calm in a crisis. It is
always difficult to know how people will respond
to information we provide.
<br><br>
Certainly, our staff will be informed of any
circumstances we are free to release; and based
upon the opinions expressed in last weeks Lamp,
I will be happy to inform the students as well to
quell any rumors.  Most of you know that student
safety is of primary importance to me. When
people jeopardize our normal routine, we all
suffer.
<br><br>
I certainly hope that these kinds of
interruptions will not negatively affect our
school calendar, forcing us to move graduation to
a latter date.  Please let me know if you have
any ideas to share with me regarding school
safety issues.Sincerly,Mrs. Linda BatzPrincipal<h4>

<h1><center>Letters to the Editor</center></h1>

<strong><h3>To the Editor:
</h3>	Although the topic of study hall has
already been commented on in the past few issues,
Id like to address yet another topic of concern
regarding them. To have study halll in room 500
seems one of the least sensible things that our
school has done yet. Room 500, which is  the
choral room, lacks one of the most necessary
elements for completing work: desks! I wonder how
one is supposed to do homework, which is what
study hall is actually for, without the use of
some horizontal surface big enough to accommodate
a book and notebook.
<br><br>
One of the authorities may argue that there is a
shortage of available rooms and that students
have access to the library to solve this problem.
This would be a decent solution if more than a
total of ten people were, indeed, allowed to go
to the library in the eighty-four minutes that
this block is in session.
<br><br>
However, the plain, sad truth is that there are
only five people allowed for each half of the
study hall to go to the library.  This is hardly
reasonable. Even still, some determined students
have managed to crouch over many chairs put
together, lean their notebooks on one leg, and
balance their calculators on the other in attempt
to finish that last set of math problems.
<br><br>
However, even for those students, it is still
next to impossible to concentrate in a study hall
that is rowdy, noisy, unaccommodating, and
frequently shows movies.it is not something that
a student should have to deal with when trying to
do homework in a class intended for just that
use! I am hardly suggesting that study halls
should be held in silence, or even that students
shouldnt use it as a well-deserved time to
unwind.
<br><br>
However, I am suggesting that the lights remain
on so students can see, that the noise be kept to
a dull roar, and students who want to use the
advantage of the library should be permitted to
do so. Of course, forty-five students from study
hall should not go traipsing into the library
without any supervision, but please, dont limit
the amount allowed to go to ten.
<br><br>
To infringe this limit is a waste of the
students time in a study hall where work cannot
be done.  And better yet, to avoid this problem
all in all, study halls should not be held in
room 500! Im sure our Star School can find
some way in our technologically advanced system
to locate a more accommodating room for study
hall!Annoyed,Ryan Fitzgerald<h4>

<strong><img align=right height=200 width=200 src=/lamp/news1.jpg><h3>by Jill Luster
</h3>The National Honor Society (NHS) held the annual
Snowball last Saturday night. As usual, the dance
was held exclusively for juniors, seniors, and
their guests. It took place in the Upper School
Gym and ran from 8 to midnight.
<br><br>
The Snowball is the primary source of fund
raising for the NHS. Mr. Baca, the advisor for
NHS, said that after the dance expenses had been
paid off, the members would be choosing one or
more organizations to donate their proceeds to.
<br><br>
Mr. Baca added that, overall, the dance ran very
smoothly, and everyone was pleased with the
results of the night.
<br><br>
The Upper School Gym was simply, yet tastefully
decorated, adorned with white balloons and two
snowmen, fitting the wintery theme.
The DJ played a wide variety of songs, and there
were no lulls in the dance as it progressed.
<br><br>
Since it was professionally catered, students who
attended the dance were provided with punch,
small appetizers, and a variety of desserts.
<br><br>
Nearly everyone who came to the dance felt that
it was a great experience and a good time.
Junior Meg Bissett commented enthusiastically,
It was a lot of fun!
<br><br>
Junior Katie Lynch declared that the dance,
...rocked, and I had a great time!
<br><br>
One of the highlights of the evening concerned
the crowning of the Snowball King and Queen. The
decision was based on ballots filled out and
submitted by students who purchased tickets.
After all the votes were tallied, this years
winners were Seniors Mike Superior and Stacy
Lyons.
<br><br>
A very surprised and excited Superior responded
to the honor, King? Youve got to be kidding.
<br><br>
Stacy Lyons said of her newly awarded title,  I
never considered myself to be the type of person
to receive the honor of Snow Queen; I was quite
honored but surprised too.
<br><br>
 The Snowball was undoubtedly successful. All 450
tickets were sold. In fact, many students were
left disappointed because they did not purchase
their tickets soon enough and were left to find
alternative sources of Saturday night
entertainment.
<br><br>
The enthusiasm for the Snowball was quite
overwhelming, and I think that everyone had a
great night, said senior Stephen Poon, NHS
vice-president. Its a shame that we werent
able to accommodate everyone.
<br><br>
The 450 ticket limit was imposed because the
state fire code regulations dictate the maximum
number of allowable occupants in the gym.
<br><br>
As a result, the National Honor Society was not
allowed to sell extra tickets at the door. This
technicality left many students scrambling to
find tickets at the last moment, but for many
there was nothing that they could do.
<br><br>
This should serve as a reminder for those
students wishing to attend the Snowball in the
future: buy tickets as soon as possible. Those
students who were able to get tickets found it
enjoyable and well worth the cost.
<br><br>
Senior Ameya Kulkarni, NHS President, stated,
The Snowball was more successful than any of us
expected it to be.

is better than the previous.
<br><br>
In between acts senior Tom OConnor, member of
the Men of Hunterdon, Chorale, and Concert Choir,

<br><br>
Indeed, the auditorium was packed Wednesday

</h3>Hunterdon Centrals Model UN competed this past
weekend in a conference at Harvard University in
Boston, Massachusetts.
<br><br>
Although Centrals Model UN was too small to
qualify for a prize, they feel that they did a
wonderful job.
<br><br>
Senior Jason OLeary  said, I was pleased with
the group. Everyone worked hard in their sessions
to create resolutions for the committees they
were on.
<br><br>
The conference included over 150 schools from
around the United States, each of which
represented a separate country in the world.
<br><br>
Participating students then become delegates
representing their countries in multiple mock
committees.
<br><br>
There were two divisions that separated the
schools into resolution groups. Among these
groups were the General Assembly, Specialized
Agencies, and the Economic and Social Council.
<br><br>
Senior Jerry George stated, As a member of the
Economic and Financial Committee for Model UN, I
had a great time on our trip to Boston. I
prepared by researching Angolas financial
problems, and as a result, I was able to support
other members of my block by resolving the issue
of Currency Stabilization during one of the
several sessions we had.
<br><br>
Besides the work that went into it, I also found
time to enjoy the attractions of the city,
including the malls and restaurants.
<br><br>
The conference itself was organized much like a
real UN session. Once the committees were
assembled, the delegates voted on which of two
assigned topics to discuss first. Then they
discussed the chosen topic and worked toward a
resolution.
<br><br>
Representatives from each country argued the
concerns and opinions of their country. Although
not technically a competition, debates can become
heated.
<br><br>
After a resolution was reached on the topic, the
committee went to a planetary session where the
whole assembly voted on the proposed resolution.
<br><br>
Senior Priya Narasimhan said, Harvard Model UN
is a remarkable experience. I felt I gained a lot
in terms of learning about international
relations.  Even though I have only been on Model
UN for two years, I have learned a great deal.

<br>
<h3>By Amy Smith</h3>
<p>
	"Anorexia nervosa is the pathological loss of appetite occurring in young women that is thought to be psychological,"  said Dr. Elysse Watts, a general physician in Morristown, New Jersey.   Approximately  one percent of adolescent girls suffer from this disease in the United States according to Dr. Watts. </p>
<p>	The causes of  anorexia include  stress about weight,  need for control, self consciousness, and  pressure from parents and peers.  These stresses have become stronger in this generation.  For this reason, the number of patients with anorexia and other eating disorders is rising rapidly, according to Dr. Watts.</p>

<p>	Watts said, "The [number of] patients I see with eating disorders is going up so fast it's frightening." </p>

<p>	Some warning signs of anorexia are depression, mood swings, emaciation of  the body,  paleness, dry skin, and a tendency to cover up one's body.   A victim may suffer from only one or all of  these symptoms. </p>

<p>	 Often one sees teens with these signs.  Unfortunately most sufferers do not want to admit they have a problem.  Also, they do not want to tell people about their problem. </p>

<p>	 But Watts said, "This must be done.  When  I suspect an eating disorder, then I either tell their parents or I recommend a specialist." </p>
<p>	 Watts also suggests local hospitals, like the Carrier Clinic, and other specialized treatment centers in New Jersey as options. </p>
<p>	If someone suffers from any of these symptoms, it is important that they receive help as soon as possible.  According to Watts, anorexia can be connected to other diseases and problems which can be deadly.   These include abnormal blood flow, thinning of the blood, depression, denial, and withdrawl. </p>
<p>	Watts said, "Besides death from malnourishment,  these medical complications may cause death." </p>
<p>	Anorexia may also lead to drug abuse.   Many anorexics use cocaine or amphetamines. </p>

<p>	"They think that by taking the drugs they won't be hungry," said Watts. </p>

<p>	Who are the most common sufferers of  this disease?   Most victims are normal everyday teenage girls from middle to upper class families. </p>

<p>	"This is what is so sad about these diseases.  I see the children of  nice, well-off  parents suffering and dying so unnecessarily.  Hopefully more of these teens will realize that they can be helped." </p>

<h2><img align = right src = "hmc2.jpg">Anorexia: The National Statistics </h2></center>
<br>
<h3>By Heather Wyatt</h3>
<p>
<p>
	Millions of people every year are affected with serious eating disorders.  The majority- more than 90 percent- of those afflicted with eating disorders are adolescents and young women.  
<p>
	According to the article "Eating Disorders: Decade of the Brain," approximately 1 percent of adolescent girls develop anorexia nervosa.  Another 2 to 3 percent  of young women develop bulimia nervosa.  These eating  disorders also occur in men and older women, but not as frequently.  
<p>
	One in ten cases of anorexia nervosa leads to death from starvation, cardiac arrest, other medical complications, or suicide.  
<p>
	Loss of monthly menstrual periods is typical in women with the disorder.  Men with anorexia often become impotent. 
<p>
	Those with anorexia have some of these complications:  mild anemia, swollen joints, reduced muscle mass, and light-headedness.  If the  disorder becomes severe, patients may lose calcium from their bones, making them brittle and prone to breakage. They may also experience irregular heart rhythms and heart failure.  In some patients, the brain shrinks, causing personality changes.  However, "conditions may return to normal after weight is gained."
<p>
	Common symptoms of eating disorders include:  excessive weight loss in relativity, continuation of dieting although bone-thin, dissatisfaction with appearance, unusual interest in food and development of strange eating rituals, eating in secret, obsession with exercise, serious depression, eating large amounts of food, vomiting for use of drugs, binging with no noticeable weight gain, disappearing into the bathroom for long periods of time, and abuse with drugs for alcohol. 
<p>
	According to the article "Eating Disorders Focus of Study at Academy" by Bradley Peniston, the Naval Academy was concerned after two females resigned last semester because of eating disorders.
<p>
	"We know we have a problem here and we don't know the size of it," said Capt. Randy Bogle.  
<p>
	Because these midshipmen can be expelled for having persistent eating disorders, they may choose not to discuss such problems with peers or counselors.
<p>
	Statistics show that one in every 100 women suffers from anorexia.  According to Jen Charat, author of "Consumed By Success," Heatherton's College's 1992 study conducted at Harvard showed that one in five undergraduates has an acute eating disorder.  "Men should not be excluded from the discussion, as they constitute roughly five percent of diagnosed cases," said Charat.
<p>
	Heatherton's study reported that 24 percent of women and less then four percent of men surveyed indicated that they had used starvation as a weight control at sometime during college.  Thirteen percent of women defined themselves as compulsive exercisers, opposed to five percent of men.  Women, more than men, are concerned with their size, with their body, and with their appearance. "If I don't look good, I'm a failure," one student said. "I hope that there is a time that it [anorexia] doesn't bother me and I can eat what I want and not be concerned with losing or gaining but just live."
<p>
	According to a fact sheet about Canada, about 85,000 Ontario residents have been diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia.  About 95 percent of those with anorexia and more than 90 percent of those with bulimia are female.  
<p>
	Recent studies in Europe and North America show mortality rates of eight to twenty percent for people with eating disorders.
<p>
	"Anorexia literally consumes the sufferer, and recovery is a long process," says Charat.  "We will eventually have to confront, and battle, the ridiculous standards of success to which women are subjected, at Harvard and beyond. Until we stop turning a blind eye to sincere cries for help, the calorie counting will continue, until it turns into a countdown towards destruction."</p>

<p>

<p>	"I'm so fat;" "I can't eat that;" "That has four grams of fat in each serving..."  Everyone has heard these phrases before; most people have probably even said them.  These are the first warning signs of anorexia, a disease that is plaguing more teenagers of our generation than ever before. </p>

<p>	Our community and school is not an exception.  In fact, anorexia and other eating disorders are becoming common. </p>

<p>	"All my friends are becoming so obsessive about weight.  I can't stand hearing everyone talking about how many grams of fat are in everything I eat," said Aly Busse, a senior at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, NJ. </p>

<p>	Everyone at Central seems to know more than one person who has been hospitalized and many more that are in need of help. </p>

<p>	"I can't believe how many of my friends have eating disorders of one form or another" said Meg Boyle, a senior at Hunterdon Central. </p>

<p>	Mr. James Ruocco, senior guidance counselor at Hunterdon Central, said "No doubt, we definitely have  problem." </p>

<p>	Most  patients are not what one would normally picture as someone with a deadly disease.  They appear normal, to slightly on the perfectionist side. </p>
<p>	"Most students are ordinary kids with boyfriends, friends who do well in school.  This is why the disease is sometimes difficult to catch.," said Ruocco. </p>

<p>	How can people get help?  A good balance is needed between both physical and psychological help.  The patient not only needs to eat a nutritious diet, but needs to solve emotional problems as well. </p>

<p>	"I see anorexia often as a symptom of  other deeper emotional problems.  It is imperative that anorexics not only gain weight but work at other parts of their lives," said Chris Birdsie, a psychiatric nurse for the department of mental health at the Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington. </p>

<p>	Where can people go for help in Flemington?  Locally the Hunterdon Medical Center's mental health unit helps patients with this problem, but only on an outpatient basis.  Usually patients need to be hospitalized for at least a short amount of time. </p>

<p>	"We usually refer patients to other programs, because we just can't meet the needs of most anorexics on an outpatient basis," said Pat Orzano,  Program Director for the mental health department at the Hunterdon Medical Center. </p>

<p>	One such program is located in the Somerset Medical Center.  They have a special unit solely for patients with eating disorders. </p>

<p>	An anonymous patient of this program said, "The staff is very nice, but I would not recommend this program.  They did not help me to deal with real life; they just want to make sure you're over a certain weight." </p>

<p>	Another option is a private doctor.  For example, Dr. Ramzy Ayman specializes in eating disorders.  The majority of his patients are either anorexic or bulimic.  He tries to work with both the patients and parents.  Ayman also corresponds with Carrier Clinic, another hospital that specializes in eating disorders.	</p>

<p>	It appears that the key to solving this problem is identifying those with eating disorders and finding people help as early as possible.  Eating disorders are not curable diseases.  They can be controlled, but people must fight them their entire lives. </p>

<p>	There are many places where people can find help in Flemington.   There are even options as to the type of help one can receive; family, friends, schools, or private help.  Hopefully more young teens will become aware that they are not alone and can be helped. </p>

<h1><img align = right src = "flyfoto1.jpg"> The Dream That Fell Short </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Hamish Seegopaul</h3>
<p>
	Jessica Dubroff was a 7 year old girl with big dreams. However, those dreams will never be fulfilled. On April 10, at 8:24 AM,  the Cessna 177B Jessica was supposed to pilot across the country crashed in Cheyenne, Wyoming during takeoff. </p>


<p>
	Jessica was in the midst of a cross-country trip with her father, Lloyd Dubroff, and flight instructor, Joe Reid. The 4 feet 2 inch tall, Jessica, who needed extensions to reach the foot pedals, was made into a public spectacle, and became and overnight celebrity. When she died, her fame grew even more, and many concerns were voiced about what young people are doing nowadays. </p>


<p>
	According to Lorraine Solberg, assistant secretary at Solberg airport in Readington, NJ, it is perfectly legal for anyone of any age to fly, as long as they are with a certified flight instructor. Solberg airport has given lessons to children as young as 12 or 13. Once a pilot reaches 16, he or she can obtain his or her student pilot's license, which allows him or her to fly solo, with no passengers. Once a pilot reaches 17, he or she  can get his or her full private pilot's license. However Jessica will never get any of these, and it is probably not her fault. </p>


<p>
	"I can almost guarantee you that she was not flying the plane when it crashed," says head flight instructor at Princeton (NJ) airport, Dick Nierenburg. Although Jessica was "flying" the plane, the flight instructor had control of the plane all of the time. The Cessna 177B she was in, had dual controls, so both she and the instructor could take the controls. Although the plane could have crashed for a number of reasons, it was probably not Jessica's fault. </p>


<p>
	"The accident was caused by improper planning on the part of the pilot, apparently to hurry to complete the record setting cross country flight," according to Seth James Garner, a freshman at Arizona State University. He is majoring in aerospace engineering, and an avid flight enthusiast, who explains that the most probable cause of the crash was the weather. </p>


<p>
	Garner explains that the visibility dropped from 3 to 1.5 miles, which is below the requirement for flying visually (pilots would have to use the instrument panel in these conditions).  Also, hail began to fall, indicating that there would be strong updrafts and downdrafts. The unfavorable wind conditions were probably why the plane never got enough lift to takeoff. Garner adds that the aircraft being over the gross weight allowed for takeoff may have contributed to the crash, causing the plane to have less lift. </p>


<p>
	Some people argue that this stunt should never have taken place. Most of the blame inevitably went to her parents, Lisa Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff. After the accident, Hathaway had no regrets about letting Jessica fly. In fact, Hathaway is encouraging Jessica's 9 year old brother to fly. This seems disturbing to many people, but Hathaway is still standing by her decisions. </p>


<p>
	Because of the repercussions if this accident, it is most likely that the FAA will review its rules on letting young people fly. Also, in the future, the media might not pay as much attention to people pulling dangerous stunts like these. The Guinness Book of Records has already pulled out the record for youngest cross country flyers. Hopefully, another tragedy like this can be avoided. </p>

<h3>By Jim List</h3>

<p>	A record-breaking attempt gone terribly wrong.  A seven year old girl, her father, and their flight instructor dead.  Nothing can bring her back, but people are still wondering why Jessica Dubroff was flying in that plane. </p>
<p>	"I think the instructor and her father were crazy to attempt to fly the aircraft with a seven year old girl anywhere near the controls," commented Shannon Debele, a junior at Hunterdon Central, when asked about the Jessica Dubroff tragedy. </p>
<p>	Jessica was clearly not in control of the plane when it crashed, according to sources in the aviation field.  Lorraine Solberg, an Assistant Secretary at Solberg Airport in Readington, New Jersey, said that "an individual can obtain a solo license at the age of sixteen and jet pilot's license at the age of seventeen."  She added, "though that children can take flying LESSONS at any age, with an instructor present at all times."
<p>	Even with these facts, questions still remain.  Should Jessica have even been in the plane, and did her mother and father push her too hard to make her excel at such a young age? </p>
<p>	In a survey of 50 students done at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, NJ, almost sixty-four percent of those interviewed said that Jessica was too young to be in the plane, regardless of the fact that it crashed.  Many of those interviewed commented on the possibility that her parents pushed her too hard or that she was possibly not able to lead a normal childhood. </p>
<p>	An article in the April 22 issue of "Newsweek" stated that Jessica "was born at home (underwater), home schooled, taught vegetarian values, allowed no TV, and urged to work at a stable where she earned money to send to a poor child in India." </p>
<p>	Sara Roushey, a junior at Hunterdon Central, commented in regards to Jessica's strange upbringing, that "individuality is a very important quality that children need to know.  If you limit the things that are a 'choice' in life - you are limiting the people of the world their freedom that we, a society, are guaranteed in life in the United States.  That is why the United States is considered the country of opportunity." </p>
<p>	It would appear that from the opinions of the small portion of the student body that interviewed at Central, many young people think that perhaps Jessica was too young to be flying an airplane.</p>

<h1>One Parent Cautions Against Flying Too Young</h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Todd Smith</h3>
<p>		   
<p>	On April 11, the nightmare of Lisa Hathaway, mother of Jessica Dubroff, came true with a tragic plane crash in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Dick Nierenberg, the head flight instructor at Princeton airfield knows about being a parent of a child pilot. </p>
<p>	Nierenberg has only two prized possessions in his life, and they  are  his spouse Connie, and his son Jason.  "Jason was flying the plane with me as soon as his little head cold see out the window,"  said Nierenberg. </p>
<img align = left src = "flyfoto2.jpg"><p>	According to Nierenberg a person must reach the age of  sixteen years old before he or she can get his or her student license to fly a plane, and that person cannot even carry any passengers.   At seventeen a person can receive a private pilot's license. At eighteen, a person may get their commercial pilot license.  However, anyone may take flight lessons at any age. </p>
<p>	"I have taught twelve and thirteen year olds how to fly," said Nierenberg.   According to Nierenberg the young age of people that take lessons does not surprise him at all. </p>
<p>	"Flying a plane is not as hard as you may think," stated Nierenberg.  According to him, anyone that can steer a bike can fly a plane.  Anyone that flies a plane really has nothing to worry about in terms of traffic because the sky is not overcrowded with planes. </p>
<p>	When asked about whether he thought the flight was all right for a seven year old girl to approach Nierenberg said, "It is illegal for a girl that young to fly a plane in the first place, and I can almost guarantee you that she was not flying the plane when it crashed." </p>
<p>	According to Nierenberg, he thinks the whole idea of record breaking flights will be put to a stop.  He just feels sorry that it took the death of a seven year old girl to make the reality of this truth come true.  "I will bet you any amount of money that you will not be seeing any more record breaking flights for a while," said Nierenberg. </p>
<p>	When asked whether he would want his child to take a flight across the country at that young age Nierenberg said, "I can see the excitement in that a parent would go through if his or her child had the chance to break a record, but you really have to weigh all of the risk factors and base your decision on that." </p>
<p>	"I have never been faced with that decision.  And to tell you the truth, I really could not tell you what I would say if my child ever had the chance to fly across America,"  said Nierenberg. </p>
<p>	According to Nierenberg, the media has really blown this thing out of proportion.  "In the end, even though this accident was preventable, it was still very tragic," stated Nierenberg.  "We should not remember her not as Jessica the pilot, but Jessica the seven year old girl."</p>

<br>
<h3>By Beth Fultz and Sean Belden</h3>
<p>
	With all of the media surrounding terrorist bombings in England and the  conflict between China and Taiwan,  it is easy to forget the ongoing battles between our own kind--Americans vs. themselves. </p>

<p>
	Robert L. Maginnis, a policy analyst with the Family Research Council in Washington D.C., says that "gangs" have been around for centuries. </p>

<p>
"As early as the 1600's, London was terrorized by a series of organized gangs...who fought pitched battles among themselves dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions," he says in an article called <A HREF=" http://www.townhall.com/townhall/FRC/insight/is95j3cr.html"> "Youth Gangs:  Out of Control and Getting Worse" </A> published on the Internet. </p>
<p>
	Maginnis believes that contributing factors to the danger of gangs are the age and living arrangements of the members--most range from 8 to 22 years old and have a troubled family history. </p>

<p>
	"If you find a gang member who comes from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him", Maginnis says..."a real 'gangbanger' who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion of himself.  I don't think that kid exists." </p>

<p>
	Maginnis also comments about an unidentified member who gave his reason for joining a gang,  "Being in a gang means if I didn't have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have no job, that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and father." </p>

<p>
	According to another article concerning gang activity, <A HREF="http://www.nlnnet.com/nlnnet/gangs.shtml"> "Suburban Gangs" </A> gangs have become more prevalent in the United States since they are now present in suburbs as well as in inner cities. </p>

<p>
	Daniel Korem, the author of "Suburban Gangs," said; "In the late 1980's I watched gangs unnervingly form in my own Dallas suburb as well as countless other prosperous communities across the US.  Many assumed that urban gangs were expanding, but facts were that most affluent youths were forming their own gangs without inner-city influence." </p>

<p>
	Also MacGinnis states, that many gang related incidents have contributed to the fear of such organized groups.  "A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang spraying graffiti on a street; a Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered when the family fails to pay; Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member." </p>

<p>
	"Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent crime in the past decade" says Vice President Al Gore. </p>

<p>
	As for a solution to gang presence across the nation, <A HREF="http://www.winternet.com/~jannmart/nkcmag.html ">Mothers Against Gangs (MAG)</A> believes prevention is key; "We're not saying that we should save the guilty ones, but we do say that we can protect the innocent before they have the chance to become guilty."

<h3>By Rich Malysa </h3>
<p>
	"Click, click, bang, bang, that's how fast you'll drop, once I blow the cap," said a 
Hunterdon Central High School (Flemington, NJ) student. You might think that's a joke. But YES, there are gangs at Central.  Just this past year a gang known as the "Sun Ridge Posse" (from a housing development of the same name) attacked and beat someone on Halloween night.  The Sun Ridge Posse is made up of sophomores, juniors and seniors. </p>

<p>
	On Halloween in 1995 the Sun Ridge Posse was out looking for an innocent Halloweener so they could take his candy. They spotted a boy younger then themselves and attempted to take his candy.  When the boy refused to give his candy, the gang gave him a hard time.  The boy's older brother intervened and told the gang to leave his brother alone.  Then 10 gang members started to fight with the brother.  The brother fought off two of the gang members, but the group became too overwhelming for the individual.  During the fight a gang member beat the individual with a hockey stick over his head repeatedly. </p>

<p>
	The individual was seriously hurt but made has since made a full recovery.  Some members of the gang were arrested. </p>

<p>
	Another gang that seems to be making themselves public is the group CRACKHOUSE.  Their name seems to be spray painted on every school building.  They have yet to cause any serious trouble.  That gang consists of mostly sophomores. </p>

<p>
	When asked if Central had a gang problem, senior Jay Gambrill replied "I don't think we have a gang problem, but we have them."</p>

<p>
	When asked if he knew any names of gangs at school he said " The SRP (Sun Ridge Posse), CRACKHOUSE and I pull one leg up posse."</p>

<p>
	Why do students feel the need to join a gang?  Senior Jess Pici said "They need to feel wanted, they need to feel accepted by their peers." </p>

<p>
	Senior Jarrett Farrell that "Students join gangs because they feel insecure about themselves and when they are in a gang they feel secure." </p>

<p>
	What constitutes a gang? </p>

<p>
	Senior Chris Taffera "I think a large group is what constitutes a gang that sticks together through the thick and thin." </p>

<p>	When asked if any gang members were arrested in the past year or two, Lieutenant Robert Smith of Readington Township Police Department commented by saying  "No, not gang members.  Just groups of kids that get into trouble." </p>

<p>	When asked if the youth of the Readington have been forming gangs Lieutenant Smith said, "It just seems like more kids are getting in trouble these days with parties and drugs.  But there has been no real sign of gangs forming here in Readington." </p>

<h3>By Mike Guzy</h3>
<p>
	A youth or street gang is defined as a closely or loosely organized association of individuals who express their identification through private language,  symbolic behavior,  the wearing of "colors,"  and who commonly claim territory in a neighborhood, says an article about youth gang violence by Frank Granger Jr. M.Ed. a professor at the University of Alaska at Anchorage. </p>

<p>
	Across the country there is a startling rise in the number of kids involved in gangs, the number of gangs, and the number of instances of gang violence, an estimated 249,324 kids are involved in approximately 4,881 gangs nationally, according to James C  Howell Ph.D.  Howell also states that it is hard to get a real idea as there is no reporting system for gang activity.  As I was leaving my house with two other friends I was shot in the back.  I thought it was never going to happen to me,"  recalls a 15 year old city youth gang member, interviewed for an article called  "Where Youth Violence and Environment Intersect", on the Internet. That is what the problem is, youths have an indestructible attitude towards themselves. This attitude is what accounts for the high death and imprisonment rates among youth gang members. </p>

<p>
	<img align = left src = "gang3b.gif"> According to a National Institute of Justice survey in 1991 of law enforcement officials in the 79 largest U.S. cities the following results were obtained: an estimated 3,876 gangs are in existence, there are approximately 202,981 gang members and 36,265 recorded gang incidents. Remember these facts pertain only to 79 cities.  The survey also shows that only eight of the 79 police departments provide a detailed breakdown of gang related incidents. </p>

<p>
	The problem is a widespread one.  One would think that only inner city areas are susceptible to gang violence, but all areas are prone to the dealings and menace of gangs.  There is a definite predominance of gangs in urban areas, but the problem can be just as much of an epidemic in your hometown.  How might you think,? The answer is simple.  Gangs are not always prominent;  there are many different ways in which gang members exhibit their identity.  Rags, tattoos, clothes with street names on them - especially hats are all indicators of gang membership according to Granger.  Black, Asian, and white gangs all have different dress styles as well, he writes. </p>

<p>
	There are gangs that claim their territory and openly show their loyalty to each other through hand signs, wearing certain colors and marking their territory with graffiti.  There are other gangs such as Asian ones where the members dress as to conform to society.  Every gang has its own ways of making themselves known, some more prominently than others. </p>

<p>
	With the growing national problem of gangs there are many associated problems.  The things we have to deal with in the age of gangs are unreal and downright scary.  A gang is a very influential organization.  According to Granger, the reason youths join gangs is because, "it's cool, it's family, security, an identity, authority, boredom, glamorous image and they think it seems like fun."  When they join or "jump in" they are subjected to severe beatings with things such as baseball bats, pipes, fists, and other objects.  These beatings can last up to two solid minutes and if the "inductee" is still alive they are in.  The only problem to these youths once they have joined is that leaving is not easy either. Some gangs will sooner kill a member than let them walk out. </p>

<p>
	Once the gang has acquired their new member, some of the expectations are thing such as obtaining firearms by any means accessible, usually robbery of gun shops.  Each gang usually has a specialty such as burglary, extortion, and drive-by shootings which are retaliation against opposing gangs and their families for violating turf and disrespecting that gang. </p>

<p>
	On a final note, the following statistics were provided by Danielle Kilmer and Tricia Price of the Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis in Missouri.  90% of all male gang members have been arrested by age 18.  Ninety-five percent will not finish high school, and sixty percent are dead or in prison by age 20.  The movement of gang activity into a town or neighborhood is often followed by an increase in violent crime. </p>

<h1><img align = right src= "b_trn_pl.gif"> Internet Censorship: a Government View </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Anna Strizki</h3>
<p>
Internet Censorship is it fair or foul?  A recent rise in the controversy surrounding the Internet has caused much discussion over whether the telecommunications bill passed by President Clinton is a violation of the First Amendment or a protection system for users. </p>

<p>
If you ask Mr. James McConnaughey what his feelings are on the Telecommunications Bill  you will get some profound answers. McConnaughey is a staff member at OPAD, Office of Policy Analysis and Development:  United States Department of Commerce, a organization that analyzes issues relating not only to telecommunication conduits but also the content traveling through the conduits in the Internet.  It was conducted using chat on the Netcom service. </p>

<p>
Anna:  Hi James, I'm a student at Hunterdon Central looking for information about Internet censorship.  Do you think you can help me out? </p>

<p>
James:  Sure, I happen to work for OPAD, a company that analyzes issues relating not only to telecommunication conduits but also the content traveling through the conduits of the Internet. </p>

<p>
Anna:   Wow this is great!  So do you think I can interview you? </p>

<p>
James:  Yeah! </p>

<p>
Anna:   Thank you for taking time out to on-line chat with me for an interview. </p>

<p>
James:  You're welcome.  I feel honored that you choose me to speak with. </p>

<p>
Anna:  Well, shall we begin? </p>

<p>
James:  Ready when you are! </p>

<p>
Anna:  OK, first off I would like to tell you that this interview will be written up as a newsmaker interview for a cyber-newspaper my journalism class is creating.  Do you have any objectives about me using you as my source? </p>

<p>
James:  Well, just as long as you send me a copy of the article I won't mind. </p>

<p>
Anna:  OK!  That's a deal. </p>

<p>
James:  So where do we begin? </p>

<p>
Anna:  Well, first I want to know about the CDA? </p>

<p>
James:  The Communications Decency Act is the amendment passed in June 1995 that requires all content on the Internet to be acceptable for distribution to young children.  Mere discussion of sexuality, including health-related forums on such topics as birth control or sexually transmitted diseases, would be banned.  In essence the bill hinders the rights of free speech on the Internet. </p>

<p>
Anna:  How could such a bill get passed, if it is so blatantly infringing upon the 1st Amendment? </p>

<p>
James:  Hummm, hard question.  It seems to me that senators in Congress who were in favor of this bill sold everyone on it by playing on the emotions of the representatives about protecting children from the harsh topics that the Internet is accessible to, but they forgot to inform everyone about how much restriction this bill really does entail. </p>

<p>
Anna:  So then how do you propose that we prevent children from accessing inappropriate information? </p>

<p>
James:  So when did the parents loose all their responsibility for looking after what their kids are doing?  The Internet censorship should take place between parents and kids, it should not be left up to the government. </p>

<p>
Anna:  Well, I'm sure that many people agree with that point of view, but I do think that some guidelines need to be set about the accessibility that the Internet offers.  Something that would kind of be an extra measure to keep kids out of places that they shouldn't be. </p>

<p>
James:  There are things out there like "Net Nanny"  an program that rates the web pages and censors them if young children are on the computer.  Also a  lot of web pages make you prove that you are 18 yrs. old to continue view the material on them, but I'm not just talking about pornography.  The CDA actually hinders health-forums.  Teenagers who are not legally adults should be able to gain access to these websites.  If they are looking for information that is important to them why should the government be able to stop them? </p>

<p>
Anna:  You bring up a good point.  So what are the guidelines to what can stay on the Internet and what cannot? </p>

<p>
James:  The guidelines are so vague that your really don't know where it starts and stops.  I mean whose to say that you and someone are on-line chatting one day and your topic of conversation is of a controversial issue.  Does that mean that some on-line police will step in and make you stop "chatting."  Basically I think the entire thing is a joke.  How can the government tell people what they can and cannot talk about. </p>
<p>
Anna:  So what do you think about President Clinton signing the CDA but promising not to enforce certain provisions of the bill, such as the ban on abortion discussion? </p>

<p>
James:  Make up your mind Clinton!  He never should have signed that bill in the first place.  He is completely contradicting himself be signing it, yet "promising not to enforce certain provisions." </p>

<p>
Anna:  Well its getting late so I have only one more question for you.  So is there anything people can do to fight this Internet censorship? </p>

<p>
James:  There are so many groups that are on-line that are fighting this legislation.  All you need to do is search for them on the Internet.  I myself cannot directly tell you of any groups due to who I am employed by, but if you look you will find them. </p>

<p>
Anna:  Well thank you so much for your time.  You have provided me with some great information.  Thanks, bye. </p>

<p>
James:  No problem, the Internet is my life.  Bye.

<p>

Whenever you hear the words, "First Amendment," you should remember that it was designed to protect offensive speech and offensive speakers, says  Mike Godwin, a California lawyer.  And the Senators now in office do not seem to understand what is happening, according to  Godwin. </p>
<p>

"The votes of Senators and Representatives were driven for the most part, by fear and ignorance," says Godwin. </p>
</body>

<p>
Are any of these Representatives actually logging on themselves?  Have they surfed the Net?  Done any benefiting research on the Net? Or are they doing, as Godwin says, "something that doesn't require any on-line time at all, passing bad laws?" </p>


<p>
Now the U.S. is dealing with one of, perhaps, the most testing form of the freedom of speech part of the Constitution.  As an article by the ACLU put it, "where are these Representatives and Senators who swore to uphold the First Amendment?" </p>

<p>
According to the ACLU, Dianne Feinstein, a Senator from California, is "ready to ban information from the Net that is legal in every library."  And that, "perhaps because she's under the impression that it cost nothing to create the fiction that she's preventing another Oklahoma City," although it is of course costing us the freedom our forefathers tried and fought so hard to protect. </p>


<p>
And then there is Senator Jim Exon from Nebraska, who becomes nervous when interviewers ask him whether he personally has logged on.  Maybe this the cause for Mr. Exon's idea that, "the Net is just another place to make an obscene phone call," as one of Mr. Godwin's recent articles points out. </p>

<p>
This issue does not define differences in liberals & conservatives.  Mr. Godwin said, "Orrin Hatch, conservative Republican, & Pat Schroeder, liberal Democrat," have already voted to do the same as all the other, perhaps, unknowing, are doing.  "That sound of ripping paper...is the Constitution," Mr. Godwin states. </p>

<h1><img align = right src = "milit1.jpg">Militias Challenge Basic Constitutional Beliefs </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Sean Donnelly</h3>
<p>

	Upon taking an overall view of this decade, one may wonder exactly what is going on in this nation  There is a movement of the kind that we have never seen before on this level of potency, anti-establishment extremism thrown at us through the media.  It's known to all of us as the militia movement.  But as this whole movement is in parts so recent and so ancient, it can be difficult to establish exactly where the movement began.  More importantly, where does one find the truth with this issue? </p>

<p>
	The militia question centers on the 2nd Amendment.  The right to bear arms is one that has been brought to question repeatedly.  In the developmental era of American history, the right to bear arms was rarely examined (in fact, it was only examined a total of 22 times in state courts prior to 1906 according to the New Jersey Court Record ).  However, in the last century, the situation has clearly changed.  We moved from a nation that in many areas required guns to ensure domestic security to it being the major threat to domestic tranquillity in our nation. The United States, in fact, has the largest per capita murder rate due to guns, yet we claim to be the leading power of the developed world.  As a result, gun control laws have been enacted. Many support these laws, saying the 2nd Amendment does not protect the right to guns, it simply defends the right to be organized in a militia. </p>

<p>
	But not just any militia, for in 1968, New Jersey's highest court deemed that the 2nd Amendment has nothing to do with the individual rights; it is one established for the national good. </p>

<p>
	But, with the right to assemble for whatever reason held by all Americans has blossomed into the spawning mushroom cloud we see now.  It goes back to one Randy Weaver in December 1990.  He was a known white supremacist, and was indicted for allegedly selling illegal guns to an informer for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).  Weaver, a self-proclaimed proponent of anti-government views, failed to show up in court in January, 1991, causing federal officials to pursue his arrest.  By the time they were done with that eleven day siege, a Federal Deputy Marshall, Weaver's wife, and Weaver's son were dead. At this point, militias were growing, but the anti-gun movement would culminate in later years, so there was no major opposition to the movement. </p>

<p>
	The second event to occur of major note in recent years was the incident at Waco, Texas.  Again the ATF was called in, this time for illegal stockpiling of weapons on February 28, 1993.  Four ATF agents and six members of the Branch Davidian Sect died that day, and from it there was spawned a 51 day stand off.  By the time the smoke cleared, 80 Branch Davidians were dead. Of those, 18 were children from the fire started in the second assault.  It is clear from both the government and the masses that the ATF and FBI proceeded with poor judgment, but there was no law broken by these agencies in the events that occurred over the siege. </p>

<p>
	The issue of militias is not a simple one in American society, nor will it be soon forgotten or ignored.  Accusations from both sides are extreme, such as some militia supporters claiming that the Oklahoma city bombing was used to create the anti-militia feeling across the United States.  But this is a new era. To learn how to make a bomb on a home computer with a modem is as easy these days as it is to look up your friends phone number in the phone book. </p>

<p>
	Not only are we seeing a closet movement of individuals stockpiling for the future, for what we have now is a mainstreaming of the militia cause. If one wishes to hear of the battles for the militias, one no longer has to turn on an underground radio station; one can get the information on prime time AM.  G. Gordon Liddy, a talk show host of increasing popularity, has announced on AM radio that "They've got a big target there, ATF.  Don't shoot at that because they've got a vest underneath.  Head shots.  Head shots."  Mr. Liddy later said that one should aim for the groin after the Oklahoma Bombing.  And Mr. Liddy is not alone in his on air views. </p>

<p>
	Yet, according to ATF reports, here in New Jersey, we are free of any large Militia movement (or any known militia movement for that matter).  Of the Mid-Atlantic and New England Regions, the only state to have any noticible problem with the Militia is New York.  The National Unorganized Militia, centered in Indianapolis, is believed to have divisions through out the region, but small ones at best. </p>

<p>
	Alan Umgelter, Hunterdon recipient for the County's Most Caring student from his involvement in the community is clear about his opinions.  "Unless the Militia is one of government establishment, it should not allowed.   The community cannot survive with these kinds of groups running around." </p>

<br>
<h3>By Mike Pensak</h3>
<p>

	Militia groups are receiving a lot of attention from the press these days, from the disaster in Waco, Texas with David Koresh to the "Freemen" in Montana to the horrible tragedy in Oklahoma City to the arrest and prosecution of the Unabomber. There is no doubt about it, militia groups are growing  throughout the United States. </p>

<p>
	Although militia groups are widespread, there still seems to be some confusion on what a militia really is, who is in these militias, and why are there militias?  According to a Michigan Militiaman named Dutchman, who was contacted via E-mail and the internet,  a militia is any military force; any army composed of  citizens rather than professional soldiers, called out in time of emergency.  But, as militia groups continue to gain numbers, so does their negative publicity. </p>

<p>
	Brian Finney, a senior at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, NJ, stated, "as long as they stay in the laws of the Constitution, they should be allowed to do their thing."  But it seems that not many people know exactly what militia groups are all about. </p>

<p>
	"I never really thought about it,"  said Junior Tom Byrne from Hunterdon Central. "It is kind of scary because they are all hidden and they have a lot of guns." </p>

<p>
	According to an artical done in Media Beat, militia groups in New Jersey are few and far between, but there are some other extremist groups that have a major impact on the region.  The Northeast contains a large population of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.  Broadcasting from WABC in New York, radio talkshow host Bob Grant has been a magnet for callers from these type groups.  According to the article,  they use Grant's show to publicize their propaganda and phone numbers. </p>

<p>
	"White supremacist groups are crazy," said senior Ron Williams.  "They will do anything to shape people's mind." </p>

<p>
	In New Hope, Pennsylvania, where there is a large gay and lesbian population, there is an annual march by anti-gay organizations in protest of the different lifestyles.  Hundreds of people come out in demonstration of there free speech, while actually denying free speech for homosexuals. </p>

<p>
	"I am not in favor of homosexuality," said senior Paul Shrieber.  "But people should not demonstrate against their lifestyle." </p>

<p>
	"So much has happened since the horrendous bombing in Oklahoma City," said columnist Jeff Cohen, "that the initial media coverage may already seem a distant memory."   But to every one in Oklahoma the memories of that day will never go away. </p>
<p>

And militia groups, hate groups, and terrorism will continue to impact countries. </p>

<p>
	"I think it is important to keep in mind everyone's freedom of speech," said Finney.  "But the government has to make sure they don't cross the line." </p>

<h1> Local Serviceman Speaks Out on the Unabomber </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Tara Petraglia</h3>
<p>
	"In my opinion the Unabomber is an insane genius,"  stated Paul Fania. He is a 36-year-old member of the U.S. army and a resident of Flemington (NJ). He has strong opinions on Ted Kaczynski and is against militia groups.  "At one point he is a genius, and then another factor of his characteristics is that he is just plain mad." </p>

<p>
<p>
	"Kaczynski's actions seem never to be rational but always have a  motive.  His motive is that he is very educated.  I do not think that he meant to kill anyone.  He just wanted to get his point across, and in my opinion he made a startling attempt,"  said Fania. </p>

<p>
	The question came up if he thought that militias encourage people like Kaczynski to take actions as he did.  After thinking for about 30 seconds he came up with the conclusion that people are going to agree with his views but they are not going to follow his actions. </p>

<p>
	"Militias are wrong, there are better ways to solve problems with government then to start your own," he said.</p>

<p>
	"Yes it's very easy to find a way to make bombs.  People like Kaczynski will influence people to make bombs just because he proved that it's so easy,"  commented Fania.  He said that he has read articles and home pages on the computer. There are specific instructions on how to make a bomb, and where you can find the materials to make one. </p>

<p>
	"I read Kaczynski's home page on the internet," states Fania. "That piece of information is a prime example that he definitely needs help.  He has a section that states how to make a bomb.  So, yeah, it's going to make a lot curious people click on that topic and check out how to make one." </p>

<p>
	"Ted Kaczynski is a genius intellect and an agenda. It's amazing how that's all he needed to reign terror for so many years...," Fania concluded.</p>

<h1>Local Youths Cope With Minimum Wage </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Karen Bowater</h3>
<p>
	In the United States, the national rate of minimum wage is $4.25 an hour, putting wages at an all-time low value for this country.  As for the average rate paid in Flemington and other parts of New Jersey, the minimum wage is $5.05 an hour, slightly above the national rate. </p>

<p>	The minimum wage issue is especially important to those who live and work in Flemington.  There are many part-time workers in Flemington since it's a big outlet shopping area, workers that are generally paid the minimum wage. </p>

<p>	"I work a total of about 10 hours a week here," said Rob Napalitano, a 15 year old who works at the Ice Cream Factory Plus in Liberty Village of Flemington, NJ He was surprised that New Jersey's minimum wages were higher than the country's wages of $4.25 an hour. He also stated that he didn't know that he couldn't work any more than 40 hours a week being under the age of 18. </p>

<p>	When Rob was asked if the country's minimum wages should be raised, he quickly responded "NO! Once we up the country's minimum wage the prices of everything will rise. Everything will be so expensive."  He went onto say that, "This country will tax you on anything and everything they can.  And another thing , if they do end up raising the wages, it will probably be taken out our paychecks in taxes anyway." </p>

<p>	Rob's comments are representative of the attitudes of most people (especially teenagers) who live and work in Flemington, and get paid the minimum wage.  Although Rob does not agree with a raise in the minimum wage, most people are still undecided. </p>

<h1> Minimum Wage In Hunterdon County</h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Paul Bowen</h3>
<p>		
	With summer right around the corner, and college kids coming home, and high school kids getting out, the question arises: Is the minimum wage enough to support you for the summer? In New Jersey the minimum wage is $5.05.  This seems to be plenty for a kid living at home wanting some spare change, but can this amount support a family? </p>

<p>	"$5.05 an hour is plenty enough for me, but I can't see anyone living off it,"  says Junior Phil Santos who is currently employed by Bishop's Thriftway is Whitehouse. </p>

 But according to R.H. Wheatley, a Democratic leader, minimum wage is more than what a person recieves in their paycheck.  Along with benefits, unemployment insurance, and social security the cost of employing someone who makes $5.00 an hour actually costs the employer $7.50 an hour.  According to Mr. Wheatley, if the minimum wage is raised, the actual cost of employing someone is raised, and most likely inflation would occur. </p>
		
Currently, President Bill Clinton is pushing to increase the federal minimum wage from $4.25 up to $5.15 an hour. Richard A. Gephardt, a House Democratic Leader, states that of the 4.8 million people working for $4.25 an hour, 3.4 million are adults. </p>
<p>	Since the 1980s, the minimum wage in real dollars has been decreasing. In 1980, it was the equivalent of $5.95 in 1995 dollars. It was at $4.50 in 1985 and currently at $4.25 according to a recent graph put out by the Democratic party. Despite the rising cost of living for a family the minimum wage has continued to fall according to the Democratics. </p>
<p>	However, in Hunterdon County the minimum wage increases to $5.05 an hourly rate according to people who earn the minimum wage locally, such as Nick Altieri, a junior at Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, NJ and an employee of Wald Drugs in Flemington. </p>
<p>	Employment has changed and increased  in the last twenty -three years and now it is steady at 75% which means, 3 out of every 4 person(s) works in Hunterdon County according to a data chart put out by the Hunterdon Chamber of Commerce. </p>

<p>	The question remains, however, as to how valuable a raise in the minimum wage would be to the average Hunterdon County family. </p>

<br>
<h3>By Lori Sulewski</h3>
<p>

	As the minimum wage's value approaches a 40-year, all-time low, a bipartisan rumble of sorts has been initiated in both the House of Representatives and the Senate in regard to raising the current federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour. </p>
<p>	Democrats, led by President Bill Clinton are pushing for the two-step, 90 cent increase as they face opposition from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. </p>
<p>	Concerned that the real value of the minimum wage has fallen 50 cents since its last increase in 1991 (a raise then supported by both Dole and Gingrich), the Democrats are trying to garner up enough support to get a vote scheduled on raising the wage, a move that four out of five Americans favor and a move that would benefit the US's 10-13 million workers currently receiving the minimum wage. </p>
<p>	According to House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt, "America needs a minimum wage increase.  And the U.S. Congress needs a straightforward, up-or-down vote--with no special interest amendments to try to blur the issue, or kill the bill altogether." </p>
<p>	Despite the unexpected endorsement of the wage increase by 21 House Republicans, Dole and Gingrich remain firm in their determination to package a wage increase with other provisions such as a $500-per-child tax credit, a tax cut, tax incentives for businesses, possible government  subsidies for workers, and an additional provision to repeal the Democratic gasoline tax increase of 1993. </p>
<p>	So why is there a federal minimum wage?  Whom does it benefit?  The federal minimum wage was created as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in order to prevent worker exploitation and to give unskilled and part-time workers a starting amount of money to live off of.  It has evolved today to be the lowest wage acceptable nationally. </p>
<p>	According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 9.7 million workers would benefit directly from a minimum wage increase, 38.8% of which would be the sole breadwinners in their families, and 70% of which are adults. </p>
<img align = left src = "spkr-new.jpg"> <p>	As it stands now, the biggest debate raging in Congress over the minimum wage increase has to do with how beneficial a raise would be.  The Democrats' main concern is the decrease in the buying value of the current minimum wage for poor families.  According to Gephardt, "Wages are a family value.  The minimum wage pays about $8500 a year--less than welfare.  It now buys less than at any time in the last 40 years." </p>
<p>	President Clinton, in his Saturday  radio address of March 30 maintains that "Raising the minimum wage would honor both work and  family.  We should not leave behind anyone who is willing to work hard as our country moves forward."  Clinton also went on to say that "...we must make sure the minimum wage is a living wage." </p>
<p>	The Republicans, however, counter this by insisting that a raise in the minimum wage will result in a job shortage because the additional cost of a wage increase would discourage businesses from creating new employment opportunities.  "Somebody is going to lose their job because somebody else gets an increase," said Dole. </p>
<p>	According to Gingrich, "Republicans believe  the best way to increase the take-home pay of American workers is to lower their taxes, lower the cost of government red tape, and increase the incentives for investment to create more and better-paying jobs. </p>
<p>	The real test for both parties now is to schedule a vote on this issue in accordance with party politics-the Republicans want the increase to be packaged with other provisions, while the Democrats favor a separate vote.  The task appears especially daunting for the Republicans as more of that party sides with the Democrats, making the wage raise an increasingly bipartisan issue.  "I will fight to the end to have a vote on the minimum wage," said Republican Connecticut Representative Christopher Shays. </p>
<p>	National Economic Adviser Laura D'Andrea, too, echoes the typical Democratic sentiment that the "bipartisan minimum wage train has left the station and rather than slow it down with political gimmicks and controversial amendments, Majority Leader Dole should immediately schedule a clean, fair vote on raising the minimum wage." </p>
<p>	Along the same lines, Gephardt stated that "Ultimately they're (Republicans) going to lose on this issue.  So I'd suggest that they simply accept the inevitable, admit defeat, and schedule a clean, up-or-down vote." </p>
<p>	Still, there are some Republicans who refuse to view the minimum wage as a pressing issue.  House Whip Tom DeLay,  a Texas Republican, stated that, "Emotional appeals about working families trying to get by on $4.25 an hour are hard to resist.  Fortunately, such families don't really exist." </p>
<p>	At this point, even Dole himself seems to sense his waning Congressional support on the wage increase issue.  "I would guess, if I had to guess, that there probably will be an increase in the minimum wage," he stated during an NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw interview. </p>
<p>	Representative Shays concludes that if the Republican leaders don't come up with an acceptable proposal in regard to increasing the minimum wage by June, Republican support could drop drastically, with a possibility of a total of 50 Republicans joining House Democrats for a comfortable majority on the final vote. </p>

<h1> Students Register for Election </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Heather Olszyk</h3>
<p>
	Election time is almost here, and everyone around Hunterdon County is beginning to register to vote.  Here at Hunterdon Central High School in Flemington, New Jersey,  young voters are also getting ready to register through a special voter registration program set up through the school.  One of it's own political science teachers, Mrs. Maureen Startzel, is in charge of it. </p>
<p>
	According to Startzel, many of the students registered here at Central are very much interested in politics and the many issues that surround this year's election.  Startzel states, "It's extremely important that students have a say, because the next four years are very crucial to them."  Startzel says that there are a number of issues that the students are interested in for this upcoming election.  One of those issues includes the environment.  According to Startzel, there are concerns that funding will be cut if Republicans stay in power.  Another important issue that concerns the young voters here at Central is the crime that's on the rise in the United States.  According to Startzel, the selection of federal judges plays a big part in this issue.  She said, "Whoever is on the bench will have an enormous say on crime, drugs, and violence in the years to come." </p>
<p>
	According to Startzel, there are two different methods of registration that young voters can use here in New Jersey.  Through Hunterdon Central, there is a form that students must come and get from her once they turn eighteen.  "The piece that's missing is student responsibility to register," said Startzel.  	

	Another newer method used in New Jersey is called Motor Voter.  According to Startzel, when you get your drivers license at seventeen, you register, and a year later when you turn eighteen, a form is sent to you in the mail.  Startzel said that there used to be voting machines here at Hunterdon Central, but due to the lack of funding, we don't have them anymore. </p>
<p>
	According to Startzel, you must register thirty days before you vote in either the primaries or the election.  Once you do so, and hand it in to her, the form is then mailed to the County Seat here in Hunterdon County. </p>
<p>
	Startzel feels strongly that once a student turns eighteen, it is their duty to go and register to vote.  One of the reasons why she feels so strongly about this is because she was recently appointed by Jack Collins to the Task Force on Curriculum.  According to Startzel, she is making sure that young voter registration is making it's way to the top of their list. </p>
<p>
	Startzel feels that registering students is "an ongoing thing" here at Central for her.  Thanks to her, it will remain an ongoing thing for years to come. </p>

<h1>First Time Voters Mull Choices </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Phil Santos </h3>
<p>


<p>
	The up and coming presidential election in November will be the first chance that this generation gets to vote.  Some look forward to playing a role in the country's future and others are not so sure they want to vote yet.  The question on everybody's mind is will the new generation know what is right for our country? </p>
<p>
	Students at Hunterdon Central are looking forward to making that big step into deciding the country's future.  In a recent poll of 50 students, half the students know who they are going to vote for already and over half said they know that their vote makes a difference.  This shows great interest by the students.  Senior Jason Goodfriend said, "I am proud to finally participate in our country's future" </p>
<p>
	But not all school's are as optimistic as Central.  Barry Reed, a Voorhees High School (Glen Gardner, NJ)  senior, said "It's just another step toward growing up.  No big deal." </p>
<p>
	John Gallis, a former North Hunterdon High School (Annandale, NJ)  student,  said "It's something that you look forward to until it's there.  Now it's just another responsibility." </p>
<p>
	Fifty percent of those polled were voting Republican.  Thirty-four percent were going to vote Democratic, while 19 percent said they were going to be independent. Seventy-five percent said that their parents had some type of influence on their decision. </p>
<p>
	When November comes around, the country will see a new generation of voters. </p>

<h1><img align = left src = "robyn.jpg">The Prom is a Costly Affair </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Robyn Fajen</h3>
<p>
	Every spring in high schools around the country, prom time appears.  Everyone gets dressed up, finds a date, and may even rent a limo for the big night. Here at Hunterdon Central High School in Flemington, NJ, nothing is different, except for the price. </p>

<p>
	This year the junior prom at Central cost $85.00 per couple and $45.00 per person.  To some people this may seem a fair price considering that you get a dinner, the hotel, and a D.J. for the night.  But for many juniors, it wasn't finding a date that kept them from the prom. It was the $85.00.  Along with the cost of a dress or a tuxedo, going to the prom becomes very expensive. </p>

<p>
	"My boyfriend had been saving up almost all year so he could take me to the prom, but then he got into a small fender bender with his car and all the money had to go for that instead," stated junior Nicole DiGeronimo. </p>

<p>
	"If the prom had cost less that wouldn't have happened"  junior Ashley Weber remarked. </p>

<p>
	Even though there are proms out there that cost well beyond Central's $85.00, is there really a good reason that they should?  One of the good aspects of having "classes" in high school is so that your class can raise money for such events as the prom.  This is something that Hunterdon Central's junior class does not seem to have.  The effect of this is that many students could not attend. </p>

		...What Some Organizations Are Doing to Stop Drinking and Driving </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Melissa Hults</h3>
<p>

<p>
	Alcohol related automobile crashes are among the leading causes of death among teenagers. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, of the 3,197 teens that were killed in automobile accidents[last year?], 2,217 of those accidents were alcohol related. Statistics also show  that in 1993, 87% of high school seniors have used alcohol, and with the end of the school year quickly approaching, alcohol could be a deadly problem. Mary Sabine, the United States coordinator of Prom Promise, a program that promotes abstinence from alcohol and drugs on prom night, says that "the rate of alcohol related crashes increases in the spring and continues to do so through graduation  in June." </p>

<p>
	Prom Promise, a program  that began in 1990, is sponsored by the Nationwide Insurance Company based in Columbus, Ohio. The program, according to Ms. Sabine, supports "no use" of alcohol on prom nights, and is a  "special safety effort offered free to high schools as  a way for schools to provide a positive, fun program for their students to encourage a drug and alcohol free prom night." </p>

<p>
	In 22 states nearly 3 million teens in 3,500 high schools will participate in Prom Promise. "When teens sign the Nationwide Prom Promise, they are making a commitment not to use alcohol or drugs on prom night," according to Sabine. </p>

<p>
	Information on such programs is all over the Internet, and phone numbers for organizations, such as Mothers Against Driving Drunk, can be found in most local phone books.   The Flemington (NJ) Department Store is a local sponsor of a program which promotes "not drinking and driving  on prom night." Developed by the Lane Company of Altavista, Virginia, makers of caskets and wooden cedar chests since the 1930's, this preventative program gives miniature cedar chests to students who pledge not to drink and drive on prom night. According to Mr. Carl Resnick, one of the owners of the Department Store, schools receive pledge cards in April and May, and students who sign them can receive the free box from participating stores. </p>

<p>
	Resnick also remembers a time when he was in the National Guard and there was a drunk driving accident near the local high school in the spring. </p>

<p>
	"They would remove the bodies, and not clean up anything else," he explained. "Then a flatbed would come and take the car to the lawn of the school. It served as a grim reminder during the time of proms and graduation of what could happen if you drink and drive." </p>

<p>
	Ms. Sally Beckweth of the Somerset/Hunterdon (NJ) Counties Chapter of M.A.D.D. says that around prom time, members of their chapter, some of whom have lost children of their own to drinking and driving, " hold candlelight vigils and distribute red ribbons to people as a  reminder of the dangers of drunk driving.  The warning?  Drinking and driving kills...and it could be your child next." </p>

<p>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that  "in 1993, someone died in the U.S. every 30 minutes, and someone was injured every 2 minutes as a result of drunk driving." This amounts to 17,461 people killed, and 289,000 injured in 1993 as a direct result of drunk driving." </p>

<p>
	Again, on the local level, South Hunterdon Regional High School (NJ) holds a surprise mock crash on their football field. S.A.D.D. member, Kelly Boyle explains, "One day in the spring, sirens and whistles can be heard during class. An announcement comes on the loud speaker and all students report to the football field. There they see what is a simulation of a crash. They see their friends dead, the paramedics treating injured victims, and a drunk driver led off by police. The students re-enact this themselves to make the message hit home that they could be the victim killed in such an accident...or they could be the one being led off in handcuffs." </p>

<p>
	It is illegal for persons under 21 to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages, but statistics show that almost a half a million high school students go on weekly binges(consuming more than 5 alcoholic beverages  in a row on a single occasion). According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2 in 5 Americans will be involved in an alcohol related crash at some time in their lives. Organizations like M.A.D.D. and Nationwide Prom Promise, are working hard to stop those accidents from happening all together--especially at prom time. </p>

<h3>By Alexis Rascio</h3>
<p>


	Before you step out of that expensive limousine on your senior prom night,  just remember that you are stepping into a tradition that even most of your parents have been involved in.  So when your parents waste 15 rolls of film on you and your date and send you out the door, remember that they went through the same torture.  The fact is you are becoming part of a tradition, the evolution of the prom. </p>

<p>	In the fifties, Elvis Presley's sexually suggestive hip gyrations and Buddy Holly's "Peggy Sue" rocked the world; slicked back ducktails and bouffant hairdos were in style.  As for the proms, "we didn't have limousines to drive us around," said Sandy Creek High School (Ga.) teacher Ralph Cobb, according to one of his students.   Cobb says the ideal prom of the fifties included a couple driving into the school parking lot in a '57 Chevy Belair Convertible. </p>

<p>	"Our prom was held in the school gymnasium and the food was simply catered," said business teacher John English, also a teacher at Sandy Creek.  Colleague Rocco Donofrio, who attended his senior prom in the fifties said, "One difference I have seen is that people come as large groups nowadays.  When I went, the students came in only as couples." </p>

<p>	From the Beetles to the Stones and from Motown to Soul Rock, the sixties and early seventies had their own unique style.  Physical education teacher John Degelman, also from Sandy Creek said, "The dresses worn by girls today are a lot more revealing; girls in my time always wore floor length gown."  Business teacher Anita Parciasepe said, "When I chaperoned here I was amazed to see many boys wearing sneakers with there tuxedos.  That was never done at my prom."  As for after the prom Degelmann said, "Embarrassingly enough, after my prom I went to Emerson Dairy Queen; I took my date for an ice cream cone.  Let's just say she was pretty pissed." </p>

<p>	Skipping to the Big 80's, although only ten years ago , the proms of the eighties had certain differences then today.  Art teacher Nicole DiPaolo, who attended the prom in the 80's, said,  "Although I haven't chaperoned a prom here yet, I'm aware that a prom ticket is more expensive now from when I went.  The themes of the proms since I went have also changed."  With all these differences math teacher Tom Quinn seems to disagree.  "The proms today are, in my opinion, basically the same as when I went to the prom.  We had a disc jockey and a large majority arrived in a limousine. </p>

<p>	Angele Cananill, a helpful student within the search, believes that the idea of going to the prom has become less and less thrilling and more and more of, well, a hassle.  Upon thinking about going to the junior prom next year, a sophomore who attends high school in Arizona, Josiah Chung, stated, "The junior prom's nothing- just warm up for the senior prom.  I'd actually rather not go the junior prom because you have to find a date, make up plans like how to get there, plus all the money that's involved.... I'd rather spend my money on a basketball game."  Also, let's not forget, the cost of the "ultimate experience" of arriving in a limo.  In the end, the more one wants their prom to be memorable, the more bucks he needs to pay for it.  According to junior Rachel Sterk, one of Josiah's friends, "You have to be prepared to spend at least $350 on the whole thing."	</p>

<p>	Sandy Creek High School provided the most information regarding their prom. Their prom was held at the Fox Theatre in the Egyptian Ballroom on May 4.  The price of their prom was $30 per ticket for seniors and $35 for juniors.  Their prom was a formal event.  Attire for ladies and men was appropriate and in good taste.  Neither jeans of any color nor shorts were acceptable.  Footwear appropriate to the outfit was required. </p>

<p>	Some say that the prom seems to have lost 'magical' effect that it had on people years ago, but most students are still looking forward to it.  Jordan Knapp, a sophomore at Sandy Creek, who doesn't like dancing, said he'd still attend because "it's still an experience of a lifetime." </p>

<h1>Planned Parenthood is One Source of Information</h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Muffy Gryctko</h3>
<p>



	Did you ever fear that you might be pregnant?  Were you ever unsure about how to protect yourself?  Of course, many teens today have those questions, but there are ways that you can get the answers. </p>
<p>
	 Michele McCarthy is a former employee for Planned Parenthood in Flemington. She had the chance to help teens every day in making the decisions needed to have a healthy life. </p>
<p>
	McCarthy worked for Planned Parenthood for three years. It was like a dream job for her.  McCarthy said, "Ever since I was little I have always wanted to help people." She felt that she could get the most out of working for an organization like Planned Parenthood. </p>
<p>
	 After attending Rutgers University, she used to her education and her experience from Planned Parenthood to further her career in the field of delivering babies Somerset Medical Center.  She has the compassion to deal with helping mothers of all ages. </p>

 <p>
	One of the reason why McCarthy  chose Planned Parenthood was because she feels that it does a good job in helping teens think about their future.  She said, "Planned Parenthood does not promote sex, it gives them options to be safe if they decide to have sex." </p>

<p>
	She said that the number of teens having sex is on the rise, but so is the number of teens coming to Planned Parenthood for help in protecting themselves. </p>

<p>
	"The main reason for teens to come to Planned Parenthood is because they needed a pregnancy test. Young girls would come here scared that they  might be pregnant, we would counsel them about their options and then help them to make a decision," said McCarthy. </p>

<br>
<h3>By Tim Kirk</h3>
<p>

<p>
	Can you imagine being just fourteen or fifteen years old and having a baby?  What would you do for money?  What would you do about school?  Do you actually think you could take on the responsibility of a mother or a father? </p>

<p>
	Many teens today are forced to make decisions about such serious subjects as when to have sex, where to get protection, and if in fact they are pregnant, what to do with the baby. </p>

<p>
	Julie Furlong, a senior at Hunterdon Central High School in Flemington, NJ, explains that she couldn't imagine having a baby right now.  She has college ahead of her next year and would never have the money to support a baby and herself.  Furlong said, "That is why I took the responsibility and went to Planned Parenthood." </p>

<p>
	Senior Nick Zemlachenko, a senior at Hunterdon Central also, said, "I would not mind having to take my girlfriend to Planned Parenthood if I knew that it would help us in the end." </p>
	
<p>
	According to Furlong,  more and more teenagers are facing reality and taking responsibility by protecting themselves from the risk of getting pregnant and sexually transmitted diseases. </p>
<p>
	Michelle McCarthy, a former counselor at Planned Parenthood, explained that Planned Parenthood is a local, confidential, and inexpensive clinic for teenagers to go to for birth control, pregnancy, and STD testing.  McCarthy said, "I wish more young girls would come to us for help rather than just thinking that they won't get pregnant or contract a sexually transmitted disease because they are lucky." </p>
<p>
	According to McCarthy, young girls feel more confident about themselves when they know that they are protecting themselves.  According to Furlong, "it takes a weight off their shoulders." </p>
<p>
	Marcy Berger, a counselor at Morristown Planned Parenthood, explains that although the number of teenage girls getting pregnant has decreased, it is still too high.  Berger commented, "There is no excuse for young girls getting pregnant, when there is such a convenient and confidential service available.  If these young teens are embarrassed to seek birth control, maybe they should think if they are really mature enough to have sex." </p>
<p>
	McCarthy added that the most common form of birth control that teenagers are 
using is the pill or the condom.  The pill is the most effective form of birth control, but 
teens have to remember that it doesn't prevent sexually transmitted diseases.  That is why 
they have to use a condom in conjunction with the pill. </p>
<p>
	"The only 100% way to prevent contracting a sexually transmitted disease or 
getting  pregnant is abstinence" said McCarthy. </p>

<p>
	"If you are going to take on the responsibility of having sex, than you have to be 
responsible enough to face the consequences,"  Zemlachenko stated. </p>

<h1> More and More Teenaged Girls Becoming Pregnant </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Amy Dembeski</h3>
<p>	There was once a time when people considered it immoral to have a child without a husband.  But in today's society more and more teenage girls are becoming pregnant alone and without a husband or father figure in that child's life. </p>

<p>	"In 1988, two-thirds of births to women under age 20 were to unmarried women -- 54 percent of the births to whites and 91 percent of the births to blacks were nonmarital and there were 10,588 babies born to teenagers aged 14 and younger -- 94 percent of these births were nonmarital," according to Planned Parenthood. </p>

<p>	These statistics show that in the United States many unwanted children are being born.  Does this mean that  teens in the U.S. are not practicing any forms of birth control?  These birth rate statistics would make us think that teens do not use birth control.  Here are some facts that also come into play. </p>

<p>
	"Substantially more teenage women today use a contraceptive method the first time they have vaginal intercourse than did so in 1982 (65 percent versus 38 percent).  Yet one-third use no protection the first time they have sex," says Planned Parenthood. </p>

<p>	Planned Parenthood says, "Teenage women are more likely to use contraceptives now more than ever.  But now  teenagers  are more likely than an other group to be non users of contraceptive one in five currently use no method of contraceptive." </p>

<p>	Do you think that the teenagers across the U.S. are getting the proper sex education?  Well, according to a 1994 study done by the Public Agenda, "First Things First," they found that a majority of Americans want sex education to begin in the sixth grade.  Also, 95 percent of the American people say that students should learn the biology of sex and pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. </p>

<p>	 Family Planning Perspectives says, "For example, most teachers think topics like contraception, condom use, and abortion should be taught before the end of the seventh grade." </p>

<p>	Teen pregnancy is not the matter of having fun it is a matter of being responsible and having self control.  Many people have an opinion on teenagers having sex.  They are especially concerned about all the problems and complication that come with sex, such as AIDS, STD's, and getting pregnant. In this day and age there is only one real way to be safe from these problems, that is abstinence.  	</p>

<p>	Planned Parenthood states,"Eighty-five percent of women who use no contraceptives during vaginal intercourse become pregnant each year. The only guarantee against pregnancy is not having vaginal intercourse. Other contraceptive methods can greatly reduce your pregnancy risk during vaginal intercourse." </p>

<p>	Some teens have learned that the only real safe way is not having sex.  Others feel that using a contraceptives make it safe enough.  For some they have learned to late and they will be scared with there mistakes for the rest of their lives. There are many choices in life for everyone to mess up on, so make sure you choose wisely. </p>

<h1> Violence a Local Concern as Well </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Jenn Pickering</h3>
<p>

Most people would say that there is not a lot of local violence in our area, when actually, there is a lot more than expected.  For instance, in local New Jersey papers, readers can find headlines like:  "Carnies Get Jail For Sex Assault" - "Police Charge Man In Assault" - "Charges Are Filed In Domestic Case" - "City Cops Say Boyfriend Killed Woman Over Dinner" - "Child Found in Plastic Bag." </p>

<p><strong>
In RARITAN TWP -- Carnies Get Jail For Sex Assault</p></strong>
Two men were involved in sexual assault on a drunken 15-year-old Franklin Township girl at the Flemington Fair last summer.  The girl went inside a truck with the four to drink alcoholic beverages.  She became intoxicated and was assaulted. </p>
<p><strong>


In NEW HOPE -- Police Charge Man In Assault</p></strong>
<p>A man was charged with assaulting police officers after they tried to arrest him Sunday evening for allegedly damaging parked cars.  The man started punching, kicking, and elbowing the police officer and patrolman when they tried to arrest him.  The police officer suffered a dislocated elbow and patrolman received a back injury and swollen lip. </p>
<p><strong>


In FRANKLIN TWP -- Charges Are Filed In Domestic Case </p></strong>
<p>By:  Anna Farneski (The Courier News) </p>
A man was charged with attaching his live-in girlfriend over the weekend.  The man allegedly choked the woman, pulled out her hair and threatened to kill her.  The man was charged with second-degree terroristic threats, and fourth-degree criminal mischief and resisting arrest.  Police said he fought with them and threatened to kill and sue them when they tried to arrest him.  The judge set bail at $25,000 cash. </p>
<p><strong>


In PLAINFIELD -- City Cops Say Boyfriend Killed Woman Over Dinner</p></strong>
<p>By: Vincent Paterno (Courier-News Staff Writer) </p>
The bludgeoning death of a 40-year-old woman Monday was traced to an argument over dinner cooking.  The woman's live-in boyfriend, was charged with first-degree murder under the Domestic Violence Act.  The woman was fatally struck several times in the head with a hammer.  After the slaying, the man covered her head with a plastic bag and went to pick up the woman's son at the baby-sitters.  The man and the kid spent the night at a motel and ate at a fast-food restaurant.  The man dropped the child off at the baby-sitters house 2 hours early and then went and turned himself in.  The man is being held on $500,000 at the Union County Jail in Elizabeth. </p>
<p>

What would you think if you were involved in an act of violence consisting of any of these instances?  Many would say that there is no chance of that happening to them when, there is a very big chance of it happening to anybody.  Even you. </p>

<h1>Violence in Schools </h1></center>
<br>
<h3>By Michele Scotti</h3>
<p>


	 These days youth violence has been increasing very rapidly throughout the nation.  According to School Net, school violence is like a medical epidemic--it's widespread and affects every segment of society.  Young kids in gangs are bringing weapons to school which provokes other students to bring in weapons for their own protection.  The violence in schools can get to be so bad that some students will stay home from school almost three times a week because they're afraid of getting shot.  According to Robert Maginnis, author of Violence in The Schoolhouse, "Violence at school is worse today than ten years ago.  The growing epidemic of school violence frightens children and their parents, undermines the education process, and threatens the future competitiveness of this country." </p>
<p>	Kids that are committing these crimes, are starting at even younger ages because of the behaviors that have been displayed by their past generations.  Commissioner Sharron Kelley of Multnomah County in Oregon, stated that "Violent crimes committed by juveniles is increasing and the age of youth committing crime is getting lower." </p>
<p>	According to an article on the Internet, "White Paper on Youth, Violence, the Schools and the County Toward a Comprehensive, Long-Term Approach", between 1988 and 1993, the number of annual juvenile arrests for crimes against persons for youth age 14 or under increased from 280 to 447, a jump of 60 percent.  During this period, the population of youth aged 10-14 in Multnomah County increased only 17.3 percent.  Between 1988 and 1993, the number of juvenile arrests for crimes against persons for youth age 15 through 17 increased from 447 to 659, a jump of 47 percent.  During this period, the population of youth aged 15-17 in Multnomah County increased only 7.0 percent. </p>
<p>	School violence occurs everywhere and still continues to get worse.  Michael Resnick, spokesman for National School Boards Association (NSBA) states, "Just as the incidences of violence are increasing, so is the severity of the violence, so that this is becoming a much more serious problem in terms of numbers, location, and severity." </p>
<p>According to School Net, in Washington during November 1995 a 14-year old honors student walked into his high school with a high powered .22 rifle concealed underneath his trench coat, opened fire, and killed one teacher and two students.  He had repeatedly been telling his classmate he was "angry."  The school did not have a school safety program.  In a District of Columbia a 17-year old was fatally shot when two students stole another student's jacket.  The student killed was on school grounds waiting for the bus.  The school did not have a school safety program. </p>
<p>	In Richmond, California-two 6-year old boys and one 8-year old boy who entered an apartment to steal bikes and ended up beating up a 4-week old infant to near death.	</p>
<p>	According to Maginnis, "The most common types of violence involved were simple assaults: pushing, shoving, grabbing, and slapping.  But more students than ever before brought weapons, including guns, to school." </p>
<p>  Many school authorities are trying to prevent the violence within their school.                                                      There have been some previous prevention programs to help try and achieve safe schools.  These programs reduce risks for young people to get into fights by developing a conflict resolution where the students can sit and talk out their problems or many other ways to just prevent fights from even occurring. </p>
<p>Orange County, Florida started a program that includes conflict resolution, peer mediation, and support groups.  The S.A.F.E. program (Student Assistance and Family Empowerment) includes five students from each grade who are trained to offer mediation for students in conflict. </p>
	<p>New York City public schools have S.T.A.R. (Straight Talk About Risks) which is designed to help students avoid crime.  The program teaches protective skills needed to avoid threatening situations with guns. </p>
<p>	However, according to Maginnis, "Some schools are on the offensive that some of these anti-crime efforts don't make a significant difference."  These schools make their first priority the protection of their students then worry about starting a safe school program. </p>
	<p>Duval County, Florida uses local policemen to patrol schools. </p>
<p>	In Tucson, Arizona the school built an eight-foot fence around the parking lot in response to a drive-by shooting. </p>
<p>	Denver, Colorado has a special school security force. </p>
<p>	These are just some of the few ways that schools try to curb school violence.  Basically it depends on the amount of violence in the school and how serious the problem is. </p>
