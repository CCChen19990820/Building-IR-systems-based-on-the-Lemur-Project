<pre><a name="Master's"><STRONG>Editor's Note:  Creative writing is of great importance to our </STRONG></a><STRONG>
teachers and staff, but their writing is not confined to the 
creative area. Teachers and staff explore the area of academic 
writing, too.  In this issue, in addition to poetry, we present 
for you an intriguing excerpt from a master's thesis.  
</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Elizabeth Downing is an English teacher and a Chinese language 
teacher at HCRHS.  Her master's thesis prepared for Columbia 
University was an original translation of a segment of a Buddhist 
sutra in four chuan from Chinese into English.  Ms. Downing 
utilized the Visesacintibrahma pariprccha which was translated 
from Sanskrit into Chinese by Kumarajiva in 402 A.D.  The 
following material is excerpted from Ms. Downing's thesis work; 
these intriguing, brief excerpts from her in-depth, scholarly 
study and translation work introduce Kumarajiva as well as 
influences upon the formation of Tibetan Lamanism.  

</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Kumarajiva (344-413 A.D.) was born in Serindia where there
were both Indian and Chinese influences.  He is counted in the
Madhyamika tradition as descending directly from Magarjuna, the
founder of the sect.  He received his education in Northern India. 
Initially he studied Hinayana texts, but he was converted to
Mahayana after a lecture by Suryasoma, a renowned Mahayana
scholar.  By the time he was forty, he had become a famous
Mahayana teacher in his own right. 
     In 383, a Chinese expeditionary force seized Kumarajiva and
carried him away as captive.  He was held at the Later Liang Court
for almost twenty years studying Chinese.  When the Later Chin
conquered Liang in 401, he was welcomed into the court.  He spent
the rest of his life in Ch'ang-an teaching his disciples and 
translating texts.  He is credited with translating more than 100 
titles . . . 
     Historically, Tibet has had two, major Buddhist influences, 
the Indian Madhyamika and the Chinese Ch'an.  In addition to these 
two Buddhist influences, the native Bon-po Shamanism played a large
part in the formation of Tibetan Lamanism.  The first Buddhist
temples were built in Tibet during the reign of Songtsen Gampo d.
A.D. 649, who also founded Lhasa and established the official 
Tibetan alphabet . . . 
     Songtsen Gampo's marriage to both a Chinese and a Nepalese
Buddhist woman served to increase national patronage of Buddhism. 
Both women were devout Buddhists and encouraged the development
of Buddhism in Tibet.  Buddhism thrived in the mid 7th century in
Tibet, but it suffered a setback later in the century when a 
smallpox epidemic broke out, and the Chinese wife of Songtsen 
Gampo was one of the victims.  Her death was interpreted as an 
omen that Chinese Buddhism was inauspicious, and it was 
subsequently suppressed . . . 
     Sino-Tibetan relations were symbolically renewed once again
by the marriage of the Tibetan King Ki-li-nou-si-long to the 
Chinese princess Chin Ch'eng in 740 . . . There is controversy 
about the lineage of the princess who was sent to Tibet, and 
exactly which Tibetan king she married, but it is agreed that she 
married a Tibetan king, bore him a son, and died in 739 A.D.  
     It was during the reign of her son, Khri-sron-Ide-bcan that 
the Council of Lhasa was held.  Conflict between Ch'an and 
Madhyamika teachings led to this official debate at Sam-ye, the 
first Buddhist monastery of Tibet.  The king ordered the debates 
and summoned an official representative from each of the schools.  
Kamalsila represented the Indian Madhyamika school   He was a 
native of India, and one of the major figures of Madhyamkia 
Buddhism at that time . . . 
     The Indian Buddhist contingent headed by Kamlsila was
proclaimed the victor and Chinese Buddhism was banned in Tibet. 
One of the texts most often cited in the course of the debates was 
the Visecacintibrahma pariprcca, a Madhyamika text concerned with
methods of attaining Buddha-hood and other points essential to the
difference between Madhyamika and Ch'an ideology.  </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     According to Ms. Downing's manuscript, the pivotal role of 
the Buddhist sutra, Visesacintribrahma pariprccha in The Council 
of Lhasa's official debate intrigued her.  Her interest in its 
dramatic influences became one of her reasons for  its selection 
as the topic of her thesis and her work upon its translation.

               I've found some sound, 
               With pen in hand 
               and men on mind with flowers, 
               words jump down, thoughts rise.

               I'm showering in movement, 
               watching evolution shake an echo 
               in my head.  I signal to those people. 
               They have leapt into the picture

<pre><center><STRONG>M</STRONG><a name="Milkweed"><STRONG>ilkweed
</STRONG></a><STRONG>by John Smith, English Teacher</STRONG></center></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I picked a milkweed plant from a field alongside the highway 
stuck it in an old vinegar bottle on my kitchen table, and waited 
for one of the fruits to shrivel, dry, and split open 
so I could count how many seeds, piled like match heads with silk
sticks, 
were packed inside a single pod. 
I watched the slit widened from the base of the shells 
haphazardly stacked at the top of the stalk, 
and spread to the tip of each capsule. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>It was the slowest opening I ever witnessed, the softest shedding.
Whenever someone walked by 
or undid a window anywhere in the house, 
the white hairs would begin trembling, 
peel from the gray pouch, and tumble on the breeze. 
I lost count, but there were over a hundred and fifty seeds
and it took days for one casing to empty.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I brought the milkweed to school.
I wanted to know who, among the passing between bells,
would notice a plant bottled in the doorway 
and not be able to help but stop for a second, risk being tardy, 
just to stroke the silk tuft with a fingertip, 
maybe even pinch a brown-headed seed 
from a pod by the white strands of hair, 
then dangle it in front pursed lips 
as if whistling a secret while making a wish.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I wanted to know how long it would take for the hallway to fill 
with feathery spheres
and a whole school of heads turn to watch dozens of frayed
parachutes float -- 
no, bob above them like wild promises. 
I wanted everyone to dip and weave like the silk-threaded seeds 
rushed between scissoring legs, 
caught up and spun by a sudden draft, 
twirling around all four walls, and careening off the milky-green 
tiles on the way to physics or geometry. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>What s there to wish for if not that a hallway of fluorescent 
lighting and fiber optics 
quietly converts into a snowy  field? 
What learning s worth chasing more, as it swerves in and out of the
lockers, 
than the one we can clasp in our hands? 
How far have we come if we aren't struck downy and transported by
the world around us,
if we can t stop sheltering the seeds planted inside and open our 
lives to the wind; 
spark into class late, but blazing, or better yet, turn at the 
first exit sign we find, 
burst through the fire doors into the outside, and climb the sky? </STRONG></pre>

Written by Florence McGinn, English Teacher</STRONG></center></pre>
<pre><STRONG>          In Pieter Brueghel the Elder's painting, Landscape with
          Fall of Icarus, young Icarus plummets into the sea within
          sight of land .
          </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>                   
                 Brueghel painted gouged eye socket truth.  
                 Boyish Icarus, wrapped in a garment
                 of father-built wings and feathers, 
                 broke journeyed silence only twice.  
                 Once, with a cry of genetic exuberance 
                 echoing out from above slow motion clouds.  
                 Second, in a glittering, final song 
                 honed on wisdom's bare knife edge.
                 </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>                 Boyhood's fall came within sight of land.  
                 Rose flesh lips were damp with cloud-taste 
                 when ocean's deep belly split 
                 in brief welcome.  Icarus vanished  
                 with plowed fields skimming 
                 across sun-dimmed retinas.
                 </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>                 Daedalus' toes must have scraped 
                 in screaming curl against leather sandals 
                 already pressed in secure glory 
                 against cropped grass and sandy earth.
                 </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>                 Daedalus' soaring, sky vault vision
                 tilted earthward following a human 
                 cormorant's dive like basalt flint 
                 sheering air and white-capped water.
                 </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>                 Victory is forever divided. 
                 Fullness builds on another's 
                 emptiness.  Standing in harvest gold
                 beckons winter's pallored cold.
                 </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>                 Old Daedalus, didn't you always know
                 the gods would exact raw payment?                 </STRONG></pre>

Warm, musty earth, dew lies
suspended, 
Pausing -- a time to embrace. </STRONG></pre>

Molding, charging, nurturing,
pruning. 
Delicious agony -- what to trim! </STRONG></pre>

Looking ahead to blushing blooms, 
Blazing moons on fire -- yellow, gold, pink 
Hodgepodge of colors. </STRONG></pre>

Angel Face, Comanche, Friendship, Mikado, 
Here's Peace, Love, Honor, Cherish. </STRONG></pre>

To give is to gain, 
To love, often labor.

Humbled, I toil with my brother 
Whose ashes lie under that soil.  </STRONG></pre>

     by Andres Duran
	 Andres is a third grader at Robert Hunter.
	 This story is about his best friend, Kevin Mc Nutt.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Once there was a boy named Andres who liked school.  One day 
he met a boy who liked school, too.  This boy's name was Kevin.  
Kevin and Andres both liked sports like football, basketball, 
hockey, and soccer.
     One day Kevin broke a window.  When someone was going to tell,
Andres said, &quot;Wait, I broke the window.  I'll pay for it.  I 
promise.&quot;  So they walked to school.
     One day Andres was getting picked on.  Kevin said to the 
bully, &quot;Hey, why don't you pick on someone your own size?&quot;  
     Andres said, &quot;Thanks,&quot; to Kevin.
     Later that day Kevin told Andres that he was moving.  Andres 
asked Kevin why.  Kevin told Andres that his father had a new job 
in Ohio, and he would be moving next week.
     The week passed by fast.  Andres was sad all the time.  
Just as Andres thought Kevin was gone, the doorbell rang.  
It was Kevin.  Kevin said, &quot;I didn'tmove because of you.&quot;  
     Andres answered, &quot;You are the best.&quot;

<pre><STRONG>Again the foamy green waves
Spill up on the empty beachline
Footprints pressed in the sand
Have long been washed away.
The smell in the air, pleasing
To the broken hearts which lay
Half sunken in the millions
Of shattered shell bits.
And the gulls gently floating overhead
Swooping down to pick at the remaing
Seaweed that was once a person's soul
And is now being brought in by the tide.
</STRONG></pre>

</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I stand high and spread my vast wings
     Light uncovered, a new day is born
Perched high in glory, I see the world
     The wind blows for me, it is all mine</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Darkness comes and my wings grow weak
     I can no longer bear to hold the weight
So I let it all fall down on my  body
     And I feel the night beginning to set</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>My eyes slowly shut and my heart closes down
     There is a certain peace in the air
I can feel the tranquility run through my blood
     And I know that life will be fine</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>The sun rises and again my wings are spread
     Sweet morning air touches my lungs
I stand back on my spot, my rock, my home
     And realize again that I am free

<pre><a name="Thinking as a Child"><STRONG>Thinking as a Child</STRONG></a></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I wonder what it's like to know that
silliness is a way of life
or that balloon men really do charge
outrageously.
I wonder what it would be like to talk out-
loud in a sullen library
or swim in the rain spouting overhead.
I wonder what I could do with myself if I
wasn't a captive of fauvism
or a stunning romantic.
I wonder what it would be like to see after
many years of being frozen
or capturing more than one butterfly in a
silk trap.
I wonder why I only want to become one
certain person 
or try to begin a life I never had.
I wonder who I'd marry when I become old
enough to believe in commitment
or if I'd ever become hopelessly lonely.
I wonder what people are doing at this
exact moment
or do I really want to know.
I wonder why reading is such a bother for
some people but a journey for others
or why I  can't write a novel of my own.
I wonder how beginnings and endings will
look at age 76
or why people stand still to look at art.
I wonder if one day I will ever see the hunt
being hunted or 
cry at every tearful movie in front of my
family.
I wonder who I dream about every night and 
if his eyes are a deadly night shade.
I wonder what I don't know that won't hurt
me
and what is being intellectual sexy.
I wonder if I will ever see my only brother
marry someone who will clean after him or
if I will dance with him at my own wedding
reception.
I wonder if I will ever look at things the
same way or
will everything I've seen and worked for
change.
I wonder if I will ever be truly happy 
or if I will just pretend to be.

<pre><STRONG>I never felt so empty, as empty as I did.
I betrayed you;
I left you stranded.
I was not the friend you were.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>You found me all alone, 
You sheltered me from the cold.
You rescued me from lonely bitterness, 
I had known so well.   I needed you.
You were my blanket in the cold,
You were a hand to hold in the darkness.
You were everything that I could have asked for.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Now, the table has turned, and you're the one hiding.
Although my words of sorrow and guilt seem to comfort you,
I am still empty inside.
I can't help knowing I don't know how you feel.
I don't know what you are thinking.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>We are two, different people.
You sheltered me from not just my fears, but my problems.
However, I never learned how to cope, 
Or how to help.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>That is why I am lonely still.
Even though I am rescued,
I'm rescued from myself, not the real stuff,
Just the pretty pictures, and the fake, smiling face.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I am not real.    You see the mask,
The blanket that once sheltered me.
They have become my life and my light.
I don't know how to feel or what it is like to feel.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I haven't cared in so long.
I can't stop myself from my imagining.
All I see is you sheltering me.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I don't know how to save you from your dreams,
Or quiet the storm.
But still,  I must thank you.
You rescued me from myself and freed my soul.

       paralyzed by reality
Silence would be the sound

Communication is virtually unoccupied
Loneliness spreads through my body
       like wax down a non dripless candle</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Crimson roses dry out on my dresser
       with a stolen note
Slowly one by one
I eat the petals
       swallowing an unforgettable recollection of
my past</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Sheets are ripped from my bed
Nightmares of love
       always leave me drowning in the ocean of you
Though I'm a fish     I can't swim

<pre><STRONG>Now I'm stranded-
And trapped in love.
Thoughts evolving  into pain.
I  think to myself,
       bleed myself,
	    cry myself to sleep.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Transluscent hearts in all of you-
Everyone is emotionless.
Neither pushing me, nor pulling me,
       leaving me alone.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I run as far as life will let me- 
       It's love that makes me
Want to see the end of life-
       To hide away from everyone's sight-
To see my own way.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I'll run to the end-
       Jump and fall,
My heart will break,
       and I'll never love him again.

		    Drunk on

		    it will end in the morning.

<pre><STRONG>          The clouds rolling in.
	  The sun peering silently from between the hills.
	  The moon setting within the light, not seen.
	  Blackness rolls in.
	  Suddenly I am engulfed in darkness.
	  I close my petals to shelter myself.
	  During the night of black, I hear the quiet pittering of rain
	  drops.
	  But then I am enclosed in coldness.
	  Will I return from this freezing madness?
	  And suddenly I am awakened by the light and heat of the
	  sun.
	  I expose myself to the world.
	  I watch my fellow flowers open petal by petal.
	  Suddenly I see shoes, deafening with every step.
	  I pray, please, not me.
	  The listless blades held tightly by her pale stubby hands,  
	  Her gentle fingers reach imperturbablely for me.
	  My dying scream was heard by no one but me.
	  The shiny black finish of the scissors gleamed in the
	  luminous sun.
	  In one quick cut my life was brought to an end.
	  But to my surprise I awakened to find myself alive.
	  I was not whole, but alive.
	  I had been set into water, placed on display.
	  I was to live as an exhibit to all who passed to see.</STRONG></pre>

	       But no, your ears deceived you,
	       Your eyes lie,
	       Your mouth has a mind of its own.
	       The demonic plague of scum is taking control.
	       Ask the question, 'Are you alive?'
	       You're extinct, you don't even exist,
	       But you're alive.
	       You cannot conquer,
	       Hopeless,
	       Yet out of the woodwork,
	       A burst of sun
	       A ray of sun,
	       A bolt of good, suppressed, forever.

     Leaving behind those lingering claps,
     Still filling my head.
     Words suspended in the air of memory.
     Sigh with contentment, seeing my pride
     In the dull gray of my warm breath amongst the city's
     Cold air.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Scarf around neck, fingers peering through gloves
     Too thin.
     In the alley across the way,
     A new mother screams of 
     Pain;  her pups emerge, soon to die.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Odd, I think, for a bitch to be having a litter
     In the fall.        In the death.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Rats scatter as I quickly trod away from this place.
     Disease, stench, garbage, dirt, all plentiful here,
     I am quick to leave the scene.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     My numb ears hear a scream here,
     a shout there, a shot even. . .
     All regular occurrences here in the city.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     At the corner a prostitute shoots up,
     Her only way to stand the man she will be with;
     She looks only fourteen or so - a young one.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     My eyes drift from spot to spot,
     Alert!
     They have to be, this is the city.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     My hand lingering in the sky, a taxi driver
     Notices me.
     Notices me. . .an unusual occurrence indeed!
     Directions shown, not spoken.
     The driver, of course, cannot understand English.
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Overcharged, but home

<pre><STRONG>     Life is like the deep blue ocean 
     Being born on a rainy day, 
     moving and swaying in all directions, 
     getting pushed all around
     There are times when giant, angry waves 
     come crashing hard to the ground, 
     we all fall apart
     Then there are times when the kind, warm sun
     is shining bright 
     and many people come to visit 
     and enjoy our company, 
     we are happy and grateful 
     But we cannot forget death 
     when we drift up on the welcoming shore 
     and evaporate into nothing
     Life is also like a tree 
     Starting from a little seed, 
     then sprouting and growing 
     With great strong roots 
     to support us like our family 
     There are times when we are covered 
     with beautiful, bright green leaves, 
     we are handsome, warm, and feeling good
     Then there are times when we are bare 
     with no protection from the world, 
     we are miserable and confused 
     We age for many years, 
     then one day we start to cripple, 
     then we fall, 
     no longer living     </STRONG></pre>

</STRONG></h2>
<pre><STRONG>     The twilight of the hour was showing through the land. 
There was a stillness about everything. Everything seemed out of 
place--the trees, the foliage, and the warrior. The panting grew 
louder, the footsteps harder and the air wetter.
     The warrior was clad in the shreds of a dirt-covered robe. 
Her rags were barely hanging onto her back. She had been whipped by
her captor many times.
     The dense fog that covered the ground swirled around her. 
She was lost in a place she did not understand. She turned her 
head to see if it was following her, but there was nothing in back 
of her.
     The warrior turned around to face a cloaked figure dressed in
black. She studied her adversary closely, to find a weakness, but 
there were none. She could not tell who he was, or what he was. 
All she could see was an evil glint in his eye.
     The cloaked figure moved his hand in a deliberate gesture. 
The warrior collapsed to the ground. Her eyes glowed a fiery red. 
Her long flowing hair began to shrivel up around her neck. Her 
skin began to boil and welts formed on her body.
     The cloaked figure crackled, &quot;Goodbye, Heart of the Warrior.&quot;
     She moaned, &quot;I . . . will never . . . die.&quot;
     With her last words, she fell to the ground, her body now red
and shriveled. A great warrior was dead. The air began to dance
around the cloaked figure's head. The trees gained life back into
them. His job was done - for now. There were still others he had 
to eradicate.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Far from the eternal resting place of the warrior,  another
one like her was resting at a tavern.  His armor was carefully 
polished and attended to.  His plate mail bore the insignia of a 
cross with two swords Xed around it, the symbol of a Zenith Warrior.
His sword at his side was like no other.  It had no stain of ever 
being used.  The handle of the sword was perfectly carved for his 
hand.  The gleam of .the sword would catch every thief's eyes.  Yet
one of that art would not dare to touch it.
     Another woman across the bar had the same insignia on her
necklace.  She was very young looking and had the eyes of a master
sorceress.  She was dressed in brightly covered robes.  She only 
had one weapon, a quarter staff.  It, too, was crafted for her use.
     In a flash of an eye, each warrior collapsed to the ground. 
They began to shake and quiver like the one warrior who died before
them.
     In unison they screamed, &quot;I . . . will never . . . die.&quot;
     At that instant, their eyes were red with revenge and horror.  
For a moment, their souls were linked with the fallen warrior.  The
tavern had died while looking at the two.  Everyone was staring,
wondering what to do.  
     One lone drinker commented, &quot;Let them die.&quot;
     After what seemed like an eternity for the two warriors, they
got up.  The man got up slowly, quivering with every heartbeat.  
The woman got up quicker, her actions like those of a cat.
     He slowly made his way over to the other warrior, intrigued by
their link.  Was she one?  Or was she merely trying to deceive him?</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     &quot;Hello, my lady.  I saw you in agony, as I was.  I thought I 
was the last Zenith, but now I am not so sure.  My name is Celestial
Hawk.&quot;
     &quot;Hello, sir.   I, too thought I was the last one alive.  I 
guess we are never alone.  My name is Magena.&quot;
     Celestial Hawk carefully studied Magena.  She was a very
powerful sorceress.  She had bags of unknown contents, robes of
bright colors and amulets swung about her neck.  She was beautiful,
everything about her led Celestial Hawk to believe she was the
ultimate sorceress.  One necklace caught his attention.  She 
noticed his eyes and brought the necklace from her bosom.  It was 
the symbol of the Zenith.
     Celestial Hawk carefully places his hand upon the amulet.  It
glowed a like the sun and his hand began to feel warm.  The Zenith
symbol on his armor glowed in response.  They both were one of a
kind.  Each with the same quest - to destroy the black mage.
     He spoke carefully, &quot;I believe one of us has fallen.  Do you
know who did this?&quot;
     &quot;I felt the power of a masterful wizard.  Possibly our eternal
enemy.&quot;
     &quot;I was afraid of this.  I do not think I am ready to face this
challenge.  But I can no longer wait.  The others must be avenged.&quot;
     &quot;What do you mean you're not ready?  And that you can no
longer wait?  We must work together.&quot;
     Celestial Hawk mumbled, &quot;Hmm... you may be correct, but for
now, let's get some sleep.  We have an arduous journey before us.&quot;
     The two of them went out of the tavern and looked around. 
The town was barren at night;  all the lights were turned low in 
the shops.  The only other place open besides the tavern was an 
inn.  It was too dark for them to see the name or the condition of 
the inn. They paid for two separate rooms and went off to bed.  
They each drifted into a sleep with the thoughts of what was to 
lie ahead.</STRONG></pre>

<br>
</STRONG></h2>
<pre><STRONG>     Cananjui is half-wolf and half dog.  He is beautiful in every 
sense of the word.  Death-black eyes wrapped in ice, yet soft and 
comforting.  His soul is the best thing about him, always alive, 
forgiving, and just like Cananjui. 
     Cananjui is very independent, for a half-breed that I call my
pet, anyway.  He lives off sheep from my ranch in Montana.  I don't
mind really.  Ours is always an exchange.  Sheep for protection, no
matter what kind.  Cananjui would always protect me to the best of
his abilities. 
     Cananjui sleeps on the other side of a perimeter fence
surrounding the ranch, always looking into the forest.  My loving 
cat, George, started sleeping and riding around on Cananjui's back 
when he was about two.  They're the best of friends, separated 
only when Cananjui goes into the forest with his brother, the Wolf.  
     I found Cananjui in a winter storm that could choke a polar
bear.  He lay just inside the perimeter fence snuggled next to his 
dead mother's body.  This spot would mark a series of events to 
come -- the farthest northeastern spot on the ranch, where the 
fence meets in a corner, near an ancient maple tree. 
     She was a wolf, but I could tell by Cananjui's full face, long
tail, and wide chest that he had domesticated blood in his veins.  
For months I fed Cananjui, for he would not hunt, but he was too 
young to hunt anyway.  He never played with other pups on the ranch,
keeping to himself, that is, until George came along. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     One day, about four years after I adopted Cananjui, a wolf
pack attempted to crash through the perimeter fence in the old
northeast corner where Cananjui's mother is buried.  Cananjui
jumped in front of their path, a half-breed with no experience in
violent matters.  The wolves attacked with no regret or thought 
to the situation -- it was just their way, and they felt that they 
had to defend themselves.  Cananjui knew he didn't have a chance 
and using the trick I had foreseen as being valuable to him, he 
played dead.  The pack turned their backs ready to return to the 
forest, disinterested with my ranch and the sheep it held. 
     As I watched, Cananjui quietly stalked the leader, then flew
through the air, his jaws locking around the wolf neck.  This wolf 
was buried near to Cananjui's mother, and eventually his son, Canon,
would be buried near the old maple tree, too.  I think that 
Cananjui's mother would have been proud. 
     The wolves howled at Cananjui, inducting him in as the new
leader of their pack.  Cananjui calmly turned around and walked
home to greet George, who was just arriving back at the ranch from 
a trip to the veterinarian.  
     The wolves returned every night, just past sunset.  They would
howl and howl until Cananjui would finally place George gently
inside the fence and trot off to be with his wolves for the night. 
Cananjui was my dog, yet he belonged to the wolf pack.  He 
protected me, George, and my ranch.  Still, the wolves were his 
true family, soulmates, regardless of his half-breed status. 
     Every morning just before dawn, Cananjui would crawl under
the fence, place George on his back with gentle yet powerful teeth,
and walk the length of the perimeter fence, like on a patrol.  
George and Cananjui almost seemed to talk to each other, like 
silent friends, who already knew what they had to say to one 
another. 
     Once, near the end, in spring, Cananjui brought a female wolf
back to the ranch.  She stayed only for a week, and I was sure 
that she had been impregnated.  George was acting strange, and 
for weeks after the female left, he stayed on my bed, basking in 
my solitary affection.  Those nights, Cananjui would abandon his 
pack earlier and come stand about twenty feet from my bedroom 
window.  He would stay there until I left the house to do the 
morning chores, then disappear until the next morning.  Finally, 
came the morning that both Cananjui and I had been hoping for.  As 
I opened the door to leave to do chores, George ran out in front of
me and leapt onto Cananjui's back.  Obviously, George was ready to 
forgive and forget, and Cananjui seemed even more relieved than I 
was.  
     George was not permitted to be out of Cananjui's sight for a
week.  George, however, never slept anywhere but in my bed from
then on. 
     The female wolf, whom I had named Canoka, returned that
fall, after her springtime mating.  She brought another male wolf,
named Cretydon, son of the wolf that Cananjui had killed.  It 
seemed that there was going to be a fight, for love and leadership.
Canoka sat near George under the great maple tree in the 
northeastern corner of the ranch, where the perimeter fence met in 
a corner where Cretydon's father and Cananjui's mother are buried. 
     George ran from the sight of Canoka, up into the great maple,
on a low branch near a squirrel.  He crouched and waited. 
     Canoka seemed to be in pain, and I looked at her firmly,
willing my mind to see her troubles.  Suddenly, I realized that 
she had started her hour of travail. 
     Cretydon lunged at Cananjui, straight at his throat.  Cananjui
now knew what he did not when Cretydon's father was killed.  He
knew how to fight, hunt, and that young wolves were often fools. 
     Cananjui whipped around, sweeping dirt into Cretydon's face
with his large tail.  Cananjui turned again and was taken by 
surprise when the wind was knocked out of him, and he was staring 
up at the sky.  
     Cretydon started to growl, walking slowly, menacingly toward
Cananjui.  Just as he bent to Cananjui's throat, George flew from 
his place on the great maple tree, onto Cretydon's head, shredding 
his eyes with well-sharpened claws.  Cretydon turned in circles 
many times, still intoxicated with adrenaline from the fight.  He 
yearned for death, to smell the carcass of the first wolf he would 
kill.  Cretydon, now blind, staggered for a moment, and then, with 
full confidence, lunged at his final target. 
     Canoka is buried next to Cananjui's mother, nearly fifteen 
feet from where Cretydon lies in the ground.  Cananjui had killed
Cretydon so quickly that I had thought, rather foolishly, that he 
had died from the eye wounds that George had inflicted.  If not for
the blood lining Cananjui's mouth, I would have documented that 
George had murdered Cretydon. 
     Canoka's cubs were saved by me, four beautiful boys, half-
breeds, yes, but still wolves at heart.  When Cananjui dies, the 
eldest brother will become leader of the pack.  His name is 
Cheyenne, and he is destined to be great friends with George's son,
and they will come to remind me of the relationship between George 
and Cananjui. 
     The other cubs have left the ranch.  Cananjui brought a
female, whom I have name Wily, the next morning to take the cubs to
the pack and to raise as her own. 
     George remains Cananjui's friend to this day.  Cananjui does
not care that George unwittingly killed Canoka, only remembering
that George saved his life from Cretydon.  George still sleeps 
with me every night.  Just after sunset, George, Cananjui, and 
Cheyenne walk the perimeter fence, on patrol.   Cananjui delivers 
George to me, and he trots off into the night with his son.  </STRONG></pre>

<h3><a name="celts "><STRONG>Celts and Christians </STRONG></a><STRONG><br>
by Christine Pasun </STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     In Europe around the seventh and eighth century B.C., there
was a group of highly religious barbarians called the Celts.  Their
territory was stretched from the British Isles to Turkey.  Even 
though they were referred to as barbarians, they had a great amount
of good qualities.  They were close to nature, believed in an 
afterlife, treated women equally, and were great artisans.  When 
the Christians came, most notably St. Patrick, the Celts were 
forced to abandon their beliefs and adopt new ones.  The Christians
disrupted the life of the ancient Celts and made them lose harmony 
between themselves and nature.  They were in touch with the earth 
and, therefore, better off before they were forced to convert.
     The Celts were able to spread into Gaul, the Iberian Peninsula,
north Italy, the Balkans, Asia Minor, Britain, Scotland, Wales and
Ireland.  They also settled in Italy, France, Germany, and
Switzerland. In Ireland, as well as the rest of the Celtic 
dominated areas, the tribes were &quot;not unified politically but...by 
culture and language&quot; (Embassy 1). One of the earliest tribes were 
the Hallstatt Celts.  They were able to create weapons and 
household instruments from iron instead of bronze, which made them 
last longer.  In Anne Ross' </STRONG><STRONG><U>Man, Myth and Magic</U></STRONG><STRONG>, it's stated that 
&quot;new skills in horse rearing and management..., combined with 
better weapons and perhaps innovations in methods of warfare, 
helped the Hallstatt warriors to establish supremacy over a wide 
area&quot; (439).  Other groups, besides the Hallstatts, were also able 
to dominate large areas. Even though this is true, &quot;in the end most 
of the Celts were conquered by the well organized legions of Rome, 
and later by the fury of the Franks, Alamanni and other Germanic 
groups as well as the Anglo-Saxons&quot; (Hamblin 6).   Sometimes seen as 
&quot;big, tall, hairy types who loved wine and war, seemed happy and 
hardy enough to sleep on the ground, and scared the daylights out of 
anybody not that tough&quot;(Hamblin 2), it's hard to believe that the 
Celts were very religious.
     Nature and religion were closely intertwined in the Celtic 
society.  The Celts were in touch with the earth, referring to the
female and the male half as the Great Mother and the Horned God
respectively. They named their months after trees, and were able to
use the sun and stars to plan their years (Conway 82-83).  Dora
Hamblin in the Smithsonian states that &quot;rather than copying nature
and life, they [the ancient Celts] interpreted it&quot; (3).  This shows
that they understood what was around them, and adjusted so it fit 
into their life.  The Druids, who performed most of the religious
ceremonies, used oak and mistletoe as an important part of their
rituals.  It is said that &quot;the word Druid itself may be related to 
daur, the Celtic word for oak tree&quot; (Littleton 1).  Many of their 
gods and goddesses were believed to control different parts of the 
natural world.  One example is the goddess Flidais.  She was goddess
of the forests, woodlands, and other wild things.  She was also a 
shape-shifter, and rode in a chariot drawn by deer (Conway 110).  
The Christians didn't believe in having any more than one almighty 
God and, therefore, attempted to convert the Celts from polytheism 
to monotheism.  It was hard for the Celts to get rid of all their 
many gods and goddesses and believe only one supreme being 
controlled everything.  Many of them weren't able to, and they 
still harbored the idols inside their homes even after they 
&quot;converted&quot; to Christianity.
     The Celts harbored an afterlife belief that was very different
from the Christian's.  Heaven and Hell didn't exist to the Celts. 
Unlike other religions &quot;the otherworld of the Celts, was a world of
magic rather than a world of formal doctrine and inflexible deities;
a world which mattered in everyday life rather than at religious 
feasts and periodical rituals alone; a world not of gloom but of 
gaiety&quot; (Ross 444). There wasn't any form of purgatory, as in 
Christians beliefs, because they didn't believe that you were 
punished after you died.  Pigs, or boars, were one of the favorite 
foods of the Celts, and their love of this is reflected in part of 
the otherworld feast.  It is said that the feast is &quot;sustained by 
magical pigs which, no matter how often they are cooked and eaten, 
are whole and alive again the next day, ready for the next feast&quot; 
(Ross 443).  There was also belief in reincarnation and 
transmigration, returning as an animal or plant.  When they died, 
they were buried in tombs with many possessions believed to be 
needed in the next world. 
     Near the town of Hallstatt (named for the Hallstatt Celts) in
upper Austria, diggers uncovered a gigantic cemetery.  In the tombs
there were many things a person might need when going into a new
world.  There was jewelry, clothing, beds, weapons, carts, and
miniature boats (Hamblin, 3).  Anne Ross tells that &quot;the burials 
were elaborate, being under a mound, in a wooden chamber usually 
made of oak.  They were furnished with richly decorated weapons and
personal ornaments, many of them bearing symbols which we
know...had a religious significance&quot; (439).  Christians believe in 
the phrase 'you can't take it with you' after you died because they
believe that Heaven has everything you want, and since Hell is 
punishment, you don't have to worry about getting any extras.  
     Celtic women didn't have to worry about equality as much as
Christian women did.  In many Christian religions, women were
thought of as possessions instead of equals.   Women weren't able 
to hold important positions, such as priests, they were only able 
to be nuns. The Celtic equivalent of priests were Druids, but there
was a female order like Druids called Dryads.  The Dryads were 
believed to be in existence before the Druids, originally a part of
the very old goddess religion (Conway 77).  In Celtic society there
were &quot;reports of flaxen-haired females who brandished swords and fought
besides their men&quot; (Hamblin 4).  The Christian crusades, men were 
the only ones who were supposed to fight.  Women were supposed to 
stay at home and tend to all the stereotypical housewife chores, 
fighting was the man's job.   Being allowed, and being able, to fight 
weren't the only ways that the Celtic women felt equality.  The Celts 
held family to be of great importance so women held power over men 
because of their ability to bare children.  One act that was 
encouraged was sexual promiscuity which the Christians tried to 
discontinue.  During Mai (May) the Celts honored the Great Mother 
and the Horned God of the woodlands by freely practicing sex.  They
wore green to honor the Great Mother at this time. In hopes that 
people, especially women, would stop this sexual promiscuity, 
Christians started, in vain, calling green an unlucky color.  
Virginity wasn't valued, and sexual activities were often encouraged
among the ancient Celts (Conway 83).
     Ancient Celts were master metal smiths, and craftsmen.  Their
most popular work includes complex, linear, intertwining symbols
that were sometimes used to deter the &quot;evil eye&quot;.  They were able 
turn everyday objects like swords, metal-embossed drinking vessels,
and decorative caldrons into works of art.  They also had their 
jewelry which included &quot;intricate fiblea, ornamental garment pins, 
often adroitly crafted into plant and animal forms.  Women wore 
rings, and wrist and ankle bracelets, and men sometimes sported 
heavy worked necklaces called torques, of bronze, silver or gold.&quot; 
(Hamblin 3)  In the Bible it says that God didn't allow jewelry or 
ornamentation of any type because that was a sign of pagan beliefs. 
The Christians probably tried to dissuade the Celts from wearing 
jewelry, but their efforts were probably didn't pan out.  The Celts
also carved stones with magical writing and figures, but Christians 
attempted to deface them by carving  religious figures, like the 
three wise men, to cover them.  As Dora Hamblin points out they 
also &quot;developed scythes for harvesting hay and the iron plowshare, 
invented the rotary flour mill and a sort of wheeled harvesting 
machine, [and] iron rims for chariot wheels&quot; (3).  They also invented 
a way to mine salt, which was very precious, by burrowing deep under 
the deposits and then mining their way back up to the surface.  They 
only used this difficult method when the surface conditions made it 
too dangerous for surface mining.
     The Celts mostly used oral tradition to pass on stories or
beliefs, so not much was written down.  Another reason is stated by
D.J. Conway.
	  &quot;St. Patrick personally burned almost 180
	  Irish books written in the Celtic language. 
	  This set an example for Christian zealots
	  who destroyed every piece of Druidic
	  literature they could find.  Christian
	  monk-scribes, for some unknown reason,
	  felt compelled to record the Celtic myths,
	  even while missionaries determinedly
	  stamped out belief in the ancient gods and
	  goddesses.&quot; (77)
If it wasn't for the monk-scribes probably all of 
the literature would be gone.  The Celts used an alphabet called 
the &quot;Ogham&quot;(pronounced owam), but they also used Greek frequently. 
After the Christians came in they forcibly replaced Ogham with 
Latin.  The Celts had knowledge of three languages and it is likely
that they wrote down their history and many of their legends 
(Conway 76).  One of the greatest contributions made by the Celts 
was the story of King Arthur of the Round table and Camelot.  The 
Celtic story was probably changed a little to make it more 
appealing.  No one wanted to hear a tale of &quot;some rude Celtic 
warrior&quot; but would rather have a tale of the &quot;chivalric head of a 
band of noble knights&quot; (Hamblin 6). Nobody knows if Arthur really 
lived but &quot;he was the greatest contribution the Celts made to 
world literature&quot; (Hamblin 6).
     The Christians may have tried to contribute to the betterment
of the world but ended up almost making a culture and religion
disappear by forcing conversion. The Celts were also known for
human and animal sacrafices, which is strictly forbidden in
Christianity.  The Celts at least had some agreements on what goes
into forming a society and religion.  Some points are the belief 
in a supreme power, belief in something occurring after death, and 
having a system of beliefs.  The ancient Celts would probably have 
been better off, and maybe have been able to form a country if the
Christians didn't come and Christianize everyone.</STRONG></pre>

<h3><a name="what causes civilization"><STRONG>What Causes Civilization, What Makes a Person Civilized?</STRONG></a><STRONG><br>
By Thor Solberg<br>
</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>   Throughout history, certain places referred to as civilized
have always existed.  Since the first use of the word, people have 
always wanted to live as a part of a civilization.  It was all 
Gilligan, Skipper, Ginger, and every other castaway on Gilligan's 
Island ever wanted. Although many definitions are associated with 
the word, civilized is a term, according to the American Heritage 
Dictionary by Houghlin Mifflin, which means &quot;to be efficient while 
polite or cultured;refined.&quot;
      A refined, efficient, cultured and polite society is not
constructed overnight.  Many factors, over time, together create a
civilized society.  Man has many needs and wants that are all vital
parts in the formation of a civilization.  The civilized man is 
not only a curious man, but also he is always wanting to know more,
always hungry for more knowledge.
     Man has a need to know the ways of the world; to be cultured. 
Occasionally, you will see a Dukes of Hazard loving &quot;redneck,&quot; who
still thinks the South won the Civil War.  This same person also 
wants nothing to do with any other place but his couch.   More 
often, people want to have knowledge about other places the world 
has to offer.  A more cultured person would much rather eat Italian 
food one day then try French food the next day and so on.  A less 
cultured person, however, would rather eat a grilled cheese sandwich
every day.  A cultured person always wants to extend themselves 
beyond their &quot;comfort zone&quot;; they want to take risks, travel to 
new places, try new things, make new acquaintances, and strive to 
understand the processes of other societies.   They, with their new
found information, feel the need to become more refined.  This 
leads to a need for the finer things in life, such as beauty.
     Beauty comes in many forms; it can be a piece of music or
perhaps a painting.  A painting for example, is not beautiful 
because it resembles to something lifelike, but for deeper reasons.
  It is easy for a refined man to see that a painting is a form of 
expression, and he will try to see the artist's deeper meaning.  
Another part of refinement, is being polite.  Someone who says 
&quot;excuse me,&quot; as opposed to &quot;move&quot; or &quot;outa my way,&quot; is without 
question much more polite.  This is much more refined, which makes 
it much more civilized.  Someone who is not polite is like a 
caveman dragging his woman into his cave, whereas  a person who is 
suave like James Bond is polite.  A refined and cultured person 
will also show sophistication.
     Yet sophistication is not an easy thing to explain.  This can 
be put into an equation by saying that cultured plus refined equals
sophistication.  In the above paragraph, I talked about James Bond 
as polite; he is also an example of a sophisticated man.  His many
worldly travels have made him cultured.   These travels lead to his
being refined and polite.  These are the effects that cause a man 
to be considered civilized.  
     Of course, for a civilized man to become efficient, something
must happen.  Man cannot become efficient on his own; part of
efficiency is working together.  A lack of cooperation is what lead
to the fall of the Roman Empire.  The empire became too large and 
it was not efficient.  People, noticing that the government was 
failing them, attempted to fix things themselves.  This lack of 
cooperation between citizens was the bane of the Roman Empire.  
All members of civilized societies must cooperate with others in 
the society, or nothing will ever get accomplished.  
     In order for man to join in the accomplishing of a common
goal, such as in a society, communication is a necessity.  Without 
a way for people to communicate with others in the society, the 
whole society would come crashing down.   That is not very 
civilized, so people make sure to communicate through many 
different methods. There are many methods of communication, such as
talking or sign language.  The more efficient the lines of 
communication, the more advanced the civilization.  This leads to 
the final piece needed to put together the puzzle of the civilized 
society, and it is simply, efficiency.
     Efficiency is very important because it is a way to get
everything done faster and easier.  Wars, an unavoidable part of 
any civilization, are won and lost on efficiency and technology.  
Although technology is not part of the definition of civilized, 
it should be.  It was the need for efficiency that lead to the 
creation of technology.  After all, anything that serves a purpose 
or makes something easier, or more efficient, is technology.   
When life is easier, it leaves the society more apt to do things 
for the betterment of that society.
     Man's need to be cultured leads to a need to have beauty, and
these together cause man to become sophisticated.  Being
sophisticated leads to man needing to cooperate with each other
toward a common goal.  The goal is efficiency.  These are simple
causes that when put together cause man and eventually a society to
become civilized.  In studying any society from the beginning of 
time until today, one will find all of the above factors present.

<pre><STRONG>   Two-hundred, fifty-six dollars and thirty-four cents and a 
small dent - only monetary and physical harms.  The least and most 
irrelevant on my list of grievances.  But the worst was the stare 
of fallacy from all, and nothing for me but to stare back at myself.
	Their idle comforts told me it was a freak incident.  The 
fault of a patch of black, hungry, evil ice. But it s hard to point
 my finger at a frozen pool of rain when lives were at risk.  Not 
the safety of some nameless face but the blood of a friend.  Their 
bruises from the impact of metal, their pain from the shattered 
glass cutting into their skin, and my horror from their screams, 
their parents  screams, and my screams.  All too much guilt for a 
sound mind to rationalize.
	Luckily, the impact was nothing.  Only a smack from reality,
knocking me down from the pedestal of driving's bliss into another 
statistic.  A good laugh for them, a recurring nightmare for me.
	A photograph stapled to the inside of my eyelids: the 
incoming taillights gleaming redder than any stop sign ever could. 
Closer.  The break pedal no longer to be differentiated from the 
my foot.  Still closer.  The worried cries of my passenger drowned 
out by the screaming radio only increased the silence of my terror.
All happening too fast.  Too much time for a frightened mind.
	I ll walk next time.</STRONG></pre>

as they passed beneath, only caught glimpses.  Although 
they looked often, only its position was noticed. 
Seeming to be so high in the air as to actually touch 
the heavens, most people didn't notice its cold, hard, 
face.  They could only guess at its smile, not knowing 
it to be twisted into an ironic and saddened thing.  
Most people didn't see how the light reflected 
perfectly off its smooth and polished white surface.  
Most people didn't care.
	Sometimes when a bird came down from its tiresome flight, 
perching a while on the shoulder to catch its breath, it would 
notice.  The white,unblemished surface only seemed to be entire. 
Sometimes if the bird would squint just right, it could make out 
the imperfection.  Down from that face of scorn and contempt, 
starting from those eyes of pity and deep sadness, ran two lines.  
Two crevices, as if a stream of molten lava had erupted from them, 
pouring forth and leaving only their scars behind as a reminder.  
But the bird, just having lit on the shoulder to rest, would
only notice these things in passing; for it was only a bird, not to
be bothered when those eyes weren't staring at and judging him.
	Every day and night, every hour of guardianship, the 
unnoticed saw.  It saw a black woman get beaten and mugged.  It 
saw countless drug deals on nameless street corners.  Once it even 
saw the president.  Those eyes saw everything.  So cold, so hard, 
so unrelenting, and yet so sad.  Most people didn't notice.  Most 
people didn't care.  And the bird finally has flown away.

<pre><STRONG>   Jesus was a statue, and he cast a shadow on the church.  His
molded features and slender fingers, a typical depiction of the 
resurrection.  But the lights from above were shining down, 
painting shadow pictures on the wall, and the statue kept the 
light away from what was behind it. And there, shadow arms were
straightened into sticks. And a dark body, long and gaunt, into 
two trees, two arms, legs, nails.  Two stories.
	And behind me, a young mother was busy disciplining her 
young son.  Telling him that the Bible wasn't a toy, shaking her 
hands into fists, finally causing the child to turn his cheek to 
her again, and then again.  More stories.
	My sister dyed her hair a different color today. Something 
new, because how often is what we're given good enough?  I can 
still see it though.  Silent.  Hiding quietly beneath the latest 
fad.  It cannot be washed away.  It is waiting, on her forehead, 
in a little girl smile.  It is now just a shadow of what once was, 
and now is just a memory, a story.
	I love my sister.  I've never thought otherwise, but what 
is it that keeps me from touching her?  What is it that stops the 
hug in my heart during peace-time, couldn't even touch her hand.  
So I asked God today for just the strength to hold my sister and 
tell her as much.  
	Jesus was a man, and every man casts a shadow.  There is a 
shadow inside the little boy behind me, beneath my sister's hair.  
In my heart.              </STRONG></pre>

	The river flows calmly and peacefully.  It greets its
surroundings with a warm hello.  The trout who inhabit this
river have a fairly easy time climbing upstream against the
gentle current of flowing water.  The reflection of the bright 
sunlight on the water causes it to appear to be sparkling,
and it adds to its aspect of friendliness and serenity.
	Then your mother comes home to find the house a mess.  
Dishes are stacked in the sink, the newspaper is strewn about on 
the floor, and paw prints are embedded in the sacred carpet in the 
living room.  The sparkle in her eyes dims down so low you know it's
not even there anymore. The current of the river becomes stronger, 
and tiny whitecaps begin to take shape.  Waves begin slapping the
unsuspecting  boulder faces which block their path.
	Your mother rushes upstairs to see the bathroom covered in 
a deluge of toothpaste.  The water is now surging forth at great 
speeds.  The trout are fighting a losing battle to get upstream.
	All the beds in the house have yet to be made, and she has 
finally reached the end of her rope.  The path of the river comes 
to an end and has no place to go but down. Water cascades over the 
side of the mountain and lands abruptly in the lagoon which has 
been waiting for it.
	She runs outside onto the patio to find her husband waiting 
for her at a candlelit table.  The path of the river proceeds from 
the lagoon and continues on its smooth course once again, the 
sparkles from the sun radiating on its surface.</STRONG></pre>

Cute innocent creatures, the future of tomorrow, travel aimlessly 
down a common pathway. Manipulated by the dreams and images of the 
world.  Unable to express personal feelings or dream true dreams. 
No control over its form. 
 
Often, the soft cotton balls in the sky become aggravated with the 
temperamental winds.  Unified by determination, they unite to form 
an unbreakable chain.  As one, they plant themselves firmly in the
sky.  Together, the wind is powerless over them.  A ritual, during

The younger generation has ideas which greatly vary from present

As frustrated clouds release their tension, the pushy wind steps

</STRONG></a><STRONG>New continuation by Lucy Robertson</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     Lunging across the room and slamming on the intercom,
Andrews yelled, &quot;Armstrong, what's going on up there!!&quot;
     The captain's voice echoed across the panicked bridge, but
Commander Armstrong continued giving her original orders. 
&quot;Jeffries, take us off navigational control, and try to steer us 
out of the beam!  Ensign, figure out why this thing didn't show up 
before!! Go to red alert!&quot;  Only after the alarms sounded did she 
turn her attention back to the intercom and the Captain.
     &quot;Captain Andrews, sir, we appear to be trapped in some kind
of tractor beam, enemy vessel unknown.&quot;  The ship lurched to the
right as Lieutenant Jeffries engaged the starboard engines. 
&quot;Captain?  Captain!&quot;  There was no response.  &quot;Of course,&quot; she
muttered and ran to a computer.
     She disengaged the locks on the bridge doors, engaged
automatically during red alert, scant seconds before the captain
walked through, still pulling on his jacket.
     &quot;Report!&quot; he demanded as he strode towards another console.
     &quot;Sir,&quot; she began, approaching him and eyeing the display
screen, &quot;we are caught in a tractor beam from an unregistered vessel
and are attempting to free ourselves.&quot;  Just then the ship lurched 
to the left  but without further affect.  Jeffries grimaced and 
tried again.
     &quot;You don't appear to be having much success.  Why didn't
you inform me there was another ship in the area?&quot;
     &quot;It did not appear on our sensors until the beam was engaged. 
Ensign Torik, do you have an answer yet?&quot;
     &quot;Still working on it, Commander.&quot;
     Andrews frowned and advanced on the frantic Jeffries. 
&quot;Lieutenant, any progress?&quot; he asked in a calm voice.
     &quot;Just a minute, Sir,&quot; Jeffries rapped out, then threw the ship
to the side once more.  This time the motion did not stop, and they
shifted towards the side of the beam.
     &quot;Good work, Lieutenant.  Now keep it up.&quot;
     &quot;Aye, Sir!&quot;  Jeffries continued punching in directions as the
captain moved to stand behind Ensign Torik.
     &quot;Ensign, if you can't tell me who that is, can you at least 
tell me what it is?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, Sir--No, Sir.  The vessel does not appear to fit any
known, standard formats.&quot;
     The ship moved again, and Armstrong called out, &quot;Captain,
we're almost out of it!&quot;
     Andrews turned back to the expectant ensign.  &quot;Ready our
weapons.  As soon as we're out from under her, I want you to target
her aft engines and fire two missiles.  Understood?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, Sir!&quot;
     Captain Andrews moved over to stand beside the commander.
     &quot;What do you think, Sir?&quot;  Does this have something to do
with the colony?&quot; she asked carefully. 
     &quot;Most likely, Commander.  Most likely.&quot;
     Several seconds after, Jeffries slammed the ship into reverse,
and the hull creaked as it was ripped from the tractor beam.  
Andrews counted to three, then shouted, &quot;Now, Ensign!  Fire!!!&quot;
     Two missiles tore into the engines of the enemy ship, and with
a flash of light, the sensors went blank.
     Silence fell on the bridge for several seconds, until Andrews
spoke.  &quot;Torik, what just happened?&quot;
     Startled, the ensign lifted his hands back to the console and
checked his data.  &quot;Sir, our missiles made contact, and then--the 
ship just vanished.&quot;
     &quot;Just vanished?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, Sir.  That's the best I can tell you.  One second it was
there, and the next... Who knows.&quot;
     Andrews frowned and turned towards the Commander. 
&quot;Well, Armstrong, do you think we could have destroyed it?  With
only two missiles, meant to disable it?&quot;
     Slowly she shook her head.  &quot;Very doubtful, Captain.  In fact,
I'd expect to see our visitors again.&quot;
     &quot;Mind your tongue, Commander,&quot; warned Andrews, eyeing
the still nervous crew.  &quot;As it stands right now, we'll assume they
escaped.  Send an emergency message to Earth HQ--I want them to
know everything we've encountered so far.  Keep sending updates
every half hour.  We can't take any chances of being cut off.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;
     &quot;Jeffries!&quot; the Captain called.  &quot;Nice job.&quot;    The lieutenant
grinned and relaxed.
     &quot;Now, return to our original course--we'll continue on towards
the colony.  We've still got a mission to complete and paychecks to
earn.  And I want every one of you to relax.&quot;  He turned his gaze 
to the rest of the bridge crew.  &quot;No use tiring yourself out with 
worry.  If anything else happens, you'll know soon enough.&quot;
     Andrews turned to Armstrong.  &quot;Commander, have there been
any more developments in that message we keep receiving?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, Sir!  I meant to tell you as soon as you woke up.  If 
you'll follow me to the communications room . . . &quot;  She preceded 
him down the corridor, until they reached the brightly lit chamber.
     &quot;All of the pieces we couldn't decipher before?  They repeated
at regular intervals, and the computer started to put them together.
I think we've made enough to safely say it's one long message.  
Here-- see what you make of this.&quot;  She thrust a printout at him.
     His eyes widened as he read, his mind easily filling the gaps 
of the transmission.</STRONG></pre>

<pre><STRONG>     Armstrong looked up at his face, startled when he crumpled
the page.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;
     Grimly, he lowered the wad of paper.  &quot;I'd say it was the
colony warning somebody off.&quot;
     &quot;Our new friends?&quot;
     &quot;It looks that way, doesn't it?  And is this message is still
being repeated....  We've assumed that their communications were 
damaged in some way, yet they haven't been repaired yet.  That 
means no one is capable of repairing it.&quot;
     &quot;Or even alive to repair it,&quot; Armstrong murmured, grasping
his idea.  
     &quot;Right.  We can also assume that the colony fired on this
unidentified vessel, using the same weapons we just used, probably
with the same effect.&quot;
     They looked at each other, then up at the wall monitors
displaying the message.
     &quot;Should we keep going?&quot; she asked nervously.
     &quot;We have to know for sure.  I'd keep this conversation between
us for right now--we don't need to panic the crew.  But make sure 
you send our theory to Earth.  Forget about the next scheduled
transmission--I want it sent now!&quot;
     &quot;Yes, Sir!&quot;
     He ran his hands through his dark hair in frustration.  &quot;I'll 
go look over the colony's weapons--see what they might have used. 
Maybe it'll help us if we run into 'them' again.  Notify me at the
slightest change in status.&quot;  He brusquely turned and stalked back 
to his chamber, leaving her alone in the communications room.
     &quot;Aye, Sir,&quot; Commander Armstrong whispered.
     Several hours later, the Captain's pacing was interrupted by
the same bright light.  Immediately afterwards the ship was jerked 
to the side, and an explosion followed, knocking him, half-
conscious, to the ground.  When he finally regained his feet, he 
flipped on the intercom and called the bridge for a damage report. 
There was no response--he feared the worst. . .

New continuation by Laura Kuznicki</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     &quot;This is getting way out of hand,  guys,&quot; 
said Sam as the teens recovered from the fright 
of the gunshot.  &quot;We need to find out where that 
noise came from, and we need this to end.  I 
have had enough of this silly game.  I can't 
take it anymore.&quot;
     &quot;Don't you see, Sam, this is not going to 
end.  I, I . . . have this feeling.  This isn't 
just a coincidence.  Someone had this planned 
for us.&quot;  Mary's voice was shakey as she tried to unravel the plot.
     Kate let out a light sob as she tried to imagine what might
become of them.  Vivid images flashed through her mind.   &quot;Guys,&quot;
she whined, &quot;I want to go home.&quot;
     &quot;There is no way that I am staying here any longer,&quot; Mike
replied in an annoyed voice.  &quot;I'll get us out of here if it kills 
me!&quot;  He started to run at an ever-quickening pace and then threw 
his body towards the glass door.  His head hit with a hard, painful
smack. Blood spilled out onto the bleached white floor.  Mike 
didn't move or speak..
     &quot;Quick, we have to help him!&quot; yelled Sam.  Sam ran over to
the motionless body of his friend and felt for a heartbeat.  
&quot;There is no pulse!&quot;  The warm, red blood covered Sam's hands as 
he started to cry.  He took off his short-sleeved tee-shirt and 
tried to wrap it around Mike's bloody skull.   It was not helping.  
They knew that there was no way to help him now.     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>   Kate knelt down on the mall floor sobbing to herself.   Her
stomach would soon not be able to handle the sight of her friend's
blood spilled out onto the floor.  She looked up to see a strange
man standing in front of the Food Court.   He had something shiny 
in his hand.   Kate was about to alert her friends when, in a split
second, the terrible noise of a gun shot went off again.</STRONG></pre>

<h3><a name="she-wolf"><STRONG>She-Wolf, Part 2</STRONG></a><STRONG>-- by Pat Sewak </STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>                                
	    In Part I of this saga by alumnae Pat Sewak, you
	    met a warrior named Lupus and the female warrior,
	    Octavia.  Octavia senses the wolf potential in Lupus
	    as she reveals her ability to shift form.  Lupus
	    initially remains wary, but Octavia wins his
	    involvement.  Read on as the tale of Octavia and
	    Lupus continues.   
					</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Hours later, Octavia lay on the ground her head resting 
on her paws.  She looked at Lupus as he lay next to her, his tail 
curled around his hind quarters.  His fur was black, deep and rich
in its shade, and she knew that no normal man would ever be able to
spot this particular wolf at night.  His coat blended exquisitely 
well with the shadows.  Not that you have anything to fear from men,
oh, my dark one, she thought as she admired the bulky lines of his 
form.  You are magnificent, my rouge.  How many others of our kind 
have I run across, hoping to find a mate, yet only to find those 
who have corrupted their blood lines, and whose deficient seed 
produced no cubs.  But you, my Lupus, you, I think, will be 
different.  Nay, I know thee will be different, for I do believe 
that you are not exactly of my people, but of a different breed.  
Even now I know there will be cubs, a litter of young ones filled 
with your strength and vitality.  
     Lupus opened his eyes and buried his snout into the russet
colored fur that covered Octavia's neck.  She made a small sound in
her throat that was almost a purr.  Lupus rose off his belly onto 
his paws and shook out his fur.  Then he turned around and looked 
at Octavia. 
     She was fairly big, perhaps two and a half feet high at the
shoulder.  She was sleek and lean, much like her human form.  Her
fur was short and bristly and red in hue, reminding Lupus of the
flames of a fire.  Her eyes were still the same brilliant blue; 
however,they no longer smoldered, but they seemed to glow with a 
gentle warmth.  She walked towards him, and as is the way among 
wolves, she offered him her throat. 
     Lupus, instead of taking her throat and biting down on it to
show his dominance over her, slid his muzzle under her throat and
gently lifted her head back up.  Octavia turned and looked at Lupus,
her eyes wide.  The large black wolf only shook his head from side 
to side. 
     Octavia shuddered and began to change.  It was Lupus' turn to
watch wide eyed.  There was a sound like bones breaking, tendons
snapping, skin being stretched, as Octavia's entire form began to
remold itself.  Her paws became thinner and lengthened into fingers. 
Her muzzle became part of her face again, ears shifted back to 
human proportions and location.  Her fur receded within her flesh 
until all that was left was her long, tangled locks.  Then it was 
over. 
     Octavia rose to her feet.  Lupus shook himself again, and he
shifted form.  Where Octavia's entire body broke itself apart and
reformed the pieces into the desired shape, Lupus' body merely
became blurry.  There was no snap or crackle of rending bones or
flesh, merely a soft pop and whoosh.  His form unblurred and where
once a pony sized wolf stood, Lupus now stood erect. 
     &quot;What are you?&quot; Lupus asked. 
     &quot;I think I should be asking that question,&quot; Octavia replied. 
&quot;But, by the Silver Goddess, a man such as you I've never known.  I
am of the People of the Moon, a Child of the Wild.  I am what men
call a lycanthrope, a werewolf.&quot; 
     Lupus mulled this over as he stared at the stars.  Octavia came
over to him, wrapped her arms about him as she said, &quot;Lupus, come
with me.  I do not know exactly what you are, but I do know that I
could be happy with you for the rest of the time Artemis gives to me. 
Any pack would be honored to have such a warrior as you as a
member.  In fact, there are very few packs that you could not lead. 
We could roam across the continent, you and I.  What say you, my
dark one?  Will thou come with me?&quot; 
     Lupus sighed and turned around, gently grasping her chin in
his hand.  &quot;Octavia, all my life I have known no other like myself, and
now you tell me there is an entire race of people, who can change 
theirform between wolf and man.  I have known no woman like 
yourself.  I would be most honored to accept your offer . . . &quot;                                                     
	&quot;Good,&quot;  Octavia said as she reached up to kiss Lupus.  He
very gently pushed her away, again shaking his head. 
     &quot;You did not let me finish.  I would be most honored to accept
your offer, if I was able.  Sadly, I cannot.&quot;  Octavia's head 
lowered, and Lupus could tell by the shudder that ran through her 
that she was crestfallen by his reply.  &quot;I cannot go with you, 
wherever it is you wish to go.  I must stay with Nephilim.  This is
my sworn duty.  I gave my word of honor to Merlin that I would look
after the little runt. However, if you are able to, and as long as 
he doesn't mind, you are welcome to travel with us for as long as 
you like.&quot;  Lupus said, lifting her head up with his thumb and index
finger. 
     Octavia's eyes were bright.  Her lower lip trembled as two 
tears rolled down the sides of her face.  She shut her eyes and 
slowly shook her head from side to side. 
     &quot;No, I . . . I . . . I . . . can't go with you.  Even though 
my heart cries out that I should.  Every fiber of my being shouts 
at me to take your offer and your hand in my own and trod whatever 
paths your destiny bids you follow; I cannot.  Just as you have a 
duty and a vow to keep, so do I.  I am a Mage-hunter -- sworn to 
seek out those who weave magic and end their weaving forever.  
I must go my own way.  Our paths must part here, for anyone who 
grew up in the great Merlin's company must know many a mage, and I 
would not willingly slay any of your kin.  I must go and pray that 
our paths never cross again, oh, my dark one.&quot;  Octavia turned away
and began gathering her things up. 
     Lupus stood and watched her.  He walked over to her sword
and drew it from the earth.  He wiped the dirt from the blade.  He
approached her as she was buckling the last strap of her 
breastplate.  He held the sword out to her. 
     Octavia looked at him, took the sword from his hands, and
placed it in its scabbard.  She then gathered him to her with one 
arm and kissed him fiercely.  Again, she broke away from him and 
walked swiftly to her horse.  She mounted it with a graceful leap. 
She tossed him the  sheathed Spatha, and said, &quot;Here, take this as 
a token of my love for thee, for it will guard you while I cannot. 
Remember me, Lupus of the dark eyes, for I will remember you . . . 
always.&quot;  With this, Octavia wheeled her horse about and rode off 
into the early morning shadows.
     Lupus stood there for a long time.  He held the sheathed sword
in his left hand, watching the spot where he had last seen her.  
He let out a great sight and shook his head.  He half unsheathed 
the Spatha, gazing down at the runes inscribed on the blade.  A 
single tear fell from Lupus' cheek to splash upon the cold steel.  
His tear ran over the runes, which read: 
	     THE NAME OF THIS BLADE IS WYRMBANE.
     &quot;Sometimes, Neph, I wish I had never met you.  If you only
knew the sacrifices I make for you!  What I give up for you!  You 
and Merlin are the only family I've ever known, and I do not renege
on my word, but Odin take me for a fool if that wasn't the 
greatest woman I've ever met.&quot; 
     &quot;Lupus, shut up.  I'm trying to sleep,&quot;  Nephilim mumbled as
he rolled over.  &quot;Besides, she had red hair.  Your destiny lies 
with a black haired woman.&quot;  Nephilim started snoring softly again. 
     It was a long time before Lupus moved.  He finally slid the
blade back into the scabbard and returned to his spot by the tree,
waiting for the sun to rise, waiting for sleep to take him into 
her dark embrace.

</STRONG></a><STRONG>by Lissa Richardson<br>

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>       This September, I stopped teaching.
       Now I have an office with no windows,
       And air conditioning,
       My own phone number,
       And sad gratitude for the peace.
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       But out in the world beyond my office
       My double rises up
       To teach my classes.
       It looks like me--doesn't know quite what to do with its
       hair,
       Seldom irons its clothes.
       My students are fooled.
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       Their sweet, open faces turn to the teacher,
       Twenty five expectant moons on a
       Hard horizon of desks.
       They whisper,  &quot;Teach us.  Tell us the secrets.&quot;
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       Which is what I could never do.
       I lost too many,
       To boredom and daydreams,
       To sunshine and snow.
       I lost suicides who shot themselves or ate poison pills or
         jumped from high places,
       I lost murderers--of strangers, of mothers--
       And miniature drunkards living up to the family promise.
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       I lost until I knew that I could not lose even one more 
       And salvage myself.
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       But this wonderful Monster Teacher
       Ascends in my room already flexed for the task,
       Wizard tongue to reach every ear, unending energy to call
       each mind
       Into the mystery.
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       So, I leave her there, hair electric and muscles singing,
       Telling all for which I had no language.
       And I will stay here in this unnatural room,
       Grateful, YES, And grieving helplessly for the 
       Twenty years of lost children
       And for the twenty years ahead without them.
       </STRONG></pre>

by John Smith, English teacher <br>
</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>       Who among us, even now as I speak,  
       isn't falling, whether it be from the edge 
       of her seat; or standing, somehow inside
            himself
       at all times, who doesn't feel his heart 
            sink like a stone 
       through the soles of his feet?  I should 
            say plunge. 
       Or maybe I have it all wrong, should have 
            said who 
       among us, even now as I speak, isn't rising? 
       Whether scaling the clouds like mountains 
       or winging our way through a dream, 
       who cannot feel her heart rocket 
       or his hopes lift from the weight of the world, 
       drift into grace?  I have been watching the leaves 
       do their annual leaving.  I have been thinking of twirling 
       like an umbrella turned inside out.  Do you know what I
       mean? 
       Hold your hand up above your head as a waiter would 
       balancing an invisible tray and then spiral it down to the
       table. 
       Do you feel the lock of your wrist get in the way? 
       Do you have any idea what it is that you're serving? 
       Have you ever considered your life's like an escalator 
       levitating from level to level; or an elevator, always
       departing 
       as well as arriving; each ceiling, another floor; every 
       floor, a ceiling? 
       But I drift, don't I?  I was talking about the leaves, 
       the way they swirl when they fall.  I was dipping and rising. 
       I was swaying the way some leaves cradle the air 
       to the left, to the right like gentle pendulums, 
       like children riding the slowest swings in the world, 
       like brooms sweeping what's right and what's left into one
       motion, 
       like the ebb and flow of the ocean, or the hands of a
       maestro 
       conducting the only symphony we know.

<pre><STRONG>       
       Sylvia walked on feet of light 
       An angel touching all our lives. 
       A sorority in sisterhood 
       We protected our own. 
       Soldiers, we two were 
       Fighting for our loved ones' lives. 
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       We sat close in a sunlit room
       And whispered warm words. 
       She bent over the chair 
       That cradled my brother. 
       &quot;Mel, how wonderful to see you still!&quot; 
       Her soft hair floated down from above 
       And gently caressed his sweet face. 
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       &quot;Oh, forgive me, dear. 
       I didn't mean to let it fall on you!&quot; 
       A tear appeared; then more 
       Gliding down Mel's cheeks. 
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       Without a grimace or a quiver, 
       Softly, like a prayer, 
       &quot;Sylvia, your hair is like warm sunlight. 
       Let it fall everywhere.&quot; 
       The words drifted like petals from his lips. 
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       And we three sat together, 
       Hands gripping each other's tight. 
       Two sighted people, one not. 
       All crying for the warm sunlight
       That was soon to disappear.

<h3><a name="once in a lifetime"><STRONG>Once in a Lifetime</STRONG></a><STRONG> <br>
by Dan Van Antwerp, English teacher <br>
</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>       A heavy snow fell
       Between 
       Then and now. 
       Afraid of losing my way, 
       I focused on the light
       ahead, 
       Pausing only to turn
       back for a 
       moment. 
       Soon, 
       a  thick blanket 
       covered the way 
       from which I came.
       The childlike footprints 
       only ghostly outlines, 
       traced 
       in the snow. 
       </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>       A few weeks ago, 
       I found myself 
       in the middle of 
       another frosted night, 
       a night on which 
       the young pines 
       struggled, 
       beautiful yet helpless 
       against the weight 
       of the glistening, 
       glassy splinters of ice. 
       I ran and laughed 
       with my poodle, 
       gliding over the surface 
       and enjoying our 
       first snow together. 
       As I watched the 
       delicious smoke 
       from my cigar 
       trail away, 
         
       I saw 
       the falling snowflakes 
       opening up like 
       little parachutes, 
       and I felt closer 
       to the heavens 
       than I every had before, 
       because I had landed 
       here.

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>I</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>The vole, bent awkwardly between the claws 
of my neighbor s cat, shakes without pride.  
The silent vole flails when even to breathe 
bleeds its pulsating pain across feline fur.   </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Without moving body or extended paw, 
the golden cat lifts its head with a preoccupied ease.  
I recall that I watched yesterday as this laxly muscled, 
purring bundle was being carried to the family car 
in the brusquely affectionate arms of a child. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I feel the vole's heart caving in, but the claws 
fully contain its continued thrashing.  I approach, 
and the cat lays back its ears.  I watch the cat's fur
momentarily rise and fall back into place as I pause.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>For a long moment, my will urges the kill.  I wish
the vole its moment of death.  But the cat waits, 
waits past the time of reason into the pause of pleasure,
and I feel anger s bile fill my mouth.  Muscles tense, 
and I lift my book to heave it at the cat. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>There is a tiny eruption of blood when clawed knives
slash the vole s body as its dripping, spastic limbs
are tossed into the air.  The broken ruin lands 
at my feet as I shudder and jump back. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>With no acknowledgment of reason or emotion, 
the cat picks up the supple flesh and turns for home.
</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>II</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I let go of dreams in the morning shower s steaming heat.
In front of an unscreened expanse of kitchen window, 
I coax thoughts of the day s routine into the perspective
of downy woodpecker s rhythmic pecking on seeded suet.
I watch finches flutter over the bit of fur and broken skull
under the crabapple tree.  Those remnants like the wrinkled, 
scattered petals of roses too long past their time of blooming 
are all that the cat has left of yesterday s vole.  One finch lands
and pecks quickly at the fur.  Its head tilts as it picks up a 
broken piece of bone I had not seen until then.  With a lift 
of wings, it drops the small, finished splendor of vole spirit. 
I rise and press my hands against the glass to see if there 
is a pattern of boundaries, a message of infinity, 
left in the air between the departing finch
and the scattered design of vole intentions.
</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>III
</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Sunset shadows deepen like an arc of darkness 
spreading its blinding sheen across vision's depth.
Perspectives shift from black ebony to soft pewter
in the thin light of a rising, ancient moon.
Night s texture is given spreading substance
by the horned owl s throaty voice.  I follow
its call into the woods to the dark base of a tree
that fingertips remember as a shagbark hickory.
In the amplified clarity of silence, I sense
the tufted, shadow form in the trunk s cleft.
A white throat shimmers in the slow movement
of a rotating head, and I hold my breath.
The owl s yellow eyes are open like a child s eyes 
struck with wonder, senses filled with hunger.
Its eyes meet mine, and I strive to memorize
how the moon dilates over its liquid surface,
how the moon glows with a cat s feral vision. </STRONG></pre>

<pre><STRONG>Writing for young readers is a unique and challenging craft.  
Writers and illustrators for young audiences know that 
sophisticated techniques, rhythms, and images need to be woven in 
an especially imaginative manner to capture young imaginations and 
simultaneously to interest adult readers.  This piece by a 
high school writer entrances within the world of imagery which 
appeals to both young and old.

I like to gamble here and there, 
Spend it all at once, I shall not dare. 
How I love the sound of those dice being rolled! 
If I could buy gambling, consider it sold.
I love the sound of the breath-taking slots. 
I get so tense, I pull my hair into knots. 
Some people say I got bit by a gamble bug. 
I dare not have a disease like that, like a drug. 
When I gamble, I don't know if it's night or day. 
All I know is to gamble and play.

him at a garage sale.  I also bought his cousins at a  garage
sale.
     Barry is grey and he has a pink bow around his neck. 
I like him most because he is soft and fluffy and I can play
with him whenever I want to.  Our favorite game is
Detective.  But do you know why he is my bedtime buddy? 
Because he helps me fall asleep.

<pre><STRONG>                It was a Friday in January and I woke up at 8:00.  
I was upset because I was going to miss the school bus.  I had
ten minutes to get dressed and to get to the bus stop.  But it
was so late that my mother had to take me to school.
     When I got to school I saw everyone in my class with a
hat on.
     &quot;Oh, no! It's Hat Day!  I forgot my hat because I was
in a rush this morning.  What am I going to do?&quot;  I said to
myself.
     I asked my teacher if I could call my mom so that she
could bring my hat.  She told me yes.  I was hoping my mom
was home.  I called but my mom didn't answer.  I left a
message on the answering machine.
     I felt sad that my mom wasn't home and hoped she
would get the message.  I waited and waited and finally gave
up because it was almost lunch time.
     All of a sudden, I saw my mom in the doorway with
my hat.  I was so happy to see her.  Now I was going to
celebrate Hat Day!

By Michael Mancino
Michael is a fourth grader at Robert Hunter.
</STRONG></center></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     To me, a hero is a person that loves you, cares for you
and is nice.  Mom and Dad love me, care for me, and are
nice to me, too.
     Sometimes if my mom is not home, my dad and I play
football or basketball.
     One day, I was playing golf with my friends.  I got hit
with a golf club and two of my teeth came out.  I lost a tooth
on the ground.  Then my Mom and Dad took me to the
hospital.  They held my hand when I got my stitches.  If they
didn't bring me to the hospital, my chin would be infected.
     My Mom and Dad are my heroes because they play
with me when they have time, take me places where I have to
go, and they take good care of me.

<pre><STRONG>I think I see you, but I don't know
I think I'm walking, but I can't go
I think I'm looking, but I can't see
I'm moving my leg, but I can't feel my knee
I think I'm crying, but I can't see my tears
I think I have them, but I can't feel my ears
I think I know you, but I don't remember
I think it's August, but it might be September
I think I know them, but I can't hear the band
I think I'm writing, but I can't feel my hand

<h1 align=center>Welcome to Electric Soup</h1>

<p><STRONG>Welcome to </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Electric Soup</STRONG></EM><STRONG>, Hunterdon Central's Online Literary Magazine. The name of the 
magazine comes from a student poem by Frederique de Lame: &quot;Quickly seeping into open 
minds/twisting neurons/electric soup blurring into a novel image.&quot;</STRONG></p>
<p><STRONG>Many of the pieces found within the magazine are written by Hunterdon Central Students, 
Staff, and Alumnae as well as pieces written by the &quot;Young&quot; Writers from the sending 
districts of Hunterdon Central. However, </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Electric Soup's</STRONG></EM><STRONG> goal is to be an inclusive, 
responsive literary magazine. We seek work from ALL writers, and contributors need not be

<pre><STRONG>his car door opened, 
music falling onto the pavement
in slow-motion syrupy beats 
notes dissolving on contact with 
terrestrial atmosphere.  i glimpsed briefly 
his sequin-laden earth-tone green 
leisure suit; 
mirror-black sunglasses 
and a grin of golden teeth 
from which apostles skittered to and from, 
brushing and flossing 
and clamoring for words to exaggerate 
into prophecy. 
it's all about image, he said; 
later they proclaimed his voice was thunder.

<pre><STRONG>          sunset is when the crickets play their song,
	  and when the nocturnal ones fly in the shade
	  it means that darkness is falling
	  ironic how the clouds melt together,

</STRONG></a></h3>
<pre><STRONG>My memory of you, Sir, is quite vague.
You should be a big part of my life, 
  but someone else loves me now.
You left, Sir,
  and your space has been filled.
I never knew why you did it,
  and I know I never will.
But I do wonder sometimes 
  about what my life would be like
  if you were in it. 
I sometimes wish you would show up one 
	day,
  but I have to be honest.
I don't know how I would act. 
Would I hit you or would I hug you?
I ask myself many questions, 
  time and time again.
Do you know that I am even here,
  or did you forget me when you ran?
I have your lips, 
  you know.
And your thick, Greek hair, Sir.
I, unfortunately, have your temper as well,
  but I never use it as a weapon. 
I only conceal one more question:
Do you still love me?
If you don't, I understand.
I can't say that I even know you, 
  but I can say this.
Maybe someday, Sir,
   you will be my father again.

<h3><a name="Whatever Happens"><STRONG>WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS</STRONG></a><STRONG><br>
</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>  i never thought it would be like this
   foolish,
      irresponsible 
		  and sloppy
  her once hard body is full of ink and holes
  it reminds me of her rotting brain
  the sharp cold steel is ripping my spine apart
  causing curdled tears and blood to fall
  and in those few seconds, my dreams fled from me
  a complete deletion of the perception i once knew
  i seemed so ignorant
  no, she seemed so ignorant
  not to know how beloved her soft ancient soul was
  not to know the weapon she carried
  could destroy, 
   burn 
     and eliminate
  and so one night
  in a store full of rectangular boxes
  and a collage of pictures (so interesting to look at)
  she spoke to me in a friendly, drunken voice
  i felt like the biggest wall in the universe
  so shattered and heart broken
  and the knife kept on twisting when she had acted like nothing 
	happened
  i spied on her physical appearance
  and noticed that she had corrupted her body with alcohol 
	and fat
  her pale eyes that i once imagined as a warm, friendly 
	massive ocean
  had turned into chiseled ice
  it was the hardest thing about her
  a warm blanket of passion and ecstasy
  that i could feel flying away into a violent bliss

<pre><STRONG>Beyond the door of her body
Is an innocent young girl
Looking to escape
With nowhere to go.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>A beauty within her
No one can see 
Looking for someone
To open her heart</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>She's hiding, can't you see?
Her radiance is shining
Don't you wonder where?
Look, look in through her eyes.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Her spirit is alive like a flame
Her heart is warm as a hot summer's day
She's frail on the outside, but her soul is strong
On the inside she's like a fierce lion, trying to escape.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Sensitivity, caring, are traits of hers
Be careful, don't scare her, she'll run away
She wants to break through, and will,
Someday.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>She's ready to escape and show herself
Stand up to anything, so they know she's alive
Now, come on, do it
Escape! Escape! Escape!

<pre><STRONG>          Night falls,

	  But darkness is nothing new to me.
	  I've lived my whole life in the dark, 
	  Waiting for that light called
	  &quot;Happiness&quot;
	  To shine on me.
	  But that dark rain cloud above my head
	  Never leaves,
	  Never allows even a shaft of light to get
	  through.
	  And so I sit,
	  Alone,
	  Wanting,
	  Wishing,
	  Yet always just a spectator.

<pre><STRONG>          How I've longed for peace of mind

	  Life's too fast to stop

<pre><STRONG>

	  Still one thing can comfort me
	  Time will set the memory free

<pre><STRONG>          
	  For it is the memory that haunts me
	  Keeps me up at night
	  It lurks beneath the shadows
	  And crawls beside the night
	  </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>          
	  It's his dark grasp that holds me
	  Forbids me to stay here
	  Locked inside the shadows
	  Deep inside my fears

<pre><STRONG>The snow won't stop falling from up high in the sky.
I'm a little worried how my dad is going to fly.
He's thousands of miles away in Florida in fear.
I bet that he's worried that we are trapped here.
As my friend and I sit in the truck and plow,
My father wonders how we are doing right now.
He hears on the news that we had 35 inches,
Though we plowed it away without any flinches.
His flight was the only one scheduled for today.
Otherwise he'd be stuck there till May.
He called us to tell us he's on his way home.
And that is the end of this wonderful poem.</STRONG></pre>

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     The next morning they went outside to 
see the town.  Everything was busy; street 
vendors and farmers' wagons littered the street.  
One wagon particularly caught their attention.  
The wagon was exquisitely decorated with 
colored fabric and paper. Celestial Hawk
quickly approached the vendor.
     With an unusual accent the vendor 
asked.  &quot;Why, hello, good fella.  What may 
I do for you this lovely morning?&quot;    
     &quot;I'd like to see what you have on sale.&quot;
     &quot;I think I know what you would be interested in.  Here's an 
amulet that I just found the other day.&quot;
     The vendor pulled out a sparkling amulet.  The insignia 
immediately got Celestial Hawk and Magenas' attention.  It was the 
sign of the Zenith.
     Celestial Hawk bellowed out, &quot;Where did you get this?!?!?!&quot;
     His hand came up to the neck of the vendor.  Celestial Hawk's 
eyes grew read with fury.  Magena put her arm in his line of attack.  
     The vendor quivered out, &quot;I don't know... I just found it in 
the forest, not too far from here.  Put me down!&quot;
     &quot;If you are lying, I will come back and snap your neck!&quot;
      Red-faced and angry, Celestial Hawk threw the vendor on the 
ground.  Celestial Hawk then slowly walked to a nearby wall and 
propped himself against it.  Tears began to slide down his cheek. 
Magena went up to him, but he only pushed her away.  After 
wallowing in self pity for a couple of minutes, he apologized to her.  
     &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he softly whispered, &quot;I shouldn't have reacted 
that way.&quot;
     &quot;That's ok, we all have hard times.  How about we go to the 
forest and find out what happened to her?&quot;
     &quot;How are we going to get there?  It takes about a day by 
horseback.&quot;
     &quot;Well, I suggest we start walking or find a horse!&quot;
     After an hour of searching around town, they managed to find a 
horse that they could use.  They had to, however, buy it for one 
hundred gold coins.  It was the last of the money Celestial Hawk had.
     They slowly trotted out of town on their new horse.  After a 
few hours of riding, Magena complained of a sore rump.   After 
resting, an eerie wind blew over them.  Celestial Hawk felt the
presence of pure evil.
     After searching around an open clearing in the forest, they 
came upon a body.  Worms and maggots had gotten to the body before 
they did.  The flesh was rotted beyond recognition and the skin on 
the skull was worn away.  
     &quot;My god - what on this world...,&quot; Magenta cried.
     Celestial Hawk just looked down on the corpse to see if it 
was their lost warrior.  Maggots crawled in and out of the skull.  
He carefully pushed them away, a Zenith symbol appeared on the 
crown.  It was she.  He bent down to touch the body.  It broke
at his touch.  A shrill scream echoed through the air.
     &quot;What was...?&quot;
     &quot;I don't know, Celestial.&quot;
      Celestial Hawk bent down and touched the crumbling carcass.  
Once again, a shrill voice echoed through the forest.  
     &quot;Her spirit must not be at rest. We must avenge her,&quot; 
Celestial Hawk bluntly stated.
     &quot;How can you be so - distant?  She was one of us!  You have no
emotion!  What is wrong with you?  Are you not a Zenith?&quot; 
screamed Magena.
     &quot;I've seen too many dead bodies, too much killing, 
slaughtering . . . &quot;
     &quot;I think that voice is trying to tell us something, that 
shrill scream - a direction . . . &quot;
     Magena bent down and touched the body.  Th voice again howled.
She did it again, and they were able to tell the direction of the 
scream.
     &quot;Let's head that way - where the voice is coming from,&quot; 
Celestial Hawk mumbled.
     Celestial Hawk and Magena began to head toward the darker 
section of the forest.  Winds howled through the trees.  With its 
bitter touch, the warriors grew tired.  Trees began to bend and 
fold around each other, weeping, crying out to the wind.  The forest
displayed a true evil mien.  After traveling for endless hours, 
they stopped to rest.  Every way they turned, there was evil.
     &quot;Where are we, Celestial Hawk?,&quot; Magena asked.
     &quot;I do not know, but wherever we are, there is more evil than 
I have ever seen.  I have only heard stories about a place of this 
evil.&quot;
     &quot;What about those stories?&quot;
     &quot;Well, I don't remember much, and I don't care to remember 
them.  An evil necromancer used to use black magic to torture and 
kill animals, people, everything.  Eventually, he turned insane. 
Everything that he saw brought an end to sanity.  The dark magic 
began to control him, instead of him controlling it.  There was a 
time that his soul could be spared, but now he no longer has one.  
He only has the souls of those he killed.&quot;
     &quot;My god... &quot;
     &quot;Hopefully, we will not have to face him, and maybe there is 
someone else.  But for now, we should rest.  This place certainly 
isn't a nice place to sleep, but we'll have to.  I can take the 
first watch,&quot; Celestial Hawk ordered.
     &quot;Ok, let's get the camp set up.&quot;

<h3><a name="swollen"><STRONG>Swollen On the Fourth of July</STRONG></a><STRONG><br>
 By Bill Henderson<br>
</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>
     Dolichovespula Arenaria -- commonly known as the
  yellowjacket, is a small black insect, 17-18mm in length (
  0.7 inches), with yellow markings on the head, thorax, and
  bands on the abdomen.  The yellowjacket is very
  aggressive, and despite its diminutive appearance, is able to
  inflict great pain upon creatures thousands of times its size
  with a single sting.  These are all facts which I have known
  for quite some time now.  How did I learn them?  Well, I
  was taught them first hand.  In fact, I was taught by a tiny
  black and yellow teacher with six legs and wings.  
     It was July 4th, 1995, and I was expecting a typical
  Independence Day at my grandparents' house, playing
  volleyball and eating hot dogs.  It's not as exciting as it
  sounds.  I am usually designated the job of watching the
  little kids to make sure that they don't hurt themselves, and
  I never really get a chance to enjoy myself.  After I'd
  showered and dressed that morning, I meandered clumsily
  into the kitchen, where my mother was just hanging up the
  phone.
     &quot;Guess what?&quot; she asked, not actually expecting me
  to guess.  &quot;There's not going to be a family picnic this
  year.&quot;
     I was overcome with a sense of freedom, and I was
  already beginning to plan out my day in my head as my
  mother continued, &quot;Instead, I'm going to drop you off at
  my parents' house, and you're going to help them put up
  the fence around their pool.&quot;  She could see the look of
  discontent slide onto my face, and before I could protest,
  she said, &quot;I'm sure they'll pay you twenty dollars if you
  help them.&quot;
     I had been beaten.  She had hit my main weakness
  and rendered me completely defenseless.  I then realized
  that the sooner I helped them with their fence, the quicker
  I'd be able to get twenty bucks and go home.  I glanced
  down at my bare feet and decided to slip on some
  moccasins. Going to get my socks would have wasted
  precious seconds that could later be used for staring at my
  newly earned money. 
     I stepped outside into the balmy summer air and
  swiftly entered the car where my mother soon joined me.  I
  sat back and relaxed, dreaming contentedly of the
  imminent elderly gold mine.
     Before I knew it, we were pulling into my
  grandparents' driveway in front of their pleasant abode in
  sunny Southhampton, Pennsylvania.  As I stepped out of
  the commodiously air-conditioned car, I cringed in
  response to the drastic climate change.  The air was soggy
  and sweat-inducing and instantly gave me an
  uncomfortable feeling as though I had just wet not only my
  pants, but my entire body.  
     I began quickly to long for the comfort of air-
  conditioning and started across the lawn towards the front
  door.  I noticed that the grass underfoot was beginning to
  turn a pale yellow from lack of water.  Yards everywhere
  suffered from the terrible drought that summer, and this
  one was not an exception.  
     I looked up from the lawn to realize that I had
  reached the comfort of the front porch.  I lunged forward,
  eager to grasp the aluminum handle which would lead me
  inside to the wonderful air-conditioned haven of my
  grandparents' kitchen when, suddenly, I was assaulted by a
  rather discourteous bee.  
     &quot;God, I hate these stupid bees!&quot; I cried, violently
  swatting at my bantam assailant.  My crude strategy was
  effective as the bee speedily fled my flailing hand.  Finally, I
  opened the door and entered the house.  My mother
  followed a few steps behind me, and together we traversed
  the short hallway to the kitchen where my grandmother
  and grandfather spend the day working on crossword
  puzzles and drinking coffee, respectively.  
     My grandmother generally has a rather difficult
  time actually hearing other people.  As a consequence of
  this minor disability, my mom and I were virtually on top
  of her by the time she realized we had arrived.  
     &quot;Oh!&quot; she yelled, emerging suddenly from the
  newspaper and its half-finished crossword, &quot;I didn't even
  hear you come in.&quot;</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>      I glanced at my mother and knew instantly that the
  single phrase running through her mind at that moment
  was, &quot;Isn't that a surprise!&quot; but instead she just said,
  &quot;Where's Daddy?&quot;
     &quot;He's out back,&quot; my grandmother replied, gesturing
  to the yard behind the house.  &quot;He's getting ready to set up
  the fence.&quot;
     My mother eyed the wooden clock above the
  telephone and turned back to me, saying, &quot;It's about 11:30
  now, so I'll go shopping for a little while, and I'll be back to
  get you at about one.&quot;      
     &quot;Ok, whatever,&quot; I replied without comprehending
  what she had said.  My mind was wandering towards more
  important topics -- for example, finishing this fence so that
  I could get out with my 20 bucks ASAP.  
     As my mom walked out the door, my grandmother
  instantaneously offered, &quot;Would you like a Pepsi or
  something to eat?&quot;  Though she's purely Irish, she's one of
  those grandmas that displays the typically Italian trait of
  offering you a lot of food all the time.  This is probably due
  to the fact that she's been married to an Italian for more
  than forty years and has gotten used to having to live up to
  his feeding expectations.  
     &quot;No, thanks.  I'm fine,&quot; I responded, glaring out the
  back window.  She could tell I wanted to get out and start
  working.  Little did she know, I wasn't actually eager to
  help -- I just wanted to get it over with.  She asked if I was
  ready to go out back.  I nodded, and followed her out the
  white aluminum door onto the back patio.
     My grandparents' back yard is exactly the kind of
  place that you'd like to be on any day in the summer.  The
  grass there didn't seem to be having as tough a season as
  the grass out front, and it was evident that whoever they
  were paying to take care of it was doing a good job.  There
  are four or five large trees which provide a comfortable
  refuge if you need to get away from the sun, and the whole
  yard is surrounded by a humble brown fence.  As my eyes
  drifted across the landscape, I noticed my grandfather
  readying the white metal safety fence to be set up around
  the pool.  I approached him and we met with the customary
  handshake.  
     &quot;How are ya?&quot; he asked, wiping the sweat from his
  tanned brow.
     &quot;I'm fine,&quot; I responded. &quot;How about you?&quot;
     &quot;I'm friggin' tired.  It's hot out here,&quot; he said.  He's
  not the kind of grandfather who generally makes a huge
  effort to be a good example to his grandchildren.
     I watched him as he wiped his sweating forehead
  again and asked, &quot;How long have you been out here?  You
  look exhausted.&quot;
     He shrugged and said, &quot;About 5 minutes.&quot;  Right
  then I knew that this fence thing was going to be a rather
  difficult task.  My grandmother made her way over to the
  pool, and we decided that we should get started so that we
  could get out of the sun as quickly as humanly (or elderly)
  possible.    
     Putting up the fence wasn't all that bad, and for a
  while it went pretty smoothly.  We'd set it up in sections,
  picking it up onto the side of the above-ground pool and
  then fastening the screws and washers.  We got two sections
  up and were almost finished with the third when it started
  to go down hill.  The fence was bent, and I couldn't fit my
  fingers between it and the side of the pool in order to
  tighten the screw.  My grandmother decided to give it a try
  seeing as how her fingers are smaller than mine.  This
  turned out to be a big mistake.
     She leaned over the small shrubs that line the
  outside of the pool and reached around the fence. 
  Suddenly, I saw her arm jerk away as she lost her grip on
  the screw and attempted to catch it.  Unfortunately, she
  was unsuccessful, and the screw plummeted into the bush
  underneath her.  
     She looked down at the little bush, then over to my
  grandfather and said to him, &quot;Frank, we need another
  screw.  I dropped that one.&quot;
     &quot;I know you dropped it,&quot; he returned. &quot;Just pick it
  up.&quot;  
     Following my grandfather's words of wisdom, she
  bent down to retrieve the fallen screw.  She reached
  forward to the small shrub and inserted her hand into it. 
  All of a sudden, she yelped and withdrew her arm from the
  bush.  Before I could react, I felt a sharp pain in my left
  ankle, and I cried out as well.  I instinctively looked down
  to the source of the discomfort and saw my tiny assailant
  clinging to me and repeatedly thrusting his pointed rear
  into my ankle.  I swiped my hand in the direction of the
  bee, removing him from my ankle, and fled the area where
  I had been attacked.  
     Everything calmed down as quickly as it had begun,
  and as soon as I stopped thinking about getting away from
  the yellowjackets, I started to feel a motherload of pain in
  my throbbing ankle.  I dashed up the steps to the pool,
  threw off my moccasin, and plunged my left leg into the
  cold water of the pool so quickly that my grandparents
  temporarily lost track of me.  When they realized where I
  had gone, they immediately began the grandparently act of
  finding out whether or not I was going to die.
     I was suddenly bombarded with a barrage of
  questions regarding my well being.  
     &quot;Are you ok?&quot;
     &quot;Does your foot hurt?  Are you in pain?&quot;
     &quot;Are you all right?&quot;
     &quot;Don't worry, it's nothing big.  I'll be fine,&quot; I
  assured them.  I'd been stung before and didn't have any
  major problems, so why should I have them now.  I looked
  through the crystal clear pool water at my ailing ankle, and
  a small red circle caught my eye, where the stinger had
  pierced my skin.  I then glanced over at my grandparents
  and noticed a similar mark on my grandmother's arm.
     &quot;Did you get stung, too?&quot; I asked.
     &quot;Yeah, but I'm fine,&quot; she answered.   &quot;I'm just
  concerned about you because it's my fault that you got
  stung.&quot; 
     I was in the middle of assuring her that it was no
  one's fault when my grandfather took credit for the mishap. 
  &quot;You wouldn't have picked it up if I didn't tell you to,&quot; he
  said.  The two argued about whose fault it was for a couple
  of minutes and then decided to go inside so that she could
  put some ice on her arm and help to ease my sting, too.  I
  told them that I was just going to stay outside and soak my
  foot in the pool for a while, and we'd could finish the fence
  later.
     As I sat there in the blistering heat, soaking my foot
  and waiting for my mom to get back, I scratched my arm
  and thought about the day.   I realized that we didn't finish
  the fence, and I might not get any money.  Then, I
  scratched my thigh.  Suddenly, I was uncontrollably
  scratching my entire body.  I thought that maybe they had
  too much chlorine in the pool and it was giving me a rash,
  or something, so I got up and hopped across the yard to the
  back door. 
     I went into the house and sat down in the living
  room.  I remained on the couch for quite a few minutes, but
  the itching did not cease.  The pain in my ankle didn't stop
  either.  Finally,  I put the two irritations together and
  realized that the itching was probably due to the sting. 
  This perplexed me because the only adverse effect that a
  bee sting had ever had on me before was the pain.  
     My grandmother entered the living room and asked
  if I wanted some ice for my ankle.  I looked down at it and
  noticed a welt about the size of a quarter forming around
  the little red circle.  &quot;Please,&quot; I said.  &quot;it'll probably help
  the swelling.&quot;  She left for the kitchen to get the icepack,
  and I sat scratching myself until she returned.  I applied the
  chilly item to my sting and sat silently on the couch.
     After another 10 or 15 minutes, my mom got back
  and was rather surprised to see two thirds of the household
  wearing icepacks.  We told her the whole story, and she
  gave me the same wellness interrogation that my
  grandparents had given me after the incident.  
     She looked me over to see if I was ok and
  commented, &quot;Your lips look swollen.&quot;
     &quot;Maybe it's the lighting,&quot; I suggested, but upon
  moving to the kitchen where the lighting was better, the
  swelling of my lips was unchanged.  My mother then
  examined my ankle, and decided that we should get going
  so that we could pick up some Benadryl  to ease up my
  swelling.
     We said our good-byes and left for the car, without
  the twenty bucks I had longed for.  On the way home, the
  itching and swelling worsened, and some interesting red
  welts appeared in various parts of my body.  We stopped at
  a 7-11 and picked up some Benadryl , which eventually
  helped my symptoms.  By the time we arrived back at our
  house, the swollen area on my ankle was about the size of
  half a kiwi.  
     Though the red welts and itching went away, my
  ankle continued to inflate over the rest of that day.  In fact,
  I wasn't even able to get on my shoe in order to go out that
  night.  We had plans to go to the movies and were afraid
  that they would be ruined by the strict &quot;no shirt, no shoes,
  no service&quot; policy.  However, I used the pair of moccasins
  that I had worn earlier that day, and my foot was able to fit
  into them with only minor problems.  
     The trip to the theater that night was an extremely
  uncomfortable one, mainly because of my bulging left foot. 
  The fact that the movie was Batman Forever certainly
  didn't help the situation.  By the time the picture was over,
  I couldn't walk, and my foot was actually overflowing from
  the moccasin.  It was then that I began to question whether
  I was allergic to bee stings.  
     The next day, my doctor began to question along
  that line as well.  We gave him a visit that morning because
  I still couldn't walk and secondarily because my foot was
  the size of a VCR.  He told me to come back in a month and
  have a series of amusing tests done to determine whether or
  not I was extremely allergic to stinging insects.  
     I took his advice and returned the next month.  This
  was not a fun visit.  I received many injections and other
  painful analyses which determined that on the whole, if it
  stings, I'm very allergic to it.  
     As a result of my allergies, I now must be constantly
  armed with a syringe and various pills during the entire
  &quot;bee season.&quot;  I urge you to take this advice -- treat insects
  with respect.  They may be small, but man, they can really
  make you swell.

<pre><STRONG>I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain. 
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again,
I'm laughing at clouds so dark up above,
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love.
					By Arthur Freed

</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Unscientifically speaking, rain is a thrilling spectacle.  
Depending upon certain uncontrollable weather conditions, droplets 
of water come gushing out of  swollen clouds.  As these drops of 
water hit welcoming surfaces, a unique melody is played to those 
willing to listen.  When free time is available to observe this 
awesome spectacle, hypnosis can occur and result in total 
relaxation.  Thunder and lighting add special effects, making 
simple showers become scary spine chilling productions of nature's 
power.  Goose bumps run through our bodies producing a strange 
feeling of excited joy. Even it its simplest form, rain stimulates 
feelings of enchantment. The steady downpour of water is a 
memorizing phenomena of nature which uplifts spirits and allows 
the mind to enter a fun-filled world of fantasy.
     Many times, however, depression occurs as black skies begin to
roll in.  The blockage of sunlight by huge dismal clouds, sets in
somber tones of sadness.  Aches and pains also begin to act up. 
Schedules are disrupted and lives altered because of this annoying
occurrence.  It is looked upon as a nuisance and wished away. 
     Rain, however, is not a nuisance.  It is essential to our 
survival and needs to be appreciated.  The first step towards 
gaining an appreciation for something is to recognize its purpose.  
By doing this, insight is gained on events which transpire.  
Events which seemed to occur for no apparent reason will become 
obvious.  This discovered information will aid in your respect of 
this occurrence.  Understanding rain's objective(s) will further 
aid in your quest of appreciating this common incident.  Clarifying 
its goal, in your mind, will help you to comprehend its systematic 
method. 
     Becoming its friend will further add to your new found
understanding of this natural phenomena.  To become rain's friend,
you must spend time with it.  The next time it rains, find an 
umbrella and pretend you are Gene Kelly.  You'll be amazed at how 
much fun you have.  After thoroughly enjoying yourself, you will 
begin looking forward to rain because it gives you an excuse to 
dance in the streets.  Your heart will be full of glee as your mind 
creates scenes from &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;
     Lastly, it is crucial that once you have become acquainted with
this spectacular event, you sit and observe it from freshly informed
perspective.  Your spirit will be dancing as your mind begins to
peacefully doze.  Your achieved appreciation for this event will 
stay with you as long as you allow it to flourish within your soul.  
     In conclusion, rains gloomy images are enhanced due to the
intense lives of the public.  Various demands cause numerous
distractions from life's simple pleasures.  The picture perfect world,
full of life and color, which nature has created often goes unseen.
With a great emphasis placed upon materialistic items in today's
world, many people tend to ignore nature and fail to recognize its
powerful influence.  Becoming wrapped up in the black and white
world of the economy and its industrial aspects of surviving is 
accomplished without effort.  It's necessary to step back, so the
uniqueness of this world can be appreciated.  
       Rain can be appreciated in numerous ways.  It should not be
looked upon as a dreary miserable happening that causes aches and
pains.  Instead, it should be thought of as an awesome occurrence
which nature provides to enhance the beauty of our planet.  Each
person will arrive at a personal level of appreciation when rain
begins to be viewed as a remarkable spectacle, rather than a
nuisance.  Feelings of peace to the spirits within each person's soul,
will be achieved as events in nature are viewed from a positive
perspective.  Rain occurs when enough pressure builds up inside the
clouds that they just burst.  Basically, the intense sun soaks up 
water droplets form numerous, abundant sources.  These magnetic 
droplets quickly cling together.  As one, the millions of water 
molecules represent a densely saturated sponge.  As more and more 
tiny moist particles try to squeeze into an already sated sponge, 
water slowly begins seeping out.  What began as inconstant blobs 
soon become frequent drips, which quickly transform into a steady 
leak.  With the aid of favorable natural forces, the sponge will 
eventually be squeezed dry. As beads tumble from the sky, they 
generously water the earth with life.  
       Even though rain allows life to exist, many dread rainy days. 
Various reasons cause people to despise rain, the most common
being the damp, dark, dismal curtain it drops before our eyes. 
Nevertheless, a few days of darkness is a small price to pay for the
survival of our unique planet.  It is necessary to look past the dreary
image which rain portrays.  The true beauty of rain is not seen by
looking at its outward appearance, but rather found inside its ugly
protective shell.  Each droplet of water holds within something very
special.  It carefully delivers its priceless gift to the thirsty 
terrain by means of thoughtful explosion upon impact.  By 
understanding the purpose of rain, its &quot;depressing&quot; effect will 
soon cease.  Try to think of each rain pellet as tiny spherical 
drops not only filled with water, but also with the precious gift 
of life.</STRONG></pre>

<h3><STRONG><img src="/esoup/gif/girl.jpg" align=left width=93 height=165></STRONG><a name="date"><STRONG>How to Date a Woman</STRONG></a><STRONG> -- by Ryan Muir <img src="/esoup/gif/muir.jpg" align=right width=133 height=125></STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>   &quot;It sure is hard to get a good date.&quot;
				-Brad Muir</STRONG></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre><STRONG>   There is nothing in life that can 
create as many mixed emotions in a man as 
a woman.  Between the careless flippant
remark that she tosses your way, meant as 
a joke, and the long passionate kisses, 
hopefully not meant as a joke,  a person's emotions get tugged at 
and pulled on so much, it feels like men are no more than puppets.  
The situation where this is most apparent is not one of those already 
long term relationships, or marriage. Instead, as we all know, it 
shines forth in all of its beauty in the process of dating.  Whether 
it is the infamous blind-date, or just a typical dinner and a movie, 
it is a guarantee that an extremely wide range of emotions will 
present themselves.  All in all, dating a woman can be one of the most
embarrassing, frightening, and yet rewarding experiences that anyone 
could imagine.
       Before the actual date itself,  the problem of finding a woman
exists.  Now, there are literally thousands of possibilities open 
to the seeking male, so the choice can be a difficult one.  
Initially, beauty is considered.  This is done by the person 
asking himself, &quot;Can I see myself kissing her.&quot;  If the answer is 
no, continue searching on until the answer is yes.  
       Once this first requirement is met, initial contact must be
established.  Different people will go about this in different ways. 
From the famous, &quot;What's your sign, baby?&quot;  to only looking and
sharing secret smiles with each other, establishing contact can be
done in an infinite amount of ways.    One of the easiest ways to
initiate contact is to comment on a subject of common interest, such
as ( but only if nothing else is available) the weather.  The 
weather is something that both people notice and feel.  Once the 
initial, &quot;Boy, it sure is nice out today,&quot; is out, it is hard to 
believe how much easier it is to talk to each other.
       After  speaking to the woman comes the hard part, actually
asking her out on a date.  Some people will ask after only the first
few minutes, some will wait almost their whole lives.  The best plan
is not to jump into it too fast, but if the O.K. signals are present,
such as if she hasn't run screaming away or isn't in the process of
physically beating you, asking her out on a date after two or three
conversations is probably  acceptable.
       Once the right time is figured out, comes the really tough part,
getting up the nerve to actually ask.  Unknown to most women, this
is the part that men dread.  The fear of getting rejected is so bad
that our palms are sweaty, our voices are shaky, and in all 
probability, we will have to go to the bathroom right afterwards 
because of all the excitement.  This part must be overcome.  
The fear cannot be allowed to overcome our desire to date, least 
there never be a dating option again.  
       Now that the tough part is out of the way, it must be decided
where to go.  This part is usually established before the asking,  
to have eliminated as much awkwardness as possible.  Common
interests must be found and leapt upon.  Also, it should be
something unique to yourself, not something that anyone could do. 
Too many guys have asked their interest to the &quot;dinner and movie&quot;
combo, and have been rejected on the spot.  Instead, try to be
creative.  Ask the woman to do something like sledding, ice-skating,
going to a play, or something similarly interesting.  This will make
them think that you're a really cool guy, who likes to do neat things.
       Now that the woman, the activity, and the interest have all 
been decided, it is finally time to go on the date.  The first 
aspect of the date itself is what to wear.  Depending on the 
activity planned, dress should be casual yet neat.  Nothing too 
fancy.  Anything that would draw attention away from you and 
towards your clothes should be avoided; remember, you want your 
date to pay attention to you, not your shirt.  The reverse is also 
true.  Never, never dress too casual either.  There is nothing that
can spoil a date like showing up in dirty, ragged, sagging sweat 
pants and your favorite flannel that has grease stains all over it.
This part of your wardrobe should remain a secret at least until 
after a year of serious dating.
       When on the date, the best way to impress the ladies is to act
yourself.  Trying to be funny, in reality, just makes you look like
the nervous and stupid fool you are.  On the other hand, being too
serious can be a problem, too.  A woman will instantly cross off any
guy that she doesn't think that she can have a good time with. 
Instead, just like everything, a happy medium must be met. 
Hopefully, your normal personality consists of a little humor, a 
little seriousness, and immense charm.  This should be enough for 
any woman.
       The final part of the evening is the after-date kiss.  This 
is the important part.  It has been on your mind all night.  It 
has been on her mind all night.  You know that she knows that 
you've been thinking about it, and she knows that you know that 
she's been thinking about it.  It can be confusing.  This one has 
to be left up to the total discretion of the people on the date.  
If  the date turned out well, and both of you had a good time, 
then it would probably be all right to kiss the woman good night, 
but one can never be certain. One thing's for sure, if the kiss is 
received well, it is worth all of the trouble.  It is usually the 
man's job to initiate the first kiss, so good luck.  
       In retrospect, dating can be one of the scariest, most horrifying
experiences that anyone could ever go through.   From realizing the
initial interest and establishing the first conversation, to planning
where to go and what to wear, to the total indecision of the
horrifying good-night kiss,  putting your pride on the line and asking
someone out takes a lot of nerve.  But when done right, and with the
right person, the rewards can be worthwhile.  </STRONG></pre>

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     She watches behind transparent shades of 
pewter as time passes and days move on.  Irony 
exists in the fact that, in reality, she cannot 
see me.  Her heat-seeking, v-shaped tongue 
suppresses against the flat surface of the glass, 
just as any warm-blooded, warm-hearted mammal 
wanders past her.  Beneath interlocking squares 
of mesh and metal, luminescent spheres of fire 
call out for attention.  A glance down into her 
world renders boredom; hence, one is left to 
believe she relies not on instinct alone but the one
who watches over her.  Without limbs to walk with, to reach out and
grasp with, she slithers ever so gently with a sense of acumen.  
Her inability to produce sufficient amounts of melanin leave her
colorless. . .in a way.  Pearly shades of pink-hued undertones and
stripes like rays of sunshine reveal internal organs that almost
protrude through her tightly-packed scales and into my palms. 
Voluntary muscle composes the majority of her worm-like
structure; whereas, freely, she chooses how and which way to twist
and twine throughout my eight phalanges.  My thumbs, which are
squeezed with any slight movement, function hand- in-hand with
her posterior end as both ventral and dorsal sides spiral about. 
Apparently, security is at ease now because she maintains
continence.  Outside of these compassionate hands 
she would be left to fend for herself and rely on instinct alone for
survival purposes.  No one would be near to rescue her from
predators in the wild longing to snatch her up in an instant. 
Therefore, one can only ponder if, in essence, she  will ever come
to appreciate the tender touch of a human hand because had she
ever been given the chance to truly be free, only then would we
know which she preferred.

<pre><STRONG>     What if someone came up to you and cut off 
your tongue?  Not a word spoken. Their actions 
making sure that you can't say anything.  No 
wait, stop!  You can't do that! But it's already 
been done.  You frantically look around for your 
tongue.  You spot it in the corner, kicked out 
of the way.  It's alive!  Spasmodically jumping 
off the floor like a fish out of water.  Maybe 
there's still time.  I know I can save it.  I 
can pack it in ice and take it to the hospital, 
and they can sew it back on.  With the leeches 
sucking the blood away,  I know I have time.
     You bend down and carefully pick up your 
tongue, realizing that there is really nothing 
that you can do.  For God's sake, someone cut 
your tongue off!  No one can put a tongue back on!  Your perfect, pink, 
sensitive, tongue.  One of the most important things you have is your 
ongue.  It allows you to taste the most beautiful tastes in the world.  
It allows you to explore the most desirable thing you can get your 
mouth on.  It allows you to communicate with someone 100,000 miles 
away from you.  Your tongue  allows you to speak your mind, voice your
opinion, pronounce letters, help you sing a song, kiss someone you 
love, make obscene gestures. Your tongue allows you to choke if you 
are having a seizure.  It allows you to taste the most revolting taste
you could imagine.  It allows you to feel excruciating pain if your 
pearly whites decide to plot against your taste buds.

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     There is music in any thing.  The way you 
talk is music.  As well as the way you move, 
breathe.  In your eyes and hair is music. Even 
the way you always look at me as if you don t 
quite think I'm real, that is music as well.  
And perhaps I m not real, but only the music 
knows for sure.  Because everything that is 
has its own music.  I can sit here and look 
at your eyes.  Not into them, for I only want 
to go so deep.  But I can look at your eyes and feel their
rhythm.  The dark, rich brown creates its own music as they burn
that color right into my mind.  And even as our relationship wavers
between what it will be and what it is, it creates such beautiful 
melodies that I find myself in a trance.  Sometimes I just sit and 
listen to our music and wonder if you can hear it, too.  It isn't 
very loud, but it is perfect.  Your confusion is obvious to me
as I listen to your part of the song, and I feel the frustration in
the chords.  It isn't as if you need to tell me; the music is 
enough.  Although I wish to help you, my heart longs to sing with 
those lovely melodies.  Our relationship can only say so much.  If 
you really wanted to understand it, you could just listen to the 
music. But it almost seems as if you don t want to.  Is it easier 
to wander in confusion?  Pleading, dark eyes have a dangerous song 
to sing. Perhaps it would be better to shut the song out, for it 
seems to be getting us nowhere.  But there would only be another 
song somewhere else.  The music is inevitable.  Just listen and 
try to understand.  For me.

<h3><a name="Mars Federal Colony"><STRONG>Mars Federal Colony</STRONG></a><STRONG>, Part 5 Continued by Topher Taylor<br>
</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>     Captain Andrews' call was not returned.  He moved slowly
toward the door of his cabin.  Looking out into the hall, he saw a
bright red light.  The power must have gone out, he thought.  That
must be why Armstrong had not returned the verification.  For a
moment, Andrews forgot the tractor beam.  He was not a bright
man, and he really didn't realize the danger he was in.
     Andrews turned the corner of the hall and saw the guidance
console smashed to pieces by a large axe.  Attached to the end of
the axe was Armstrong's chest.  Scarlet oozed from the hole, barely
visible in the crimson lighting.  Andrews withdrew from the room,
not really aware of what he ought to do.  His training had
accounted for everything, or so he thought.  He thought back,
trying to recapture his training back on Earth.  He remembered
nothing of &quot;death of a crew member by a sharp object&quot; and
panicked.  Andrews ran quickly back to his quarters and fell,
sobbing, onto the bed.
     The tractor be0am finished its purpose and pulled the earth 
ship inside the alien ship.  The alien  ship was incredibly large,
approximately the size of New Jersey in area, and was manned by
almost one-million Brakazoraks.  These extraterrestrial beings had
only one purpose behind their visit to our solar system, blood. 
They had run out of a proper food source three years back, and,
man, were they hungry!
     One of the scout robots had accidentally killed one of the
humans, potential food, and the robotic scout  had, therefore,
crawled into a corner, ashamed.  The nature of these scout robots
was to destroy themselves if they were not able to follow through
with their directives, and that is precisely what this scout did 
now. 
	Unfortunately for both Andrews and the Brakazoraks, the 
corner the robot was sulking in happened to be the back corner of 
CaptainAndrews' quarters.  The robot's self-destructive explosion 
surged upon Andrews' sobbing form, tearing the flesh from his back.
He screamed loudly at the first surge.  The robot's pieces then
bombarded his body, imbedding into his flesh.  Thankfully, one of
these hit his heart, stopping it.  Tragically, Andrews was left
mangled and cold.
     Angry at the accidental deaths of the two humans, for the
Brakazoraks could only eat living flesh, the aliens decided that they
would have to visit Earth.  The Brakazoraks might have been happy
with the Mars colony's residents alone, but now they were hungry
again.  The fate of humanity lay in a questionable state . . . </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>What do you think will occur next?  Will the crew be able to save
themselves?  Will Earth be given any warning?  How will Earth face
an alien attack?</STRONG></pre>

<pre><STRONG>     &quot;Katie!&quot; yelled Sam as he let go of Mike's hands.
     They all ran to Kate's bloody, twisted body, but they knew 
that there was nothing they could do for her.  She was obviously 
dead from the terrible injury inflicted by the mysterious gun shot.
Now, not only were Kate and Mike dead, but the mysterious presence
who had led them to their deaths had also seemed to disappear.
     &quot;I want to leave,  Sam.  Just get me out of here, just get me
out!&quot; shrieked Mary as she collapsed crying.
     &quot;It's all right, Mary,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I'll get you out of here 
if it's the last thing I do.&quot;
     The two teens decided that the best possible thing they could 
do was to hide from the maniac, but they didn't know exactly where. 
They knew there were many good hiding spots in the mall, but they
felt like they were being watched.
     &quot;I'm getting tired of walking for so long,&quot; complained Mary.
&quot;Let's take a break.&quot;
     &quot;Okay, but make it quick.  I've got a feeling that something 
bad is going to happen,&quot; Sam said in a frightened voice.
     They began to hear those footsteps coming towards them again,
so they ran as fast as they could.  As they turned a corner, they
stopped dead in their tracks.   Their mouths dropped open in
complete horror.  There was the apparent maniac who had been
terrorizing them.  What the maniac was though they didn't know!
</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>What do Kate and Sam see?  What will happen next to the terrified
teen-agers?  You can create the next episode and submit it to

by Dara Badiak<br>
Alumnae of class of 1995</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>there are satellites so large
they dance in a double orbit with their hopeless cycles
two bodies pulling and pushing in tidal surges
sucking with hungry gravitational mouths
moving in distorted circles through the silent vacuum</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>as they spin through their hopeless cycles
they slowly draw one another in 
knowing the consequences of getting too close
always turning aside at the last instant
and passing by one another in the cold night</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>each one has to keep circling
even when it can feel its rock, its oceans, its liquid metal core
pulled toward the other
even when all it wants to do is surrender
stop spinning and dancing away
fall inward, grow fingers and lips and a tongue, ignite
and never have to worry about geometry and distances again</STRONG></pre>

<h3><a name="anticipation"><STRONG>Anticipation</STRONG></a></h3>
<pre><STRONG>I cannot live on faith alone
That you will return to me, my love
And while the nights grow darker still,
My voice carries a note of frigidity
(Is it only my voice?)
For in these infinite hours of longing,
I have begun to shrink into myself,
While you are off cavorting with a stranger,
My heart dares not to ask where you have been.

<pre><STRONG>I found music,
And discovered
What it was,
To burn on stage,
mind spinning thrillingly
beyond control,
adrenaline rushing
my brain
and crushing my
consciousness
as I
squeeze the last howling, roaring
gasp
of electric agony
from a Fender Telecaster.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Or to feel the wah-wah,
Washing away 
All symptoms of adulthood,
To be newly baptized
in the torrents
of rhythm,</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Or, for just a razor slice
of time
to be back,
magically,
jamming in the basement
of Ted's house,
naively believing
we had the stuff
to be
on someone else's radio.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>When I found music,
I suddenly discovered
a screaming, wailing,
demon voice
with which to 
chase away
the awkward agonies
of my timid adolescence.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>And now, 
as rock dreams
fade away
into the bottom of a briefcase,
I realize
that just three chords
can contain more magic
than I ever
dreamed
when I would 
fall asleep 
in my old bedroom,
guitar in hand,
blistered fingers
caked with blood,
and Neil Young
on the radio,
lulling me to sleep
with
Hey, Hey, My, My
Rock and Roll
Can Never Die.</STRONG></pre>

Shiny, yet scratched
Nicks, rough edges worn smooth

<pre><STRONG>Push aside jammed tears,
Tuck all grief away,
Look for joy of living.
Seasons merge in between
Good times to store.</STRONG></pre>

or, perhaps, half empty?
Will the lid slam?  Or
Will it close gently?</STRONG></pre>

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>How many times as I
turned that corner
in the Acropolis Museum
could I feel you tugging at me?</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>You held me transfixed
my eyes feasting on the light;
and once, when the guard had tired of chaperoning us
I reached out because we were alone.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>It wasn't marble I touched.
It was as if in one moment
a merciful hand from the past found me.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>In that instant I knew
I couldn't meet another day
without your presence.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Remember how many layers they wrapped you in
to guard fragile plaster;
or how they stamped &quot;MUSEUM COPY&quot;
all over that great cocoon?</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>When I finally had you home,
before anything else,
I had to find a place for you
so our conversation could continue.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>And now, 
in another museum,
I turn another corner
knowing you are there;
sensing it before my eyes venerate you</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>The crowd around dutifully studies,
intent on learning who made you
and what the style of your garment suggests
and where the archaeologists found you.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Experts call you pensive, mourning
Citing time, subject, location
as if your clues were external.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>But they have never regarded you as I have,
like a lover always searching,
even from this distance,
in every contour,
to find an invitation to go on.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>From the first day
I understood:
you simply read 
words we cannot see.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>And what others term sadness
is the inner smile
that comes from knowing 
which words will stop a goddess
and bow her head.</STRONG></pre>

</STRONG></h3>
<pre><STRONG>Summer whisks fingers 
translucent with shimmering heat
across the blue whirr of dragonfly wings.  
Algae floats thickly upon pond water
like long hair twisted into knots of scum.
Two does step into mud, lower their heads, 
and alternately drink and snort.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>It is a sound, almost human, 
in an inhuman time 
of humid weight and fiery air.  </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>The buzz of gnats and black flies,
loud like a wheezing engine, 
draws me away from the pond edge. </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Insects swarm and rise above
the farm road s ditch and coarse weeds.
A young rabbit, its back legs torn and twisted,</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>lies visible from the road.  As I stare, it lifts
its head, eyes covered with flies, and cries 
a thin, high wail.  I shudder and back away.  </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>When I find the large rock and lift its weight
with both hands, I flinch.  I want to offer 
comfort and can only bring release.  </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I cannot go near.  I find instead a thick stick. 
I plan only one, swift stroke, but I swing 
and slam five, maybe six, times.  It is hard</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>to stop.  I run and heave the stick deep 
into the still pond.  I keep on running 
from the dead rabbit and from myself.</STRONG></pre>

<pre><STRONG>     One day I went to Jamesway and bought a fire truck.  
Then I went to my Mom and Dad's pizzeria to play with it.
     The fire truck was red and had a fireman.  It also had a 
ladder that went up and down.  I put the ladder up and the fireman 
on the ladder and pretended there was a fire.
     I play with my fire truck after school and like to pretend I 
am a fireman.  Sometimes, I put the siren on.  It's loud and has a 
red light.
     The fire truck is the best toy in the world because it makes 
me happy and lets me pretend I'm a fireman.</STRONG></pre>

<h3><a name="detour"><STRONG>A Detour On the Way to Camp Bernie<br>
</STRONG></a><STRONG>by Antonella Carannante<br>
Antonella is a 5th grader at Robert Hunter.</STRONG></h3>
<pre></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     The day finally came.  Our fifth grade class was getting ready
to go on a trip to Camp Bernie.  It was a rainy day.  We got on the
bus and started going.  The bus had to take a detour because there
was construction on the road.
     Maria, Samantha and I were playing travel games.  Suddenly,
we were thrown to the side of the bus when the bus driver lost
control of the wheel.  It was slippery and the bus skidded into the
woods.  Everybody was screaming as the bus fell in  hole.  &quot;Help,
help!&quot; I screamed.  All of the kids panicked.  Then we were floating
and rotating in space.  After a while, we landed on a planet and we
felt safe because the bus was standing still.  
     The planet was different from Earth.  There were gray and
yellow trees and red grass.  We saw no people and no buildings. 
All of a sudden, these blue and purple strange creatures appeared. 
They were about two feet tall with long droopy ears.  We were
trying to get away from them because they were banging on the
windows of the bus.  The bus driver started driving away.  &quot;Wow!&quot;
I thought.  They must have been going 60 miles per hour because
the bus driver was going 50 miles per hour and they got past us.  
     The bus started going slower until it stopped.  The bus driver
was shouting, &quot;I RAN OUT OF GAS!&quot;  Everyone started screaming.  
The creatures began attacking the bus.  They broke the glass and 
tried to get in.  I thought I was going to pass out and I
began to sweat.  Suddenly, I found myself sitting on my bed in the
dark.  I took a deep breath and went back to sleep.</STRONG></pre>

     The craze behind those icy eyes
     You realize not the pain to me 
     Caused by the silence I despise</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     I feel the breeze's frosty breath
     Upon my neck so late at night
     He whispers horrid psalms of death 
     I listen and my face grows white</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     Emerges from blackness the silver of knife
     Then howling echoes through the place
     That's drowning in the essence of the absence of life
     I do not watch, I hide my face</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     The pines converse, the moonlight glares
     They urge me off their property
     I'm flaming with guilt but no one cares
     Won't someone come to rescue me?
     </STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>     I can not cope; I'm in a daze
     This wasn't something I could plan
     I'm smothered with a mass of haze
     I can't believe I've killed a man.

<pre><STRONG>I must travel far far away
Where nobody knows my name.
There I can rebuild from the ground.
There I will have a new life where I will be free.
I must lay the foundation of my hopes and dreams.
I need to run by night.
Soon my color will not matter.
The night will show the drinking gourd.
I will follow it north.
When the dawn comes my journey will cease
only to start again.
White and black only make mocha.</STRONG></pre>

<pre><STRONG>A flare
A glare
A spark upon the air
Like lightning, thunder upon the sky of bare
And there I sat, staring at the flares and the glare
Thinking of things that happened there.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>I closed my eyes, completely unaware
A scream
Like a gunshot
And then I thought...
A shuffling of feet,
A jostling crowd.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>The screams increased
The crowd aware
Everyone seemed scared,
What could it be
Whatever could have happened
But I still thought...</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>Abruptly the screams ended,
Leaving an empty feeling in the air
Everything was bare
The cameras flash
But then again it all stopped
And I still thought...</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>The silence stood
As it should
And hovered in the air
The screams had died,
I asked myself,
&quot;What has happened here?&quot;</STRONG></pre>

Wondering where I might go next, wanting to know where,

<pre><STRONG>(Danica Rue, Reading Fleming Middle School)
     The brightness of the outside

     Deep inside my thoughts comes my

     A million thoughts waiting to become words.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(Anna Ichel, Round Valley Middle School)
     A far off place where ideas and

     Where everything is impossibly perfect.
     A light shines through from this place
     And a story is born.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(Matt DiGiandomenico, East Amwell School)
     My creativity comes from      
     Something I may see 
	  or read about.
     I usually have an interest

     I m not exactly sure

<pre><STRONG>(Nitasha Bansal, Reading Fleming Middle School)
     Dark, deep               
     A seemingly endless pit
     Emotions swirl and are swept away
     By the raging sea
     Ideas are struggling
     Desperate to be freed
     Down there
     WITHIN

(Jessa Conant, Voorhees High School)
     From feelings            
     From people who make me happy
     From people who hurt me
     From all the deep thinking and

<pre><STRONG>(Liz Upchurch, Voorhees High School)
     My source for creativity           
     I was always alone growing up

     Almost everything I think or do or feel 
     Stems back to that time.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(Jonathan Sasor, East Amwell School)
     My creativity comes from                
     Imagination.  Anything I can 
     Think up may be something to write about.
     I'll think up an ordinary thing 
     And turn it into something
     Extraordinary</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(John Grimaldi)
     I have no definite sources for creative

<pre><STRONG>(Barbara Witmer, Reading Middle School)
     My sources come from my dreams

     Anything that comes to my mind that
     I think will be interesting.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(Jessica King, Reading Fleming Middle School)
     My eyes enclose what I see         
     My nose what I smell
     My mouth what I taste
     My ears what I hear
     And my heart, mind, and soul open up
     And release me in words.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(Jackie Luster, Reading Fleming Middle School)
     From my soul and heart        
     My mind
     My language
     My sense -- the touch of my hand to a pen
     My body
     My face
     My emotions
     My expressions
     Especially my hands.</STRONG></pre>
<pre><STRONG>(Dale Langley, Reading Fleming Middle School)
     My creativity comes from being     
     With others.  My family, friends, 
     And the people I babysit all make me
     Happy or sad or angry.
     I think about the outdoors--
     The sky and clouds, 
     The trees and the hills.
     I feel at peace when 
     I think about these things.
     I create.</STRONG></pre>

<TD width=75%>Life is plagued with difficult decisions. From the last minute
decision made at 2 a.m. about which assignment to complete, to the slightly
more significant decision of which college to attend, the process of choosing
surrounds our lives, day in and day out. In all of the countless decisions
that we ever will make, there is one that stands out from the rest. This
momentous choice is something that everyone has to make for himself, without
the help of friends and family. This road that you choose, most likely
you will follow until the end of your days. Yes, the sticky question is
that of which is the better, peanut butter or jelly? </TD>

<TD width=75%>Inside of everybody's head lurks childhood memories of mother-made
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. For many people, these sandwiches played
an integral part in helping them to grow and achieve happiness, providing
the substance that is so essential to life. But one side of the bread always
seemed a little bit better than the flip side. This could be because it
stuck to the wall longer when winged at high speeds from across the room
or simply because it was more pleasing to the taste buds. Many different
reasons exist as to why someone would like peanut butter or jelly more.

</TABLE>

<TABLE>

<TD width=5%></TD>

<TD width=75%>Taste preference will ultimately determine the decision of
peanut butter over jelly or vice-versa. Jelly is an extremely sugary substance
that is pleasing to eat. It is available in many different flavors to suit
individual taste: strawberry, cherry, grape, etc... you get the idea. This
allows the eater of jelly to pick the flavor that is right for him or her.
Peanut butter has a pleasing taste, and although it, too, is sweet, it
does not have nearly the amount of sugar that jelly has, which may or may
not be your thing. While available in different textures: smooth or chunky,
peanut butter is only available in one flavor, that of peanuts. </TD>

<TD width=20%></td.</tr></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD width=5%></TD>

<TD width=75%>When deciding which is the better, texture must also be taken
into consideration. The texture of peanut butter is thick and sticky. This
allows for good gripping on any surface: bread, walls, people. Also, if
the peanut butter gets accidentally turned upside down, none will spill
out of the canister or fall from your food. The texture of jam is also
sticky, but it is not nearly as thick as peanut butter. It will still stick
to things pretty well, but if turned upside down, some seepage might occur,
so watch out! </TD>

</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD width=5%></TD>

<TD width=75%>One issue that might be important in the decision making
process, especially for all of the health conscious people out there, is
that of fat, calorie, and protein content. In one serving of peanut butter,
there are 16 grams of fat. This is 4 more grams in one tablespoon of peanut
butter than in an entire bar Crunch bar or Hershey's bar. It also contains
200 calories, 140 which are from fat. Its saving grace is that it contains
6 grams of protein. In one serving of jelly, there is no fat, 40 calories,
and no protein. It is obvious that for the weight conscious person, jelly
would be the way to go. </TD>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD width=5%></TD>

<TD width=75%>When making the decision about which of the spreads is right
for you, versatility must also be considered. Besides the actual peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches, how else can these items be used? To answer
that question, we must look at them individually. Some of the known uses
for peanut butter are for celery sticks, cookies, and candy bars. Peanut
butter can also be used to remove sticky substances from hair, (such as
gum) and this is always a plus. Jelly is mostly used for toast and crepes,
and it does not have the ability to remove sticky things from hair. Both
of these substances are typically not eaten by themselves. Peanut butter
is too thick and clogging to eat in large amounts by itself, and if it
were attempted to do so, serious harm to the eater might result. Jelly
is typically not eaten by itself because people can only take so much of
its obscenely high sugar content. If you enjoy heaping amounts of sugar,
then, please, disregard the prior statement. </TD>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD width=5%></TD>

<TD width=75%>The last issue, for all of you hungry yet frugal people out
there, is that of cost. Just like any food, a person can spend any amount
they wish on either peanut butter or jelly by going into some speciality
shop and buying the &quot;world's finest&quot; spread. But on the average,
a one pound container, about 16 servings, of peanut butter runs around
$1.60, which is double the $0.80 required for a one pound and 16 serving
size of jelly. </TD>

<TD width=20%></td.</tr></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD width=5%></TD>

<TD width=75%>Once all of these above facts, plus countless others that
pertain only to you, are taken into consideration, only then can the final
decision be made. The question of peanut butter or jelly may seem trivial
to some cynical folk, but it plays an important part in out lives. It helps
us to distinguish our true identities and to find out who we really are.
If more people would take the time to find out the answers to questions
such as these, then the world would be a much better place to live. </TD>

<P><B>Lieutenant John Mitchell was afraid. He had only been afraid once
before in his life, as far as he could remember. When he was eight, his
older brother took him hiking in the woods near their house. He was attracted
to an area simply by a gut reaction. There was nothing special about this
clump of overgrown moss and shrubs against the rock face, but it was a
visceral feeling eight-year-olds are not very adept in. Almost hypnotically,
he made his way to the shrubbery. His older brother did not seem to share
his enthusiasm and, being an older brother, proceeded to make fun of the
strange way in which his younger sibling approached the rocks. He brushed
the shrubs away to reveal a dank cave, black as the creek that trickled
out of it and back into the rocks. </B></P>

<P><B>Not even exchanging glances, the brothers made their way into the
cave. By now the older Mitchell was as entranced as the younger. The darkness
enveloped them quickly. The musty smell reminded John of his grandmother's
basement with her coal furnace, dirty concrete walls, and jars of pickles,
tomato sauce, and who knows what. As they crept farther into the cave,
the fear crept farther into them. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Mom's going to worry if we aren't back soon,&quot; said David,
the older of the two. &quot;We might as well start heading back. It's just
a cave.&quot; But John would have none of it as he listened to his brother's
voice echoing around him. They had told their mother they would be back
by dusk - and it was only 4:30. John was delighted to feel the water slowly
permeate his shoes and rest between his toes. It was so cold! </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Just a little farther, David,&quot; replied John. &quot;We've
got plenty of time.&quot; So onward they trekked, bumping, bruising, and
scratching, and they finally saw light. They made their way towards the
illumination and were astounded by what they saw. A huge cavern illuminated
by a single shaft of light down the middle of the room and landing on a
podium of rock. The podium was on a small island of rock surrounded by
a moat of water for which there seemed no source. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;This must be just below the hill behind the school,&quot; David
said in awe. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;You could fit two football fields in here!&quot; said John
enthusiastically. He began to make his way towards the center of the room.
The ceiling loomed forty feet above his head. An immense sound slammed
into the side of John's head. It sounded like a thousand hands clapping
at once - like a huge wave rolling into the shore. John looked up towards
the sound. &quot;The ceiling is collapsing!&quot; he shouted to his brother.
They made their way, stumbling towards the cave entrance where they stopped,
perplexed. Had the ceiling been collapsing some- thing surely would have
hit them by now. They turned around slowly. What they saw next neither
of them have been able to sufficiently explain. </B></P>

<P><B>A wave of black swooped down from the ceiling and circled in a deadly
column and folded back on itself before shooting toward the brothers. They
made a narrow escape as they plunged themselves into the opening, barely
missing the onslaught of thousands of bats. </B></P>

<P><B>A musty smell suffocated John as it swarmed around him. He and his
brother clamored back up the wet rock as fast as adrenaline would allow.
In seconds the stinking creatures were on them, engulfing, asphyxiating,
making it impossible to move. Claustrophobia buried the brothers in its
hot grasp as the wings batted against their heads and sticky fur slashed
past their skin. </B></P>

<P><B>Finally, the brothers made it out through the dense canopy closing
off the cave. The bats did not follow them out. John and David could not
even hear the swishing and squeaking of the thousands of bats that seconds
ago covered them. It was as though the creatures never existed. John felt
as if the cave led to another planet or dimension. The bats seemed so hungry...
</B></P>

<P><B>Sitting in the storage closet, Lieutenant John Mitchell was afraid
again. He had seen his superior officer impaled with an axe. He had heard
the grisly fate of Captain Andrews. He remembered the hunger of the bats
and now he felt that same cold. He felt something warm and furry brush
past his ear and he jumped. It turned out only to be a hanging mop. But
for a second there he thought . . . </B></P>

<P><B>What will happen next? </B></P>

<P><B>Was that really only a mop that brushed past John Mitchell's ear?

<P><B><I>Final Episode</I> </B></P>

<P><B><I>Continued by Dan DiMicco</I> </B></P>

<P><B>Original story created by Miriam Pare; previous episodes contributed
by Nicole Baker, Meghan Bissett, Laura Kuznicki (2 episodes), and Desiree
Carmona. </B></P>

<P><B>After Sam and Mary turned the corner, their hearts stopped. The silence
in the mall was deafening. All that could be heard was the ringing in their
ears. A dark figure loomed over them, shadowing all light. They could only
make out two shoes at the bottom. </B></P>

<P><B>The figure spoke, &quot;Welcome to the mall.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>The two teenagers were speechless. For the first time in their short
lives, they saw nothing. Nothing in their futures, nothing in their deaths.
</B></P>

<P><B>&quot;NEVER!&quot; Sam hollered, the veins in his throat poking through
his skin. </B></P>

<P><B>The figure jumped and grabbed the two teens in one horrendous move.
Sam and Mary were helpless to stop the figure's grip. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot; Mary pleaded helplessly.
</B></P>

<P><B>&quot;You'll NEVER get away with this!&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>The figure stood there, his own heart beating faster. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Shut up you little twerps; you and your clich&eacute;s are
ticking me off!&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>Sam ferociously attacked the figure, clawing, kicking, raving in
all directions. The little kid in him was beginning to show nicely. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Let us go, you big bully!&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Shut up.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>The figure took the two kids into another dark spot in the mall.
Sam read the letters on the shop, &quot;Wild Bill's Fish and Game Hunting
Shop.&quot; What an interesting store... I wonder what they have in there...
</B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Why are you taking us here??? What are you going to do? WHY?
HELP!!! MOMMY!&quot; Mary pleaded, and started sucking her thumb. She was
obviously regressing back into her childhood. </B></P>

<P><B>The doors to the store opened as they approached. The fishing lures
caught the attention of Sam. I should buy those, he thought, they catch
my attention. They must get the fishes! Sam's eyes slowly began to drift
around in all directions. Nothing else interesting caught his eyes, other
than the guns on the far wall. If only I could get to those guns! </B></P>

<P><B>Mary, however, was still trapped in her childhood, and she began
to cry even more. All of a sudden, loud noises went off all around them.
Wild blasts of light, smoke and tear gas broke loose. Men in black ran
in the entrances, and flew through windows. A very large man came flying
in through the roof of the mall. The letters on his black outfit read,
&quot;SPLAT.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>Thinking quickly, Sam used this time to entertain the figure. &quot;Why,
those are wonderful shoes you have on! Where did you get them? At the shoe
store at the other end of the mall? How much did they cost?&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Shut up.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>In a mad dash, the figure ran for the guns. However, since his shoes
did not fit correctly, he fell face down. The figure began to curse, and
scream all the profanities in the <U>Oxford Dictionary</U>. After he got
up, his costume fell off, and he appeared to look like a normal man. His
face, however, was still a little distorted. After a closer look at the
figure, Sam concluded that he was a disgruntled postal worker. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Help us! Help us! This big man killed our friends and kidnapped
us! Help!&quot; Mary was still having some problems. </B></P>

<P><B>The rest of the SPLAT team broke through the mall and went after
the man. The tear gas the SPLAT team threw in the building was very flammable,
especially when mixed with chemicals from the local Agway. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Stay away from me! I didn't do anything! I didn't kill the
kids! It was the voices in my head!&quot; Wild shots rang out in the air;
sparks flew, and gas ignited. The mall went up like Waco! </B></P>

<P><B>After the clean up, witnesses swore the last thing they could hear,
was shouting. They could only make out part of it. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you pesky
ki...&quot; </B></P>

<P><B><I>The End</I>. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Mall Madness&quot; has been discontinued. </B></P>

<P><B>It is now replaced with &quot;The Fifty-third Street Bar&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>The air was cold and bitter. Fragrant smoke flowed through the autumn
air. Cars traveling down the road left an exhaust trail in the cold evening.
Street lamps glittered, casting their yellow beams downward. Artificial
sun could not light this dark place. </B></P>

<P><B>One such beam gleamed upon the 53rd Street Bar. The outside lights
were comparable to the street lamps. The windows were lit to anyone willing
to enter. </B></P>

<P><B>Sylvan Garrison was one of these few people. Alone and shy, he was
not happy. Women dancers moved in time with the music. Sylvan sat nursing
his drink. He had come to make some friends but wasn't having any luck.
</B></P>

<P><B>Maureen Poppy sauntered in the door, flowed up to the bar and ordered
her usual. &quot;New guy in town, ever seen him before,&quot; said the
bartender gesturing at Sylvan. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;I'll show him a good time,&quot; winked Maureen. </B></P>

<P><B>Her sly grace became her, and she slithered to the chair beside the
lonely Sylvan. The dancer flung an article of clothing towards Sylvan.
As it passed him, he flinched at the evil garment. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Ehehe, relax. It's only a bra.&quot; Maureen took a long sip
from her champagne. </B></P>

<P><B>Winston Weich slid into the bar. He slowly walked to a bar stool,
away from everyone else, and sat down. The bartender gav him some of his
finest chardonnay. He slowly began to drink away his problems and his memories.
</B></P>

<P><B>Reverend Murphy wandered into the bar and stopped dead in his tracks.
</B></P>

<P><B>&quot;My Good God!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;A den of sinful pleasures!&quot;
He quickly walked straight to the bar and beckoned the bartender. &quot;Could
I hang up these posters for my revivial meeting?&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>The bartender slowly answered the good reverend with a discreet glass
of J.D. </B></P>

<P><B><I>What will happen next? Will the reverend be pulled into a life
of sin? Will Sylvan's life be changed forever? You can create the next

<TD width=65%><B><I>&quot;When I grow up, I'm going to be an astronaut
and be the first to walk on Mars,&quot; stated the second grade girl. She
was outside with her friends during school recess. It was a beautiful,
sunny day, and they were dreaming about their future. </I></B>
<P><B><I>A couple of boys ran by and overheard their friends talking. Stopping
abruptly, they skipped back to join in the conversation. &quot;Wow,&quot;
interrupted one boy, &quot;that's really neat. But I'm going to create
the fastest space ship so we can travel past Mars before we get too old.
Maybe you can be an astronaut for my shuttle.&quot;</I> </B></P>

<P><B><I>&quot;Maybe! That would be really cool,&quot; excitedly replied
the girl.</I> </B></P>

<P><B><I>The students continued their discussion into the classroom and
asked their teacher, Mrs. Star, what she wanted to be when she was their
age. She got the class settled down and rambled off numerous different
dreams she had when she was younger. Some of them were funny, and others
were intriguing. Concluding her childhood fantasies, she explained how
her dream of teaching became a reality. The children learned how important
it is to dream, and think creatively. They realized that the career they
chose--the dream(s), in the sense of aspirations/goals, they pursued--would
be their contribution(s) to the the world. </I></B></P>

<P><B>Too often, as age increases, this valuable lesson becomes buried
under numerous phone numbers and strict schedules in a complicated maze
located under the skull. Filled with important facts and haunting errands,
the mind constantly confronts things needing to be accomplished. Obstacles
are endless and wide smooth paths are rarely experienced. </B></P>

<P><B>In youth, however, the mind, the body, and the soul roam freely along
roads with wide shoulders. Each day, an exciting adventure begins as new
items are discovered, untraveled paths are walked, and imaginations are
utilized. In time, however, the experiences encountered during life shade
opinions, views, and perceptions different colors. Greatly influenced by
the practical world, one's imagination becomes restricted with responsibility.
Opportunity increases throughout one's life, but inescapable obligations
tend to intensify with age. Unfortunately, tentative prospects may not
enable present requirements to be fulfilled. As a result, restrictions
are inadvertently placed upon the public. Dreams once sworn by have suddenly
disappeared behind thick gray clouds of limitations filled with burdening
conditions. An occurrence similar to this, demonstrates that life has lost
meaning and transformed into a boring routine. </B></P>

<P><B>Life should be anything but a boring routine. Adventures, risks,
laughs, love, happiness, sorrow, and other sensations exist to make life
a roller coaster loaded with peaks, valleys, and unexpected turns. Chasing
one's true dream(s) allows each individual's life roller coaster to stand
apart from the rest. </B></P>

<P><B>Throughout life, dreams are naturally refined, changed, and interpreted
differently. Nevertheless, dreams should always be within one's sight.
They are necessary aspects of life which aid in the evolution of our continually
developing world. Technology, medical advancements, different teaching
techniques, new age thinking, and various other ways of life in the 90's
all began as dreams. The mind, constantly thinking, instantaneously forms
opinions, that are accompanied by images and ideas, based upon the present
situation. It is essential to explore the imaginative section of the mind.
As a thorough search is underway, the mind and its power, will be observed
with awe. At first glance, the amazing sight cannot be seen, however closer
examination confirms its beauty; a colorful kaleidoscope full of spectacular
dreams, goals, and aspirations, waiting to be recognized, to be achieved,
and to be utilized for tomorrow. </B></P>

<P><B>Recognition is a key element when striving to attain a goal. It is
important to pinpoint exactly what dream is going to be conquered. Some
regard this to be a complete waste of time. In their mind, dreams are simply
fantasies, an escape from reality. If this were true, we would still be
carving stories in stone. Many had to pursue wild dreams in order for today's
world to be a modern society. </B></P>

<P><B>Dreams must not be thought of as unrealistic fantasies, simply wasting
time when considered or, even worse, pursued. Determination and dedication
to your true goal will enable you to succeed through all your endeavors.
If you believe that your dream will come true by sleeping on the hammock
and creating pictures in the clouds, you're dreaming. No one will serve
your dreams to you on a golden platter, but by working, many will be able
to see your golden platters filled with personal accomplishments. Remember,
no one will do anything for you, especially if you aren't willing to do
it for yourself. </B></P>

<P><B>Everyone must realize that each person has a unique gift to contribute
to this world. There are no exceptions to this statement, only one requirement;
it comes from your heart. This condition ensures that the contribution
is meaningful to each individual. A sense of humble pride and accomplishment
will be experienced when you initialize the world with your unique gift.
Many times, these priceless gifts lie within your goals. Talents are discovered
as we steadily trudge along the rugged tracks of life. </B></P>

<P><B>Besides discovering hidden talents along the path of life, a change
of heart may manifest itself. The highway of life has many exits. Pick
and choose according to desire. Always be cognizant of the consequences.
Remember it's natural for people's areas of interest to change from time
to time. Even when drastic transition doesn't transpire, one's goals usually
undergo adjustment. They are refined many times before realistic ideals
are uncovered. After this phase, the first steps toward success are taken.
</B></P>

<P><B>Often, perceptions concerning the accomplishment of goals appear
closer than reality. They jump a few times with hopes of confiscating their
dream. After a few attempts fail, the need for support becomes obvious
and basic ground work begins. A solid foundation beneath our feet is steadily
built before setting up the ladder towards success. As this sturdy base
is slowly built, some may try to discourage you by belittling your efforts
and minimizing your progress. It is also important to remember that luck
and/or heritage have nothing to do with personal goals. Dreams lie within,
along with determination. Devotion determines your future. Therefore, you
control your fate, not luck, heritage or any other factor. </B></P>

<P><B>Dreams create options for your destiny; they are the shadows of our
future. They are perfect outlines missing a few minor details. As in Peter
Pan, it is first necessary to locate your shadow. Then, you must aggressively
capture it. Next, the obtained shadow must become your prisoner. Coincidentally
forgetting your handcuffs, you are forced to attach your accomplishment
permanently with a needle and thread. Finally, after having the shadow
secured, you can begin to utilize it. With this new addition to your existence,
a new adventure, maybe to Never Neverland, will begin. </B></P>

</B>
<P><B><TT>by Ryan Gernay </TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>In the 1970's, many believed prisoners deserved a rehabilitation
program to set them on the right track once they re-entered into society.
Today, however, the minds of the people have changed dramatically. They
now feel prisoners should lead a life of isolation. They feel the job of
the prisons is to separate the criminals from the rest of society. What
has changed so many minds over the past two and half decades? The common
answer is that prisons are too lenient, and criminals are unafraid of being
thrown in jail. If prisons truly are a correctional facility, then the
public has a right to worry because those who walk out of out unaffected
by their &quot;bad experience&quot; are ready to commit another crime.</TT>

<TD width=65%><B><TT>Many people may be asking the question, &quot;Why
wouldn't someone be afraid of being thrown in jail?&quot; There is one
simple answer: luxury. Most prisoners have more luxuries in their jailhouses
than most hard-working Americans. Inmates have access to body-building
equipment, televisions, radios, and reading materials. The federal court
required North Carolina to equip thirteen prisons with a set of drums,
three guitars, and five Frisbees. At one Massachusetts facility, prisoners
were served prime rib dinners. It is these luxuries which deny criminals
the persuasion they need to convince them that crime doesn't pay.</TT>
</B>
<P><B><TT>It may not seem as obvious, but aside from the luxuries of the
jail cells, prisoners are also granted working luxuries. In fact, not all
prisoners are even forced to work. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
91% of all prisoners work in the federal system, and only 70% work in the
state. Those who are exempt include the medically or mentally unfit and
those who can't be trusted to work without harming another inmate (Lacayo
33). The average prisoner workweek is only thirty-four and a half hours.
Criminals had relatively little work to do, and the remainder of their
time was occupied by leisure activities. Quoted in Sarah Glazer's essay
&quot;Can Prisons Rehabilitate Criminals,&quot; George Bush indicated a
tough stance on criminal behavior. </TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>A common-sense approach to crime means that if we're going to
affect people's behavior, we must have a criminal-justice system in which
there is an expectation that if you commit a crime, you will be caught;
and if caught, you will be prosecuted; and if convicted, you will do the
time. For far too long, a privileged class of violent and repeat offenders
have calculated that crime really does pay--that our criminal-justice system
is a crapshoot where the risks are worth the rewards. Well, it's time we
change the odds--and up the stakes enormously (Glazer 430).</TT> </B></P>

<P><B><TT>It may have been this paragraph-long speech that gave other politicians
as well as prison officials the incentive to take action.</TT> </B></P>

<P><B><TT>Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona banned all TV stations
as well as pornographic magazines. The inmates' leisure time now includes
one of the following: CNN, old Disney films, or reruns of Newt Gingrich's
10-part course on revitalizing American civilization. In Richard Lacayo's
&quot;Prisons: The Real Hard Cell&quot; essay, Arpaio said, &quot;I want
to make this place so unpleasant that they won't even think about doing
something that could bring them back. I want them to suffer&quot; (Lacayo
31). This is a view supported by the majority of Americans. </TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>Senator Phil Gramm of Texas believes inmates should be forced
to work more than the required thirty-four hours each week. He's pushing
to make the prisoner workweek seventy hours; a total of ten hours each
day. This amendment is well supported by the people. Whenever Gramm makes
a campaign stop, the crowd cheers, &quot;We've got to stop building prisons
like Holiday Inns&quot; (Lacayo 31).</TT> </B></P>

<P><B><TT>As part of the Republican-sponsored anti-crime bill, a new amendment
has been added which will try to deny luxurious living conditions in federal
prisons. If this amendment is allowed to enter the final version of the
bill, it would forbid such things as premium cable channels and R- or X-
rated movies. Representative Dick Zimmer of New Jersey, the above bill's
sponsor, is trying to create a law that would deny federal prison money
if the states did not ban such things as in-cell TVs and coffee makers,
body-building equipment, and any food better than that served to U.S. soldiers
(Lacayo 31).</TT> </B></P>

<P><B><TT>Prison wardens and guards say taking away the leisure activities
and luxuries of the prisoners would be a big mistake. Since they're the
ones who must live with the the convicts at close range, they think the
inmates need the variety of activities to choose from because it keeps
them busy and reduces the risk of a prison riot erupting. Thomas McKinney
of the Alfred Hughes state prison unit in Gatesville, Texas said in Lacayo's
&quot;Prisons: The Real Hard Cell&quot; essay, &quot;To ban such things
as TV and recreation would take away one of our best management tools&quot;
(Lacayo 32).</TT> </B></P>

<P><B><TT>Will the prisons ever run the way the people feel they should:
to separate the criminals from the rest of society, make them suffer, and
teach them how to live a normal life? Probably not if the constitution
has anything to say about it. But the voices of the people are getting
louder and stronger. They tried giving the prisoners a fair chance to prove
themselves in the past through the rehabilitation programs. But some prisoners
proved themselves to be incapable of change. Now the people just want to
turn the tables on the criminals who inhabit their cities. They want them
to suffer and lead lives of hard work and isolation. But that goal may
prove to be a failure if prison leniency continues strongly into the future.</TT>

<TD width=65%><A NAME="The Prozac Addiction"></A><B>The Prozac Addiction
</B>
<P><B>by Lisa Routel </B></P>

<P><B>It has been called the &quot;pills of pills&quot;- a green and white
capsule that was introduced in 1988 and has become one of the ten best-selling
drugs in the world. Prozac offers nothing less than self-transformation,
turning self-doubt into confidence, increasing energy, improving one's
social skills. However, the sacrifice of this scientific advancement is
the loss of individuality. </B></P>

<P><B>There's no denying it, Prozac is remarkable. Prozac has positive
results in treating major mental illnesses from psychotic depression to
eating disorders to schizophrenia. It works by altering the biochemistry
of a single neurotransmitter, serotonin. Normally, brain cells that produce
serotonin quickly reabsorb the chemical and deactivate it, clearing the
pathway for the next chemical signal. Prozac interferes with that reabsorption
process, making more serotonin available in the brain ( Jaret 396). Prozac
has the power to give social confidence to the timid, make the sensitive
brash, lend the introvert the social skills of a salesman. Dr. Peter Kramer,
psychiatrist and author of Listening to Prozac, prescribed Prozac to many
of his patients. He began to see a clear picture of how poorly patients
fared when they were inhibited (Kramer 15). The realization of how our
culture favors one interpersonal style was obvious. </B></P>

<P><B>However, is it ethical to choose which traits we value and which
we choose to suppress? &quot;No,&quot; says Chris Dymyk, who has seen the
disasterous effects of Prozac. He recalls how he once knew of a friend's
brother, who turned violent when on the medication, and threatened to kill
his whole family. Dymyk also feels Prozac &quot;stifles individuality.&quot;
In Dr. Kramer's book, <U>Listening to Prozac</U>, he shares a story about
one of his patients, a man named Sam. He was an architect, who was suffering
from a bout of melancholy. Even though his wife disapproved of it, Sam
had an interest in pornography. As he reached forty, Sam fell into a bout
of depression set off by the death of his parents. Sam was soon prescribed
an antidepressant; it worked only partially, leaving him able to function
at work but left him with a constant feeling of vulnerability. </B></P>

<P><B>Soon, it was revealed with further sessions with Dr. Kramer, Sam
recalled having been an obsessed child. This obsessive quality faded as
he entered adulthood and focused on his career. When Sam's depression failed
to respond to the medication, Dr. Kramer thought about the hints of his
history of something resembling obsessive compulsive disorder. Prozac,
at the time a new antidepressant, was thought to have the potential to
ameliorate compulsiveness. The change that came was remarkable. Sam not
only recovered from his depression, he declared himself &quot;better than
well.&quot; He felt more vitally alive. Sam had fewer rough edges. He experienced
this change as a loss. The style he had nurtured and defended for years
now seemed not a part of him but an illness. Sam was convinced that his
interest in pornography had been a physiological obsession. Sam had allowed
Prozac not only to cure the episode of depression, but also to tell him
how he was to be constituted. </B></P>

<P><B>Prozac's power to alleviate depression, shyness, and hypersensitivity
is beneficial, however, only in the severest of cases. The indiscriminate
use of Prozac runs our culture into the risk of covering itself in a veil
of monotony. Dr. Peter Kramer foresees the social implications involved:
&quot;We cannot escape entirely the fear that a drug that makes people
optimistic and confident will rob them of the morally beneficial effects
of melancholy and angst&quot; (Nichols 37). </B></P>

<P><B>However, many doctors appear too liberal with their prescriptions.
&quot;If a patient comes to me feeling unhappy or out of sorts, why not
try Prozac?&quot; as one leading psychiatrist put it. &quot;It's not going
to do them any harm, and it just might help&quot;(Jaret 397). Even a prominent
researcher was bemoaning the fact that Prozac takes several weeks to become
effective, and he looks forward to the day when a quick-acting version
is available (Jaret 396). </B></P>

<P><B>There is an aura of mystery that surrounds Prozac. Neuroscientists
still can't identify all of its effects. Unfortunately, Prozac may present
serious side-effects that are still unknown. Prozac's long-term effects
might not be known for decades. &quot;I'm very concerned about Prozac,&quot;
says Dr. Brandes, who reported in 1992 that rats and mice with artificially
induced cancer showed an increased rate of tumor growth when they were
given Prozac (Nichols 37). </B></P>

<P><B>Altogether, Prozac has proven to be a medical breakthrough-- eliminating
severe bouts of depression and other chronic mental illnesses. However,
I feel Dr. Kramer stated it perfectly when he wrote that sometimes &quot;you
take Prozac to treat a symptom, and it transforms your sense of self &quot;
(Nichols 39). All I know is, in the future, I don't want to be walking
in a crowd, surrounded by a sea of faces, and realizing each face is the
same. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;No one ever discovers the depths of his own loneliness.&quot;<I>Georges
Bernanos</I> </B></P>

<P><B>The field was empty, less the afflicted sapling. A small, warped
tree, striving to live in the center of a barren, creatureless plain. Every
other tree had fallen at the whim of flesh, except that one. It had been
decided that even though it'd be alone, being so small, it wasn't worth
the effort. Tufts of ill-placed leaves adorned the branches in a mesmerizing
pattern. Surrounded by low grasses, it was visible for miles on the flat
plain, but from the tower it was the lone green spot on a sea of burnt
browns. </B></P>

<P><B>As the sun rose, its rays bent and reflected at strange angles. The
rays of warmth rippled through the swirling blue glass, a lone pane. Circular
and framed in iron, it was the only source of light. </B></P>

<P><B>A drop of water fell from the cold gray stone of the ceiling and
ran down my nose, leaving a moist trail. As it hit the floor, it shattered
like crystal, sending rays of distorted light reeling. For a glimmer of
a second, the room was bathed in sunlight. The small components, bound
to the floor by an unseen force, surveyed my nothingness. </B></P>

<P><B>The gray stones formed a solid wall that stretched for a full revolution
around me. Dank and empty, I had no one with whom to share my captivity,
less my little liquid friend. As I glanced he had evaporated leaving only
a mark behind as his epitaph. I pleaded with a god I knew well for my time
to leave this world and wished I could flow through the shattered walls,
but I could not fall through <I>these</I> cracks. </B></P>

<P><B>As night fell, even the warmth left me. Skin cold and damp, I was
being consumed by sheets of fire, the walls of my internal hell. I begged
for someone to melt away with, someone to share this isolation. </B></P>

<TD width=75%><B>Gradually, the ice begins to melt, and it is able to flow
freely once again. However, with this change the charcoal clouds that invade
the sky carry torment. As the water falls, the current gains momentum.
The water jostles and twists and turns. As the floor churns endlessly,
like the eye of a hurricane, the brown ugliness turns over and over. Ugliness
that would seem to go on forever.</B> 
<P><B>That was not the end of it.</B></P>

<P><B>The water calmed and gently lapped onto the shore, the black, lush
soil of the woods. The tiger lilies bloomed. Each petal coyly opening,
absorbing the radiant energy. A beam of sunlight trickled down from the
sky, shining on the river.</B></P>

<TD width=65%><B>Around me cool lush trees block out harsh rays. They cast
shadows which seem to carry the chirps and snippets of bird talk, crickets
in harmony. I lie down and calmly breathe. The absence of light coats my
body with a slick grey that I can't wash away, can't even peel away. I
try to drift elsewhere, ignoring the shadows, focusing on my breath. Sucking
air swiftly with a whisper through my nostrils. The tight coppery smell
of the crackling water, sifting through the air reminding me... </B>
<P><B>not of rebirth but of the steely thickness dripping into streams
and veins- cold hospital floors where everything echoes. Everything frees
(my thoughts, words, motions), and it hurts to try and understand, so I
. . . </B></P>

<P><B>feel at peace. Everything loosens, and I can think with a clarity
that is new to me, but it feels old and familiar. And I accept this because
I am getting older even if my wrinkles aren't abundantly visible. If I
were younger, I would want time to slow down, so I could jump and play
on the rocks forever, not heeding my mother's call to &quot;be careful&quot;
and not falling over the rocks to an almost inevitable death because I
. . . </B></P>

<P><B>didn't understand that maybe I would be the last one left running
through those hospital halls, building DNA structures out of blocks, praying
with Bert and Ernie for a cure--wondering why I couldn't see . . . </B></P>

<P><B>the fish (her). </B></P>

<P><B>And then when I got into double digits I wanted time to speed up,
so I could be older and do everything like the &quot;big kids&quot; because
they never got lost in the woods. . . they never got lost in the tubes
or the elevators, lifting you upward to the sky or downward to a place
where I can only see her through the plastic bag she sits in (oh, I can't
remember the terminology because I'm so young, so young that my hands are
still so tiny and I can't reach the door handle), and I see her chest rise,
fall, rise, fall,. . .rise--slowly breathing different air --not the air
of the forest where... </B></P>

<P><B>I sit on the smooth grey rock and realize life and time are working
hand in hand because they both seem so unfair and refuse to be manipulated.

<P><B>&quot;Hand in hand, I walk through the mall with my girlfriend. It

was struck with the brilliant idea of exploring the array of specialty
shops and department stores clumped together in everyone's favorite marvel
of modern shopping convenience-the mall. </B></P>

<TD width=65%><B>We strolled along at a lethargic pace when, suddenly,
my arm was yanked with an unexpected ferocity. Before I realized what was
the matter, I passed under the sign which entitled my doom-Bath and Body
Works. This palace of hygiene haunts the dreams of every man ever to make
an entertaining experience of shopping. The ominous flow of the words off
the lips causes grown men to shiver in fear. I was truly petrified. </B>
<P><B>I thought to myself, Okay, you're a big guy. You can handle this.
It's just a stupid, feminine store. </B></P>

<P><B>Oh, how wrong one pitiful person can be. Smack! I'm slammed in the
face with the force of a Mack truck. Fruits and berries tear away at the
intricate patchwork of my sanity. My nostrils are on fire. The multitude
of scents presently entering my unsuspecting nose pushes me to the brink
of olfactory eruption. ''Look, it's blueberry bodywash,&quot; she marvels
as I grasp for a whiff of the uncorrupted oxygen necessary for life. &quot;Ooohh,
peach moisturizer. I love how my legs feel after I put this on.&quot; How
can she stand this odorous hell as it eats away at my weakening brain.
&quot;Oh, my god, lavender bubble bath. I can't wait to get home and hop
into the tub.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;No! Help me, dear lord! I can't take it anymore! God have mercy!&quot;

<P><B>His passion spits at me. Tongues flaring wildly about, raging and
out of control. He dances; moods so dynamic, constantly changing. Peaceful
and serene, as much as one can imagine. Until, swiftly, the earth's breath
carries him under her wing, illuminating and capturing the essence of the
night in his smoldering gray eyes. In the next instant, anger spouts upward,
erupting fiercely to a wild conclusion, warming me and sending a glow to
caress my skin. His eyes burn bright in mine. I close my eyes and inhale
his scent and smile. </B></P>

</B>
<P><BR>

</P>

<P><B>I was tired and it was late; already for some minutes I had been
bathed in that delicious warm numbness that sweeps over one in relaxation
of muscles long tense and strained from a day s rigors, but I could not
sleep. The insomnia was familiar, and I felt it creep up and envelop me
like a constricting gag, restraining me from the peace of losing myself
in blissful slumber. Though I was but a mere child of ten, I knew sleeplessness
as well as the contours of the bed in which I lay, but that made it no
less disconcerting. </B></P>

<P><B>Finally, unable to keep my eyes closed any longer, I unveiled them
to the pitch darkness hanging over my room, a cloak of deepest royal purple.
I cannot pretend that the dark did not frighten me; although I had, of
course, performed the routine ceremony of checking under my bed before
retiring, some innate part of me deep within whispered; black rumors brought
terror flooding through every nerve of my body. My limbs tensed tight as
a ready bowstring, and in that moment of sickening fear, I knew that Morpheus
had truly abandoned me this night. </B></P>

<P><B>I could not remain there, lying still in the stifling blackness with
Heaven-only-knew-what sort of malignant creature advancing upon me. So,
with a gasp, I finally sprang from my prison and ran to the window. </B></P>

<P><B>Thick, blue curtains separated me from the summer night sky beyond,
but I drew them back quickly and threw open the glass pane with a trembling
hand. Before me, the sky stretched endlessly onwards, and my eyes roved
rapidly as I searched its surface frantically for some ray of hope. It
was a cloudy night, however, and there was nothing above but ebony clouds
racing in a light breeze. My throat constricted; the oppressive gloom pressed
in on me from above, from below, from all around, and I felt as though
I would scream... </B></P>

<P><B>Suddenly, for a mere moment, a gap opened in the clouds on high to
reveal one bright, glittering star, whose rays fell upon me as balm upon
a wound. Like a diamond in a sea of velvet it was, myriad rays streaming
from its facets onto my upturned face, imparting to me in that fraction
of a second the calm and serenity of unimaginable age, knowledge, and wisdom.
</B></P>

<P><B>In another moment, it was gone, the black clouds closing over that
one, tiny hole in Heaven as the Red Sea closed over the head of the Egyptians.
But my fright was gone as well, banished like Arcita from Theseus and Athens,
and I smiled into the darkness that had so recently evoked a grimace of
horror. </B></P>

<P><B>Closing the window and the curtains, I turned back to my bed, fatigue
abruptly washing over me. Confining prison had become a welcome haven,
and I clambered eagerly into the waiting embrace of the crisp, clean sheets.
Just before I drifted off into slumber, however, I remembered a Bible verse
so often quoted by my mother and father - &quot;A light shines in the darkness,
and the darkness has not overcome it.&quot; Smiling again, I rolled over
and let myself go down into the lightless realms of sleep. Ad astra per
aspera, indeed. </B></P>

<P>The full moon hangs low, </P>

<P>Its eerie glow the only source of light around. </P>

<P>A thick gray fog moves in across the sky, </P>

<P>Hovering over the moon like a helicopter over a criminal. </P>

<TD width=60%>The tall pines are lined up across the forest floor 
<P>Resembling soldiers lining up and preparing for battle. </P>

<P>They stand stock still. </P>

<P>The only time they move is when </P>

<P>The gentle breeze soothingly rustles their needles. </P>

<P>A stagnant pond lies in the distance. </P>

<P>The reflection of the moonlight on the water </P>

<P>Gives it a luminous effect. </P>

<P>The twinkling stars sit suspended in the night sky, </P>

<P>Like a mobile over a baby's crib. </P>

<P>The wild animals saunter around the forest floor </P>

<P>Desperately searching for something to eat </P>

<P>Without the slightest inkling that they may be the target themselves.
</P>

<P>As the night proceeds, </P>

<P>The moon goes down and the sun comes up, </P>

<P>Its beautiful orange light </P>

<P>Just about able to peer over the horizon, </P>

<P>Like a small child over a countertop. </P>

<P>As day continues and night draws closer and closer, </P>

<P>The sun begins to descend </P>

<P>Giving the sky a purplish mien. </P>

<P>The moon comes out making its appearance known. </P>

<P>Once the sun has completed its downward journey </P>

<P>And the sky is black as coal, </P>

<P>Mother Nature continues with her nighttime cycle </P>

<P>To prepare for the dawn of the new day that awaits her. </P>

<P>Some days you may find yourself being torn to pieces </P>

<P>Every rip destroys a piece of you that you worked so hard and so long
to build </P>

<P>You want to jump in and hold them back, but nothing can stop their desire
to </P>

<P>make your life miserable </P>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>So then you're left there all alone </P>

<P>Sobbing, begging for help, picking up the pieces </P>

<P>And then you begin to put them back together </P>

<P>Binding them stronger this time </P>

<P>Only hoping that they won't be torn down once again </P>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>You smile as you survive the next few blows </P>

<P>But are just waiting for another major blow to tear you down again </P>

<P>Leaving you with the pieces </P>

<P><I>That she is a free spirit.</I> </P>

<P><I>Ready, willing, and able to do whatever she wants at the spur of

<P><I>Others say that she is out of control, or maybe that she has a bad

<P><I>Yet this does not phase her. </I></P>

<P><I>She blows it right off.</I> </P>

<P><I>She does not care about what others think is right and what is wrong.
</I></P>

<P><I>She only cares about her thoughts and what she thinks is right.</I>
</P>

<P><I>She has her own mind and her own values.</I> </P>

<P><I>One of her values is that she does not judge a person by what they
look like, but on their personality.</I> </P>

<P><I>Reputation means little to her. </I></P>

<P><I>There are some people who make fun of her clothes, her hair, and
her friends. </I></P>

<P><I>When they laugh she merely just shrugs it off, and figures that it
is just jealousy or low self-esteem.</I> </P>

<P><I>She is as free as a bird who can just soar all day long. </I></P>

<P><I>With her dreams she reaches for the stars </I></P>

<P><I>and will not give up until she grabs them.</I> </P>

<P><I>But there are some who are afraid to reach, afraid to dream, afraid
to be.</I> </P>

<P><I>Those who are will never live life to its fullest, and never be the
dream.</I> </P>

<P><B>The tires screeched around the turn in the road. Sirens blaring could
be heard miles away. The pressure was on as the getaway car sped away.
People on the street were frantically screaming as they tried to recall
the face of the masked man.</B> </P>

<TD width=65%><B>Charlie and Ed had been best friends since the second
grade. Now they were twenty-three-year-olds and still as immature as they
had been then. Behind the wheel was Charlie, a young, handsome man, though
not very bright. Ed sat in the passenger seat, huddled in a small mass,
air puffing in and out of his lungs at a quickening pace.</B> 
<P><B>&quot;Drive faster, you idiot! You're gonna get us caught!&quot;
Ed was letting the horror in his voice show through. &quot;I knew this
was a bad idea. Why I am doing this?&quot; Ed mumbled as Charlie pressed
down on the gas pedal, and the acceleration was felt. &quot;Ah, now that's
more like it.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>The bright, sunny day slowly turned into a dark, mischievous night.
The chase had been on for five hours, and Charlie's station wagon was running
out of fuel. Charlie knew that it would be over soon, and that they would
be in a great deal of trouble. The police car behind the old, beat-up car
was still shining its bright lights into their window. The loud siren was
pounding in the young mens' heads. This would be a day that they would
never forget.</B> </P>

<P><B>Charlie's mind was in a raw mass of confusion. He knew what he was
doing was wrong, even though he had not done the crime himself. He would
be an accessory when they were found, and that would be just as bad as
doing it himself. Guilt swept over his entire body until he began to quiver.
His hands shook with fear and the car sped out of control.</B> </P>

<P><B>Ed gripped the stolen money in his sweaty hands and prayed that his
pitiful life would be spared. <I>What would my mother think if she were
still alive?</I> Ed thought. The idea swept through his mind with tremendous
pain. <I>It's all over now. My life is over.</I> One single tear ran down
Ed's face. He knew what he had to do. </B></P>

<P><B>The spinning station wagon flung itself into the middle of the road
at a speed that was unimaginable. The police stopped their patrol car and
quickly hopped out. The wagon came to a halt with a loud smash. Ed's and
Charlies' seemingly lifeless bodies were thrown through the windshield
onto the soft spring grass. The chase was over.</B> </P>

<P><B>Emergency vehicles raced into the scene. It was unknown whether or
not Ed and Charlie were still alive. The bodies were loaded into the ambulance,
and it was determined that Ed had died. Charlie was barely holding on.
They reached the hospital in a matter of minutes. Charlie would eventually
be all right.</B> </P>

<P><B>Weeks later, Charlie had almost totally recovered. He still had to
go through physical therapy, but all his wounds had healed. It was the
day that Charlie was going to be able to go home from the hospital when
he saw the silver-badged men come into his room. &quot;Are you Charles
Edensmer?&quot; they inquired.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Charlie answered. Fear built up inside of him.</B>
</P>

<P><B>&quot;Well, I am afraid that you are being charged with the robbery
of Sunny County Bank, young man. Do you deny this charge?&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;I only drove the car, sir.&quot; said Charlie.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Did you take part in this crime?&quot; the officer asked Charlie.</B>
</P>

<P><B>&quot;Yes, sir, I did.&quot; he replied.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Then you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say
can and will be used against you in the court of law.&quot; The handcuffs
were placed on Charlie, and he was taken away.</B> </P>

<P><B>We kept driving. And driving still. Hoping and waiting and hoping

if the void needed filling. The car was wet with exhaustion. It had been
hours... or days.</B> </P>

<TD width=65%><B>Courtney started humming. It was a nondescript, bored
hum, most likely never having been labeled a tune in its short life. The
initially endearing hum grew incessant. I gritted my teeth and sighed through
my nose. None of the pressure dissipated in the deep sigh. The humming
continued, eventually blending with the roar of the jalopy's motor. I closed
my eyes, relaxed, leaned against the seat. Everything was dank outside.
Trees and wet leaves and mud. I would have liked to swim in the humidity.
Courtney Courtney Courtney. The sound of the word rolled around my brain
cavity and echoed. Courtney Courtney Courtney.</B> 
<P><B>I had been single for two weeks. Mmmm. It was quiet, but comforting.
The nerves, the confusion, the excitement... all alleviated for the time-being.
Still, I had loved him once. Thoroughly. Letting him in felt right. Suddenly
my stomach turned itself inside out. Knowing I was free was like knowing
my name: familiar, but unfortunate.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;This is all getting sort of monotonous, isn't it Phoenix?&quot;
she asked me. I ignored her. &quot;Isn't it? Didn't we pass that tree already?&quot;
I sort of smiled and shook my head. The road was still brown, but the pebbles
were beginning to get thicker, metamorphosing into rocks. And then boulders
and finally... mud. Courtney began to giggle. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;My tires are really gonna get pissed at me for this one, Pheen.&quot;
I debated questioning the moodiness of her tires. I decided to let it pass.
Bump bump bump... roooolllll. My stomach felt like a nuclear waste dump.
Bump bump bump... roooollll. Bump bump bump... rooolll. The irregularity
of the road was unusually regular. </B></P>

<P><B>The sun beat down against my forehead, which started to melt. I could
actually feel my skin softening, liquefying, and dripping off the tip of
my nose. Turning to Courtney, I waited to see the look of revulsion on
her face. She just smiled complacently. Apparently she hadn't noticed.
I smiled to myself.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Do you feel like you're melting or is it just me?&quot; I pondered
aloud.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;You're hot? I can put the air conditioning on if you want,&quot;
she replied, gently pressing the small button labeled &quot;AC&quot; next
to the cigarette lighter.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;That's nice, thanks.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Why didn't you say something before? I'm sorry,&quot; she apologized
for not sensing my disomfort. Courtney is like that. Courtney lives in
my ribcage sometimes.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;No, don't worry about it. I'm not actually hot.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;But you said--&quot; Courtney stopped short, knowing me well
enough to understand that even if I <I>tried</I> to explain it to her,
I would get nowhere.</B> </P>

<P><B>Liking the air conditioner, watching the vents rotate like eyeballs.
Cool air across my face, now my neck, now my collarbones, now my face...
All the places he had loved me. All the places he had inhabited and made
his. All the places he had discovered and charted.</B> </P>

<P><B>I said his name aloud, slowly, letting it <I>sliiiiide </I>off of
my tongue like diseased water. The kind that quenches your thirst right
before it kills you.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;What did you say?&quot; Courtney asked softly, with aged Merlot
in her voice.</B> </P>

<P><B>I repeated his name. I even said his middle name. The name felt like
an ice-pick, but sounded something like light rain against sand.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;What about him?&quot; she questioned, fearing any answer.</B>
</P>

<P><B>&quot;Oh nothing. I just felt like saying his name,&quot; I returned
cheerfully. She knew false cheeriness. She regarded me out of the corner
of her eye. Hell, it was true, mostly. I did feel like saying his name.
I also felt like maybe he'd appear in the backseat like a genie if I said
it nicely enough. I needed him to pop up out of nowhere, call me his Baby
and tell me things would be good. He'd take a detour to the local Super
Stop &amp; Shop. We would buy cereal (Frosted Flakes or Fruity Pebbles
maybe) and eat it with our fists. Sugar grinding against our teeth, we
would laugh at nothing. And everything. And nothing again.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Yeah? You sure?&quot; she vocalized her doubt.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Hell's yeah.&quot; I don't know where we had picked up that
phrase. Hell's yeah. It was similar to &quot;word.&quot; White girls in
the suburbs don't say Hell's yeah. We said Hell's yeah on a daily basis.
Hell's yeah.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Hey Phoenix, do you want to talk about things with... you know...?&quot;
Yes I knew. But it was more than I wanted to know. So I ignored her and
it was all calm in my heart again.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Feel like stopping?&quot; Courtney asked too loudly. What a
dumb question. Feel like stopping? I felt like starting. I felt like I
had never been. I felt like I had never even seen the kind of people who
had started in the past. Stopping was so out of the question. Sooooo out
of the question.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Put on your windshield wipers,&quot; I commanded.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;It's not raining,&quot; Courtney argued. It wasn't. &quot;It's
clear out.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;I know, I just--&quot; My thoughts interrupted my sentence.
I wanted the hypnotism of the windshield wipers. I wanted the constant
swish to comfort me. I wanted some constancy. I wanted something I could
predict. Life left me confused.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;How hard do you think it would be to become a hermit?&quot;
I asked loudly. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Professionally?&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>I giggled too quickly. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>Courtney thought for a moment. &quot;I dunno. Pretty easy I guess.
Whadya' really need to be a hermit? Cabin, woods, wild animals--&quot;</B>
</P>

<P><B>&quot;What are the animals for?&quot; I interrupted.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;They're, you know, hunt and kill?&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;I don't hunt.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;You could learn,&quot; she encouraged.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;I don't kill.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>That course of conversation sort of sank into the false wood paneling
enclosing the station wagon. I wondered silently how long it would take
to learn which berries were edible and which were poisonous. Nuts and berries;
isn't that what one survives on in the woods? I didn't remember ever having
seen wild nuts in my life. Seeds, maybe. Nuts, never.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;So he's really got you freaking out, huh?&quot; Courtney asked
quietly.</B> </P>

<P><B>I pulled a blueberry bagel out of the cooler and started chewing
on it carefully. The blueberries just tasted right. I thought about how
nice it would be to live on blueberries for a few years. But I'd miss the
bagel part.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;I mean,&quot; she continued, &quot;You're not doing too well
are you?&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>Apparently my attempt to silence her by eating a blueberry bagel
was fruitless. So I rolled down the window.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Pheen, the A/C is on,&quot; she told me.</B> </P>

<P><B>I opened the door.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Pheen!&quot; Courtney cried, slamming on the breaks. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;I dropped something,&quot; I told her. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;Jesus Christ! I hope it was pretty damn important to risk your
life over retrieving. What did you drop?&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>Hum. Rattle. Bump. Roll. Swish.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;My guard.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>by Ryan Miller</B> </P>

<P><B>Ryan is a senior here at HCRHS, exploring </B></P>

<P><B>his creativity by writing for young children.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Mom, I want to be a squirrel,&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>the boy said one bright sunny day,</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;And run around in the woods</B> </P>

<P><B>Eating nuts and berries and seeds and stuff.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;I don't think that's possible,&quot; his mother said,</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;for squirrels live in the woods and are small.</B> </P>

<P><B>You live in a house and are big.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>And with that she went back to her book.</B> </P>

<P><B>The boy stood puzzled for a moment</B> </P>

<P><B>But then got the most brilliant idea</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;How about I get your grey fur coat</B> </P>

<P><B>And put a dusting brush on my butt?&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;You'd still be a boy though,&quot; the mother said,</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Only you'd be running around in a big fur coat</B> </P>

<P><B>Eating nuts and berries and seeds and stuff in a tree.&quot;</B>
</P>

<P><B>And with that the mother proudly thought she had won.</B> </P>

<P><B>The boy was only temporarily discouraged by that,</B> </P>

<P><B>But then ran into the house and returned with a box on his back.</B>
</P>

<P><B>&quot;I'd settle to be a turtle down by the creek,&quot; the boy
said.</B> </P>

<P><B>And it went on and on and on like that all day.</B> </P>

<P><B>So the moral of this story is for the kids:</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;Never give up on becoming what you want</B> </P>

<P><B>And eventually your parents will break down</B> </P>

<P><B>And buy you the transmorgrifier you wanted for Christmas.&quot;</B>

<p><STRONG>Welcome to </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Electric Soup</STRONG></EM><STRONG>, Hunterdon Central's Online Literary Magazine. The name of the 
magazine comes from a student poem by Frederique de Lame: &quot;Quickly seeping into open 
minds/twisting neurons/electric soup blurring into a novel image.&quot;</STRONG></p>
<p><STRONG>Many of the pieces found within the magazine are written by Hunterdon Central Students, 
Staff, and Alumnae as well as pieces written by the &quot;Young&quot; Writers from the sending 
districts of Hunterdon Central. However, </STRONG><EM><STRONG>Electric Soup's</STRONG></EM><STRONG> goal is to be an inclusive, 
responsive literary magazine. We seek work from ALL writers, and contributors need not be 
associated with Hunterdon Central. We invite all submissions supportive of the inquisitive, 
imaginative writing process. But now, please come in!</STRONG></p>

As we look toward the inside of the bend in this stream, we notice the abundance
of rocks while on the outside bend, the stream is cutting away at the bank.  Gradually,
this stream (one of the many) is wearing away Hunterdon County - gradually wearing 
away the landscape, grinding it down to particle size and transporting those particles
off to the ocean.  (click on picture to continue)

<u><h3><u>State The Problem</u><h3></u>
<h4>The first step in solving a problem is to make sure you completely understand the problem.  After a careful analysis of the situation, you must limit it to a single, clearly defined issue before you can proceed.</h4>

<u><h3><u>Research</u></h3></u>
All scientific discoveries begin with a basic idea.  In order to determine whether or not the idea has merit, you must do research.  This research allows you to see what has been done in the past so that you won't repeat work already done and, it could possibly offer you some solutions.

<u><h3><u>Hypothesis</u></h3></u>
The third step in the Scientific Method is to make an educated guess at the solution.  This is called the hypothesis, since it is a reasonable solution based on knowledge and judgement rather than on ignorance and superstition.

<u><h2><u><center>Test (Experiment)</center></u></h2>

It is now time to test your hypothesis.  The experiment must be thought out ahead of time to obtain all the necessary materials.  The test must be done with accurate notes, so other people can reproduce the same experiment in the same conditions.  Each experiment must contain two procedures:  One procedure must contain  <a href="#control">CONTROL</a>and one must contain a <a href="#variable">VARIABLE</a>.  Furthermore, there must be a <a href="#Number">SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTAL ORGANISMS</a>, <a href="#repeat">REPETITION</a>, and Careful Observations.  

<a href="labs3.html"><h5>Go to 
Top of Menu</h5></a>
<a href="conclude.html"><h5>Go to 
Next Step</h5></a><hr>



<a name="control"></a>
<h3><b>CONTROL</b></h3>
This is something that every valid experiment must contain.  In two procedures, the procedures are identical, until, at one point, a <a href="#variable"> VARIABLE </a>
is introduced.  The procedure with the variable is the one involving the experiment.  The procedure without the variable is called control.

<a href="test.html"><h5>Continue Reading</h5></a><br>


<a name="variable"></a>
<h3><b>VARIABLE</b></h3>

A variable is anything that changes.In the two procedures, this is the procedure with the change.  However, there can only be <b>one</b> variable, otherwise, the test is invalid.  If this was not the case, you wouldn't know if the results were because of the variable or whether ir was altered by something else.  You must always be on the lookout for extraneous variable (i.e., the temperature, humidity, placement of your tools, and other things you would ordinarily not pay attention to)

<a href="test.html"><h5>Continue Reading</h5></a><br>



<a name="Number"></a> 
<h3><b>SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ORGANISMS</b></h3>
Large numbers of organisms should be used so that variables such as disease and individual differences may be ruled out.  Also, mathematically speaking, the more organisms, the better the accuracy.  Also, do not be quick to assume that works on some animals will work on humans.  The results may be completely different.

<a href="test.html"><h5>Continue Reading</h5></a><br>

<a name="repeat"></a>
<b><h3>REPETITION</h3></b>
An experiment must be repeated many times to assure its reliability.  If it is not repeated, you can not be sure if the experiment is valid or if it was just a fluke.

<u><h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3></u>
After careful evaluations of your results, you must answer one question:  Was my hypothesis correct?  Even if you have proved your hypothesis false, it does not necessarily mean it is wrong.  In your experiment, you may have uncovered a new hypothesis.  Remember though, a good conclusion often leads to another hypothesis.

<b><h1><center>Multiples of Ten</center></h1></b>
Since the Metric System is based on multiples of 10, it is easy to convert a unit to larger or smaller units just by moving the decimal point.  For instance, to convert 1 meter to centimeters, all you have to do is mulitply by 100 (since one centimeter is 1/100 of a meter) to find that 1 meter = 100 centimeters.  There is no difficult arithmetic involved.<br>

<h2 align=center><b>Weight</b></h2>

<p>This is the amount of force that gravity exerts on an object. This means
that, depending upon the <img src="gif/denver2.gif" height=200 width=200 align=right>amount
of gravity at a given location, the weight of an object varies. The larger
a heavenly body is, the more gravity it exerts, and, consequently, the
more something weights. For example, if you weight 100 pounds on Earth,
you would weight 20 pounds on the moon and 2800 pounds on the sun. Altitude
also plays an important role in weight. The greater the altitude, the less
something weighs. So, if you want to &quot;lose weight&quot;, go to Colorado!
You may ask how scientists (and people everywhere) avoid getting different
measurements depending upon their location. If one scientist weighed an
object in Colorado and one weighed the same object in the Sahara Desert,
their answers would be totally different. The solution to this problem
is <a href="mass.html">MASS</a>. </p>

<b><h2><center>Mass</center></h2></b><br>

The mass of something is a measurement of the amoun of matter it contains.  Thus, the amount of matter an object contains is the same despite the force gravity exerts upon iit.  Because of this, scientists always use mass to weigh an object; no matter where they are, the mass, the amount of matter, is the same.

<b><h2><center>Density</center></h2></b>

This measures how tightly packed the atoms are in an object.  We often compare the density of a liqued to that of water.  If you've ever looked at oil and vinegar in a jar, you've noticed that the oil floats on top.  Thus, oil is less dense than both vinegar and water.  Since the vinegar sinks, it is more dense than oil and of equal or more density than water.

<b><h2><center>Heat</center></h2></b>

This is defined as the vibration of molecules.  Heat passes from molecule to molecule through vibration (except in RADIATION).  An object feels hot or cold depending upon how rapidly its molecules are moving.  When the molecules of an object vibrate quickly, the temperature of an object rises.

<b><h2><center>Conduction</center></h2></b>

In conduction (conduct meaning "to lead"), the molecules must touch.  When molecules are "bumped", they begin to mave fater, thus "bumping" the molecules next to them.  The process is much like a chain reaction spreading the heat throughout the object.  This is much like when you put a <a href="#example">Nail in a Flame</a><br>

<a name="example"><u><b><h3>Example:  A Nail in a Flame</h3></b></a></u>

If you were to hold the end of a nail in a flame, the heat would move up to your hand by means of conduction.  The molecules in part of the nail in the flame begin the bounce around faster.  Soon, the molecules bump into one another, forming a chain reaction.  The molecules at the end of the nail (in the flame) conduct the heat upwards, towards your hand.

<a name="stove"><u><b><h3>Example:  The Stove</h3></b></a></u>

Suppose you had a stove in the middle of a large room.  Through <a href= "conduct.html"> conduction</a>, the heat passes through the walls of the stove and out into the air of the room.  This air expands.  The cold air near the windows weighs more than the hot air (remember; hot air rises and cool air sinks).  Consequently, this cooler, heavier air sinks to the floor, forcing the air aroundt he stove to move towards the ceiling.  As more hot air comes out of the stove, the cooler air continues to push it towards the ceiling, thus continuing the cycle.

<b><h2><center>Radiation</center></h2></b>

To get heat through radiation, a hot object must give out radiant heat.  As an object becomes hotter and hotter, it gives out more and more radiant energy.  It travels in a straight line through space.  However, this energy is not true heat.  Only when this radiant energy strikes certain materials that can absorb it does it turn into heat.  The radiant energy sets the molecules of that material into rapid motion, thus transfering heat.  In radiation, no molecules are need to transfer the heat.  It is a lot like our <a href="#sun">SUN</a><br>
<a href="transfer.html"><h5>Go to Top of
Heat Transfer</h5></a><hr>

<a name="sun"><u><b><h3>Example:  The Sun</h3></b></a></u>

If you recall, the sun is 93 million miles away.  In this empty space, there are no molecules.  However, we still receive heat from the sun; we would die without it.  The radiant energy (the sun) travels in a straight line through space and hits our Earth.  However, this radiant energy is not true heat.  For, if it were, the tops of the mountians would be hot as they're closer to the sun than the hot deserts.  In fact, the air isn't warmed much by the sun.  The sun can also travel through glass without affecting it (ever bask in the warmth of the sun spilling through the window; you're hot, yet the window pane is cold?).  This is because both air and glass do not absorb much radiant energy.  You can only feel the heat when the radiant energy is absorbed by a material, is changed into heat energy, then sets the molecules of the material moving faster and then, finally, the material gets warmer.  What a complicated sun we have!

<h2><b><center>Definitions and Conclusions</center></b></h2>
<center><u><IMG SRC="gif/smile.gif"><a href="bpoint.html"><h5>Go Back the Boiling Point</h5></a></u></center><hr>

<h4><center>What is the boiling point and how can it be altered?</center><br></h4>

According to Funk and Wagnall's Dictionary, the boiling point is "The temperature at which a liquid boils; at normal atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celcius".  However, because all thermometers are different, in the classroom, we said that, since water can't go higher than its boiling point, we would define it as the temperature at which the thermometer would go no higher in that solution.  

It is also important to know that boiling point of water does NOT change unless you alter the water in some way.  For instance, if you add salt, the boiling point will be affected, but, if you only deny it oxygen, it will not be affected.  You must physically change the water.

<h3 align=center><i>What is the effect of salt on the boiling point of
water?</i> 
<br></h3>

<p>Ever wonder why your grandmother would always put salt in the pot before
cooking spaghetti? 
<br>
<br>Well, after conducting an experiment, we found that salt actually raised
the boiling point of water. We mixed up two solutions; one had 150mL of
plain tap water, another had 150mL of plain tap water mixed with 25g of
salt. The solution with salt took 5 minutes and 8 seconds to boil. Its
boiling point was 109 degress Celcius. The beaker without the salt took
5 minutes to boil. Its boiling point was 106 degrees Celcius. Though with
salt it takes more time to reach a boil, the increased temperature allows
things (such as spaghetti) to cook faster.

<h4><center>What is the effect of oxygen have on the boiling point of water?</center><br></h4>

Without oxygen, it will take a beaker longer to boil.  However, both beakers (with and without oxygen) will boil at the same temperature.  Beaker A, the one without oxygen, took 14 minutes to reach its boiling point of 100 degrees Celcius.  Beaker B, the one with the oxygen, took just 8 minutes and 30 seconds to reach the same boiling point, 100 degrees Celcius.

<h2><b><center>Reduced Air Pressure</center></b></h2>

<h4><center>What effect does reducing the air pressure have on the boiling point of water?</center><br></h4>

Since water boils at approximentally 100 degrees Celcius, at "normal atmorspheric pressure", what would happen if you greatly reduced that pressure?<br><br>

Through an experiment which involoved monitoring the temperature of water in a beaker (all the while sucking air out of the bell jar it was contained it), we obtained our results:  When you reduce the air pressure, water can boil at a lowered temperature.  Though we had not altered or heated the water in any way, after we reduced the air pressure, it began to boil at its original temperature (25 degrees Celcius).  Thus, we concluded that, becuase the water was not at "normal atmospheric pressure", it would boil at a lower temperature.

<h1><u><center>Laccoliths</center></u></h1>

<center><u><IMG SRC="gif/smile.gif"><a href="intrude.html"><h5>Go Back to Intrusive Vulcanism</h5></a></u></center><hr>

These are mushroom-shaped intursions of magma between rock layers.  Since it is difficult for the magma to make its way between the laters, it pushes the overlying rock into domes.  <br>
As a result, dome-shaped mountains on the surface form.  The Henry Mountains of Utah and the Orange Mountains of New Jersey are two such examples.  <br>
Laccoliths, like batholiths, are made up of granite or diorite rock.  Both types produce large crystals because the magma takes so long to cool.<br>

<h1><u><center>Dikes</center></u></h1>

<center><u><IMG SRC="gif/smile.gif"><a href="intrude.html"><h5>Go Back to Intrusive Vulcanism</h5></a></u></center><hr>

These occur when the intrudeing magma dries vertically across layers of horizontal rock.  They range from a few inches thick to several hundred feet thick.  It also may extend many miles below the earth's surface.<br>
Sometimes, because the dikes are composed of igneous rock, they are able to withstand erosion, while the rock neighboring them (sedimetary rock) erodes.  There are some huge exposed dikes extending from the Spanish Peaks in Colorado. <br>

These occur when the intruding magma solidifies between horizontal layers of rock.  They form parallel to other layers and may be several hundred feet or several hundred miles long.<br>
These, too, may also erode to the surface after time (usually through a river washing over its surface).  The Palisades of the Hudson River in New York and New Jersey are part of a great sill.

<h3>Ever notice that, where there's an earthquake, there's usually a volcano?  For instance, Southern California has earthquakes, and nearby Northern California, Washington and Oregon have volcaoes.  Why is this?</h3>

This is because volcano and earthquake activity is related; both are formed because of plate activity and unrest.  Often times, plates near each other move different ways, and therefore have different types of boundaries.<br>

<center><u><IMG SRC="gif/smile.gif"><a href="earthgen.html"><h5>Go Back to General Information on Earthquakes</h5></a></u></center><hr>

Seismic waves, vibrations of an earthquake, help define layers of the earth.  You can tell what kind of material is down there by the time it takes a certain point.  It takes longer for the waves to go through a liquid than it does to go through a solid.  This was how we discovered that the mantle and outer core were liquid while the crust and inner core were solid.  Contrary to popular belief, nobody ever dug a hole deep enough to figure it out that way.  (No, you can't dig to China, either.)<br>

Remember; Seismic Waves are earthquake waves, seismologists measure them, and seismologists study them.<br>

<h2 align=center><b>The City that Waits to Die</b></h2>

<p>Why is San Francisco called this? It is for a variety of reasons. Once,
in 1906, the city experienced an earthquake measuring 8.3 on the <a href="richter.html">Richter
Scale</a> which left 3,000 people dead. It also caused a 270 mile-long
segment of the fault to jump 21 feet in just a few seconds. Since then,
the fault has been relatively inactive; indeed, it seems to be locked.
You see, San Francisco's real problem is not actual earthquakes; it's the
lack of small ones. If small ones occurred, then the tension would gradually
ease on the two plates and we wouldn't be waiting for the &quot;Big One&quot;.

<br>
<br>To add to the city's problem, a lot of the government-run facilities
are located directly on the fault line (see <a href="property.html">Property</a>).

Because no one else would buy property on faults (plus, it was a lot cheaper), the city of San Francisco did.  Consequently, fire stations, schools, and hospitals are all on the San Andreas Fault.  Other towns have done the same thing; our town of Flemington has.  On the Flemington Fault, there is the library, the park, the police/fire station, and some schools. <br><br>

Tsunamis are giant title waves caused by earthquakes.  Everyone always hears about destruction on land due to earthquakes, but what about the oceans?  Water also needs a place to vent its fury, so trunamis are the result.  Once, in Alaska in 1964, an 18 foot wall of water crashed to the shore.<br>

<h1><u><center>The Richter Scale</center></u></h1>

<center><u><IMG SRC="gif/smile.gif"><a href="earthgen.html"><h5>Go Back to General Information on Earthquakes</h5></a></u></center><hr>

The Richter Scale was invented by a man named Charles Richter in 1935.  He devised this system of measuring quakes because he was tired of journalists asking him to compare the earthquakes.  The Richter Scale uses a seismograph to measure <a href="seismic.html">seismic waves</a>.<br><br>

Now, scientists have abandoned the Richter Scale and have gone to using the Moment-Magnitude Scale.  Essentially, this is determined by multiplying the area of a fault's rupture surface by the distance the earth moves along the fault.<br>

<h2><b>Winter</b></h2>

<p>Called the Winter Solstice, December 21 is the first day of winter in
the Northern Hemisphere. Since the Southern Hemisphere is closer to the
sun, the <a href="rays.html">direct rays </a>are striking the Tropic of
Capricorn, and therefore, they experience warm weather. Consequently, since
the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, the direct rays are
not striking on the Tropic of Cancer and they experience cool weather.

<br>
<br></p>

<h3><img src="gif/snow296.gif" height=200 width=200 align=left>On the winter
solstice:</h3>

<ol>
<li>The direct rays are as far south as they go; the Tropic of Capricorn
</li>

<li>The North Pole is in the middle of a 6-month period of darkness </li>

<li>The South Pole is in the middle of a 6-month period of light </li>

<li>It is the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere </li>

<li>The sun rises south of east and sets south of west </li>

<li>Winter begins in the Northern Hemisphere </li>

<li>Summer begins in the Southern Hemisphere</li>
</ol>

<h5><a href="#spring">To Spring

<h2><a name="spring"></a><b>Spring</b><img src="gif/suny_cpl.gif" height=200 width=200 align=right></h2>

<p>As the revolution continues, the direct rays gradually shift upward,
resting on the equator on March 21. This marks the first day of spring,
or the vernal equinox. On this day, there are exactly twelve hours of daylight
and twelve hours of darkness. The earth and the sun are 93,000,000 million
miles apart. 
<br>
<br></p>

<h3><img src="gif/rain064.gif" height=200 width=200 align=left>On the vernal

<h2><a name="summer"></a><b>Summer</b><img src="gif/sun062.gif" height=200 width=200 align=right></h2>

<p>As the earth continues to revolve around the sun, the direct rays continue
to move upward. On June 21, on the summer solstice, the direct rays are
as north as they go; the Tropic of Cancer (the earth has reached the aphelion
and is coming back closer to the sun). 
<br>
<br></p>

<h3>On the summer solstice:</h3>

<ol>
<li>The direct rays are as far north as they go; the Tropic of Cancer </li>

<li>The North Pole is in the middle of a six-month period of light </li>

<li>The South Pole is in the middle of a six-month period of darkness </li>

<li>It is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere </li>

<li>The sun rises north of east and sets north of west </li>

<li>Summer begins in the Northern Hemisphere </li>

<h2><a name="fall"></a><img src="gif/wind_cpl.gif" height=200 width=200 align=right><b>Autumn</b></h2>

<p>The direct rays are now begining their descent downward. On September
22, they stop on the equator, the date of the autumnal equinox. Like spring,
there are exactly twelve hours of both daylight and darkness and the two
bodies are 93,000,000 miles apart.

<dd><h4>Bryozoas are similar to corals because they are marine animals that live only in colonies.
They resemble seaweed, or may form hard shelled, moss like mounds on rocks.  
Bryozoas have encrusting, branching, or fan-like growth.  The bryozoan skeleton 
consists of hundreds of small boxes arranged along branches or over the surface of structures.  Bryozoas have a cluster
of tentacles that trap small particles of food.  <br><br>

Each colony is made up of microscopic
beings called zooids.  The zooids have box like or tube shaped bodies.  
Some of the colonies consisted of simple chain-like series of tubes.
But they could also be leaf-like, fan-like, or ball-shaped.  Most Bryozoas are
found in limestone rocks from the Ordovician period.

<dt><u><h3><u>Appearance:</u></h3></u>
<dd><h4>Mollusks are soft bodied animals with no bones.  Most have a hard external shell to
protect their bodies.  Some have no shells and others have an internal shell.  The shell structure varies
from coiled to symmetrical bivalves.    
The mollusk phylum is the second largest in the animal kingdom.  This phylum includes snails, slugs, clams, oysters,
squids, and octopuses.  Mollusks are common as fossils.<br><br>



There are three main groups of mollusks (these are the groups the freshmen will study).  They are:

<UL>
<LI>Gastropods (snails)
<LI>Pelecypods (clams)
<LI>Cephalopods (nautillus, octopus, and squids)
</UL>

<h3><u>Gastropods</u></h3>

Gastropods first appeared in the early Cambrian.  They adapted themselved to life in 
the sea, fresh water, and on land.  Gastropods carries a shell on its back, when there is
danger they retreat into the safety of its shell.  They have a single,
coiled shell (but some are cone-shaped), and their body has a 
well defined head, eyes, and a large muscular foot.  They also have a mouth, and tentacles.  
Only the gastropods have adapted to a terrestrial mode of life.  

<h3><u>Pelecypods</u></h3>

Pelecypods are bivalved mollusks.  Bivalves first appeared in the early 
Ordovician and although their two-valved shell has restricted their evolution they were successful since 
the beginning of the Triassic.  Most are marine animals but some live in fresh water, they may be
attached, burrow into the bottom, or creep about by their hatchet-shaped foot.  Scallops are free-swimming.
Oysters, mussels, and clams are living types.  Pelecypods valves are equal in size and mirror images of each
other.  These mollusks have no head or teeth and they get food and oxygen through a siphon.  
Many fossils are found as casts and molds.  Pelecypods first appeared in the Ordovician Period,
they are common in rocks of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic.

<h3><u>Cephalopods</u></h3>

Cephalopods are the most advanced class of mollusks.
Cephalopods have their shells external, internal, or none at all.  They are living forms and
 have well-developed head with large eyes, a well-formed brain, and tentacles.
They first appeared in the Ordovician.  The early nautiloids had a variety of shell shapes.  Another 
group of cephalopods, the ammonoids, came in the early Devonian.  They had a rather simple structure.
Fossils forms have well-developed shells.  Most common fossils forms are from the Mesozoic Period.  Cephalopods
are also useful in helpong to date rocks.<br><br>

Modern representatives of mollusks are octopus, squid, and cuttlefish.  Modern cephalopods 
have internal shells completely covered by soft parts.

<dd><h4>Coelenterates are simple aquatic animals including corals, sea anemones, sea pens and fans, the tiny 
hydra, and the extinct stromatoporoids.  They are usually soft bodied marine animals.  
The body of coelenterates has a radical symmetry.  Their bodies are sac-like and have at least two layers of cells 
which form the body wall.  The outer layer is the body covering and the inner layer lines the digestive cavity.  Some
have more layers of a stiff, jellylike substance to support the animal.  The body is shaped like a cylinder, bell, or
umbrella and has a single opening surrounded by tentacles.<br><br>

They lack hard parts, so they rarely form fossils.  One group, the Anthozoa, grow external stony skeletons that is
fossilized.

<dd><h4>Coelenterates usually live in the sea, most living in colonies.  The coelenterates can swim about
freely or be attached to the sea bottom.<br><br>

The corals, the most prominent of the coelenterates, grow together in colonies 
that are made up of individual corals whose skeletons 
are attached to each other.  Corals are important rock builders, since tropical islands are partly coral limestone. 
Reef-building corals live in an equatorial belt of warm, shallow water.  
They don't grow on muddy bottoms.  Coelenterates were found in the Arctic and Antarctic, 
which indicates that climatic conditions were different from the present.     <br><br>

Coelenterates indicate climatic conditions which were very different from the present.  They are found from 
the Pre-Cambrian Era to the Present.</h4>

<dd><h4>Arthropods have segmented bodies, paired, jointed limbs, and a hard external 
covering, with flexible joints.  The legs are used as sucking organs or sense organs, jaws, or weapons of
defense.  The outside shell of the arthropods is made of a stiff material named chitin. 
There are seven groups of arthropods.  They are:
<UL>
Spiders<br>
Ticks<br>
Millipedes and Centipedes<br>
Lobsters<br>
Crabs<br>
Barnacles<br>
Insects<br>

<dd><h4>Arthropods are a sucessful phylum of invertebrates and one of the most
abundant animals on earth.  Arthropods can exist on land, in fresh and salt water, and in the air.
You can probably find arthropods anywhere that life exists.  However only a few groups of arthropods
are commonly found as fossils.<br><br>

Arthropods first appeared in the Cambrian Period.  The trilobites, a group of arthropods, were abundant during this
time.  The only group of arthropods that is now extinct is the trilobites.<br><br>

<dd><h4>Echinoderms or "spiny-skins" are a phylum of marine animals.  These are complex animals, 
that are coverd with plates or spines.  Many fossil echinoderms had a long, flexible jointed
stem.  This stem hooked them to the sea floor to to another object.  But most forms are
unattached and move freely over the sea floor. <br><br>

As adults, echinoderms have bodies that have radial symmetry (body parts are arranged around a center
like spokes on a wheel).  Their bodies are divided into five sections with the mouth at the center.  Many tiny tube like
structures, called tube feet, project from the body.  The tube feet allow the echinoderms to move, breathe, feed, and
sense.  As larva, the echinoderms have bilateral symmetry.<br><br>

This phylum has eight common classes.
<UL>
Crinoid<br>
Asteroid<br>
Ophiuroid<br>
Holothurioid<br>
Echinoid<br>
Edrioasteroid<br>
Cystoid<br>
Blastoid
</UL>

Some examples of echinoderms are:
<OL>
<LI>Sea Urchins
<LI>Starfish
<LI>Sea Cucumbers
<LI>Brittlestars
<LI>Sea Lilies
</OL>

One of the more popular echinoderms is the criniod.  Freshmen will go into more detail with the
crinoind than any of the other classes.<br><br>

<h3><u>Criniod</u></h3>

Crinoids are called sea-lilies but are animals not plants. 
Criniods are from the Ordovician to the Recent.  Found in Paleozoic rocks, a complete crinoid is very rare.
Today crinoids are rare and are confined to the deeper parts of the ocean.  
They are flower-like echinoderms, which are also often beautiful colors
that grow in colonies on the sea floor.  Some forms were free-swimming but most were fixed by a stem.

<dd>Echinoderms lived in deeper parts of the ocean during the Paleozoic Era.  They reproduce by laying eggs that
develop into larva.  The larva swims freely during its early stages.  The larva then sinks and attaches to the ocean bottom
as it changes into an adult.</h4>

<h5><OL>
A.  There are all different kinds of rocks.<br>
B.  All the rocks are rounded off.<br>
C.  The rocks are all different sizes (Since they are all sizes this shows that a river didn't flow through this area.  A
river would sort the rocks into equal sizes, but a glacier wouldn't sort the rocks.  This leads us to believe that 
a glacier once passed through here.).

Students have to define what a <u>moraine</u> and a <u>terminal moraine</u> are.<br>
<h5>Moraine-a boundary line of a glacier.<br>
Terminal Moraine-last boundary line of a glacier.</h5>

Some of the question asked in the booklet are:
<OL>
<LI>How many years ago was there a glacier at Buttsville?
<h5>Answer:  10,000 years ago</h5>
<LI>How many ice sheets have covered parts of North America?

<center><h3><u><b>Trilobites "three lobes"</b></u></h3></center>
<hr>


<h4>Trilobites are one of the earliest marine arthropods,  found in the Cambrian 
to the Permian Period.  They lived in the sea, but they are now extinct.<br><br>

Trilobites were common three-lobed marine arthropods, most being less than four inches long.  The body of the
trilobite had three main parts:  the head, thorax (body), and tail.  
They had a soft shell that covered most of their body.   Two groves extending down the back of the
body divided it into three lobes.  Each lobe was divided into many segments, each having its own pair
of legs.  From front to back, the body has a number of arranged segments.  A pair of jointed legs grew from each side
of these segments.  They have a head, body, and a tail.<br><br>

When they grew larger, trilobites molted their armor (like a snake sheds its skin). 
Trilobites could also roll up into a ball.  This was done to protect the animal's soft underside.
Trilobites were probably bottom-feeding scavengers and predators.<br><br>
 


When you find a trilobite as a fossil they are usually found in parts rather than as a
whole.  However, during the Fossil Field Trip, if a student finds a whole trilobite fossil, 
the teacher will reward them somehow.  
They are one of the most popular and priced fossil.  Some are used as jewlery.<br><br>

At this site, we find small round marks in reddish sandstone/shale material.  Research 
indicates that they are the remains of a 200 million year old alge-like life form.

The rock, when broken, shows small black and white crystals.  Since it is so difficult
to break it is often used for rail road beds within the county.  It is the igneous rocks
known locally as Byram Diabase.  (click on picture to continue)

To the left of the outcrop, there is a path up to the top of the outcrop and a view of the Delaware River and the banks of Bucks 
County, PA.  In the middle of the river, near the mouth of a small stream one can see a collection of rocks, 
(called an 'alluvial fan') very similar to those in the stream bed at the first stop.  These rocks 
have been deposited by the stream which drains a portion of Bucks County.  They await the next heavy 
rain which would allow the Delaware to aid them on their journey to the Atlantic.  (click on picture to continue)

Continuing the trip along Route29, about 2 miles north - we notice another large rock outcrop.  Clearly
this area has been layered and tilted.  The rock is dark gray to black, quite dense and upon cracking,
produces samples with very sharp edges, locally called Lockatong Argillite.   (click on picture to continue)

The argillite is composed of fine particles, packed together quite closely.  This dense rock
is difficult to break but when you do, you notice very sharp edges.  Local
farmers still occasionally find arrowheads made from this local rock.   (click on picture to continue)

About 3-4 miles north, we arrive at another series of outcrops.  Although they are tilted at 
almost the same angle as the argillite, the rock type is much different.  It is more reddish in 
color and seems to crumble much more easily.   (click on picture to continue)

as Warford Creek.  Here, one can easily observe the erosional effects of water in a tilted streambed.

Continuing our northward journey, the road widens considerably and passes the
small village church at Holland Township.  This marks the site of a large fault, known 
as the Triassiac Border Fault.  It is considered the boundary between the newer Triassic sediments 
and the much older Precambrian basement rock known as Losee Gneiss.  (click on picture to continue)

Cancom Network Operations manages the television signals for its
cable and Direct-To-Home satellite services, plus a number of
radio signals, from a Master Control Centre (MCC) in Mississauga,
Ontario. The centre is located in a building with an excellent
line of sight to satellites and freedom from microwave interferences.
<BR>
In May 1994, both WIC and Cancom joined in the formation of an
industry-wide consortium to establish a Direct-To-Home marketing
company. More than 100 digital channels of satellite programming
services will be offered to subscribers across Canada who will
receive the signals via a two-foot-wide satellite receiving dish.
The service is expected to be operational by the fall of 1995.

<P> On March 30, 1953, a licence application was approved for a
local consortium consisting of Maple Leaf Broadcasting, controlled by
Kenneth Soble, Wentworth Broadcasting, and Southam Press (owners of The
Hamilton Spectator).  Shortly thereafter, Theatre Properties Hamilton
joined the consortium.

<P>On June 7, 1954, at 8:00 p.m., "Lucky Channel 11" began transmitting to
the public as a privately owned affiliate of the CBC network.  The opening
show was a two-hour production telling the story of the city of Hamilton. 
One of the many "new" attractions about CHCH was the tower, a single pipe rising 540
feet from the top of Hamilton mountain, eight miles from the station. 
Invented by G. Bruce MacKimmie, the tower was called a "wavestack
antenna".  Another big attraction for viewers on June 7, 1954, was the
"weather window".  Toronto viewers were accustomed to watching the
weather mapped out on a blackboard.  Now viewers could watch weatherman
John Dickins stand behind a glass window, and with a crayon, mark in the
various systems and weather information on the back of the glass --
writing backwards all the time.

<P>CHCH also had a television
camera apparatus which was the first of its kind in Canada.  It was an
"electro-zoom" gadget .  The station boasted a special effects
generator, which allowed the viewer to look at the screen and see the
announcer in one part of it and, for example, a news film in the rest.  
As well, CHCH had the biggest studio in Canada -- the Hamilton Forum, a
200 foot x 95 foot arena owned by Ken Soble.

<H1>&quot;Sunset Beach&quot;</H1>
<H2>a sizzling new daytime drama from Aaron Spelling,</H2>
<H2>premieres January 6, 1997 on CHCH-TV.</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>
<I><B>Sunset Beach</B></I> is a place where everyone knows everybody
else's business.  It's home to the rich and poor, young and old,
warm beaches, casual charm and a legend that pervades the entire
character of the community.  <I><B>Sunset Beach,</B></I> the first
daytime serial to debut on television in eight years and Aaron
Spelling's first entry into the daytime arena, premieres <U>Monday,
January 6, 1997 (3:00 - 4:00 p.m.)</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
The 21 member cast includes such names as veteran actress <B>Lesley-Anne
Down, Sam Behrens, Susan Ward, Clive Robertson, Leigh Taylor Young,
Kathleen Noone</B> and <B>Ashley Hamilton</B>.  <BR>

<P>
Set in a small Southern California coastal community, <I><B>Sunset
Beach </B></I>is comprised of a diverse mix of people: police
officers, lifeguards, newspaper reporters, doctors, waiters and
restaurant owners.  It has its share of interesting personalities
like the &quot;trophy&quot; wife of a high-powered, unscrupulous
attorney, who lusts after power and social status; a mysterious,
wealthy entrepreneur; an eccentric, personable socialite; a career-driven
physician; a good cop gone bad; an all-American hero with a tormented
past; a troubled young runaway; a conniving half-sister; and a
young man who holds a secret that could destroy his entire family.
 <BR>

<P>
To keep up with the latest goings-on, most residents can be found
at the Java Web cyber coffeehouse, the blues/rock club called
The Deep, or Elaine's Waffle House.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Sunset Beach</B></I>, the hottest spot to be come January,
premieres <U>Monday, January 6, 1997, at 3:00 p.m.</U> on <B>CHCH-TV</B>.

<hr>
<b>Economy Lookahead</b><p>
We all hope for the best at the start of a new year ... but this year it appears, there may actually be some sound economic evidence on which Canadians can pin their hopes. For the first time in nearly a decade, economic forecasters are almost unanimously upbeat; saying the conditions are ripe for a return to prosperity, and lower unemployment, across Canada. 
<hr>
<b>PEI Bridge</b><p>
The maritime region of Canada has often seen some of the toughest economic conditions in Canada. But this year may be different. Aggressive policies by provincial governments, combined with generally better economic conditions, are spurring new development, and optimism. But one of the biggest spurs to economic growth on the east coast, is a concrete serpent more than 20 kilometers long. 
<hr>
<b>Ferries Resume</b><p>
Travellers in the maritimes will still be forced to rely on the ferries to trips to Newfoundland however. That service resumed this morning, after hurricane force winds over the Northumberland Straight, forced the ferries to shut down over New Years. Travellers trapped on one ferry were treated to a free meal, and party favours by a sympathetic crew.
<hr>
<b>BC Weather</b><p>
The bill for some of the worst weather in the history of British Columbia ... could top more than 200-million dollars. Heavy snow collapsed many buildings, including scores of commercial greenhouses, used by the province's multi-million dollar flower industry. And following the snow, came warm temperatures and heavy rain bringing floodwaters ... which will make the holiday season of 1996, one to remember in B.C.
<hr>
<b>West Coast Wrap</b><p>
And the same weather system that has battered B.C. has wreacked havoc up and down the west coast of North America; from Washington state, to California.
<hr>
<b>Weird Weather</b><p>
Meanwhile in Europe ... record breaking cold from Moscow to Madrid ... has claimed 140 lives in the last week. One of the latest victims; a French resident of Normandy, who tried to walk home in minus 15 degree temperatures; when his car wouldn't start.
<hr>
<b>Polar Bears 97</b><p>
It probably began as a hardy Canadian cure for the inevitable New Year's Day hangover. But whatever sparked the tradition of diving into the frigid waters of the great lakes on New Years Day; has now spawned a host of frosty frolicking, not only designed for fun, but for charity as well. Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>Spectators huddled for warmth in their cars, parked along Hamilton's beachfront.  Even the dogs were bundled against the cold.  But the arctic air, and frigid waters of Lake Ontario still enticed dozens of hardy dippers.  <br>Just enough time for a few Kodak moments, and one last warm embrace. Then, into the swim of things.  <br>Of course proper attire is mandatory.  Also mandatory... post-swim analysis .  <br>Eleven years ago, just five people took the plunge from this side of the lake.  This year, more than three-hundred rushed in, to raise money for a good cause.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Sydney Polar Death</b><p>
Many say the human body was not built for such abuse ... and unfortunately; almost every year there is at least one case to prove them right. This year, in Sydney Nova Scotia; a 65 year old member of the local polar bear club, suffered a heart attack and died, after a plunge in minus seven degree temperatures. Authorities say, Bill Jamieson was one of 29 people who braved the waters of Sydney Harbour. After the event, Jamieson dressed in his truck, and began to drive to a local fire hall, but the collapsed behind the wheel and died, a short time later.
<hr>
<b>Puppy Rescued</b><p>
Rescue workers in Thorold report a happy conclusion in their efforts to rescue a dalmation puppy ... that fell some thirty metres down the ventilation pipe; from an old septic system... on the property of Tony and Kathy Bowman. The puppy was a Christmas gift to the couple's young children; and had gone astray from the family home.<br>  A quick search drew the family to the sound of the yelping puppy at the bottom of the pipe.<br>  It took firefighters and Humane Society officials five hours to rescue "Duke" from his subterranean prison.<br>  Although frightened, "Duke" is fine; and dog-gone lucky, to be alive.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Babies</b><p>
They were not the first Canadians born in the New Year ... <br>  But two babies born in separate hospitals arrived at virtually the same moment ... to make them the first new residents of Hamilton, for 1997.<br>  At St. Josephs Hospital, Dominic Scibetta .... the son of Josee and Joseph Scibetta, weighed in at seven pounds, eight ounces ... arriving five minutes after midnight.<br>   At the same moment, on Hamilton mountain ... Nolan Robert Charles Thomas; made his way into the world ... almost 36 hours after mother Dawn Berry, had been induced to labour. Doctors had been concerned about the baby's health, and Nolan was born almost three weeks ahead of schedule... weighing five pounds, eight ounces. Happily, both mom and baby, are doing just fine.
<hr>
<b>Hardy Dead</b><p>
Funeral services will be held saturday morning, in toronto, for internationally known Canadian composer, Hagood Hardy. Hardy succumbed to cancer in a Hamilton hospital yesterday. He was 59.<br>  The three time Juno Award winner was best known for his melodic instrumental "The Homecoming,".... originally written for a tea commercial. <br>  He also composed film and TV scores, including "Anne of Green Gables."<br> Hardy started in Toronto's jazz clubs in the 1950's, and also performed for a time with jazz great George Shearing.
<hr>
<b>Kiddie Porn</b><p>
A former defence department scientist facing child pornography charges appeared briefly in an Ottawa court today.<br> His case was set over until January 30th at the request of the defence.<br> 46 year old Blair Evans of Gloucester, Ontario was arrested last month, after the OPP seized more than 20-thousand computer files containing child pornography, from a defence department office. Evans is charged with making, possessing and distributing child pornography, via the Internet.
<hr>
<b>Dubai Documents</b><p>
New evidence in the "Maersk Dubai" case indicates that Canadian authorities had to make it up as they went along.<br>  Briefing notes to Canada's justice minister from the mounted police show that Ottawa ... at first ... said it had no jurisdiction in the case.<br>  Six Taiwanese container ship officers are facing an extradition hearing, after charges that they threw three Romanian stowaways overboard, to their deaths, on the high seas.<br>  Because the incident took place in international waters, federal ports police at first said, there was nothing they could do.<br>  The mounties then stepped in, re-interviewed the witnesses, and laid charges ... while Canada hastily wrote an administrative agreement with Romania ... that would allow the RCMP to board the ship, and search for evidence in the case.
<hr>
<b>Toronto Murder</b><p>
A York University student has been charged with second degree murder, after the stabbing death of a German man; in Canada for only a few hours. Metro homicide detectives were called to a rooming house in North York where they found the body of 55-year-old Helmuth Volkmann of Germany. Police say he had been stabbed to death. The suspect is Volkmann's son, 25-year-old Krister Volkmann, who came to Canada last fall to attend university. A German newspaper reports that the senior Volkmann had come to Canada to rescue his son from what he believed to be a cult.<br>  His son was arraigned on the murder charge and remanded in custody in a Toronto court, this morning.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Fatal</b><p>
A British tourist died in this accident; in Niagara on the Lake. 33 year old Anne Denise Coventry of London England, was a passenger in a mini-van which collided with a car, and then struck a utility pole.<br>  She was thrown from the vehicle ...which then rolled over, and landed on top of her.<br>  Her husband, 34 year-old Edward Coventry and their two young children suffered minor injuries.
<hr>
<b>Body Inn</b><p>
Fire claimed the life of a 72 year old woman, in a New Year's day fire at a St. Catharine's hotel. Foul play is not suspected in the death of Cecile Dumais, whose body was pulled from the flames and smoke that engulfed room 6 of the Crossroads Motor Inn. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze. Careless smoking is the suspected cause.

<b>Crumbling Sewers</b><p>
Hamilton- Wentworth residents may be flushed with pride, having just concluded a year that featured Hamilton's Sesquicentennial, the privatization of Hamilton airport, and the Grey Cup bash.<br>  But unless the region gets its financial house in order, taxpayers may not be able to flush much else.<br> In a bluntly-worded report, regional staff warn politicians that they have been penny-wise and pound-foolish.<br> As a result, Hamilton- Wentworth's roads, sewers and waterworks are crumbling.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br> Caught between a provincial government bent on slashing subsidies, and taxpayers who demand no increases, Hamilton- Wentworth politicians have responded by cutting capital spending by 70-million dollars during the 1990's.  More and more of what's left is spent on special projects, and less and less on what the region's already got... things like roads, sewers and water mains. Councillors now have a choice. They can raise taxes to improve maintenance of essential services, or cancel special projects.  <br>To contain the overflow, Hamilton- Wentworth has built a series of giant CSO tanks, that temporarily store sewage overflows until the treatment plant is able to to handle the excess. Councillor Wilson fears future tanks could wind up on the special project hit list. If something has to go, he'd rather see cancellation of the Red Hill Creek Expressway.  <br>Either way politicians can pay now, or pay much more later. Staff point out it costs at least five times more to replace services, than to maintain and repair what you've already got.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Teacher Charged</b><p>
A Hamilton teacher faces charges after a former student claims he was molested for a two year period, starting in 1972. At the time, police say the male complainant was a 10 year old student at Earl Kitchener School in Hamilton.<br>  He claims the incidents occured while he helped out after school.<br>  48 year old Edward Ward is charged with buggery, gross indecency and indecent assault.<br>  The case is now being handled by Hamilton Wentworth's major crimes unit.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Bomb</b><p>
Police used a water cannon to disable an apparent pipe-bomb in Niagara Falls.<br> The device, with a timer attached, was found outside a home on Armoury St., New Year's Eve.  About 20 neighboring homes were evacuated.<br> Officers used a water cannon to blow apart the package holding the device, then detonated it safely.<br> They're still trying to figure out who planted the bomb, and why.
<hr>
<b>Niagara fatal</b><p>
A British tourist died in this accident; in Niagara on the Lake. 33 year old Anne Denise Coventry of London England, was a passenger in a mini-van which collided with a car, and then struck a utility pole.<br> She was thrown from the vehicle ...which then rolled over, and landed on top of her.<br>  Her husband, 34 year-old Edward Coventry and their two young children suffered minor injuries.
<hr>
<b>Body Inn</b><p>
Foul play is not suspected in the death of a woman in a St. Catharines hotel yesterday. This after the body of 72-year-old Cecile Dumais was pulled from flames and smoke that engulfed room 6 of the Crossroads Motor Inn. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze. Careless smoking is the suspected cause.
<hr>
<b>Flu Bug</b><p>
Much of Ontario is in the grip of the grippe.<br> Thousands of people suffering from the influenza-a virus have swamped hospitals and clinics.<br> Hamilton doctor Kathleen Walker says the epidemic is turning doctors' offices into "viral pits."<br> Symptoms -- which last about a week -- include fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue and aches and pains.<br> Children sometimes develop vomiting.<br> Walker says there's not much physicians can do but let the bug run its course.<br> The elderly and very young particularly those who have had respiratory infections  are particularly vulnerable.
<hr>
<b>Dalmation Rescue</b><p>
Cruella De Vil wasn't involved but a dalmation puppy in Tholold got the scare of his life last night.<br>  Duke, a seven week old, deaf dalmation pup fell head first into a narrow ventilation pipe.<br>  As Lauran Sabourin reports, Duke was trapped inside the pipe for five hours before firefighters were able to pull him out..
<i><br>  For five hours firefighters frantically made one attempt after another to dislodge tiny Duke the dalmation from a backyard septic tank ventilation pipe. <br>  Bathy Bowman had let Duke outside around six o'clock just for a minute. When she says the ground just sucked him up..<br>  She didn't even realize the hole was there.. <br>  Oxygen was pumped into the hole in an attempt to keep the pup alive. <br>  Three times the pup was snared ..three times he fell back down the 30 foot pipe. <br>  Finally firefigters got a 30 foot rod. attached a noose to it. and was able to lasoo the dog's tail. <br>  Shivering..coated with mud, Duke was wrapped up in blankets and rushed to an animal hospital.<br>  He went into shock at the hospital and nearly died.  <br>  This morning Duke was still worn out.  He was curled up at home with his sister Peanut.<br>  Today his owners seem to be more shaken up by Duke's ordeal than he is.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>JAG</b><p>
The military drama "JAG" comes to the CHCH program lineup beginning Friday night.<br> The show, which drew roller coaster ratings after being shuffled around various nights last season, has taken on new life following a U.S. network switch.<br> Alex Reynolds reports that Canadian actor David James Elliott plays the lead.
<i> <br>  "JAG" is military-speak for Judge Advocate General's Corps, the elite cadre of naval officers trained as investigators and lawyers.<br>  After some tinkering by the producers, the show has a new look. <br>  <br>  Timely plots infuse the show with energy and realism....sexual harassment, AIDS and gays in the military.... there's also focus on the personal interplay between the two characters, who work side by side, and not one in front of the other. <br>  "JAG" officers investigate... prosecute.... defend.<br>  The elements are in place for gripping tales.<br>  "JAG" has found a home Friday nights on CHCH-TV.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Polar Bear Swim</b><p>
Oakville's Burloak Bears Polar Bear Club has raised five thousand dollars for World Vision Canada to help Rwandan orphans.<br> This at yesterday's traditional New Year's Polar Bear Dip... at which more than 200 braved the icy waters of Lake Ontario. There was a minimum donation of fifteen dollars for each of the dippers... and a loonie apiece from the more than 2500 spectators who showed up.

<b>Cult Murder </b><p>
A York University graduate student appeared in court in Toronto today, charged in the stabbing death of his father.<br> 25-year-old Krister Volkmann was remanded in custody until a January 9th court appearance.<br>   He was charged with second-degree murder after his 55-year-old father, Helmuth Volkmann, was found slain in his apartment early yesterday.<br>   Toronto police say the professor had flown in from Germany on New Year's Eve.<br>   Police also say there is no evidence to prove the suspect was involved in a cult.
<hr>
<b>Police Shooting</b><p>
Friends of an Ottawa man shot four times by police believe racism was involved.<br>   They say Francis Nicholls would not have been shot and wounded yesterday afternoon if he weren't black.<br>   Nicholls was shot after officers and an ambulance crew went to his apartment because relatives couldn't reach him.<br>   Police say he had a knife but his girlfriend, who was on the phone with him at the time, is questioning the officers' behavior.
<hr>
<b>Evans - Court</b><p>
A former defence department scientist appeared briefly in court in Ottawa today on child pornography charges.<br>  46 year-old Blair Evans will reappear January 30th.<br>   He was charged last month after OPP seized more than 20-thousand computer files containing child porn at a defence department office.<br>   Evans is accused of downloading the files from the Internet.<br>   Police say they are widening their probe into the U.S. to try to determine the source of the material.
<hr>
<b>Flu Epidemic</b><p>
Much of Ontario is in the grip of the grippe.<br>   Thousands of people suffering from the influenza-a virus have swamped hospitals and clinics.<br>   Hamilton doctor Kathleen Walker says the epidemic is turning doctors' offices into "viral pits."<br>   Symptoms -- which last about a week -- include fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue and aches and pains.<br>   Children sometimes develop vomiting.<br>   Walker says there's not much physicians can do but let the bug run its course.
<hr>
<b>Peru - Ambassador</b><p>
The actions of a Canadian hero were praised in Ottawa today.<br>  Anthony Vincent is Canada's amabassador to Peru.<br>  He was in Ottawa briefing foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy on the current hostage crisis.<br>  Axworthy praised Cincent for acting as a facilitator in the current hostage crisis.
<hr>
<b>Mideast Hebron</b><p>
Foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy warns that the mideast peace process could fail if there is no agreement on Hebron.<br>   Israelis and Palestinians are still trying to negotiate a pullout of most Israeli troops from the west bank town.<br>   Axworthy says hebron is just one step of many that are required for peace -- but he says, it's the key step right now.
<hr>
<b>Cowboys</b><p>
Some questions are being raised about the woman who is accusing Dallas Cowboys players Erik Williams and Michael Irvin of rape.<br>  The woman's estranged husband says he doubts her story.<br>  Irvin and Williams have not been charged.<br>  And they continue to practice for Sunday's NFL playoff game versus Carolina.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Spain Four</b><p>
They were shunned in Canada, loved by the people of Spain.<br>  The Canadian veterans of the Spanish Civil War have a special place in the hearts of the people they once defended.<br>  Tonight, in our continuing series on the Spanish Civil War, veterans meet the people and discover a 60 year old debt has not been forgotten.

<hr>
<b>Economy</b><p>
This recent sign of strength in the American economy was measured by the purchasing managers index which did not drop as expected.<br>  The news trigger a selloff of Canadian and U.S. bonds and contributed to a heavy selloff of U.S. and Canaian stocks early in the day.
<hr>
<b>Winners and Losers</b><p>
Just as Canadian big blue chip stocks like Bell Canada Enterprises and the major banks led Canadian stock markets to new record highs in 1996, it was also big name companies that propelled U.S. stock markets higher. Many of them were technology companies.

<HR>

The Festival of Lights is almost over at Burlington's Spencer Smith Park.....so, if you haven't seen the spectacular display yet ...bundle up and stroll among the lights any night from 5pm - midnight.  Over 4000 lights...10 gallons of paint ...and 1000 feet of electrical cord were used to create the breathtaking exhibit.  
<P>
It's time to start gathering team members for the Big Brother's Bowl for Kids Sake Bowlathon.  Every team equals a new match for a child on the waiting list.  The bowlathon will take place February 15 from 1pm-4pm.  Our very own Ken Welch is chairman of this worth while event.   
<P>
Towards the Millennium is a four year partnership in the arts.  It will produce a series of musicals ...kicking off with Godspell.  It will take to the stage February 7 & 8 at Hamilton Place. 
<P>
Some other up coming performances not to miss.... enjoy an evening at the opera... Opera Hamilton will perform "Popera" January 30 and February 1.  or .... become part of ancient mythology... and attend the Canadian Stage Company's production of "Atlantis".   Its an intense ...endlessly moving.. story about a tragic love affair.   
<P>
Happy New Year.  1997 could be your lucky year ...if you bought a CNIB Lottery Calendar.  You could win any day of the year.     Calendars are still available by calling the institute.  
<P>
If you're heading out with family or meeting friends this New Year's Eve...make sure you arrive alive.  Gallop and Gallop Advertising, Sign Depot Express, Al Cosentino Remax Real Estate, CAA South Central, The Spectator, Y95 and CHCH-TV are promoting this message: don't drink and drive... decide to use or be a designated driver.  
<P>
Come join Sunni Genessco and our very own  Donna Skelly New Years Eve, as they host the 2nd Annual First Night Hamilton.  There will be an afternoon of fun for the kids and a brilliant fireworks display to bring in the new year.   First Night buttons are available at any Hamilton branch of Canada Trust, Fortino's on Dundurn, or the Sesqui Office.   Whatever your plans New Year's Eve...make sure you arrive alive ...  Don't drink and drive. Decide to use or be a designated driver.

<HR>
<P>
Discovery is the latest addition to CHCH TVs mobile fleet. This
audio mobile employs state-of-the-art technology which includes,
two 24-track digital multitracks, a sophisticated computer-automated
console, flexible powering and communications in a spacious, yet
efficient, environment.
<P>
With elegant interfacing to various venues a main design criteria,
the mobile is equally at home when connected to a television studio,
an outdoor sporting event, or a concert hall. Discovery's large
inventory of equipment combined with CHCH-TVs immense supply of
facilities and world-class audio engineers - translates into a
service that can provide maximum versatility and an excellent
final product. 
<P>
The unique live broadcast suite, located at the rear of the truck,
allows for separate control over a stereo program feed while allowing
the main control room to concentrate on multitrack recording and
mix down. The truck interior may also be utilized as production
space for editing, voice-overs, graphics, etc., and could be integrated
with a television mobile facility, or function independently.
Discovery Mobile is one of the premier mobile sound facilities
in North America, but is capable of working in other applications
such as film and television production as well.

<H2>CORPORATE VIDEO PRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
Corporate Video Production utilizes all of the facilities and
personnel available at CHCH-TV. While most productions are single
camera shoots, we have the capability of multi-camera studio productions
or remotes, as well as teleconferencing.
<P>
Staff writer/producer/directors as well as free-lance personnel
are available to work with clients throughout the video production,
taking charge of the project from conception to completion.
<P>
We will work with clients to establish the objectives of the video,
the information to be transmitted, and the creative approach.
We then script, budget, shoot and edit the video for client approval.
<P>
In most cases, production equipment and personnel are &quot;in-
house&quot;, assuring you of high quality, professional production
standards.<HR>

<H2>COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
Highly skilled and creative writer/producer/directors are on staff
to meet the needs of all types of commercial production. Where
specialized skills or equipment may be needed, CHCH Production
will meet the requirements through the sourcing of free lance
personnel or rental of equipment.
<P>
Our creative personnel work with clients to determine the objectives
of the commercial, and the approximate budget. They then devise
a creative approach, script the commercial, quote the production
costs, and if approval is granted, proceed to produce the commercial.

Demonstrating neither the pretentiousness or pompous rituals that are so often associated with wine tasters, host Jonathan Welsh (E.N.G., Adderly), explores the world of wine and great food on the <B>The New World Wine Tour <I>Niagara</I>.</B>  Each week Jonathan welcomes a different celebrity or personality as his guest for dinner.  Some of the celebrity guests include Red Green, Pierre Berton, Dinah Christie, Camila Scott and Silkan Laumann.   Additionally, Jonathan is joined by Canadian viticulturists and wine makers who provide candid insight on what it is that differentiates one wine from another.

<CENTER><H1>&quot;Patsy!&quot;, A Musical Tribute To Patsy Cline,</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Now Playing in Toronto</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
Patsy Cline, the country music legend who gave her final concert in 1963 is now more popular than ever!
<P>
The sensational hit musical tribute <I>Patsy!</I> delights audiences and critics alike.  The show features 22 hit songs performed live by award-winning Gail Bliss and backed by a quartet reproducing the sounds of the incredible Jordinaires and a red-hot six-piece country band.  
<P>
The show is a tribute to the spirit of Patsy Cline and a celebration of songs that form one of the greatest legacies in music history.  A legacy honoured with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 1995.

<H1>The CRTC Announces Decision on</H1>
<H1>CHCH-TV's Ontario Expansion Applications</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>
CHCH-TV is pleased to receive approval from the Canadian Radio-television
and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to establish rebroadcast
transmitters in seven Ontario markets: Ottawa, London, Muskoka,
North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins. <BR>

<P>
&quot;Unquestionably, we are delighted with the Commission's decision,&quot;
says Jim Macdonald, president and chief executive officer, CHCH-TV.
&quot;The station's long term interests depended upon this conclusion.
While we are disappointed the CRTC approval of our applications
did not include Kingston, Peterborough and Thunder Bay,&quot;
continues Macdonald, &quot;we are left with the opportunity to
file applications for these markets at another time. With the
CRTC's endorsement to expand our coverage area within the province,
CHCH will be able to compete more equitably in the future.<BR>

<P>
&quot;What I must also make clear at this point,&quot; emphasizes
Macdonald, &quot;is that CHCH's current commitment to local news
coverage will not be affected by our Ontario expansion plans.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
The targeted time frame for rebroadcast transmitters servicing
London, Muskoka, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins to be operational
is spring 1997. The targeted time frame for the Ottawa market
is February 1997. <BR>

<P>
CHCH-TV is a member of WIC Television Ltd., a WIC Western International
Communications Ltd. company. WIC Television Ltd. owns eight television
stations. In addition to CHCH-TV (an independent), WIC Television
Ltd. owns BCTV-Vancouver and CHEK- Victoria (both CTV affiliates),
CHBC-Kelowna and RDTV-Red Deer (both CBC affiliates), ITV-Edmonton,
CICT-Calgary and CISA-Lethbridge (all independents).<BR>

<P>
WIC Western International Communications Ltd. is a leading Canadian
broadcast, communications and entertainment company with its head
office in Vancouver, British Columbia. WIC operates in four market
segments: television, pay television, radio and satellite network
services. In addition to its eight television stations, WIC owns
12 radio stations and is the pay television licensee in Western
Canada for Superchannel, MovieMax! and Home Theatre, a pay-per-view
service which operates under the name Viewer's Choice. Through
Superchannel, WIC has a 50 percent ownership in The Family Channel
Inc. WIC is active in telecommunications and satellite network
services through its 53.7 per cent ownership of Cancom. WIC and
Cancom together own an equity interest in ExpressVu Inc., a Canadian
satellite television direct-to-home (DTH) distribution company.
WIC is also parent to CellularVision Canada Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary which has applied to Industry Canada to provide wireless
broadband communications services to homes and businesses across
the country.

<H2>News from the Canadian Association of Broadcasters
- August 8, 1996</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
<CENTER>
<I>Broadcasters Call on Cable to Support Strong Community
Channels</I><BR>
</CENTER>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/bar.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</CENTER>

<P>

The Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) today
urges the cable industry to voluntarily support strong community
channels and, at the same time, flatly denied reports that it
in any way advocates their elimination.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Frankly, we're shocked and surprised that the
cable industry has grossly misrepresented our position to community
groups,&quot; said CAB President Michael McCabe.  &quot;Contrary
to what they're saying, we recognize the usefulness and importance
of the community channel and have said so publicly.&quot;<BR>
<P>
In a recent brief on new Distribution Regulations,
CAB states: &quot;The cable community channel is a useful outlet
for a number of viewers.  It provides Canadians in their communities
with information on community events and concerns and provides
community groups with an outlet to convey those concerns.  The
community channel has been an important part of how the cable
industry has defined itself to its customers.&quot;<BR>
<P>
CAB's proposal to the CRTC is that the cable industry,
like other distributors, contribute 5% of its gross revenues to
an independently-administered production fund open to all Canadian
producers.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The CAB expects that support from community
programming and community access is guaranteed in a competitive
marketplace,&quot; stressed McCabe.  &quot;A community channel
is an important marketing tool for cable.  You'd think they'd
want to provide it voluntarily, not to look to the CRTC for a
requirement.  But if community groups are concerned cable will
abandon its community channel responsibilities, they should call
on the CRTC to impose a funding requirement on top of the 5% all
distributors must contribute to Canadian programming.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;Some cable operators obviously are twisting
our case to imply we want community channel funding eliminated
altogether,&quot; added McCabe.  &quot;We can assure them and
any concerned community groups that simply is not the case.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
CAB estimates that an annual 5% programming contribution
from all distributors would leverage other funding resources that
could support over $200 million in additional Canadian drama,
variety and kids shows.<BR>
<P>
Broadcasters' position that all distributors should
make maximum and equivalent Canadian programming contributions
to an independently administered fund is supported in the government's
new Convergence Policy.<BR>
<P>
CAB represents the vast majority of Canada's local
serving, advertising supported television and radio stations.
<BR>
<P>
For information contact Michael Buzzell at the CAB
(613) 233-4035.

On May 29, 1995 we completed the installation of a new, completely
solid state, transmitter. This was purchased from Larcan, a world
leader, and Canada's premier manufacturer, of high power solid
state television transmitters.
<P>
The CHCH transmitter site is located on the Niagara Escarpment,
over looking Hamilton, Stoney Creek and Burlington, at the extreme
west end of Lake Ontario. With an antenna towering 1497ft above
Lake Ontario and an effective radiated power of 325,000 watts,
our signal reaches millions of viewers in southwestern Ontario
and western New York State on channel 11. In addition, our signal
is available in communities coast to coast in Canada via satellite.
This service is provided by CANCOM, one of our sister companies.

<H1>The Holiday Season Sparkles</H1>
<H2>on CHCH-TV</H2>
</CENTER>


<P>
<B>CHCH-TV</B> welcomes the holiday season with familiar favourites
and new traditions. Following are special Christmas holiday treats
the whole family can enjoy:<BR>

<P>
(in chronological order)<BR>

<HR>

<H2><CENTER><I>CHRISTMAS ON DIVISION STREET<BR>
</I></CENTER></H2>

<P>
A youth, charmed by the wisdom and generosity of a feisty 80-year-old
homeless man, pursues a relationship with the fellow. The alliance
enriches the boy's life just as his old friend relinquishes his.
The bitter-sweet drama, <I><B>Christmas on Division Street</B></I>,
airs <U>Tuesday, December 10, 1996, (8:00 - 10:00 p.m.)</U> on
<B>CHCH-TV</B>.<BR>

<P>
<B>Hume Cronyn, Fred Savage, Kenneth Welsh, Cloyce Morrow, Casey
Ellison, Kahla Lichti</B> and <B>Badja Djola</B> star. <BR>

<P>
In <I><B>Christmas On Division Street</B></I>, 14-year-old Trevor
Atwood (Savage), still suffering the loss of his grandfather,
fails to share his family's excitement about their move to Philadelphia.
The transition is made more difficult when Derek (Ellison), the
school jokester feels it his duty to torment the &quot;new guy.&quot;
Then, one day while in the library researching information for
a history paper, Trevor encounters Cleveland Meriwether (Cronyn),
an elderly homeless man and self-proclaimed &quot;Minister of
Education.&quot; His personality and exhaustive knowledge of American
history win Trevor over.<BR>

<P>
As the story unfolds, Trevor pursues a complex friendship with
Cleveland, a man besieged with drinking problems after causing
the death of a boy in an auto accident years ago. 
<P>
So enamored with Cleveland is Trevor that he is unwilling to desert
him no matter the outcome. Even after Cleveland rejects their
friendship, a lie initiated by a social worker, Trevor refuses
to stop caring for the man who would leave him with wonderful
memories and numerous examples of magnanimity: like the time Trevor
was stranded in the rain without train fare and Cleveland sold
his blood to give him the train fare; or the time Cleveland distributed
among the neighbourhood's needy, a sack of clothing Trevor had
brought for him; and so sweet was the time the two walked the
streets through the season's first snowfall when Cleveland landed
a job, temporarily. <BR>

<P>
Only after Cleveland's death, does the essence of the holiday
season take on a new and profound meaning for Trevor and his family.

<TITLE>Our Founder, Ken Soble</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY background="../images/bkgd.jpg">

<CENTER><IMG HEIGHT=133 WIDTH=529 SRC="../images/ksoble.gif" ALT="Ken Soble Photo"></CENTER>
   

<P>Kenneth D. Soble, founder of CHCH, was a revered giant in
the broadcast industry and an effective leader in urban renewal.  He was
a man of great vision, daring, and determination, who was respected
professionally and personally by everyone.  His career was comprised of
a long list of firsts which included the pioneering of: Canada's first
audience-participation radio broadcast, private television's first
regular reports from Parliament Hill, Canada's first on-the-spot  sports
broadcast, and the first broadcast for crippled children from Toronto's
Maple Leaf Gardens.  Soble was also instrumental bringing about
invaluable recognition for Canadians by having Leopold Stokowski arrange
and play Canadian music in Canada at Carnegie.

<P> Ken Soble gave
some of the biggest names in show business their start, for example, 
Oscar Peterson purchased his first piano with prize money won on the Ken
Soble Amateur Hour; people like Joyce Davidson, Gordie Tapp and the Four
Lads can trace their success back to Soble.      He was one of the key
figures in developing Broadcast News Ltd., the radio and television news
service affiliate of the Canadian Press.

<P> He also served for
many years on the board of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters. 
Kenneth D. Soble was born June 12, 1911, in Toronto.  At the age of 16,
he entered broadcasting at a Toronto radio station by giving a ride to a
young woman in need of transportation -- Jane Gray, Canada's first
female broadcaster .  Shortly after, he created the country's first
amateur show, The Ken Soble Amateur Hour, a radio broadcast that began
during the Depression in 1931.

<P> In 1936, at the age of 25, Ken
Soble came to Hamilton to manage radio station CHML.  Eight years later,
Soble learned that CHML was for sale and mortgaging everything he owned,
bought it.  In 1953 his television licence application, with equal
partnership with Wentworth Broadcasting and Southam, was approved.  In
1961, he pulled away from the CBC Network making CHCH Canada's only
independent station.

<P>Soble always managed to shock other
broadcasters.  In October of 1966, in association with Power Corp. of
Canada Ltd., he presented to the Board of Broadcast Governors a proposal
for a 97- station nation-wide television network to be fed by an
all-Canadian space satellite.  He and his partners could have the system
up and running before any other country in the world.   At the time of his death, no
formal application had been made.

<P>  Kenneth D. Soble entered the public housing field in
1960.  He was the first chairman of  Hamilton's urban renewal committee,
a position he held until his death in 1966.  His leadership in this
field was so impressive, that he was invited by the Ontario government
to head its proposed advisory committee.  He was a dynamic force within
the community.   He originated the Hamilton Dream Home campaign in 1950
to raise money for Winnipeg flood victims.

<P>Soble served on such
organizations as The Hamilton United Appeal, the Hamilton Art Gallery,
the Masonic Order, the Hamilton Health Association, the Primrose Club,
the B'nai Brith and the Hamilton Club.  He was an active member of the
Beth Jacob Synagogue.  In 1962 he was honored with a human relations
award from the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews.  Soble was
national chairman of the United Israel Appeal.  He was a member of the
conference planning Canada's centennial, a member of the Board of
Governors of McMaster University and a governor of the Hamilton Tiger
Cats Football Club.

<P> Repeatedly, Ken Soble was heard to say, "I
don't really have any talent of my own, unless it's a knack for finding
good people to run my businesses, and then leaving them alone.  Each
time I go into a new business, I leave my old one to the manager, and
I'm embarrassed by how successful it becomes."  According to Jack
Miller, radio and TV editor of the Hamilton Spectator at the time of Ken
Soble's death, that statement was the only repeated statement Soble ever
made -- that he couldn't back up.

<P>His "knack for finding good
people to run his businesses" proved to be true long after his death. 
His widow, Frances Soble, succeeded him first, as the head of one of
Canada's largest broadcasting empires.  Her position was then passed
along to two individuals Kenneth Soble placed in high regard -- Sydney
James Bibby, followed by Douglas C. Gale.

<P>Kenneth D. Soble
died on December 16, 1966, at the age of 55.<P>

<CENTER><H2>&quot;Mansion On Nob Hill Unlikely Home For Television Station&quot;</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/bar.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>

<P>The main offices of CHCH-TV were and still are housed in an unlikely
setting for a television station -- a stately 1840's mansion.  It was
built by John Bickle, an early Hamilton druggist, who named the
residence Pinehurst.  Following his death in 1875, the home became known
as Bishophurst and was occupied by Bishop Thomas Brock Fuller, the first
bishop of the newly created Diocese of Niagara.   It later became the
property of publishing pioneer William Southam, publisher of The
Hamilton Spectator.

<P> When William Southam died in 1932, the
residence was taken over by the Cawesco Club and used as a boarding
house and social centre for single male university graduates who had
come to Hamilton to be trained for management positions at Westinghouse.

<P> Following World War II, the house was transformed into the
headquarters for CJSH-FM, a radio station owned by the Hamilton
Spectator.  In 1953, CHCH began to occupy the house as part of its
facilities.

<P>When CHCH went on air, the grand old cut-stone home
housed CJSH-FM radio as well as the newly converted broadcasting
facility.   A Spectator delivery truck garage was located at the rear of
the house.  The new television station was equipped by RCA, acclaimed to
be among the best equipment in North America during that era.  The
reconverted garage at the rear of the house served for a time as CHCH's
main studio, complementing the TV studio set up at the Telecentre, the
old Kenmore Theatre, located a few blocks away.

<P>Until 1984, CHCH operated out of a collection of old buildings, including the 1840's
Georgian-style mansion. The designated historic site played a major role
in the construction and design of a new low-rise, high-tech facility
that would be linked with the house and bring operations under one roof.
In the end, the elegance of  Pinehurst-Bishophurst was completely
refurbished to its former grandeur.

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/bar.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>In the 1990's, CHCH has maintained its television programming
savvy, offering a well balanced schedule to its viewers -- news, sports,
comedy, drama and prestigious seasonal specials.  However, in the
inaugural days of television programming, news was not one of the key
players like it is today.  Musical entertainment was the order of the
day.  Following is a look back at a variety of some old CHCH favourites:

<UL>
<LI>The Ken Soble Amateur Show, which began in radio in 1931 and
went on to become a weekly television show in 1954.  It became one of
the longest running shows in Canadian Broadcast history.</LI> 

<LI>Tiny Talent Time, equally enduring, showcased aspiring singers, dancers,
baton twirlers and other hopefuls who were under the age of 12 (on-air
35 years - last broadcast 1992).</LI>

<LI>Family Theatre</LI>

<P>
Based on the hit movie of the same name, which starred Michelle
Pfeiffer, and memoirs of the real Louanne Johnson, <B>Annie Potts
</B>now takes on the role of the passionate, impious, nonconformist
teacher who touches students' lives in a racially pressured, inner-city
school system .  Tirelessly battling the school's jaded administration
and trying to excite her students about learning, Louanne's biggest
challenge comes when her kids leave the classroom and face overwhelming
personal struggles.

<P>
<B>Brooke Shields</B> stars as Susan, a bright, beautiful book
editor who has led a sheltered life.  Now, as she faces a new
career position, she also, for the first time, faces life as a
woman on her own -- having just ended a relationship with her
live-in boyfriend.  Both situations are frightening and exhilarating,
but Susan is learning all she needs to know about single life
from her co-worker and best friend Marcy.  Meanwhile, at work,
Susan is put through her paces by Charlotte, a flamboyant and
wildly eccentric romance novelist.

<P>
This epic science fiction-adventure series, combining 40 years
of history occurring in the late 20th century and speculative
fiction, leads to a final showdown between humans and aliens on
the eve of the millennium.  Leading the battle to save the world
are John Loengard and his girlfriend Kimberly Sayers, who, as
two utopian college grads in 1961, went to Washington to join
John F. Kennedy's New Frontier.  When Loengard stumbles into an
ultrasecret government program to fight a covert invasion of the
planet by extraterrestrial intelligence, he and Kimberly become
both victims and warriors in a resistance movement known as &quot;Dark
Skies.&quot;   The secret war will involve not only them, but
their children and millions more as well.

Jarod, a genius raised in isolation by a secret organization and
trained to be a &quot;human chameleon,&quot; flees &quot;The Centre&quot;
after discovering his brilliant studies were used to stage misdeeds.
 Utilizing his charm and ability to assume any personality and
solve any puzzle, Jarod takes on new identities and tasks, weekly,
to make up for the wrongs he inadvertently caused, all the while
being pursued by people who want him stopped -- dead.  <B> </B>

Fran Drescher stars as Fran Fine, a street-smart young woman,
with a face out of Vogue and a voice out of Queens, in <I><B>The
Nanny</B></I>, a half-hour comedy series.
<P>
Fran, fresh out of her job as a bridal consultant in her boyfriend's
shop is working as a door-to-door cosmetics saleswoman when she
stumbles onto the opportunity to become nanny to the children
of a wealthy Broadway producer, Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy).
Once Fran realizes Sheffield is not only wealthy but also a widower,
she eagerly takes the job.
<P>
It's a situation of blue collar meets blue blood, as Fran gives
the prim-and-proper Maxwell and his problem children a dose of
&quot;Queens logic,&quot; helping them become a healthy, happy
family.
<P>
Fran discovers she's got a lot of work to do with the three Sheffield
youngsters. Maggie (Nicholle Tom) is a pretty, yet insecure teenager
in need of a boost in self esteem. Convinced he doesn't need a
nanny, Brighton (Benjamin Salisbury) is a master at mischievous
pranks and tormenting his sisters. Six-year-old Grace (Madeline
Zima) is a serious child who dotes on her daily sessions with
her therapist.
<P>
Proudly running the Sheffield household is the butler Niles (Daniel
Davis), who watches all events with a bemused eye and levels problems
with his quick wit. Niles quickly recognizes Fran's gift at bringing
warmth back to the family. C.C. Babcock (Lauren Lane), Maxwell's
socialite business partner, views Fran with a mixture of skepticism
and jealousy, as she has designs on the very available Sheffield
herself
<P>
Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser are executive producers on
<I><B>The Nanny</B></I>. Peter Marc Jacobson, Pam Eells and Sally
Lapidus are co-executive producers. Kathy Landsberg and Fran Drescher

<B>Rhea Perlman</B> (<I>Cheers</I>) stars as a mature, outspoken,
working-class widow who is determined to graduate from the hallowed
halls and ivy-covered walls of Yale University
-- but first, she must deflect the prickly assertions hurled by
the ever-revered and feared, pompous Professor Pynchon, played
by <B>Malcom McDowell</B> ( <I>A Clockwork Orange, Star Trek:
Generations</I>).  In so doing, she wins the approval of her fellow
students, which include an insecure genius and dedicated intellectual.
 Her most arduous test, however, is convincing her electronics
store co-workers that her pursuit in academia is not a passing
fancy.

<P>
Stand-up comedian <B>Tom Rhodes</B> stars as a long-haired, free-thinking
scholar and author, who escaped his blue-collar upbringing for
the promise of literary success and excitement in New York City.
 Since inspiration has been an infrequent visitor, Tom returns
to his hometown to teach at the very prep school he enthusiastically
ridiculed during his years there as a student.  Tom's unorthodox<I>
</I>teaching methods send the headmaster reeling, 
mortifies his elitist colleagues and wins the approval of the
student body.  Sharing Tom's discomfort in a confining prep school
environment is the sexy, edgy Nikki Harkin -- the girl he worshipped
from afar during his high school days.  Between his headmaster,
the students and Nikki's fiancee, Tom is the one who ends up getting
an education!

into a wild adventure.  First, Roger gives Jason the courage to
leave his loudmouth bride at the altar -- a woman he could not

(it's not a mutual feeling) agree to share an apartment.  As the
duo is completely mismatched in character, what ensues is a series

<CENTER><H1>EXTRA: The News and Entertainment Magazine</H1>


<H1><IMG SRC="../../images/bar.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></H1>

</CENTER>

<P>
&quot;EXTRA&quot; is <I>your</I> half-hour daily entertainment
news magazine show, airing weekdays Monday to Friday (5:00 p.m.
- 5:30 p.m.).
<P>


The successful magazine series EXTRA is living up to its name by giving viewers something EXTRA. More than just entertainment news, more than just pop culture stories, EXTRA is combining the excitement of Hollywood with the drama of the real world to deliver breaking and topical news from around the globe. 
EXTRA has spent the past several months revamping and refocusing to evolve from a purely entertainment magazine to a broader, popular news series, covering a wide array of stories about celebrities, music, fashion, politics, business, health, everyday heroes and ordinary people doing EXTRAordinary things. 

<P>

EXTRA has built a strong news gathering operation comprised of highly regarded journalists, writers, and producers who travel throughout the country -- and around the world -- to go where the stories take them so they can bring them to EXTRA's viewers. 

<P>

The series is anchored by award-winning and seasoned broadcast journalists Brad Goode and Libby Weaver, and supported by a team of highly respected and talented correspondents including Lauren Sanchez, David Rose, Phil Shuman and Wendy Walsh. 

<P>

EXTRA's strength in front of the camera is matched by enormous power behind-the-scenes. In February, award-winning news producer David Friend (who has been with EXTRA since its inception) was named executive producer and was given the mandate to use his strong news expertise to change the show's philosophy, direction, and style of coverage. 

<P>

Friend restructured and reorganized the senior news staff, shifting the emphasis away from entertainment and towards pop culture. He recruited two senior supervising news producers, with exceptionally strong news backgrounds. Gloria McDonough-Taub (former executive producer of the number-one rated 11:00 p.m. newscast in the number-one market -- New York's "Eyewitness News" on WABC-TV) heads up the news and features unit, while Eugene Young (most recently executive producer of the 11:00 newscast on KCBS-TV in Los Angeles) is in charge of broadcasts. In addition, EXTRA has completely transformed its New York office into a comprehensive news bureau. 

<P>

And, as a Time Telepictures Production, EXTRA benefits from the enormous resources of Time Inc.'s publications (including Time, People, Entertainment Weekly, Life, and Sports Illustrated). The EXTRA staff works closely with the editors, reporters, and researchers from the publications in identifying, developing, and reporting a broad range of stories. 

<P>

All of this adds up to EXTRA's new status as a broadcast journalistic powerhouse. 

<P>

EXTRA, which offers half-hour editions every weekday and an original hour-long weekend installment, is seen in more than 90% of the country, including clearances in major market affiliates in prime access and key latenight time periods. In the top-ten markets, EXTRA is seen on WNBC (New York), KNBC (Los Angeles), WMAQ (Chicago), WCAU (Philadelphia), KPIX (San Francisco), WCVB (Boston), WJLA (Washington, D.C.), KTVT (Dallas), WJBK (Detroit) and WAGA (Atlanta). 

<P>

EXTRA, a Time Telepictures Production, is distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution.

<P>
From the creators of<I> thirtysomething </I>and<I> My So-Called
Life,</I> comes a romantic comedy focused on the mirth and madness
of marriage and extended families.  Isabel and Leo, the central
characters, meet and fall in love while Isabel is still engaged
to another man named Everett.  As many know only too well, the
road to true love is not smooth and the sources of Leo's anxieties
include Isabel's unreliable father, an opinionated gay sister
and  a fear that Isabel will one day return to Everett.  Love,
however, will prevail.

Journalism program, George worked as a general assignment  reporter in
Northeastern Ontario and Northwestern Quebec before coming to CHCH.

<P>Beginning as a General Assignment reporter at CHCH, he covered may of
the economic, financial and labor news stories that were the result of
the 1981-82 recession and the recovery that followed.  The  recession
also created a demand among Canadians for more economic and financial
news on a regular  basis.  In 1988 George was assigned to report
exclusively on business and the economy and to prepare and  read a
nightly business report on CHCH.

<P> A wealth of information, the
Business Report includes a brief summary of the day's developments in 
financial markets, nightly quotations of the New York and Toronto Stock
Exchanges, precious metals  prices and oil prices, the daily value of
the Canadian Dollar and other major currencies, profiles of  Hamilton
and area business, and interviews with economists and industry
specialists.  Friday's "Best Buy"  investment segment usually generates
calls from interested viewers when a Hamilton-area investment  dealer
offers specific recommendations for a specific investor profile.

<P>The Business Report with George Szostak airs Monday to Friday at 6:15pm on
the Channel 11 Evening  News, and is repeated during Channel 11 News
Final Edition at 11:45pm.

<P>George is a past President of the
Canadian Association of Broadcast Employees, a title which he held for 
four years.  He is also active in the Hamilton and District Chamber of
Commerce Annual Business  Achievement Awards.

<TITLE>Jennifer Mossop Biography</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY background="../../images/bkgd.jpg">
<IMG SRC="../../images/jennifer.gif">  

<P>CHCH-TV news
anchor JENNIFER MOSSOP was born during the month of June in Toronto,
Ontario.   Her first few years of school were spent at a Toronto French
school, but when the family moved in 1967,  Jennifer completed her
primary, secondary and post-secondary education in London, Ontario,
ultimately  graduating from Fanshawe College in Broadcast Journalism.  A
few years later, her interest in the  continuation of learning, as well
as her love for the French language, took her to Universite De Toulon, 
France, for the summer of 1986.

<P> While still rooted in London,
Jennifer began her broadcast career at CJBK Radio as a reporter and 
newscaster.  In 1981, CHCH-TV hired her to be the Niagara Bureau Chief,
a position she held until 1986.   Recognizing her exceptional talents, 
the station moved Jennifer into the seat of weekend news anchor in 
1987.  In 1990,  Jennifer left her weekend duties to produce and anchor
CHCH-TV's 11:00 p.m. news  package, weeknights, a post she commands to
this day.

<P> Not one to rest on her laurels, the multi-talented
Jennifer produced and hosted CHCH-TV's weekly travel  show, "Ontario
Adventures" during the summer of 1989 and 1990, while she was anchoring
the weekend  newscasts.  In addition, she has her own company, J.F.M.
Productions, which allows her to produce,  direct, write, and host a
variety of current affair programmes.  This endeavour complements
Jennifer's  strong belief in solid journalism, and her interests in the
environment, nature, history and economics.

<P>Jennifer Mossop is a
member of Canadian Women in Communications, and Toronto Women in Film
and  Television.  As well, she is always willing to share her free time
with many of the area's charitable  organizations.

<P> When not
working, Jennifer enjoys time with her musician husband, their long
haired dachshund, and  many family members and friends.  As well,
Jennifer takes pleasure in gardening, cooking, reading,  walking, and
music.

<TITLE>Ken Welch Biography</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY background="../../images/bkgd.jpg">
<IMG SRC="../../images/ken.gif">

<P>CHCH-TV's
quick-witted sports anchor and reporter KEN WELCH was born in Toronto in
1954.   Although his family resided in Tweed, followed by Bramalea, it
was in Belleville, Ontario, where Ken  completed his elementary
education, and obtained his high school diploma.  After a two year
sojourn at  Kingston's Queen's University, Ken transferred to Carleton
University in Ottawa, where he graduated with  a Bachelor of Arts Degree
in History.

<P> Ken Welch's broadcast career began in 1981, at
Newmarket radio station, CKAN.   In August, 1982, he  made the switch to
CFOS Radio, Owen Sound, where he took on the duties of news and sports
reporter, as  well as that of host for a weekly sports phone-in show. 
Word soon spread about Ken's personable nature  and innate sports
reporting talent, and by 1984, he was working at CHYM/CKGL Radio in
Kitchener as sports director.

<P>Recognizing Ken's capabilities, CHCH-TV hired him in October, 1985,
as writer, producer, and anchor  for the weekend sportscasts .  Since
1988, Ken has applied those same skills to CHCH-TV's Final Edition
newscasts, weeknights.  In addition to those responsibilities, Ken has
been the host and sideline reporter for University Football  Game of the
Week (1989 to present); for four years he hosted, wrote, and co-produced
a weekly Canadian  Football League show, CFL Journal (1988-91).  As
well, Ken has provided reports from the sites of five  Grey Cup
Championship games; and co-hosted the Save the Ti-Cats Telethon (1989).

<P>Outside the sports world, Ken generously gives of his time to youth
oriented endeavours, e.g., he regularly  visits  local schools as part
of "Literacy" and "Learn To Read" Weeks; participates in CHCH-TV's
annual  Mother's Day Telethon to benefit the Children's Hospital at
Chedoke-McMaster; and he was the  Honourary Chairman of the 1995 Big
Brother's Bowlathon of Hamilton-Wentworth, Burlington.

<P> Never at a loss for words, Ken's command of the English language has made him a
popular figure on the  speakers' circuit.  He has emceed banquets and
delivered after-dinner speeches all over southern Ontario,  in
Nashville, Tennessee and even in New Orleans, Louisiana.

<P>Ken and his wife, Laura, are the proud parents of one beautiful child, Michael.<P>

<b>Specialists Protest</b><p>
Surgeons across the province have taken the day off, in a continuing protest by doctors, against the Harris government.  Only emergency patients will receive treatment, and specialists across the province are being urged to shut their doors in a one day protest next week. While doctors continue to edge closer to a full-blown strike; the Ontario Medical Association says, it believes a settlement with the province could come, this weekend. 
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Attacked</b><p>
Convicted sex-killer Paul Bernardo has been attacked by another inmate at the Kingston Penitentiary.<br>  Corrections officials say the incident occurred as Bernardo was being escorted back to his cell this morning after taking a shower.<br>  Another inmate outside his cell stepped up and punched Bernardo in the face.<br>  Bernardo suffered a cut on his cheek and a swollen eye.<br>  The unidentified inmate has been placed in segregation.
<hr>
<b>CAI Hargrove</b><p>
As 37-hundred members of the Canadian Autoworkers Union prepare to vote on a contract designed to save Canadian Airlines ... their national president is slamming the deal, and continuing efforts to renegotiate. Buzz Hargrove is calling on the federal government to pump more money into the restructuring plan... and re-instate regulatory controls over Canadian skies.<br> 
<i> <br>   The president of the Canadian Autoworkers wants federal government to step in to save Canadian Airlines.<br>  Buzz Hargrove is still smarting over  Ottawa's order forcing the holdout union to vote on a rescue package for Canadian.<br> But so far, the autoworker's leadership has refused to tell its 37 hundred members to vote against the restructuring plan. <br>Yesterday... Hargrove was beseiged by members who want to vote on the package which contains a sliding scale of pay cuts.<br>  But this British Columbia union leader says most Canadian employees feel the government has sold them out.<br>  The union says Canadian's problems are caused by cutthroat competition with Air Canada.<br>  It wants Ottawa to re-regulate the industry.<br>  But the transport minister says reregulation won't fly.<br>   Meanwhile.. Hargrove says the the fight over Canadian has gotten personal.<br>  His former wife's address and phone number have been posted on the Internet.<br>  There have been bomb threats..and tires slashed.  All this is happening as Canadian's 16 thousand workers begin voting on the restructuring plan.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Pearson Severance</b><p>
Meanwhile; 500 employees at Pearson Airport are enjoying a federal windfall of nearly 10-thousand dollars each. That's the average amount paid out in severance benefits to the airport workers ... even though none of them has lost their jobs. In fact, they haven't been out of work for even so much as a day. The federal government paid out nearly five million dollars to the workers, however, because the airport was turned over to a local airport authority and officially, they are no longer civil servants.
<hr>
<b>Main St. Flood</b><p>
Regional crews mopping up a wet mess in central Hamilton this morning.<br>  A water main broke on Main Street at Grant during this morning's rush hour, spewing water several blocks away.<br>  A road construction crew had been working nearby just before the break.<br>  A spokeswoman with Hamilton Wentworth's Sewer and Water Department says there have been several complaints of flooding by nearby residents and businesses.
<hr>
<b>UI Stats</b><p>
The economy may be improving, but the unemployment rate, isn't. Statscan says, the national jobless rate edged upwards in November ... to a worrisome ten percent ... the worst performance in three months.<br>  In Ontario, unemployment climbed by two-tenths of a percent, to 9.3. But Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and B.C. all reported slight improvement.<br>  Locally, Hamilton's jobless rate rose slightly to 7.3 percent... still one of the lowest rates in Canada. Kitchener- Waterloo also reported a small increase in unemployment ... while Toronto held steady, and improvement was reported, in the Niagara Peninsula, and London.
<hr>
<b>GM Layoffs St Kits</b><p>
 33 workers at General Motors in St. Catharines, have one week left on the job. They will be laid off, December 15th; as the plant cuts production of its v-6 engines, and winds down its foundry operations. 88 more workers will will be laid off, March 1st.
<hr>
<b>Fewer Pols</b><p>
Ontario will do without 27 MPPs, come the next provincial election. The Harris government kept a campaign promise, and cut the number of provincial politicians from 130, to 103. New ridings will match existing federal boundaries. The province says the move will save, 11-million dollars a year.
<hr>
<b>Halton - GTA</b><p>
 David Crombie's 'who does what panel', will tell the province what to do with Toronto, this morning; calling for a super-city; and the establishment of a greater Toronto region, stretching from Burlington to Clarington ... and north from Lake Ontario to Bradford. What will that mean for the region of Halton? Deborah Walker reports:
<i> <br>The "who does what" panel resurrects some of the recommendations of the Golden Report, endorsing the GTA-wide provision of services, and the elimination of overlapping layers of municipal government. But unlike Golden, the panel also looked at municipal government beyond the borders of the GTA.  <br>As a member of the "who does what" panel, Cooke won't comment on specific recommendations until they're released to the public.  <br>The chairman of Halton Region supports change, but only if it's change for the better.  <br>The mayor of Burlington wants more details before he comments on the recommendations. But Terry Cooke warns it's too late for Burlington to reconsider throwing its lot in with Hamilton- Wentworth.  <br>The recommendations of the "who does what" panel are just that.  It's up to the Ontario government to decide whether to accept them.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Sailing Death</b><p>
Australian authorities have abandoned the search for an 18 year old Fonthill resident, missing, and presumed drowned, after a freak accident on board a sailboat, off the north coast of Australia.<br>  Derek Zavitz was part of a student adventure program; and was sailing on board the Concordia, when the ship's battery exploded, and apparently threw him overboard. His body has not yet been recovered. A memorial service for Zavitz is planned for tomorrow, in Wainfleet.
<hr>
<b>Grenade - Ancaster</b><p>
Nine year old Barron Thompson's show and tell subject, turned out to be a show stopper, in Ancaster, yesterday. Thompson was on his way home when he pulled a hand-grenade from his back pack on board the school bus. A startled driver, who did not know that the grenade was inactive; stopped the bus, and evacuated the students. Police bomb squad officers moved in to take the device away. That left Thompson to explain to his father, how the souvenir he had picked up at a sportsman's show; had suddenly disappeared.
<hr>
<b>Car Lease Language</b><p>
The cost of car-buying is driving many consumers down the road less travelled.<br>  Leasing, is becoming more popular than ever ... even though car lease contracts are more confusing than federal tax rules. But provincial regulators are hoping to take the mystery, frustration and danger out of leasing with some plain language ... as Lauran Sabourin reports.
<i><br>  Shopping for a new car can be an intimidating experience.<br>  Should they buy ..should they lease..what's it all going to cost ...<br>  Leasing started to become more popular as cars became more expensive.<br>  People couldn't deal with the sticker shock.<br>  The lower monthly payments were more palatable..<br>  But with leasing had its problems.<br>   People knew what their monthly payment was.<br>  But often weren't told what the residual value of the vehicle would be. <br>  But there should be no surprises now.<br>  Effective January 1st 1997 car dealers will be required to fully disclose what a vehicle costs a consumer.<br>  Taxes, mileage, down payments, responsibilities. <br>  Every thing will be laid on the line.<br>  Now dealers won't be able to simply tell customers what they want to hear.<br>  They'll have to put everything down on paper.</i>

<b>Hargrove Newser</b><p>
Buzz Hargrove says the union will keep on trying.   <br>   The head of the Canadian Auto Workers Union called a news conference in Toronto today to restate the union's case for more government help for Canadian Airlines International. Hargrove says the union will use at least the balance of the day to try to get the federal government to move on the issue of re-regulating the industry. It will also try to negotiate some of the issues with the company. Hargrove says he's in contact with the federal labor minister's office, the federal transport minister, B.C. premier Glen Clark and Canadian Airlines president Kevin Benson. Earlier today, Hargrove ruled out a court challenge to the federal decision ordering the union to allow its members to vote on the company's wage-reduction package.
<hr>
<b>Doc Dispute</b><p>
The battle between Queens Park and the province's doctors is heating up again. Despite optimism on the part of the Ontario Medical Association that a deal is close, many general surgeons are closing their offices on Friday and now the Specialist Coalition of Ontario is calling for a provincewide closure of all specialist offices, beginning next Friday. But the coalition is refusing to call it a strike. Coalition vice-chairman Dr. William Hughes says patients expecting to see a specialist December 13th will be rescheduled. But he maintains emergency services will be provided.
<hr>
<b>Strike Clash</b><p>
Videotaped evidence from the spring riot at Queen's Park contradicts OPP claims that striking civil servants used picket signs as weapons. A confidential report on the March 18th incident reveals that one picket was hit in the head by an OPP sergeant -- then hit by another officer as he fell. The 114-page report on allegations made by Stephen Giles was delivered yesterday to OPP commissioner Thomas O'Grady. The OPP has 30 days to decide whether to take disciplinary action.
<hr>
<b>Workfare</b><p>
If the province approves it, Hamilton- Wentworth's workfare program could be up and running by the middle of next month. Initially, only new welfare applicants will have to sign up for workfare. Another six-thousand people who are already collecting benefits will be gradually phased into the program. Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>Only a handful of Hamilton- Wentworth regional councillors object to the workfare program adopted by council this week.  <br>Anyone who's eligible, and refuses to participate in workfare, can have their benefits cut off.  <br>For the first four months, recipients have to conduct a job search.  After that, they'll have three options... register with a job placement agency, sign up for a retraining program, or work for a non-profit group as a volunteer. That's something many welfare recipients are already doing.  <br>Schuster says the workfare program won't cost Hamilton- Wentworth Region a cent, and it's expected to produce a five per cent drop in the welfare caseload by next year.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Students - Fumes</b><p>
Authorities still don't know the source of nauseating fumes at a Hamilton high school yesterday. Thirty students and staff at Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School were taken to hospital after being overcome. Dozens of people reported coughing, headaches, sore throats, nausea and burning eyes. The school was checked for natural gas but nothing unusual showed up.
<hr>
<b>Christmas Ride</b><p>
With Christmas just 20 days away, Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police are kicking off their annual holiday ride programs.<br>  Ride lanes will be set up every day throughout the region to help reduce drinking and driving.<br>  Last holiday season, there were 33 collisions involving drunk drivers, including 2 fatalities.<br>  In the first week of Ontario's strict new driving suspensions for impaired driving, 4 people in Hamilton Wentworth have lost their licences for 90 days.<br>  Carol Redmond, whose husband was killed by a drunk driver 3 years ago, had a sobering message at the ride kickoff this morning.
<hr>
<b>Pot House</b><p>
Quite the surprise for police checking out a house break-in overnight.<br>  A neighbour had called after seeing two men run from the back of the house with two garbage bags.<br>  When police went inside to investigate, they found marijuana leaves spread out on a table and a hydroponic growing system with several marijuana plants in the basement.<br>  31 year old Matthew Gordon Kelly of Hamilton faces a number of narcotics charges.
<hr>
<b>Native Dispute</b><p>
A dispute that closed a school on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford has been resolved. Natives used their vehicles to blockade the school for four days to protest the actions of a teacher they say was insensitive to native language and customs. They say the teacher reprimanded two boys for speaking the Cayuga language in a gym class. The protest ended yesterday when a Six Nations Band Council decided to sent a resolution demanding the removal of the teacher to the Federal Indian Affairs Department.
<hr>
<b>Paris Canadian</b><p>
A Victoria man is preparing to fly to Paris to join his injured son, who lost his bride to a terrorist attack on Tuesday. Newlyweds Frank Stonebanks and Helen Viel were on a Paris commuter train that was bombed. Roger Stonebanks says his 30-year-old son's injuries are not life-threatening and he expects to leave the intensive-care unit today.
<hr>
<b>Simpson Latest</b><p>
The judge in the OJ Simpson civil trial has allowed testimony banned at his criminal trial. A battered women's counselor told jurors yesterday that a woman named Nicole called to say she was being stalked by her ex-husband. The counselor said the call came in just days before Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman were murdered. Simpson is being sued by the families of the victims for wrongful death.
<hr>
<b>Jenny Jones</b><p>
A man who killed a gay admirer who revealed the crush on a "Jenny Jones Show" taping has been sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. Jonathan Schmitz was convicted last month of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Scott Amedure. During the trial, witnesses said Schmitz believed he was going on the show in March 1995 to meet a female secret admirer. Amedure was shot three days after the taping. The show never aired, but was played in court during trial.
<hr>
<b>Ghali UN</b><p>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has "temporarily" suspended his candidacy for another five-year term as UN chief. That opens the door for other Africans to vie for his job. But Boutros-Ghali insists he's still in the race, adding more confusion to the bizarre proceedings. Boutros-Ghali's term expires December 31st. Diplomats say the 74-year-old Egyptian is prepared to withdraw in light of an American veto against his re-election. They say he doesn't want to be blamed by Africans for denying the continent another five-year term by staying in the race. At the same time, they say he doesn't want to let down his backers. No other candidate has been nominated yet.
<hr>
<b>Tiny Tim Funeral</b><p>
Tiny Tim has been laid to rest the way he would have wanted it -- with a ukulele on his chest surrounded by tulips. About 400 people showed up for his funeral in Minneapolis yesterday. A fan placed six rose-colored tulips in Tiny Tim's casket, and someone had placed a stuffed white rabbit in as well. Tiny Tim died Saturday night of a heart attack suffered just as he was performing his signature song, "Tiptoe Thru' the Tulips."
<hr>
<b>Bobbitt Minister</b><p>
And they say the lord works in mysterious ways, but this one has many people baffled. Remember John Bobbitt -- the guy who gained notoriety three years ago after his wife cut off his penis? Well it's now Reverend Bobbitt. He says he's been ordained a minister in, where else...Las Vegas. Bobbitt has done a lot of things since the impromptu amputation, including an adult movie and a jail stint for assaulting his fiancee.
<hr>
<b>Nicholson Star</b><p>
Its "Jack Nicholson Day" in Hollywood! The honorary mayor of Hollywood, Johnny Grant made the announcement to commemorate the two time Oscar winner getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Nicholson is the proud recipient of the Hollywood chamber of commerce's 2,077th star. You can find it at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Mann's Chinese Theater.
<hr>
<b>Billboard Awards</b><p>
Madonna has made her first public appearance since becoming a mother. She was on hand in Las Vegas last night at the Billboard Music Awards, where she won the artist achievement prize. It was also a big night for Alanis Morissette of Ottawa. She won the artist of the year award. Mariah Carey was a double winner.

<b>Eves Statement</b><p>
We're doing better than we thought we would ... but three billion more, in provincial budget cuts ... are coming.  That's the word from Ontario finance minister Ernie Eaves. But Eaves was not prepared to detail his plans ... when he delivered an economic statement to the province at Queen's Park. Instead the finance minister focused on the deficit, and government success in bringing it 40 per cent below what it was, when the Tories came to power.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Docs</b><p>
Ontario's doctors are stepping up the pressure in their efforts to resist provincial government budgets cuts to the health care sector. General surgeons announced that they will stop treating all but cancer and emergency patients, beginning next Friday.<br> Meanwhile, most physicians in Mississauga took the day off today, in protest over government plans to cap their salaries, and force new doctors to work in underserviced areas.
<hr>
<b>Labour - Sudbury</b><p>
While the doctors continue their protest against the Harris government ... organized labour is having some trouble keeping the momentum going.<br> Labour leaders in Sudbury have now rejected plans for a 'days of protest' rally in their city, scheduled for February.<br> Steelworkers in the nickle city say the demonstrations have failed to get the government to change its course on program and budget cuts. And the District Labour Council says ... February is no time to take to the streets ... in Sudbury.
<hr>
<b>Casino Spinoffs</b><p>
While it may seem that Ontario's economy is still very sluggish ... you'd have a tough time proving it, in Niagara Falls.<br> The honeymoon city is gushing with excitement and activity with the grand opening of the Niagara Falls Casino just over a week away.<br> As Lauran Sabourin reports businesses are cashing in on a multi-million dollar jackpot of economic spinoffs.
<i><br>  Casino Niagara is still a muddy construction site.<br>  A site that within the last year has employed three thousand construction workers.<br>  Eighty million dollars has been spent on construction materials alone.<br>  But construction isn't the only industry that has come out a winner.<br>  Local retail businesses are cashing in big on the casino.<br>  Beatties Stationary is supplying all of the office materials at Casino Niagara. <br>  Six hundred thousand is being spent on office related tools and supplies.  <br>  At Cataract Ice in the falls they're packing and stacking bags in preparation for all of the casino parties. <br>  Restaurant managers are looking at hiring more staff to feed hungry gamblers.. <br>  Even the mood on economically depressed Queen Street is changing..<br>  Where the businesses go from here no one is sure.<br>  But with six million people spending 650 million dollars a year at the casino,  many business operators at looking at grabbing even a small piece of that action.. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Drinking & Driving</b><p>
It also got more expensive to drink, and drive. as of midnight ... the province began to enforce new penalties that will provide an automatic 90 day licence suspension for anyone caught exceeding the legal blood alchol limit, behind the wheel. At least four people have been charged already, in Kitchener, Toronto, and Owen Sound. No one has yet been charged, in Hamilton-Wentworth.
<hr>
<b>Liberal Leadership</b><p>
Provincial Liberals begin their leadership convention ... facing off at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, today. Seven candidates are seeking to replace out-going leader Lyn McLeod ... and the odds on favourite is former food bank director, and rookie Toronto MPP ... Gerard Kennedy.  
<hr>
<b>CAI Latest</b><p>
Blame it on Buzz Hargrove. The CAW president is being characterized as the villain ... in the drama surrounding the potential collapse of Canadian Airlines.<br> Hargrove stormed out of a meeting with federal transport minister David Anderson last night; claiming Anderson had nothing to offer but the same old lecture, on the financial state of Canadian.<br> Hargrove's union is the last hold-out in a plan to bail out the financially strapped airline. The CAW objects to a proposed five percent pay cut, and will not allow its 32-hundred members to vote on the restructuring plan. Hargrove wants Ottawa to kick in more money. The federal government says, it has gone as far as it can, to save Canadian. Airline officials now say however, that Hargrove's union may not matter. They believe with five other unions already on board, creditors will now accept the restructuring plan for Canadian.
<hr>
<b>Flamboro Merger</b><p>
Residents of Flamborough turned out by the dozen last night ... to show their opposition to the Hamilton-Wentworth super-city plan.<br> Flamborough mayor Ted McMeekin says, he wants to bring in a new mediator, and renegotiate the current deal, with a little more sensitivity to public input.<br>  Ian Dovey reports.
<i><br>  There have been few issues that have sparked the public's attention as the proposed supercity concept in Hamilton Wentworth.<br>  Mayor Ted McMeekin says it's time to reneogiate. <br>    A supercity that includes Flamborough is a sensitive issue for residents here, but still people came out to this public meeting to voice their distaste. <br>    The meeting also attracted this councillor from Dundas, a community that also opposes a megacity. <br>    A citizens group has started a petition against the supercity.<br>  Organizers hope the signatures end up on municipal affairs minister Al Leaches desk. <br>    </i>
<hr>
<b>Canal Body</b><p>
Police have now identified the body of a woman pulled from the Welland Canal in St. Catharines, yesterday. 46 year old Elita Johnson died, when her car left the road and plunged into the frigid waters just after one o'clock yesterday. Witnesses say they could hear the woman screaming, but could only watch helplessly as the car quickly sank in the canal. It took St. Lawrence Seaway divers 20 minutes to find the victim, and pull her from the car. Attempts to revive her in hospital, were futile. An autopsy will be conducted, today.
<hr>
<b>Coats for Kids</b><p>
A heart warming story being played out across Hamilton Wentworth today.<br>  This as hundreds of kids pick up donated winter clothing collected by regional police.<br>  Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  This is the second winter kids from across Hamilton Wentworth will be kept a little warmer thanks to community donations.  The warm a heart campaign, organized by Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police, has been collecting warm coats, boots, hats and mitts for the last several weeks.  <br>  This year, people have donated three times as much as last winter.  <br>  While the clothing is meant to warm little bodies across the region this winter, handing them out seems to warm the hearts of those involved.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Frechette</b><p>
Olympic synchronized swimming medalist Sylvie Frechette ... is embarking on a new career.<br>  Frechette will join the internationally reknowned Cirque du Soleil ... to develop and star in a new 'water show' ... to be presented as a regular attraction of the new Bellagio Hotel, in Las Vegas. Both the show, and the hotel will open in the spring, of 1998.

<b>CAI Unions</b><p>
The deadline for a deal between Canadian Airlines and its six unions has been pushed back one week.  <br> Airline president Kevin Benson says he's confident he'll have a deal by then. Benson challenged two of the carrier's six unions to put a restructuring proposal to their members for a vote. CUPE, representing flight attendants, and the CAW, representing terminal staff, consider a pay cut unacceptable. CUPE president Benson said he's confident pressure from other unions will persuade CUPE and the CAW to put the deal to a vote. He also said he's going ahead with restructuring talks with the four unions that are on-side.
<hr>
<b>Cardiac Wait</b><p>
While one of this country's major air carriers continues on financial life support,  waiting lists for non-emergency heart surgery in Ontario have reached an all-time high.<br> Some cardiologists believe that a crisis is developing.<br> A group which monitors waiting lists says there are more than 15-hundred people waiting for non-emergency bypass surgery.<br> The Cardiac Care Network says the median waiting time is 70 days, but some folk are waiting as long as four months.<br> Patients needing emergency surgery do get immediate care.<br> The growth in waiting lists comes eight months after the province spent 16-million dollars to improve cardiac services.<br> The money was to fund more than 14-hundred bypass operations with the goal of cutting the waiting list by one-third.
<hr>
<b>No Mini Budget</b><p>
Finance minister Ernie Eves delivers an economic statement today and premier Mike Harris says it will offer a rosy view.<br> He says the numbers will show Ontario is "ahead of schedule" in cutting spending and reducing the province's 8.7 billion-dollar deficit.<br> But the update won't include the information municipalities, hospitals, school boards and post-secondary institutions are looking for.<br> The premier says funding information for the province's transfer partners won't come until next month at the earliest.<br> Liberal finance critic Gerry Phillips says it's going to be "a window dressing statement " that won't tell people how the tories plan to balance Ontario's books.
<hr>
<b>St. Liz Inquest 6</b><p>
More disturbing testimony at the coroner's inquest into deaths at a Hamilton seniors home. The jury heard that a resident of St. Elizabeth Villa jumped to his death from an upper floor window. But, when his body was discovered, police weren't even called. Dwight Ryan reports.
<i><br>  Members of the jury had a first hand look at St. Elizabeth Villa ..touring the facility they have heard so much about in recent weeks.<br>  The coroner's inquest is investigating five deaths at the villa..five of more than forty in just over a year.  <br>  Earlier in the day jury members heard dramatic testimony about the suicide of an elderly villa resident not long ago.  The man's crumpled body was found outside the building shortly after ten o'clock in the evening. <br>  RNA Sherry Farrell said Sister Maria was flustered and asked her to call a doctor.  Armed with a flashlight the sister and Farrell saw that the man, surrounded by blood, was obviously dead.<br>  Further investigation showed that he had removed his screen and jumped from an upper floor window.<br>   It was the doctor who called the coroner and police.  Later the angry officer said if anything like that happened again, to call 911 immediately.<br>  The suicide story was just one of many that put the villa's management in a bad light.<br>  Former health care aide Linda Bonnoly told coroner Bill Lucas and jury members that she was repeatedly yelled at by Sister Maria.  It was her way or not at all.<br>  She detailed instances of sour milk being sent to the residents and fresh cereal poured over stale cereal.  Damp sheets being returned from the laundry. Improvising when supplies such as bed pads and diapers weren't available. <br>  When the investigation into St. Elizabeth Villa began, staff members were asked to write letters to the medical officer of health defending the facility.<br>  Linda Connoly refused.  A couple of weeks later she quit.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Bell Cancer</b><p>
An expert says the high rate of cancer among workers at a Bell Canada office in Hamilton is coincidence. Dr. Gilles Theriault, an epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal, says further testing would be useless. Eight cases of cancer have been confirmed among 50 workers on one floor of the Bell Canada Centre, including five breast cancers. In September, the workers moved from the third floor to the seventh. Tests of air quality, electromagnetic and radiation emissions were done, but nothing unusual was found. Bell Canada is setting up a cancer surveillance program for workers who were on the third floor.
<hr>
<b>Bell Warning</b><p>
And a warning from Bell Canada today about a new phone scam.<br> Urgent messages are being left on voice mail concerning accidents, deaths or prize winnings.<br> The recepient is asked to call back a number beginning with 8-0-9.<br> What they aren't told is the number originates from the Caribbean, and that the call could cost you as much as 100 dollars.
<hr>
<b>Nuke Plant Licence</b><p>
Canada's oldest nuclear-power plant finds out today how much faith regulators have in it.<br> The Pickering facility just east of Toronto is expected to get an unusually short six-month licence renewal, not the standard two-year renewal Hydro wants. A shorter term would be a rebuke for a litany of safety and staff problems.<br> The Atomic Energy Control Board is holding a public hearing in Oshawa today before ruling on the plant's application for a new licence.
<hr>
<b>Murder Charge</b><p>
Niagara Region police have made an arrest in connection with a shooting death earlier this month in Fort Erie.<br> The body of Fred Grondin was found lying beside a van on the shoulder of Highway 3 November 7th.<br> Charged with first-degree murder is 30-year-old Patrick O'Connor of Fort Erie.<br> He is to appear in a St. Catharines court Friday morning.
<hr>
<b>Scarf Bandit</b><p>
Police in Hamilton believe they may have nabbed the "scarf bandit".<br> Over the past few weeks, several stores and submarine shops on Hamilton mountain have been robbed by a suspect wearing a scarf across his face.<br> Yesterday, police arrested a suspect after a Bargain Shop on Fennell Avenue was robbed by a man wearing a scarf and matching the description from similar robberies.<br> 21 year old Kurt Gray of Hamilton is charged with robbery in the Bargain Shop hit.<br> Police are continuing their investigation.
<hr>
<b>Gun Law</b><p>
Justice minister Allan Rock has tabled new regulations that accompany the gun-control bill passed almost a year ago. As Ian Dovey reports, the major provision calls for a person to be notified if a spouse or ex-spouse applies for a gun permit.<br>
The person notified would then have a chance to wave a red flag.                 <I><br>  Ottawa says buying a firearm will under the proposed regulations be straightforward and practical.<br>  The new process will be much like a credit card purchase.<br>  The swipe of a license and registration card will verify that the buyer is authroized to buy the gun and that the store is authorized to sell it. <br>    Beginning in 1998 everyone who owns a gun will have to have a license.<br>  The five year license will range from 10 to 80 dollars depending on the weapon.<br>  Regarding the storage of weapons... non restricted firearms will have to be stored unloaded, locked or deactivated in a separate location from the ammunition.<br>  Restricted or prohibited weapons must be stored in the same fashion but with a trigger lock in a locked case or cabinet.<br>  Rock says the existing permit to transport firearms will replaced with simpler rules.<br>  The anti gun lobby supports Ottawa's initiatives. <br>    Rock says the regualtions will apply to aboriginal peoples as well, but enforced with respect for the aboriginal way of life.<br>  Ontario along with Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the territories say they will not enforce the registry.<br>  </I>
<hr>
<b>Fireworks Explosion</b><p>
Peruvian police say six people are dead and at least seven people are seriously injured from a fireworks factory explosion in a Lima shantytown.<br> The police say a spark apparently started the deadly blaze which was still burning Wednesday evening. Police officer Hector Grados says all the injured people have been taken to hospitals.

Foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy says 15 countries have agreed to a multinational mission to help Rwandan refugees in central Africa.<br> Axworthy says while diplomatic efforts to get the mission off the ground have been frustrating, he feels things are moving now.<br> He says details of the force will be worked out under United Nations rules tomorrow.<br> He says the force will be occupied with setting up relief headquarters in Uganda, reconnaissance to identify areas of need and co-ordination of delivery of aid packages.
<hr>
<b>Bouchard Mission</b><p>
He may not be a team player, but Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard has decided to join the Team Canada Trade Mission to Asia in January.<br> Taking part will be prime minister Chretien, all the premiers, the leaders of the two territories, and representatives of 300 companies. Bouchard's decision is a break from the policy of his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau.<br>  He did not take part in the last two trade missions, to China in 1994 and to India last year.
<hr>
<b>Crash - Genie</b><p>
It was a big night for controversial movie director David Cronenberg last night. Banned in some countries, Cronenberg's film "Crash" won the most Genie awards -- but not best picture. Cronenberg's notorious blend of sex and car collisions won him the Genie for best director -- one of five genies that went to "Crash."<br> The best picture award went to John Greyson's "Lilies."
<hr>
<b>Jagged Little Pill</b><p>
Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill" appears to be the juggernaut of the 90's. The Recording Industry Association of America reports the album has sold 14-million copies, averaging sales of one-million a month. That's enough to make it one of the three best-selling albums of the 90's, up there with Hootie and the Blowfish's "Cracked Rear View" and the soundtrack to "The Bodyguard."
<hr>
<b>Ancaster / Broadway</b><p>
The Ancaster Arts Council goes broadway once again with its fourth annual community musical.<br> "The Magic of Broadway," with a cast of over 60, taps into the blockbuster shows ...."Phantom" ...."Evita".... "Les Miz" ...."Guys and Dolls"....and "West Side Story" among others.<br> Proceeds from ticket sales are donated to community programs.<br> "The Magic of Broadway" runs tonight through Saturday at the Ancaster High School auditorium.

<b>Supercity Update</b><p>
Some say it's just another stalling tactic. Others say it's an essential delay to allow more public consultation. <br>   Either way, Hamilton city council voted last night to wait two more weeks before making a final decision on the proposal to merge Hamilton- Wentworth's six municipalities into one supercity. Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>Several members of Hamilton city council came to the meeting ready to vote, especially because municipal jobs are on the line.  <br>Even some who oppose the plan, are anxious to get on with the vote.  <br>In the end, council voted to delay the final vote for two more weeks.  </i>
<hr>
<b>St. Liz Inquest 5</b><p>
Dining room food routinely recycled. Mouldy juice bottles often refilled ...just some of the disturbing testimony coming out of a coroner's inquest looking into deaths at a a Hamilton home for seniors. Dwight Ryan has more.
<i><br>  Letitia Jones worked as a health care aide at St. Elizabeth Villa for three years.<br>     During that time, she testified she repeatedlay witnessed incidents of poor patient care.<br>  She told the jury that Sister Elizabeth often refilled milk bags from a bottle.  And that on one occasion curdled milk was served on porridge.  Health care aides refused to serve it to the residents and gave them toast instead.<br>   She said orange juice bottles with black around the edges and mould inside would be refilled.<br>  Soup bowls from the dining room would routinely be emptied back into the pot.<br>   Jones went on to say that Sister Elizabeth mixed mashed potatoes with her bare hands.   And that Louis, a resident who helped in the kitchen would peel carrots, potatoes and onions with his bare hands, despite having an infected finger. <br>  Inquest counsel Angela Paparella asked Letitia Jones if she had ever spoken to Sister Elizabeth about the incidents.  No, she replied, I was scared of her, she yelled at me a couple of times. <br>  In earlier testimony, registered practical nurse Debbie Smith told jury members that Sister Elizabeth had scolded her for calling an ambulance after an elderly woman had fallen and injured her back.<br>  RPN's weren't to call for help without following the correct protocol.<br>  Smith however returned to St. Elizabeth Villa after working in Mississauga for a month.  When the probe into allegations of poor care began, Smith wrote to medical officer of health and the media defending the Villa.<br>  Jury members will tour St. Elizabeth Villa Wednesday afternoon.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Drunk Driving</b><p>
A crackdown on drunk drivers begins later this week, just in time for the Christmas party season. Starting Friday, those who are caught drinking and driving in the province will automatically lose their licences for 90 days. Transportation minister Al Palladini says the new administrative driver's licence suspension program won't totally eliminate drunk driving, but says it will go a long way towards getting drunk drivers off the road. Palladini says he expects up to 200 drivers will lose their licences this weekend alone.
<hr>
<b>Latimer Appeal</b><p>
The Supreme Court of Canada today heard an appeal of Robert Latimer's second-degree murder conviction but reserved judgement. The Wilkie, Saskatchewan farmer wants his confession to killing his daughter thrown out, arguing police violated his constitutional rights. Latimer told police in 1993 he killed his 12-year-old daughter with carbon monoxide to end her suffering from cerebral palsy.<br>   He was given a life sentence in 1994.
<hr>
<b>Baby - Shot</b><p>
Elsewhere in an Ottawa-area courthouse a woman accused of attempting to murder her unborn child goes on trial today. Brenda Drummond is accused of shooting her fetus two days before the boy was born at her townhouse in Carleton Place. Lawyer Lawrence Greenspon will argue that because the infant was in the womb, he was not legally a human being and therefore, there is no victim.
<hr>
<b>Ross Appeal</b><p>
The crown intends to retry the former chief psychologist of the Grandview Training School for Girls on sex-related charges. 63 year-old Dr. Robert Ross was found not guilty of six charges of sexual abuse November 1st, but a Kitchener jury could not agree on 11 other counts. Ross, a criminology professor at the University of Ottawa, originally faced 19 charges ranging from rape to breach of trust.
<hr>
<b>Auditor Report</b><p>
Canada's auditor general warns the public is being put at risk by the prison release program. Denis Desautels says gaps in communication between federal and provincial authorities are letting dangerous criminals loose among the public. In his final report of the year, Desautels says public safety is being compromised by a lack of information sharing on prisoners who are released back into society.
<hr>
<b>OJ Simpson</b><p>
OJ Simpson's wrongful death civil trial is breaking for the American Thanksgiving weekend.  Simpson left the stand yesterday after three days of tough questioning by lawyers for the victims' families. His own lawyer opted not to cross-examine Simpson, but to bring him back when the defence presents its case.
<hr>
<b>Air Bag Dead</b><p>
It was just a minor fender-bender -- but it resulted in the death of a one-year-old girl who was decapitated by an air bag. Police in Boise, Idaho, say the accident in a parking lot triggered the passenger-side air bag in the car being driven by the girl's mother. Air bags have been blamed in the deaths of more than 30 American children in low-speed crashes.
<hr>
<b>Crash Video</b><p>
The final moments of an ill-fated Ethiopian Airliner were captured on video.  A South African couple on their honeymoon in the Comoros Islands witnessed the crash on Saturday  as they sunbathed on the beach and recorded the disaster. At least 120 people died in the crash. The Boeing aircraft was hijacked on a flight from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, and the pilot was ordered to fly to Australia. It crashed just offshore from the tourist beach as onlookers watched in horror.
<hr>
<b>Canadian Air</b><p>
A flurry of last-ditch efforts to keep Canadian Airlines alive is nearing a midnight deadline. The airline wants to know by tonight whether workers will agree to a rescue plan that involves 10-per-cent pay cuts. Two unions say they won't go along with the pay cuts. As far as government support goes, Alberta has expressed its willingness to help, but Ottawa still hasn't.
<hr>
<b>Cancer Connection</b><p>
There's a new service up and running now across Ontario to help cancer patients deal with their disease and its treatment.<br>  Through "Cancer Connection", patients or their caregivers are matched up anonymously with a cancer survivor who's been through a similiar experience.<br>  Their contact is by phone, with the Canadian Cancer Society picking up the tab for any long distance charges.  
<br>  If you have cancer and want to hear from someone who shares your experience, or if you're a cancer survivor who'd like to help, you can call "Cancer Connection" toll free at 1-800-263-6750.
<hr>
<b>Election Law</b><p>
Pending senate approval, the next federal election campaign will be shorter and cheaper than in years past. The commons has given final approval to amendments to the Elections Act that would include setting up a permanent voters' list, eliminating the need for enumerators. A campaign could last as little as 36 days, and polls would close at roughly the same time across the country.
<hr>
<b>Phone Hike</b><p>
Local phone bills are on the rise for three-million Bell Canada customers.  The CRTC has approved a rate increase for customers in small- and medium-sized towns in Ontario and Quebec. Rates will rise next month by up to four-dollars.  In return, rural customers will have access to digital services, like call-waiting, late next year.
<hr>
<b>Opera Hamilton</b><p>
An operatic leading light is headlining in Hamilton this week.<br>  He's the internationally acclaimed baritone Allan Monk.<br>  The Calgary native, a regular with the Metropolitan Opera for thirty years, has performed in Hamilton on many occasions....this time in the Opera Hamilton production of Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte."           <br>  Performances of "Cosi Fan Tutte" continue Thursday and Saturday at Hamilton Place.

<b>Doctor Protest</b><p>
Starting next Monday, it may be hard trying to get an after-hours appointment with your family doctor. That's the day thousands of Ontario's doctors are being asked by the Coalition of Family Physicians to stop booking evening and weekend appointments. The move means more after-hours clinics will likely close their doors. It is the latest escalation in the dispute between doctors and the province over cutbacks to the health-care system. On November 8th, many doctors stopped taking on new patients and some surgeons have refused to book elective surgeries.
<hr>
<b>Witmer WCB</b><p>
The provincial government will cut benefits to injured workers under legislation to be introduced today. The proposed law, to replace the Workers Compensation Act, would slash benefits by five percentage points to 85 per cent of pre-injury earnings. Labor minister Elizabeth Witmer says the aim is to make the system more cost effective. New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland have cut benefits to injured workers in recent years. The law would also make people return to work earlier and tighten eligibility rules.
<hr>
<b>Rent Study</b><p>
A private research study suggests that a growing number of people who rent rather than own their own home, may be forced on the streets, because of the Harris government's loosening of rent controls. The study indicates a growing number of people are having trouble making the rent.
<hr>
<b>Supercity Forum</b><p>
A public meeting on the concept of a supercity in Hamilton Wentworth drew a less than enthusiastic response from residents of Hamilton last night. The city hall meeting attracted fifty people. And of that number less than half expressed an opinion.  Some of those present had already been involved with the municipal reform process... four people said they were in favour of a supercity, 14 were opposed. Many of them wanted a referendum. Hamilton city council will likely vote on the new single tier structure at a special council meeting on Friday, although some expect fireworks in the council chambers tonight over the megacity proposal at the city's regularly scheduled meeting.
<hr>
<b>Ont. Immigration</b><p>
A federal study confirms that Ontario gets the lion's share of immigrants to Canada.<br>   More than half the 1.5-million immigrants who arrived in the past six years settled in Ontario -- most of them in Toronto. British Columbia was the second favorite arrival spot, taking in 20 per cent of immigrants, while Quebec absorbed 12 per cent. Virtually none went to Saskatchewan and only two per cent went to the atlantic provinces.
<hr>
<b>Babysitter Killed</b><p>
Winnipeg police say an eight-year-old boy who shot and killed his 13-year-old babysitter is too young to be charged. But his parents aren't. Possible charges include unsafe storage of firearms, possession of a prohibited weapon or causing death by criminal negligence. Police say the shooting of the 13-year-old girl by her eight-year-old cousin was no accident. Crystal Ducharme was babysitting the boy Saturday when police say they got into a fight. They say the boy fired a shotgun at Ducharme as she hid behind a bathroom door -- killing her.
<hr>
<b>Karla Parole</b><p>
In spite of being eligible for day parole on January 6th, Karla Homolka has shown no signs of wanting to get out of prison.<br>  Homolka is serving a 12-year sentence in Kingston's prison for women after being convicted of helping her former husband, Paul Bernardo, kill two teenaged girls. Parole board officials say they have not been contacted by Homolka. They say if she does approach them, it would be at least five months before her application would come up for a hearing. Another important date for Homolka is july 6th, 1997, when she will have completed one third of her manslaughter sentence in the deaths of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. Under the law she will be automatically eligible for full parole and an automatic parole board hearing at that time -- unless she waives her right to the hearing.
<hr>
<b>Simpson Tuesday</b><p>
The judge in OJ Simpson's civil trial is expected to dismiss a juror today for alleged misconduct. Meantime, Simpson will take the stand again. Yesterday, he denied owning Italian shoes like those he's shown wearing in a 1993 picture. 
<hr>
<b>Sands Blown</b><p>
Talk about going out with a bang. A Las Vegas landmark, the 44-year-old Sands Hotel was demolished this morning to make way for a two billion-dollar resort. This was the third major casino to be destroyed in the past four years. The Sands once showcased the world's leading entertainers.  It was the glamorous playground of top entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford, who collectively became known as the Rat Pack.
<hr>
<b>Candy Stamp</b><p>
Here's an update on a story we told you about yesterday.  John Candy's family says it's too soon to honor the comedian with a stamp.<br>   Lawyer Patrick Duco, who represents the family, says they were honored by the proposal from Canada Post but the family feels his children are still too young. Candy, a founding member of SCTV, was to be one of three Canadian-born Hollywood stars to be honored in a stamp series. But when news leaked, members of Candy's family told Canada Post they hadn't been consulted and wanted the stamp killed. The crown corporation has agreed. Candy, a native of Newmarket, Ontario, died of a heart attack March 4th, 1994. He was 43.

<b>First Snow</b><p>
Old man winter has returned to the golden horseshoe early this year. It wasn't a blizzard but light snow began falling yesterday and didn't let up until the wee hours this morning. Accumulations of a couple of inches are fairly common, and the white stuff will stick around, with more on the way. Cold temperatures and flurries are on tap for most of the week. Salters and sanders were on the job keeping highways and main thorourfares clear, but many sidestreets are still snowcovered, or slushy. Driving conditions led to a number of accidents on area roads, although no serious injuries have been reported. While it was a gentle reminder winter is on the way, many Hamiltonians were caught off guard when they woke up this morning.
<hr>
<b>Grey Cup Winner</b><p>
Doug Flutie conquered blowing snow, swirling winds and the CFL's top defence to lead Toronto to an exciting 43-37 Grey Cup victory over Edmonton. Flutie was 22 of 35 for 302 yards. He also rushed for a game high 98 yards and a touchdown.  He was named top player of the game. Kicking was a decisive factor in the Argonauts' Grey Cup win over the Eskimos. The Argos' Mike Vanderjagt was five-for-five on field-goal attempts, while Edmonton's Sean Fleming went 0-for-3. Vanderjagt was picked top Canadian in the Grey Cup. 
<hr>
<b>Foster Newser</b><p>
A man cleared of being a savage sexual predator is accusing police of browbeating him into an early morning confession. 23 year-old Jeremy Foster, of Thornhill, says he got nothing to eat and was denied sleep after his arrest. He was taken in at 9 p-m on November 16th, and finally confessed the next morning at eight o'clock. He says he decided that was the only way he was going to get to see a lawyer. Foster was accused of two knifepoint sexual assaults and held in custody for almost a week until he was cleared by DNA tests.
<hr>
<b>Bouchard Results</b><p>
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard walked out of a three-day policy convention with a mandate to give the Parti Quebecois a new look. After receiving a less than resounding leadership mandate, Bouchard insisted his party is going to change. Hardliners went to the meeting wanting a return to unilingual french commercial signs. But that motion was rejected, and Bouchard demanded a more tolerant approach would pave the way to a sovereigntist win in the next referendum.
<hr>
<b>Quebec - Terrorist</b><p>
 Meanwhile,  there are reports the Quebec government has a former FLQ terrorist in its midst. The Montreal Gazette reports Gaeten Desrosiers is an associate deputy minister in the department responsible for greater Montreal. In 1967, Desrosiers testified that a year earlier, he delivered the bomb to a shoe factory that killed a 64-year-old woman. The Gazette says two years ago, the Parti Quebecois put Desrosiers on a three-year contract -- at 91-thousand dollars a year.
<hr>
<b>Simpson Monday</b><p>
OJ Simpson returns to the stand today at his civil trial in Santa Monica, California. On Friday, he answered scores of questions about his fights with Nicole Simpson, and denied killing her and her friend. Today, plaintiff lawyer Daniel Petrocelli is expected to grill Simpson on what he was doing during and around the time of the murders. 
<hr>
<b>Apec Meeting</b><p>
It accounts for 40 per cent of global trade, and this morning, Apec leaders vowed to make the pacific rim region a giant free-trade zone. Prime minister Chretien sat down with 17 other world leaders in the Philippines for a pacific rim economic summit. Their communique promises the nations will take concrete steps toward transforming the region into the world's largest free-trade zone by the year 2020.
<hr>
<b>Ethiopia Update</b><p>
A section of the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed Saturday in the Indian Ocean was hauled onto the beach today. As the chunk of fuselage was brought ashore, bodies could be seen dangling from the seats they were strapped into. The hijacked plane ran out of fuel off the coast of East Africa and ditched into the sea. Only 52 of the 175 passengers and crew survived.
<hr>
<b>Canadian Airlines</b><p>
Transport minister David Anderson will head up restructuring talks today with Canadian Airlines in Richmond, B.C. Anderson has said Ottawa would consider helping the cash-strapped carrier if it reaches an agreement with its unions to save itself. The airline says it needs its 16-thousand employees to take a 10-per-cent wage cut to avoid bankruptcy.
<hr>
<b>Manpower Survey</b><p>
There may be some good news on the employment front in Canada. Manpower Temporary Services polled 16-hundred Canadian businesses on their hiring plans for the first three months of next year. Sixty-eight per cent expect to keep staff levels even, while 14 per cent plan to hire employees. However, another 14 per cent admit jobs will be cut.
<hr>
<b>Candy Stamp</b><p>
Johnny LaRue would be proud. Canada Post will deliver "Candy" next year. The late John Candy will be featured on a 1997 postage stamp honoring Canadian-born Hollywood stars. The Toronto-born actor-comedian died in March 1994 at the age of 43.

<b>Bus Vote</b><p>
The buses could be rolling in Hamilton in time for Grey Cup Sunday. The city's transit workers are voting on a tentative agreement today. More than 600 drivers, mechanics and inspectors have been on strike since last weekend, in a contract dispute that centres on job security. They've been without a contract since March.  A marathon bargaining session produced results yesterday with the announcement of the tentative pact. Aside from the out of towners looking for transit to the big game on Sunday, some 60 thousand daily users of public transit in the Hamilton region will be looking to board the buses that have been idled all week.
<hr>
<b>Meningitis Shots</b><p>
 Some 16 hundred Hamilton high school students will get the point today...not in classroom studies, but via the business end of a hypodermic needle. The St. Thomas More teenagers will be immunized against meningitis because regional health authorities now realize that two students who became ill earlier this month did indeed both have the same vaccine preventable strain of meningitis. Shots will also be given to children attending a day care centre attached to the school. Health officials say Grey Cup visitors have nothing to fear, because the general public is not at risk.
<hr>
<b>Back to Casics</b><p>
Ontario's education minister is promising to reform the province's elementary school system. And John Snobelen says the emphasis will be on the basics -- reading, writing, spelling, grammar, math, science, geography and Canadian history. The first phase of a new curriculum is to be implemented next September, with the rest brought in over the next five years. Provincewide testing is also on the way, as are standard report cards. Snobelen vows to improve the quality of education in Ontario and to make the system more accountable to parents.
<hr>
<b>Jobs Recut</b><p>
Meanwhile, many young people in school today are fearful about their futures. They wonder if there is a job for them waiting in the Canadian workforce. Schools are having to prepare your children for what lies ahead.
<hr>
<b>Boater Search</b><p>
A search resumed today for two boaters who were reported missing late Thursday after they set out on the Niagara River from Chippawa. Police said the 66-year-old man and 15-year-old boy had planned a short trip in a 4.5-metre aluminum boat. No names were released. A search late Thursday by volunteers from the Chippawa division of the Niagara Falls Fire Department failed to turn up any clues. The New York State Parks Police, U.S. Coast Guard, Niagara Region Police and a helicopter from CFB Trenton were also called in for the search.
<hr>
<b>Mahaffy Split</b><p>
The parents of one of Paul Bernardo's murder victims are separating, saying the strain of losing their daughter has been too much to handle.  Debbie Mahaffy says she and her husband Dan are ending their marriage after five years of trying to cope with the torture death of 14-year-old Leslie.  The Burlington girl and 15-year-old Kristen French were murdered by Bernardo and his ex-wife Karla Homolka.
<hr>
<b>Simpson </b><p>
OJ Simpson today will finally get to tell his story -- from the witness stand.  For the first time, Simpson will offer a Santa Monica jury his answers to such key questions as what was he doing during the June 1994 murders of his ex-wife and her friend, and how he cut his hands. 
<hr>
<b>Aussie Sentenced</b><p>
A judge in Australia handed down 35 life terms to a man who pleaded guilty to murdering 35 people last April. During his trial, 29-year-old Martin Bryant was described as sane, but with a severe personality disorder. The judge ordered that Bryant never be eligible for parole. The shooting rampage occurred at a tourist spot in Tasmania.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Out</b><p>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin has left a Moscow-area clinic to continue recovering in a government rest home. Wearing a fur hat and long dark coat, Yeltsin waved cheerfully as he took a limo ride to Barvikha Sanatorium. The 65-year-old leader is said to be making steady progress after his November 5th quintuple bypass. Doctors have warned him against taking things too fast.
<hr>
<b>Teresa In</b><p>
Mother Teresa is back in the hospital for an irregular heart beat. Doctors in Calcutta says she was admitted today with acute left-ventricular failure and is in stable condition. Her doctor says the 86-year old Nobel Peace Laureate is comfortable, conscious, and breathing on her own. Mother Teresa was in hospital twice earlier this year, for malaria, irregular heart beat and respiratory problems.
<hr>
<b>JFK Film</b><p>
A never-seen-before film of John Kennedy's last days 33 years ago is now public. It shows the former U.S. president and his wife being mobbed by Texas well-wishers the day before he was killed in Dallas. The film was filmed by a Kennedy aide. It shows the Kennedys driving down streets in an open convertible and people running up to shake hands and pat the president's back. The film runs out just moments before the 1963 shooting in Dallas. The pictures were released by the review board looking into Kennedy's assassination. One analyst says they are interesting for what they reveal about security at the time.

<hr>
<b>Bus Deal</b><p>
The slowdown in steeltown could be over before the Argos and the Esks take the field for the Grey Cup showdown.  After more than 16 hours of mediated talks at the Burlington Holiday Inn, a tentative contract was hammered out this morning between striking Hamilton Street Railway drivers and mechanics and the region. Talks continue to try to find a settlement for the hsr's inside workers who also are on strike. The five day old job action has shut down bus service for some 60 thousand regular public transit users in the Hamilton Wentworth region. Local 107 of the Amalgamated Transit Union will vote on the deal tomorrow, they could be back behind the wheel on Saturday.
<hr>
<b>Festival Closures</b><p>
And just a reminder that with all the Grey Cup festivities taking place in Hamilton,  a section of the downtown core has been shut down, right through the weekend.<br>  King Street is closed from James to Bay Streets for the Grey Cup festival. And it won't re-open until 3 o'clock Monday morning.<br>  McNab Street is also closed to accomodate another tent for the festival.
<hr>
<b>403 Lane Closure</b><p>
And Grey Cup organizers have a bone to pick with the Ministry of Transportation.<br> Anybody coming into Hamilton from out of town for any of the festivities will likely be treated to traffic backups due to lane restrictions on Highway 403 between the Highway 6 north cutoff and the Main Street East ramp. Transport ministry crews are busy putting up concrete barriers and high mast lighting, upgrading pavement, and repairing bridges and guard rails.<br> The bottleneck will be there until next summer, and Grey Cup officials are wondering out loud why a project this size couldn't have been postponed for a few days.
<hr>
<b>Kenilworth Open</b><p>
But there is some good news for motorists in Hamilton.  After being closed since last Tuesday, the down bound lanes of the Kenilworth Access were re-opened this morning.  The main mountain access in the city of Hamilton has been under construction after a retaining wall gave way.<br> The up bound lanes should be cleared for traffic later in the day.
<hr>
<b>Derry Death</b><p>
One person is dead after a car slid under a tractor-trailer and burst into flames outside of Milton.<br> The truck had been carrying a load of seat-belts to the Ford plant in Oakville when it collided with the car at Trafalgar and Derry Roads.<br> The resulting fire engulfed both vehicles.<br> The body of the car's driver was trapped inside the smoldering wreck. The victim's identity has not been released.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Aid</b><p>
Paul Bernardo has been told he can't get legal aid for his appeal.<br> But officials with Ontario's legal aid program won't say why his request was rejected.<br> Bernardo has been attempting to appeal his convictions for first-degree murder, sexual assault and other crimes in the deaths of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. The legal aid money would have paid for Bernardo's lawyer and research for his case. Bernardo has now applied for an "inmate appeal," which doesn't require a lawyer and doesn't take place before a full court.
<hr>
<b>Glancaster - Booze</b><p>
A stolen tractor trailor loaded with rye whisky has been found, empty, in Mount Hope.<br> The rig had been reported stolen from Simcoe Tuesday night.<br> Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police found the trailor, abandoned on Airport Road.<br> Anyone with information on the stolen booze is asked to call Crime Stoppers.
<hr>
<b>Cops Cleared</b><p>
Niagara Regional Police officers have been cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of a man found hanging in his cell.<br> The special investigations unit has wrapped up its probe into the death of Donald Yacura.<br> He was arrested last March 27th, and had to be treated for a gash to his head after struggling with officers.<br> Yacura was placed in a holding cell in Grimsby, but later moved to a St. Catharines lockup.
<hr>
<b>School Ruling</b><p>
A group of religious minorities has lost a 10-year fight to receive provincial funding for their schools.<br> The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against them today.<br> The case was brought by the Ontario Alliance of Christian Schools, the Canadian Jewish Congress and a multi-faith coalition.<br> They had argued that freedom of religion includes the right of parents to educate their children according to their beliefs.
<hr>
<b>Native Commish</b><p>
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Affairs says aboriginals need a new deal, including new lands and real self-government.<br> Otherwise, it warns native people might turn to violence.<br> The five-volume report, put together at a cost of 52-million dollars and two years past its deadline, warns aboriginals have made it clear they will no longer sit quietly by.<br> It says some leaders feel violence could come from ignoring long-held grievances.<br> The commission calls for an extra-two billion dollars to be added to the six billion spent annually by the federal and provincial governments to improve housing, health an employment.<br> The commission also calls for an aboriginal parliament.
<hr>
<b>Tobacco Update</b><p>
Federal health minister David Dingwall has changed his mind -- and won't table his anti-tobacco bill today.<br>   He says it still needs some work. There are suggestions dingwall was pressured by Quebec MP's who met with sports and cultural groups fearful of losing their tobacco company sponsorship.
<hr>
<b>Boxing Day</b><p>
The province has taken steps to legalize store openings the day after Christmas. A retailing association predicts most merchants are likely to take advantage of the new rule.<br> However, the province's top labor group condemns the move as another blow to working people under the Tory government.<br> The Ontario Federation of Labor, says if the government had its way, people would work on Christmas Day, too.<br> Under the proposed law, workers could refuse to work Boxing Day.
<hr>
<b>Rent Control</b><p>
The Ontario government tables its rent-control legislation today.<br> It will make it easier for landlords to raise rents that are below market value. Housing minister Al Leach says current rules have led to a near-freeze in rental-housing construction.<br> Critics complain the new rules will lead to dramatically higher rents.
<hr>
<b>Rico Explosion</b><p>
Turning to international news.  An explosion at a suburban shoe store in Puerto Rico killed at least 15 people and injured 50 today. Police said leaking natural gas may have been the cause. The early morning explosion destroyed much of a six-storey building housing the store, leaving a tangle of concrete and steel beams.<br> Firefighters searched through the rubble for other victims and police sealed off the site. Nearby buildings also were damaged.
<hr>
<b>Fire Update</b><p>
At least 39 people were killed and 80 injured in the worst fire to hit Hong Kong in almost four decades.<br> Most victims were found between the 13th and 15th floors of the 16-storey downtown high rise.<br> One firefighter died after falling into an elevator shaft.<br> The blaze burned for 21 hours before firefighters were able to bring it under control today.
<hr>
<b>Chunnel Fire</b><p>
The fire-damaged Channel Tunnel reopened for limited business after Monday's fire on a truck transporter train.<br> The folks who run the Chunnel have given the green light for six freight trains to traverse the tunnel every 90 minutes.<br> Passenger and shuttle trains carrying cars and their passengers might be rolling again before the end of the week.<br> There's no indication of when shuttle trains carrying cargo trucks might resume service.
<hr>
<b>Britain Subway</b><p>
London's Subway system was paralysed by a power failure for two-and-a-half hours.<br> Thousands of passengers were stranded in tunnels and stations last night.<br> Once power was restored just after midnight, trains pulled into the next station where passengers disembarked.<br> Most had to find their way home by other means because most public transit shuts down overnight.<br> Central London was packed with bewildered tourists and residents faced with long waits for buses and taxis.
<hr>
<b>Math Update</b><p>
Back home, education minister John Snobelen says math and science classes in Ontario are boring.<br> He says that's part of the reason why Ontario grade 7 and 8 students received average scores in an international study of math and science testing.<br> Alberta and B.C. scored much higher than Ontario in both categories.<br> Snobelen says Ontario students are "part of the Nintendo generation," and it's about time they were educated with the proper tools.
<hr>
<b>QM School</b><p>
It was a evening of celebration and dedication at Queen Mary School in Hamilton last night. With the cutting of the ribbon Queen Mary School was officially reopened.<br> The original school was built in 1913.<br> Two years ago the old school was demolished to make room for the new facility. Parents, staff and students packed the school's gymnasium last night for the ceremony that included elected and non elected school board officials.<br> Taking in the special event was 91-year-old Helen Mepham who attended Queen Mary School when it opened 83 years ago.<br> Helen Mepham's three great granddaughters are now students at Queen Mary School.

<b>Transit Recut</b><p>
Public transit users in Hamilton Wentworth are sitting on pins and needles today. This as mediated talks go on in the four day old transit strike, which has crippled bus service in the region.  <br> 600 bus drivers, inspectors and mechanics with the Hamilton Street Railway walked off the job on the weekend. Union members rejected the company's final offer, which included a $1,000 signing bonus and a partial pension payment holiday. Job security remains the stumbling block. Both sides seem to agree that if those talks in Burlington today don't bring some quick results, this strike could be a long one. That has led to the suggestion that perhaps the HSR might be better off, in private hands. And some public transporation analysts say that is the way of the future in many communities.
<hr>
<b>Festival Closures</b><p>
And to add to the traffic problems in Hamilton, a section of the downtown core will be shut down, starting tomorrow for Grey Cup weekend.<br>  King Street will be closed from James to Bay Streets for the Grey Cup festival.<br>  The closure begins at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, and continues until 3 o'clock Monday morning.<br>  McNab Street will also be closed to accomodate another tent for the festival.
<hr>
<b>Supercity Region</b><p>
There's a chance the citizens of Hamilton Wentworth might be given a say in the supercity deal amalgamating Hamilton and the five outlying communites. Last night Hamilton Wentworth Regional council agreed to debate the merits of holding a region wide referendum. That discussion will take place in two weeks. Flamborough and Dundas oppose the supercity concept. The mayor of Flamborough senses support for the deal is falling apart.
<hr>
<b>Fire Master Plan</b><p>
Hamilton firefighters are concerned that further funding cuts could put city residents at risk.<br>  Mike Murphy reports the firefighters are warning that some money could be saved...but at the cost of lives.
<i><br>  So many firefighters turned out to sound the alarm over potential budget cuts ...they had to find a bigger room.<br>  Then...the firefighters warned a committee of Hamilton council that major cuts in service and manpower could be disastrous.<br>  Their concerns surround Hamilton's master fire plan.<br>  A plan that lays out potential scenerios which could see up to 60 of 440 firefighters lose their jobs..and budget cuts of up to 3 million dollars<br>  Already the city has downsized the fire department. There are fewer vehicles on the road.<br>  And fewer firefighters to pull trapped motorists out of cars.<br>  This alderman says he'll fight any further cuts.<br>  The new fire master plan will be hotly debated when it comes back to the politicians for action early next month<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Tobacco Tax</b><p>
It's going to cost more to buy a pack of cigarettes. CTV News reports the federal government will unveil legislation tomorrow that would boost federal tobacco taxes by 60 cents a carton. And it says five provinces -- Ontario, Quebec and the maritimes -- are prepared to follow suit. That would raise the cost by 15 cents a pack in those provinces, and seven-and-a-half cents everywhere else. Meanwhile, smoking in a home with young children has been equated to child abuse. An Ontario Medical Association report suggests the government should consider banning tobacco use in homes where pregnant women or young children are present.
<hr>
<b>Plane Collision</b><p>
Turning to international news, investigators are studying a fiery runway collision in Illinois that killed all 14 people aboard the two planes involved. The crash occurred when a United Express commuter flight landing at the airport struck a smaller plane that was taking off. The commuter flight was carrying two crew and 10 passengers, and the smaller plane had two people on board.
<hr>
<b>Hong Kong Fire</b><p>
Scores of people were injured when fire broke out in a building in a densely-populated district of Hong Kong today. Ambulances took 68 people to hospital after the blaze broke out in a 16-storey commercial and office building. Flames erupted in the lower floors but spread quickly via the elevator shaft to sweep through to the top three floors. There's no word on fatalities but people were seen clinging to windows and then falling. Helicopters were called in to pluck a number of fire victims from the upper floors and roof of the flame ravaged structure.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Pics</b><p>
Russian state television broadcast the first images of president Boris Yeltsin today, since his heart operation earlier this month. Yeltsin was shown smiling and walking alongside his wife, Naina, daughter Tatyana and granddaughter, Masha, in the Kremlin central hospital garden, where he is recovering from his multiple heart-bypass operation on November 5.  Yeltsin could be transferred on Thursday or Friday to his official rest home just west of Moscow. Since Mr. Yeltsin's quintuple heart-bypass operation the Kremlin has stressed that the Russian leader is recovering better than expected. However his address to the nation that was to have made last Friday was postponed.
<hr>
<b>Canada - Zaire</b><p>
Rwanda says foreign soldiers are not wanted or needed in central Africa. That is putting the future of any Canadian-led international mission in doubt. Countries involved in the rescue effort will hold several meetings this week to debate whether to send over a military force. Aid agencies insist the mission should go ahead. They say that while one-half-million refugees have returned home to Rwanda, there are still one-half-million more in Zaire in need of help. An advance team of Canadian soldiers remains in Uganda, with nothing to do as they await the results of the diplomatic meetings.
<hr>
<b>Haiti - Canada</b><p>
Canada will likely stay in Haiti longer than planned -- again. For the second time, Canada is expected to extend its peacekeeping and training mission beyond November 30th. Haiti's president hopes the U.N. will stay through July. Canada has 700 soldiers and 100 mounties in Haiti helping to reform its legislative and justice systems.
<hr>
<b>Mini - Vans</b><p>
If you're considering buying a minivan you might want to consider this information.  The Ford Windstar minivan outperformed eight competitors in protecting occupants in crash tests. The tests were done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the U.S.  The poorest performer was the Pontiac Trans Sport, with its massive collapse of the passenger compartment. The Institute says minivans generally have good on-the-road crash experience, being large and usually driven by low-risk drivers.
<hr>
<b>Pam Lee Divorce</b><p>
It's splitsville for B.C. native Pamela Anderson Lee and Tommy Lee. The "Baywatch" star filed for divorce from her rocker husband yesterday in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. The Lees, who have each others' names tattooed on their ring fingers, married 21 months ago after a four-day courtship.  They have a five-month-old son.  Tommy Lee was previously married to actress Heather Locklear.

<b>Transit Tuesday</b><p>
An attempt to kick-start stalled talks between transit workers and Hamilton Wentworth regional officials is underway.   It's day three of the transit strike with time ticking away before thousands of people pour into steeltown for the Grey Cup. More than 600 bus drivers, inspectors and mechanics with the Hamilton Street Railway walked off the job on the weekend. Union members voted yesterday against accepting the company's final offer, which included a $1,000 signing bonus and a partial pension payment holiday. Job security remains the stumbling block. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Grey Cup Committee is doing some damage control. With the championship Canadian Football League game set for Sunday, the committee is stressing that it's business as usual and has arranged for five park-and-ride locations throughout the city. A private company will provide the service and the union has agreed not to disrupt it.
<hr>
<b>Leach re: Supercity</b><p>
Look out Ontario ... the supercity is likely the way of the future ... Hamilton- Wentworth Region's proposal for becoming a supercity was given thumbs up by the provincial government yesterday.<br> Municipal affairs minister Al Leach has announced his endorsesment of the plan which was brokered through provincial mediator Gardner Church. He also wants all councils involved to complete deliberations on the plan quickly so that the new structure can be in place for the 1997 elections.
<hr>
<b>Dundas Says No</b><p>
But instead of moving towards unanimity, the town of Dundas is actively working to ensure it's not part of a supercity in Hamilton Wentworth. An ad campaign will help spread the anti-super city message and a call for a referendum is likely to be presented to regional council tonight. As Ian Dovey reports last night Dundas council voted unamimously against the mega municipal concept and to advise the province of its desire to remain an independent town.                                     
<I><br>  It's not the first time Dundas has threatened to withdraw from the region,  as this copy of an 1859 separation bylaw infront of Dundas Town Hall states. <br>There wasn't much to discuss, the vote was unamimous Dundas wants to remain distinct and independent from any unified municipal structure. <br>    Mayor Addison has been a strong critic to the process that lead to unified government concept for Hamilton Wentworth telling his council and the public it the least democratic he's ever witnessed.<br>   The mayor had no problems gaining councils support to go it alone. <br>   Addison says he'll now try to persuade the other outlying councils to do the same. <br>    </I>
<hr>
<b>P.E.I. elex</b><p>
While Dundas was saying no to amalgation, Prince Edward Island voters were rejecting their government. There's no such thing as "Milligan's Island" anymore. PEI premier Keith Milligan and his Liberals have been swept from power. Pat Binns' Tories won yesterday's election, taking 18 of 27 seats for a majority government.
<hr>
<b>Inflation Rate</b><p>
Higher energy and food prices pushed last month's inflation rate to its highest level since November 1995.<br>   Statistics Canada says year-over-year inflation climbed to 1.8 per cent, up from the 1.5 per cent rate for September.<br>   Costs were also higher for new vehicles, post-secondary education and telephone service. But homeowners spent considerably less on mortgage interest rates.
<hr>
<b>Bankruptcies</b><p>
More disturbing economic news. Bankruptcies among consumers and businesses continued at record pace in September. There were 69-thousand failures in the first nine months of the year, up more than 20 per cent from the previous high of 57-thousand in the same period of 1995. Ontario and Quebec consumers were hard hit in September, each with 26-hundred failures.
<hr>
<b>Help Wanted</b><p>
It wasn't supposed to be this way. The economy is growing but more Canadians are either out of work or worried about keeping the job they now have. Many Canadians are wondering where have all the jobs gone?
<hr>
<b>Weeping Icon</b><p>
The jury is still out on whether it's a miracle, but Toronto police say there's no evidence of fraud in claims of a weeping icon in a tiny church.<br> Detective Arthur Locker says there's no proof of any financial gain by those involved with a Greek orthodox church in suburban East York.<br> The icon, a copy of a 12 hundred-year-old painting of the Virgin Mary, allegedly began weeping last August.<br> Large amounts of cash were donated when reports of the icon became public.<br> Fears were raised when it was discovered that the church pastor was excommunicated for once working in a brothel.
<hr>
<b>Video Gambling</b><p>
Ontario has become the ninth province to legalize video lottery gambling. The Conservative government passed legislation yesterday to allow 20-thousand machines at racetracks and permanent charity casino sites, on a trial basis. The government, which says it is devoted to curbing profiteering from illegal gambling devices, is expected to rake in between 300- to 400-million dollars a year.
<hr>
<b>Chunnel Fire</b><p>
Turning to international news.  A fire deep inside the tunnel that runs beneath the English Channel has left 34 people injured, most with smoke inhalation. The blaze broke out last night onboard a truck being hauled on a freight shuttle using the tunnel, better known as the Chunnel. The fire scene was about 20 kilometres from the French end of the 51-kilometre-long tunnel. The tunnel has been shut down because of the fire and it is not known when it will re-open.
<hr>
<b>U.S. Zaire</b><p>
The future of the Canadian led aid mission to Zaire remains in doubt. This after the Clinton administration announced plans to scale back its plans to send a large military force to Central Africa. American officials say the administration is still considering whether to send a smaller contingent of troops to aid relief efforts along the border of Zaire and Rwanda. Military planners and diplomats from more than one-dozen nations, including Canada, will meet Thursday in Stuttgart, Germany to discuss their options.
<hr>
<b>Ghali Vote</b><p>
The United Nations says the United States has vetoed a second term for Boutros Boutros-Ghali as U.N. secretary general. All 14 other security council members voted for a resolution recommending the 74-year-old Egyptian diplomat for election by the general assembly. The veto may open the way for other candidates to enter the race for a five-year term as secretary-general beginning January 1, 1997.
<hr>
<b>Pope Castro</b><p>
Pope John Paul has accepted Fidel Castro's invitation to visit Cuba. The two met at the Vatican this morning. It was the first encounter between the two men. Before the meeting, the Cuban leader said he was bringing the Pope a message of friendship. Cuba is the only Latin American country the Pope has not visited. A date for the papal visit has not been set.
<hr>
<b>Israel Beating</b><p>
Israel's border police arrested two officers after they were caught on video beating and kicking a group of Palestinians. The video shows the troops apparently unaware of an amateur Palestinian cameraman nearby as they attacked the six arab men. One officer kicked a man in the head and the footage also shows the Israelis apparently forcing the Palestinians to do push-ups. a passerby who stops to ask questions is smacked in the face.

<b>HSR Strike </b><p>
Thousands of people who depend on public transit in Hamilton Wentworth were left to their own devices this morning, as the work week began with no bus service.  <br> The 525 member workforce walked off the job on the weekend... and no new talks to settle the dispute have been scheduled.    As Dwight Ryan reports, regional counsellors and striking workers are both being briefed at this hour on why the strike began.  
<i><br>  The sixty thousand people who rely on public transit in Hamilton were on their own as the work weeek began.<br>  Negotiations between the Amalgamated Transit Workers Union and the HSR's 525 drivers broke off in the early hours of Sunday morning.<br>  Regional chairman Terry Cooke says they were close to an agreement.  <br>    Cooke is now briefing all regional counsellors on the strike, the first in Hamilton since 1982.<br>  A news conference is scheduled to follow.   <br>      Striking HSR wokers in the meantime are at this hour being briefed by the union leadership.<br>  As the strike moves through its second full day, no new talks are scheduled.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Snowstorm</b><p>
At least the weather is fine for walking to work today in Southern Ontario. Pity those who have to travel the Trans-Canada Highway between Kenora and Winnipeg.<br> An intense storm battering the American midwest right up to northwestern Ontario has brought heavy snow and freezing rain to the area. In Kenora, OPP Constable Rob Kobayashi says the amount of snow took them by surprise with more than 70 centimetres falling in the past 24 hours. The Trans-Canada was closed this morning, it should be reopened shortly. No flights are going in or out of Winnipeg's airport and city streets there are clogged with stuck cars. As many as three people died from shovelling snow in Winnipeg.
<hr>
<b>Zaire Update</b><p>
The homecoming of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees from Zaire is prompting a rethinking of an international relief mission. Commander Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril thinks the mission should proceed for the sake of the refugees still in Zaire. He has invited all participating military leaders to meet in Germany later this week to discuss how to proceed with the multinational effort. Baril left Ottawa for Africa last night.
<hr>
<b>Mars Probe Crash</b><p>
They're breathing a sigh of relief down under. Fears that Russia's failed Mars space probe would crash in Australia evaporated last night when pieces of the spacecraft fell into the southern Pacific Ocean west of Chile.  Officials had been concerned about possible nuclear contamination.
<hr>
<b>Russian Explosion</b><p>
The death toll from a weekend explosion at a military block of flats in Russia's southern Dagestan region has risen to more than 40. Officials expect the toll to surpass 50. Eight people are in hospital and about a dozen others are still missing and feared buried in the rubble. Rescuers believe there is a chance of finding some of them alive. The Itar-Tass news agency says the blast might have been gangland revenge over a crackdown on arms and smuggling.
<hr>
<b>Children Shot</b><p>
Police in Laurens, South Carolina are looking for a man after his wife found their four children shot to death in their beds. The victims are a 16-year-old girl and her three brothers, ages 10, 13 and 14 -- and they may have been dead several days. Reports say the mother, Bertha Satterwhite, left the home earlier in the week because of marital problems.
<hr>
<b>Vanderkley Sentenced</b><p>
A Niagara Falls man has been sentenced to three months in jail after killing a police officer in a hit and run mishap last April. This morning 68 year old Frank Vanderkley was sentenced in a St. Catharines Court, and also ordered not to drive for another year and half. Vanderkley struck and killed veteran OPP officer Mike Goula, who was helping another officer with a traffic accident when he was struck by the side of the road in Niagara Falls.
<hr>
<b>Memory Drug</b><p>
There's a new drug that has been shown to restore memory in healthy older men.  American scientists are hoping the drug can do the same for people with alzheimer's. They plan to begin testing it on alzheimer's patients next year.
<hr>
<b>Christmas Shopping</b><p>
And just in case you forgot, there is just over a month until Christmas. And the Retail Council of Canada is expecting a good holiday season. Council vice-president Jill Birch says a survey of store owners suggests they expect sales this year to be better than last year.  Most major stores are decorated for the season and the holiday buying binge has begun.
<hr>
<b>Christmas Dolls</b><p>
Have any of your christmas shopping done yet?<br>  Well often it's not a store-bought gift that's the best idea, but one hand-made with love.<br>  Annette Hamm tells us the story of an elderly Stoney Creek woman who's been busy all year getting ready to spread a few smiles this Christmas.
<i> <br>  The sewing machine is rarely idle at Bea McPherson's Stoney Creek apartment.<br>  88 year old McPherson spends most of the year working her magic for this time of year.<br>  Ahe's putting the finishing touches on a spare bedroom full of dolls hoping for new homes this Christmas.<br>  Bea estimates she's refurbished thousands of second hand dolls since 1941, when her husband asked her to send some Canadian dolls overseas.<br>  Now she does donates her dolls to local charities.  <br>  Picking up remnants throughout the year, with the help of her friend Kathleen Cortolucci, Bea fixes up one doll at a time.   <br>  Each one is given special attention in the hopes it will become someones special doll.  <br>  Bea McPherson's dolls will be available at the Christmas Bazaar at Stoney Creek United Church this Saturday.<br>  </i>

<b>HSR Strike</b><p>
If you use public transit in Hamilton, you might want to start looking for another way to get around town.  A provincial mediator has called Hamilton Street Railway bosses and the drivers' union back to the bargaining table today for a last ditch effort at averting a region wide transit strike. Contract talks broke off Wednesday night with bus drivers and maintenance workers poised to pick up the picket signs. Shutting down the busses in Hamilton Wentworth could create havoc for Grey Cup organizers, school boards and businesses. Education officials are already scrambling to come up with contingency plans for thousands of students who use public transit to get to classes. HSR drivers last hit the bricks in June of 1982, staying off the job for 92 days.
<hr>
<b>Crowd Control</b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police also gearing up for Grey Cup.<br>  Fearing, but not expecting the worse, a special crowd management squad of 40 officers has been preparing for the game and its festivities since January.<br>  Annette Hamm reports.
<i> <br>  The 93 riot in Montreal after the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup.<br>  It's exactly the kind of situation police don't want to see happen in Hamilton Grey Cup weekend.<br>  And this is their insurance.  <br>  Since January, forty officers have been practicing hard tactical manoueuvres, preparing for the very worst Grey Cup weekend may have to offer.  <br>  Police don't know exactly what size crowd they'll be dealing with, but insist they won't be on hand to intimidate them.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Retaining Wall Down</b><p>
Fears for public safety on a Hamilton mountain access now seem well founded.<br>  By this morning, a retaining wall on the Kenilworth access was leaning at a 45 degree angle.<br>  Officials shut down the access Tuesday night after they noticed a buckle in the wall.<br>  A Hamilton firm has started demolishing the wall.<br>  Once it's down, engineers will examine the foundation to find out why the wall failed.<br>  The access is expected to be reopened next Thursday.
<hr>
<b>Postal Problems</b><p>
We could see some mail disruptions early next month. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers is planning a day of protest, to show their anger over Canada Post's withdrawal from the junk mail business. CUPW president Darrell Tingley says Ottawa's order to stop door-to-door flyer delivery will mean the firing of 10-thousand workers.
<hr>
<b>Days of Action</b><p>
Sudbury will be the next target of Labor's Days of Protest. That word comes from CUPE Ontario leader, Sid Ryan. Yesterday Ryan also said North Bay, the riding of Premier Mike Harris, should also be hit before next summer. Union leaders and social activists will meet in Toronto on November 26th. They will discuss future protest plans and ryan says he'll push for Sudbury to be hit as early as February. He also said Thunder Bay and Windsor should also be targets.
<hr>
<b>Serial Rapist</b><p>
Toronto-area police are on the hunt for a savage rapist who struck for a fourth time yesterday. But the latest victim, in her 20's, managed to fend off her attacker by fighting back in the Dufferin-Steeles area. Police say the woman was spun around and thrown to the ground, but was not sexually assaulted. The attack occurred near the scene of the first assault on Sunday. Police say yesterday's victim was threatened with a knife and that the suspect's description matches the rapist sought in the other attacks. All of the attacks occurred within the past five days within an eight kilometre radius.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Cell</b><p>
Officials at Kingston Penitentiary have removed the plexiglass shield around the door of Paul Bernardo's jail cell. The shield was installed after inmates pelted the convicted Ontario sex killer with human waste. But prison officials have taken it down so Bernardo can benefit from heating and ventilation during the winter. Plexiglass will remain around his sleeping area.
<hr>
<b>Meningococcal</b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth health officials are keeping a close watch on the student population of a city high school. Authorities are investigating the occurence of meningococcal disease among grade 11 students at St. Thomas Moore High School. A teenaged girl was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital earlier this week and a male student, suspected of having the disease was admitted to McMaster Medical Centre on Wednesday. There is no apparent link between the two but those in close contact with the two teens are being treated with medication and area health care professionals are on notice. Meningococcal disease is a serious but rare infection which occurs in the blood or lining of the brain.
<hr>
<b>Smoking Rates Up</b><p>
Ontario's chief medical officer says smoking is making a come back -- and it's causing a health "crisis." Dr. Richard Schabas  says governments must take tough action to butt out the crisis, especially among teens.  
<hr>
<b>Zaire Update</b><p>
Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees are trekking through the eastern Zaire town of Goma towards Rwanda today. There are possibly 100-thousand of them, and they may be headed for home. The exodus from two sprawling camps at Mugunga follows heavy fighting between Zairian rebels and Hutu fighters who had controlled the camps. The retreat of the Hutu fighters allowed the refugees to leave the camps. This could be good news for the planned international relief mission, as it could reduce the risk of military intervention. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council meets today to decide whether to authorize a multinational relief mission to help refugees in Zaire. The Canadian-led effort could involve 20-thousand troops from more than one-dozen countries, although the length of its mandate is still up for debate. Defence minister Doug Young says the bill for a six-month mission could hit 100-million dollars -- about one-tenth of his department's budget.
<hr>
<b>Linehan</b><p>
The lives of showbusiness celebrities are an open book, and it seems public interest is focused more on inner secrets rather than their outer image.<br> Brian Linehan has built a career meeting with screen names and emphasizing their positive strengths.<br> Alex Reynolds interviews the man who talks to the stars.
<i> <br>  The Hamilton native combines a photographic memory with meticulous preparation... movie names responding with amazement to little known facts Linehan reveals during sessions.<br>  But it isn't always easy. <br>  Linehan will be back on the home screen with a weekly series beginning in January.<br>  A kick-off special is set for Saturday night on chch-tv.<br>  </i>

<b>Fire Kills Kids</b><p>
The Ontario Fire Marshall continues to look for answers in a Brantford fire that killed two toddlers.   <br> The bodies of three-year-old Samantha Dixon and her two-year-old sister Natalie were found huddled under a bed in an upstairs bedroom yesterday. They were trapped by flames that engulfed their home. Police say the girls' mother noticed smoke in the house and managed to escape next door with her nine-month-old daughter copelyn. But Muriel Dixon was overcome by smoke and flames when she tried to rescue her other daughters.
<hr>
<b>Children Report</b><p>
The Canadian Council on Social Development warns that poverty threatens the health of more than one-million children. And there are dire warnings that the problem will worsen as governments cut funding for social programs.
<hr>
<b>Parents Kill</b><p>
Neighbors said he was a model father. Every morning, Bernard Halpin would help Andrea, his 35-year-old mentally handicapped daughter, into his car and buy her breakfast at a McDonald's Restaurant.<br> But that routine was shattered yesterday when the 75 year old retiree shot Andrea and then took his own life.<br> It's the second such shocking incident in Montreal in two weeks. Last week six-year-old Charles Antoine Blais, an autistic child was drowned in a bathtub. The boy's mother has been charged with first-degree murder.
<hr>
<b>Villa Inquest</b><p>
A former nurse says staff at a Hamilton retirement home created an atmosphere of fear.<br> A coroner's jury was read a letter written by the home's former nursing director in which she describes a long list of alleged abuse and "substandard" care.<br> Helen Demchuk's letter led to the inquest into five of 42 deaths at St. Elizabeth Villa from January 1994 to April of 1995.<br> She wrote it in October 1994 after being fired.<br> Among other things, it accuses staff of sedating new residents and placing others in restraints.<br> It also says residents were abused to the point that one suffered a broken elbow and another received cuts and bruises on his head. The inquest continues today.
<hr>
<b>Quebec Judge</b><p>
A newly-named Quebec judge and former FLQ sympathizer says he's stepping down from the bench temporarily.<br> Richard Therrien was convicted 25 years ago of hiding terrorists involved in the kidnapping and murder of Quebec labor minister Pierre Laporte.<br> Quebec Liberals say Quebec justice minister Paul Bezin should resign for allowing therrien's appointment. But Bezin insists he only learned of it last week, and has complained to the province's Judicial Council and Bar Association.
<hr>
<b>Docs Dicipline</b><p>
The Harris government has failed to stop a protest by Ontario's doctors.<br> The governing body for the doctors has turned down a request by the health minister to discipline physicians who refuse to treat new patients.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Heart Drug</b><p>
Doctors may soon be prescribing something other than an aspirin a day for heart and stroke patients. A Canadian team headed by researchers at Hamilton Civic Hospitals, tested the new blood thinner -- called Clopidogrel, it reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes by one-third, compared with one-quarter for aspirin with milder side effects.  One drawback though -- it'll cost more than aspirin.
<hr>
<b>Zaire Troops</b><p>
Canada sends its first group of soldiers to Zaire today, to lay the groundwork for saving one-million starving refugees.<br> More than two dozen countries have pledged their support and troops for a Canadian-led humanitarian mission.<br> The remainder of Canada's 15-hundred-troop commitment, and those from other countries, won't deploy until after the U.N. security council sanctions the mission.<br> Meanwhile, an American army medical, engineering and security team has arrived and is already in the Rwandan capital, Kigali to assess the situation for a possible large-scale deployment of American personnel.<br> The team, lead by Major General Edward P. Smith, will be based at the U.S. embassy in Kigali and will carry out assessments for material and personnel to open a humanitarian corridor to aid the hundreds of thousands of refugees that have fled recent fighting.
<hr>
<b>Haiti Canada</b><p>
Haiti is asking the U.N. to extend its peacekeeping mission through July.<br> President Rene Preval says Haiti's new police force needs more training, and says it can't be done by November 30th.<br> Twelve-hundred U.N. troops and 300 U.N. civilian police -- mostly Canadian soldiers and mounties -- are in Haiti.<br> The mission has already been extended once.
<hr>
<b>St. Pete's Riot</b><p>
Police in St. Petersburg, Florida say the streets are quiet now. But last night violence erupted after a grand jury cleared a white police officer in a fatal shooting of a black motorist that led to rioting last month.  Two officers received minor gunshot wounds and seven other people were hurt in the unrest overnight.

<hr>
<b>Blaze Recut</b><p>
A house fire in Dundas last evening has claimed the life of a woman.   46 year old Debbie Trafford was pulled from the top floor of a Govenor's Road house soon after firefighters arrived. It is the second fire related death in the valley town in two years, and firefighters are still trying to determine a cause.
<hr>
<b>Thorold Fire</b><p>
 A 72-year-old Thorold woman has succumb to her wounds after being rescued from a house fire. The woman was taken by air ambulance to hospital in Hamilton last night with serious burns to 90 per cent of her body. The fire was contained to a washroom on the lower level of the Cowan Drive home. The cause remains under investigation.
<hr>
<b>QEW Crash</b><p>
Traffic was snarled on the Queen Elizabeth Way at Grimsby for all of the morning commuter rush. A tractor trailer jack-knifed in the Hamilton-bound lanes at Casablanca Boulevard.<br> The westbound lanes were closed and eastbound traffic was reduced to one lane. Despite the rush hour traffic headaches, there were no serious injuries as a result.
<hr>
<b>Kenilworth Access</b><p>
And while one road worry cleared up this morning on the QEW, Hamilton drivers face a week-long hassle on a key mountain access.<br> Last night, the partial collapse of a primary retaining wall forced the closure of the Kenilworth Access.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  This morning, this was about the only traffic moving on Hamilton's Kenilworth Access.<br>  Last night, road crews decided to shut down the mountain access after finding a large buckle in a retaining wall.<br>  Because of the danger of the wall falling down, councillor Terry Anderson, who chairs Hamilton Wentworth's Transportation Services Committee, expects it could be some time before the access reopens.  <br>  The closure created a few traffic tieups at the bottom of the access this morning, mainly by drivers who didn't realize they could get up or down the mountain this way.<br>  Danny Schebesch is a engineering consultant who worked on repairing the neighbouring Sherman Cut back in the 1980's.<br>  He expects similiar remedial action will be needed here.  <br>  It's believed a slow leak from a 40 year old water system on top of the mountain may have caused the crack.<br>  City officials are meeting all day to figure out the best way to repair it.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Doc Decision</b><p>
The College of Physicians and Surgeons decides today on a government request to punish doctors who refuse new patients. Health minister Jim Wilson wants the college to amend its regulations to expand the definition of professional misconduct. If Wilson has his way, even doctors who simply urge others to boycott new patients could be punished. The push to penalize doctors has outraged many physicians involved in the anti-government protest.
<hr>
<b>TTC Sues</b><p>
The Toronto Transit Commission is suing labor leader Sid Ryan for the 1.7-million dollars it lost on the Toronto Days of Action protest last month. The TTC cites the CUPE boss and two other labor organizers in the suit. Ryan calls the lawsuit a joke. He says the real villain is premier Mike Harris, whose cuts have taken millions of dollars out of the transportation system.
<hr>
<b>Supercity - Council</b><p>
 Fireworks in Hamilton last night as some city councillors accused the mayor of trying to pull an end run around council, in the supercity debate: they were angry that a caucus of five council members signed a deal with other Hamilton Wentworth municipalities to drop the region and form a supercity, in closed talks last week.  When the smoke cleared; councillors agreed to put the supercity memorandum of agreement on the next regular council agenda November 26th, for a full debate.
<hr>
<b>India Crash</b><p>
Turning to international news.  The black box flight recorders have been recovered from both planes involved in a fiery crash over India. A Saudi Airways jumbo jet had just left New Delhi when it collided with a Russian-built cargo plane coming in for landing. The crash scattered wreckage and the bodies of about 350 people over a wide area of farmland. No word on the cause of the crash.
<hr>
<b>Mexico Explosion</b><p>
Two people have died of burns suffered in an inferno that has raged for more than three days just outside Mexico City. At least 13 other people were hurt, several critically, in Monday's explosion and fire at a fuel depot. Towering columns of flame continue to light up Mexico City's skyline as thick black smoke billows high into the air. More than five-thousand people have been evacuated.
<hr>
<b>Zaire Relief</b><p>
Prime minister Chretien is challenging world leaders to get off their duffs and do something to help one-million starving refugees in Central Africa. He wants an international military force to ensure food and medicine get into war-torn Zaire. Chretien says he's frustrated by the lack of action, so he's called 16 world leaders himself, and got the support of 10 of them. Canada is willing to lead the mission and send 15-hundred troops to Zaire.
<hr>
<b>Immigration</b><p>
Immigration minister Lucienne Robillard says she has tried to balance compassion with security in clearing a huge backlog of refugees. She has announced plans to grant landed immigrant status to more than 75-hundred Somalis and Afghans over the next four years. They have been stuck in legal limbo because their war-wracked countries could not provide them with any documents to prove who they are. Robillard says to win landed status, the refugees must be in Canada for at least five years, and show they have been good citizens with no criminal records.
<hr>
<b>Peru Quake</b><p>
Many residents in Southern Peru are living outdoors after a powerful earthquake rocked the region. As many as 15 people were killed and 700 people injured when the 6.4 magnitude quake struck. Many homes and buildings are in ruins. Forty to 60 miners remain trapped in an isolated gold mine in the Andes mountains.
<hr>
<b>Who Does What</b><p>
Back home,  the so-called "who does what" panel is recommending the Ontario government pay a bigger share of the cost of education.<br>   Panel chairman David Crombie is recommending that school boards focus their attention on activities that relate directly to students in the classroom. Crombie says that means business functions, like school construction and transportation, can be left to municipalities. The panel is also recommending that the number of school boards be reduced with boards having the same boundaries as counties and regional governments. Meanwhile,  the Association of Municipalities is applauding a recommendation that municipal governments get more control over police services. The panel says municipalities should set police budgets and appoint members of police-services boards. But the association is holding its breath over a suggestion that all municipalities be required to pay for policing.
<hr>
<b>Villa Inquest</b><p>
An inquest into the deaths of nursing home residents in Hamilton has been told there were problems at the St. Elizabeth Villa. The coroner's jury heard yesterday that 42 residents died in just over a year. Former regional coroner Dr. Bonita Porter testified she began an investigation in April 1995 after complaints about food, nursing care, and the use of restraints. The inquest is looking into the deaths of five residents at the home. Porter was the first witness to testify, and said that while reviewing medical charts, she noticed a pattern of problems. Those included problems with admission criteria, monitoring care, availability of resources and residents' injuries.
<hr>
<b>White Rose Robbery</b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police investigating a robbery at the White Rose Nursery outlet on Upper James Street this morning.<br> Details are still coming in ...but it appears that two suspects wearing ski masks and brandishing handguns entered the store around 8:30 this morning and demanded cash.<br> The two fled with a third suspect in a green Ford Mystique.<br>   The license plate of the getaway car had been covered with plastic.<br>   We'll have an update at 5:30.
<hr>
<b>Drug Sting</b><p>
Teenagers and drugs...  despite the many campaigns over the years to tell teenagers to just say no to drugs.. they still do it ... and there are still those who happily sell drugs to teenagers.. as Jamie West reports, Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police are turning up the heat on drug pushers and users in hopes of getting the anti-drug message through to young people.
<i><br>  9am and the Hamilton Wentworth High Enforcement Action Team are getting ready...<br> The six member team changes it's focuss every few months...they've already made a big dent in car thefts,  kept loitering youths off the streets, and are now conducting daily undercover surveillance of 10 high schools, trying to put a damper on drug use...<br>  Education is a big component of the programme,...<br>  So far over 25 arrests...for possesion and trafficking...<br>  And word is getting around that the heat is definitely on...<br>  Marijuana is the drug of choice followed by hasish oil and LSD.<br>  The numbers say less than 5% of students are users on a regular basis, but the percentage of first timers is way up...<br>  Even being where you're not supposed to be will get you in trouble with this team...<br>  Continuing identification arrests, prosecution and effective followup are proving to the community that heat means business.<br>  </i>

<b>Doc Protest</b><p>
The doctors' protest is spreading. <br> Ontario's 450 general surgeons have stopped booking new operations as part of the job action against the Harris government. Doctors are battling with the province over a clawback on their earnings and the right of new doctors to practice where they want. The surgeons say they will perform procedures that were booked before November 8th. But they say they will be joining obstetricians and other specialists by not taking on any new patients. The head of the Association of General Surgeons of Ontario says all elective surgery in Ontario could be shut down within a month.
<hr>
<b>QEW Rollover</b><p>
Motorists on the Queen Elizabeth Way found it a lot less stressful during this morning's rush hour. This after one of Canada's busiest highways was closed for more than half a day.<br> All lanes of the QEW through Burlington were reopened just in time for the morning rush hour.<br> The highway was closed at Burloak Drive around one o'clock yesterday afternoon when a tractor-trailer carrying gasoline flipped onto its side. About one-thousand litres of the truck's 50-thousand-litre load spilled forcing the closure of the busy highway and bringing traffic to a standstill for most of the afternoon and evening, and creating a major traffic headache right into the wee hours of this morning. The tanker truck was moved from the side of the road around 4:30 this morning. Luckily no one was injured.
<hr>
<b>Zaire Canada</b><p>
Canada has offered to lead a multinational force to help end the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire.<br> U.N. secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali confirms Canada is ready to command the force in Zaire and he hopes the U.S. offers logistical support. Boutros Ghali says the size of a force has not been set but experts are speculating between 10-thousand to 12-thousand troops will be needed. 
<hr>
<b>Planes Crash</b><p>
Two planes have collided in flight near New Delhi.<br> Reports say there were no survivors among the 350 people aboard the aircraft.<br> The planes involved were a Saudi Airways 7-47 jumbo jet and a smaller passenger plane from Kazakhstan.<br> The scene of the disaster is a village about 60-kilometres west of New Delhi.
<hr>
<b>Mexico Explosion</b><p>
Hundreds of firefighters are battling to contain a huge blaze at a fuel storage facility just outside Mexico City.<br> Towering flames lit up the night sky nearly 12 hours after a giant storage tank exploded.<br> At least 11 people were hurt and thousands were forced from their homes.<br> Flames rose high in the sky after the initial blast yesterday sparked a fire that quickly spread to a second storage tank.
<hr>
<b>U.S. Snow</b><p>
The threat of heavy snowsqualls has eased across most of southwestern and central Ontario -- except in the Goderich area.<br> About 35 centimetres of lake-effect snow has fallen in the Huron and the southern Grey-Bruce region during the past 24 hours.<br> Forecasters say another 15 centimetres could fall in the area today.<br> That's not the case south of the border. Frigid air feeding off the great lakes has dumped more than 60 centimetres of snow from Wisconsin to New York. The hard-hit Cleveland area already has about 60 centimetres and forecasters expect another 50 today.<br> The snow storm has closed schools, blacked out tens of thousands of homes, and forced communities to open temporary shelters.<br> So far, the pre-winter blast is blamed for eight deaths in Wisconsin and one in Ohio -- most of them traffic related.
<hr>
<b>Video Vote</b><p>
A controversial sex-education video has spawned a new material-review policy, at the Wentworth Board of Education. An animated video that some parents complained was too graphic, prompted the board last night to approved a ten-point program; that will allow school councils the opportunity to view, and approve sex-education videos that may be deemed controversial, by board staff. The new policy was approved by a 6-4 margin ... and was widely applauded, by parents attending the board meeting.
<hr>
<b>GM Strike</b><p>
Strikes against General Motors in Canada and the United States will likely cost the automaker at least 650 million dollars U.S. after taxes in the fourth quarter.<br> GM lowered its fourth-quarter production forecast by 151-thousand vehicles to 1.17 million because of the strikes.<br> Meanwhile, General Motors says strikers who occupied an Oshawa plant for several hours last month did extensive damage.<br> The Canadian Auto Workers Union denies that.<br> The automaker says it doesn't have an exact figure but suggests the repair bill will run into the thousands of dollars.<br> GM spokesman Stew Low says the damage includes tampering with brakes to tractor trailers, severing of hydraulic and pneumatic hoses, and ripped wire doors.<br> About 125 striking workers stormed the plant and occupied it for five hours on October 16th to stop the company from removing machinery.
<hr>
<b>Marvin Caplan</b><p>
Uptown style in a downtown location; was the trade mark of Marvin Caplan, for nearly two decades.<br> The retailer, and Hamilton alderman made a statement with both his wardrobe, and his views on city politics.<br> Later this week; half of that equation, will disappear, as Caplan closes his retail outlet, for the last time.<br> The clothing store that made his name is, he says, a victim of both changing consumer shopping patterns, and the city's failure to react more quickly to the deterioration of the downtown core. Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>They're liquidating the inventory at Marvin Caplan Gentlemen's Apparel.  They're also liquidating three full-time jobs, several part-time positions, and an eighteen-year-old business.  The company's president, who's also a Hamilton alderman, says he can't afford to keep losing money while the city dickers over what to do about the downtown.  And he wishes the city would simply let its staff do the job they're paid to do.  <br>Caplan says the city merely needs to create the conditions necessary to allow business to thrive.  The businesses themselves will do the rest.  <br>And Hess Village is not the only high point. Caplan points out the International Village, and James Street North and South are thriving, proving it's premature to sound the death knell for the downtown core. </i>
<hr>
<b>Jenny Verdict</b><p>
Jonathan Schmitz, who admitted shooting a gay acquaintance after the man revealed a crush on him during a taping of the Jenny Jones Show, was found guilty today of second-degree murder. Schmitz was charged with fatally shooting Scott Amedure in March 1995 after the two were taped for a Jenny Hones show segment on same-sex crushes.
<hr>
<b>Morissette</b><p>
Rocker Alanis Morissette has made Canadian recording history. She's the first Canadian to hit the magic "double-diamond" mark of two-million sales for a single album, "Jagged Little Pill." Released in June, 1995, the album has produced four consecutive top 10 singles and a trophy case full of Junos and Grammys. The 22-year old Ottawa native is also the first artist of the 90's to hit the two-million mark in Canada and the first since Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album in 1982.<br> The only other members of the Canadian "double-diamond' club are Fleetwood Mac's "Rumors," "Led Zeppelin 4," "The Wall" by Pink Floyd and Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell."

<b>Remembrance Day</b><p>
At the 11th hour, of this the 11th day, of the 11th month, Canadians took a moment to remember.  <br>  Today is Remembrance Day, a day to remember Canadians who gave up their lives in past wars allowing us to reap the legacy of their sacrifices in a free world. Ceremonies were held across the country, to the refrain of the last post.
<hr>
<b>Zaire Update</b><p>
While we in Canada enjoy a life free of war, the same cannot be said of millions around the world.  A mission to get relief to the huge crowds of refugees in eastern Zaire is set to begin today. A U.N. official says assessment teams and some emergency aid are to enter Zaire from Rwandan border towns. They'll lay the groundwork for the arrival of truckloads of badly needed food and medicine. Fighting during the past month has sent more than one-million refugees scattering without food or water.
<hr>
<b>Algerian Bomb</b><p>
The shadow of terrorism continues to plague many countries around the world.  A car bomb exploded in an Algiers suburb Sunday, killing at least 15 people. A few hours later, a second bomb exploded.<br> Both explosions could be heard throughout most of the Algerian capital.<br> Officials say the first bomb went off near a coach parked by a school.<br> Hospital sources say 15 people were killed, four of them children, and at least 30 others were wounded -- some of them also youngsters.<br> No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, but suspicion centres on muslim militants waging an insurgency against the government.
<hr>
<b>Russian Bomb</b><p>
Russia has set up special police teams to track down the gangland bombers who killed at least 12 mourners at a Moscow cemetery. Yesterday's massacre has been blamed on criminal groups linked to Afghan war veterans' groups. It has shocked a nation where mafia killings have become commonplace in Russia's post-communism chaos. The Moscow prosecutor's office says the attack is being investigated as "terrorism."
<hr>
<b>Cyclone Update</b><p>
 While manmade tragedy continues to claim lives, mother nature is capable of inflicting her wrath in terrible catastrophies. Officials say the death toll from a cyclone that swept through southeast India last week may reach two-thousand. The search continues for about one-thousand fishermen, who were working at sea where the cyclone hit on Wednesday. Hopes are fading as hundreds of bodies wash ashore. The cyclone destroyed houses, livestock and crops in a prime agricultural area of the country.
<hr>
<b>Doc Update</b><p>
Ontario's doctors are turning up the pressure in their battle with the province. Doctors are angry with provincial clawbacks on their earnings and a plan by the Harris government to force doctors to work in underserviced areas. Yesterday, two after-hours children's clinics in Toronto closed their doors, forcing parents to take their kids to hospital emergency rooms. Dr. Paul Friedman of the Coalition of Family Physicians says he doesn't agree with such closures, but says if the government doesn't back down, more closures might be unavoidable. He says if the government follows through on its total fee reduction, what is happening today will be "small potatoes" compared to what will happen next February and March as the fiscal year ends. Talks between the Ontario Medical Association and the province continue this week.
<hr>
<b>Ford Vote</b><p>
It's a clean sweep for the Canadian auto workers. Workers voted almost unanimously in favor of new three-year deal with Ford yesterday. The deal tracks those hammered out earlier with Chrysler and G.M. CAW head Buzz Hargrove says bargaining this year with the big three shows that if workers unite, they can get ahead in a climate of downsizing and concessions. The three-year deal puts restrictions on contracting out and hikes wages by about 10 per cent.
<hr>
<b>Labor Storm</b><p>
Meanwhile, the level of time lost due to labor unrest in the first half of this year reached levels not seen since 1990. That suggests a long period of labor calm has given way to stormy workplace relations.<br>   A stronger economy, global competitive pressure, labor-law changes and the erosion of the social safety net have unleashed a new militancy among unions.<br>   At the same time, companies are more resolved to take the unions on.<br>   Figures show just over one-10th of one per cent of all work time was lost to strikes or lockouts involving more than 500 workers between January and June.<br>   That's roughly four times the level of the past two years, although still well below the almost half per cent level in 1976.
<hr>
<b>Minivan Bumpers</b><p>
It appears that most minivan bumpers don't do much to prevent big damage in low-speed impact crashes. The U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashed nine popular vans into barriers at eight kilometres an hour.  All fared poorly.  The 1996 Honda Odyssey sustained the least amount of damage -- at about 474 dollars per crash -- while the Ford Aerostar had the most at 14-hundred per crash.
<hr>
<b>Toronto Murder</b><p>
Police are asking for the help in identifying Toronto's 49th murder victim of the year.<br> The man aged between 60 and 70 was found in a recycling bin at the rear of an apartment building on Adelaide Street near Niagara Street on Saturday morning.<br> He'd been beaten on the head.
<hr>
<b>Box Office</b><p>
"Ransom", starring oscar-winning heartthrob Mel Gibson, has knocked Shakespeare from atop the North American box office. The film about a father who turns the tables on his son's kidnappers took in an estimated 35-million dollars U.S. in its debut weekend. "Romeo and Juliet" was second, bringing in 8.8-million dollars, followed by Queen Latifah's "Set it Off."

<hr>
<b>Hamilton One Tier</b><p>
A deal has been reached between Hamilton and her suburban neighbours which could see the creation of a new supercity.  Bleary-eyed municipal politicians met into the wee hours of this morning with provincial mediator Gardner Church, and finally came up with an agreement which almost everyone could live with. Deborah Walker was there for the twelve-and-a- half hour marathon session, and has this report.
<i><br>For the first seven hours, they staked out their positions, conferring in corridors... or closeting themselves away from others outside their own municipality. Gradually, all the suburban politicians congregated in one room, with occasional emissaries from Hamilton dispatched from the floor above. By midnight, everyone re-assembled for a last-ditch effort at reconciling their differences.  <br>But an hour later, the deal-making nearly collapsed, as Dundas and Flamborough walked out on the talks.  The rest soldiered on, and at four-thirty this morning, they reached an historic agreement.  <br>Under the proposal, Hamilton- Wentworth's six municipalities will disappear, replaced by one, as yet un-named municipality, governed by one local council, with less than half the current number of politicians.  The former suburbs will retain their historic names, and have the choice of setting up community councils, to deal with local issues.  <br>In exchange for giving up their boundaries, the former suburbs will have the same number of seats on the new council as Hamilton has.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Unemployment</b><p>
Canada has returned to double-digit unemployment. The jobless rate hit ten per cent last month, up from 9.9 per cent in September. The economy created 42-thousand jobs in October -- but that wasn't enough to offset a rising number of job hunters. Some industries that had been putting Canadians back to work suddenly backtracked and cut payrolls, including manufacturing, transportation and communications. The biggest source of new jobs last month -- farming and construction.
<hr>
<b>Bank Rate</b><p>
The good news on the economic front is that the major banks are cutting interest rates yet again. Both the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Toronto-Dominion Bank led the way this morning chopping one-quarter of a percentage point from their prime rate. The new prime will be 4.75 per cent, effective Tuesday. The announcements came minutes after the Bank of Canada cut its key lending rate. The new central bank rate is 3.25 per cent. The central bank has been cutting rates steadily to offset the dollar's rising strength on the exchange market and the stimulate the economy.
<hr>
<b>Doc Protest</b><p>
Talks between the province and Ontario's doctors have resumed in spite of the start of a job action by many physicians.<br>   Doctors have said they would begin turning away new non-emergency patients today if an agreement wasn't reached with the province. A move, meanwhile, by health minister Jim Wilson to limit the withdrawal of services has infuriated doctors. In a toughly worded letter to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, Wilson said work stoppages should lead to sanctions. Dr. Murray Miller of the Specialist Coalition of Ontario says Wilson's bullying tactics have undermined the negotiations. Miller says the doctors in his group won't negotiate with a gun to their head.
<hr>
<b>OFL Protest Follow</b><p>
Unions appear to be divided over day of protest tactics. More than a dozen unions say they'll no longer help shut down Ontario cities to protest the Harris government's cost-cutting policies. After meeting with the Ontario Federation of Labor to discuss last month's Toronto protest, the power workers' union and 12 others issued a news release saying it makes more sense to go the political route. While labor leaders insist there's no division in the ranks. It appears the prospects for another citywide shutdown is remote.
<hr>
<b>HSR Update</b><p>
A mediator will try next week to avert a strike that could bring Hamilton busses to a halt during Grey Cup week. Hamilton Street Railway bus drivers have set a November seventeenth strike deadline. Union leaders say members have no intention of accepting concessions. But Hamilton- Wentworth Region faces the possibility of another seven-million dollar cut from the province. And at least one councillor believes the failure to accept concessions now, could ultimately lead to the death of the HSR.
<hr>
<b>Machete Murder</b><p>
A Hamilton man who plead guilty to second degree murder in the death of his wife will not be eligible for parole for 15 years.<br>  Mr. Justice John Cavarzan, in sentencing 53 year old Carmelo Reyes, described the machete attack as an act of "appalling and unspeakable cruelty".<br>  47 year old Alba Fuentes-Reyes died after being struck by a van and struck repeatedly with a machete.<br>  Before his sentencing, Carmelo Reyes broke down momentarily, weeping while admitting he was wrong and was willing for pay for what he did.
<hr>
<b>Harnick Break-in</b><p>
Attorney general Charles Harnick dropped a bombshell in the legislature yesterday when he announced police were investigating two New Democrat MPP's.<br> Harnick says his ministry has asked the police to open a criminal investigation of Shelley Martel and Peter Kormos for an alleged break-in at the province's new family support plan office.<br> Kormos and Martel went there yesterday morning to try to expose problems.<br> Opposition politicians are accusing harnick of "shocking" intimidation and of acting as judge and jury.
<hr>
<b>Homolka Parole</b><p>
The Ontario government is looking to block Karla Homolka's parole from the Kingston Prison for Women. The Toronto Star says solicitor-general Bob Runciman and attorney-general Charles Harnick will intervene with the National Parole Board in the case.<br> Homolka is serving a 12-year sentence for manslaughter in the deaths of two teenagers, but will be eligible to apply for day passes in January, and for full parole in July.<br> But a source says both cabinet ministers have no intention of letting her get out.
<hr>
<b>Teachers Vote</b><p>
Secondary school teachers voting today on the Hamilton Board of Education's last offer.<br> They're also taking a strike vote.<br> Both votes are being supervised by the education relations commission.<br> That's the provincial body overseeing teacher-board negotiations.<br> Should the teachers vote in favour of a strike, they'll be in a legal position to do so five days after giving the board notice.<br> Ballots will be counted this afternoon, and we hope to have results for you on First Edition at 5:30 pm.
<hr>
<b>Halton School Update</b><p>
Groups opposed to school closures in the Halton Region are joining forces to pressure trustees to keep them open.<br> Six schools are scheduled to close, but the groups say its not the answer.<br> Dwight Ryan reports from Burlington.
<i> <br>  The children are singing in the gym at Lakeshore Public School in Burlington.<br>  They've been making music for generations at one of the city's oldest schools.  <br>    The board is facing a 24 million dollar shortfall.<br>  Parent groups from all six schools are joining forces to fight the cuts.<br>  They believe school closures are not the answer.   <br>    And so with a well organized campaign they are trying to convince trustees to vote against closures.   <br>       Sstill, the director of education believes closures are the answer.   <br>      Parent groups will have the opportunity to voice their opinions in communtiy meetings.<br>  A final answer from the board will come before Christmas.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Rock Guns</b><p>
Justice minister Allan Rock is said to be on the verge of releasing the new national firearms regulations. MP's studying the new rules say they've been told they'll be handed down November 20th. The regulations deal with the licensing of all gun owners and registering of all firearms. Regulations -- as opposed to laws -- are implemented directly by cabinet and don't require approval of parliament.
<hr>
<b>Gun Bust</b><p>
A joint forces investigation involving RCMP, OPP and police in Hull, Quebec and Hamilton Wentworth has broken a gun running ring.<br>  Six of the nine guns seized, including a .50 calibre handgun, had been stolen from a Hamilton area home this summer.<br>  37 year old Bruce Gerald Maher of Hamilton was arrested last night, and charged with 25 weapon offenses.<br>  More arrests are expected.
<hr>
<b>TWA Missile</b><p>
Turning to international news,  veteran U.S. newsman Pierre Salinger says he will hand over a mysterious document to the FBI. He says it proves the U.S. navy accidentally shot down TWA flight 800 in July off Long Island during a missile test. Both the navy and FBI heatedly denied Salinger's charge. However, the FBI received dozens of calls from people claiming to have seen a missile at the time of the explosion. All 230 people on board the plane were killed.
<hr>
<b>Nigeria Crash</b><p>
A Nigerian Boeing 727 airliner missing since Thursday has crashed killing all 141 people on board. The plane was flying from the southeastern oil city of Port Harcourt to Lagos with 132 passengers and nine crew members. Airport sources said several foreigners were on board, possibly oil company executives.
<hr>
<b>India Cyclone</b><p>
Planes and helicopters are scrambling to drop food and medicine to half a million people stranded by flood waters in India. A cyclone lashed the southeastern coast Wednesday night, killing at least one thousand people -- a toll officials say is certain to rise. State officials say 15-hundred people are missing, including dozens of fishermen working in the Bay of Bengal. More than 10-thousand homes were destroyed.
<hr>
<b>Sex Scandal</b><p>
A sex scandal has rocked the U.S. army. An army captain and two sergeants face charges of raping or sexually harassing more than two dozen female trainees. The alleged incidents took place at the Army Ordnance Centre in Maryland. Other service officials said the case could get worse and that some 500 female recruits and former recruits had already been questioned.

<b>Hospital Cuts</b><p>
There's a report that Ontario is about to lose one-fifth of its acute-care hospital beds.  <br>  The Toronto Star says the Health Services Restructuring Commission plans to eliminate 48-hundred of the province's 24-thousand acute-care beds. Those beds are the ones used for for everything from surgery to childbirth and emergencies. It's the first time the commission has confirmed plans to reduce hospital capacity beyond the nine-thousand beds already closed in recent years. Commission chairman Duncan Sinclair says no hospital is exempt from cost cutting. Health minister Jim Wilson has said he intends to chop 1.3-billion dollars from the health-care system in three years. Sinclair says the commission will be able to cut more than that.
<hr>
<b>Ortho Docs</b><p>
More trouble for Ontario's beleaguered health care system. Ontario's orthopedic surgeons will start refusing most new patients tomorrow. It's part of a protest against the Tory government's failure to meet doctors' demands. The Ontario Orthopedic Association called for the long-threatened job action in a memo faxed to its 298 members yesterday. The group says there's been no progress at talks with the province and it's useless to wait any longer.<br>   The association says elective surgery such as hip and knee replacement shouldn't be cancelled, and emergency problems should be treated. The OMA rejected a tentative deal with the province last week after a vote by members but put off job action as long as talks continue.
<hr>
<b>Chlorine Water</b><p>
Still with health news,  a new study suggests that chlorine-treated drinking water could be killing people. In studying five-thousand Ontario residents, Health Canada suggests chlorinated water causes more than 500 cases of cancer and 140 deaths each year. It concludes the reaction of chlorine with decaying organic material creates carcinogenic byproducts known as T-H-M's in the water. Researchers think those cause bladder and colon cancers.
<hr>
<b>Van Shooting</b><p>
Niagara Regional Police are investigating a fatal shooting. A body was found along the side of Highway Three near Fort Erie around 5:30 this morning. Reports from the scene suggest a man was found shot to death beside a delivery van. Police aren't saying much more as they continue their investigation.
<hr>
<b>Burton Search</b><p>
 About a dozen Hamilton Wentworth police officers spent the morning looking for clues in the disappearance of a Stoney Creek woman.  41 year old Kathryn Burton disappeared October 3rd. Police say she is unemployed and was depressed around the time of her disappearance.<br> A neighbour reported Burton missing from her apartment where she lived by herself. If you think you've seen Kathryn Burton, please call Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police at 546-4925.
<hr>
<b>Kids Breakfast</b><p>
Premier Mike Harris has found himself in a food fight.  He says it isn't unemployment or welfare cuts that are leaving kids with empty tummies.  The premier announced a school breakfast program yesterday. The eight million-dollar initiative will support 400 breakfast plans to be introduced across the province by the end of the school year. He shrugged off suggestions that his government's cuts to civil-service jobs and welfare rates might have something to do with kids' being hungry and that has critics fuming.
<hr>
<b>Gambling Crackdown</b><p>
Just days before legalizing 20-thousand video lottery machines, the Ontario government is cracking down on illegal ones. Police estimate about 15-thousand illegal machines are in use across the province. Solicitor General Bob Runciman says organized crime has a hand in most of them. The OPP will hire an extra 29 officers to deal exclusively with gaming investigations.<br>   In addition, eight Toronto police officers, four crown attorneys and up to five technical experts will be dedicated to fighting illegal video gambling. Critics argue that legalizing some machines will only compound what is already a serious problem.
<hr>
<b>Truck Safety</b><p>
And Queens Park isn't gambling on road safety. It's cracking down on companies that operate unsafe trucks. Legislation to be tabled today will give the registrar of motor vehicles the power to penalize companies who operate unsafe rigs. Safety records of firms will be made public, exposing those with a history of violations to insurance companies and customers. There will also be new provisions to allow the registrar to refuse new licences.
<hr>
<b>Ford Settles</b><p>
Ford of Canada workers vote on a new tentative contract this weekend. Ford and its union struck the deal yesterday, hours before a strike deadline. The CAW is recommending members accept the pact, which shadows ones made with chrysler and G.M. The deal contains wage increases and limits on outsourcing.
<hr>
<b>Australia Massacre</b><p>
Turning to international news,  an unsettling scene today in court in Hobart, Australia.  The man who killed 35 people last April changed his plea to guilty to all 72 charges he faced in the Port Arthur shooting massacre.  But Martin Bryant laughed during his entire court appearance. He's certain to spend the rest of his life behind bars. The only question is whether it'll be in prison or a mental institution.
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Better</b><p>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin is walking again. But he's been advised to stay another 24 hours in the Moscow hospital where he had open heart surgery this week. Doctors made the recommendation despite a request by Yeltsin to move to another clinic to convalesce. They say all signs are that the 65-year-old president's condition is normal after such an operation.
<hr>
<b>Candu China</b><p>
The federal government may water down environmental regulations to help complete the four billion-dollar Candu reactor sale to China. Reports say prime minister Chretien doesn't want an environmental review to delay the project. Under the rules, Canadian-funded projects that don't face environmental assessment in the recipient country must undergo one in Canada. The Candu sale has also come under attack because of China's human rights record and its active nuclear weapons program. It's suspected the prime minister wants to make the signing ceremony the centrepiece of his visit to China later this month.
<hr>
<b>Alien Smuggling</b><p>
Hundreds of illegal Asian immigrants have been pouring into the United States over the last two years ... through a doorway cut in Canada. The RCMP made a dozen arrests ... four in Ontario ... to close that doorway, and end one of the most lucrative and despicable smuggling operations, in North America. 
<hr>
<b>Dying Mom Sentenced</b><p>
The final chapter has been written in a sad story in Toronto. A woman who claimed to be on the brink of death and the victim of a purse-snatching has been sentenced to three years probation. Donna Mercier says all she really wanted last April was medication for her painful kidney condition. But she ended up telling police she'd been robbed of 150 dollars and was dying of cancer.  Her tale drew national public sympathy and 100-thousand dollars in donations.
<hr>
<b>SCTV</b><p>
Last week we spoke with the author of a new biography on the late John Candy. It seems canadians can't get enough of memories of the SCTV comedy troupe. Hamilton's own Dave Thomas has a new book out about the years he spent creating one of Canada's funniest video exports.

<hr>
<b>Clinton Wins</b><p>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has easily won a second term in office.   <br>  He's the first Democratic president to be re-elected since Franklin Roosevelt six decades ago. But Republicans will keep control of congress. Clinton says by splitting the balance of power in Washington, Americans are saying they want all parties to work together to "get the job done." 
<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Update</b><p>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin is back in charge.<br> He reclaimed his presidential powers just 24 hours after a seven-hour heart-bypass operation.<br> Yeltsin had transferred power to prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin before surgery.<br> His lead surgeon initially thought it would be a couple of days before Yeltsin could regain charge of the country.<br> Doctors performed five bypasses on Yeltsin.
<hr>
<b>Mortgage Update</b><p>
The cost of borrowing to buy a home, already at some of the lowest levels in 30 years, has fallen a little more.<br> Royal Bank kicked off another round of cuts today, chopping up to a quarter point off existing rates. Effective tomorrow, a five-year mortgage at the Royal falls to 6.95 from 7.20.<br> The six-month rate drops to five per cent from 5.20.<br> Falling interest rates have paved the way for the latest cuts.
<hr>
<b>Smokies Protest</b><p>
Firefighters would like to see the government's proposed fire protection and prevention act go up in smoke.<br> Thousands of them are at a rally outside Queen's Park today to protest the legislation to regulate municipal fire departments.<br> The bill allows firefighters to work up to 48 hours a week, bars them from striking, and permits key personnel to be excluded from the union.<br> The Ontario Professional Firefighters Association says the legislation puts the safety of firefighters in jeopardy.
<hr>
<b>Deadly Fire</b><p>
A four-year old boy has died of burns hours after a fire in downtown Toronto.<br> The boy was taken to hospital with burns to about 90 per cent of his body. His mother, and three firefighters suffered burns as well.<br> None of their injuries are life threatening.<br> The fire apparently began in the basement of a townhouse in Toronto's Chinatown Tuesday afternoon. Its cause is still under investigation.
<hr>
<b>Doc Talks</b><p>
There are two days to go before thousands of disgruntled Ontario doctors start shutting their doors to new patients.<br> The government and the Ontario Medical Association are trying to resolve disputes over billing, malpractice insurance, and how to serve underserviced areas.<br> A new wrinkle is a failure by doctors to sustain a united front.<br> Some obstetricians stopped taking new patients months ago, some family doctors followed suit last Friday, but most are waiting until this Friday.
<hr>
<b>Ford Settles???</b><p>
It appears a tentative contract has been reached at Ford of Canada.<br> A union official at Ford's assembly plant in St. Thomas, Ontario, confirmed the deal to a London radio station.<br> The official, who didn't want to be named, says members of the Canadian Auto Workers are being told not to consider an early walkout because a deal has been struck.<br> CAW president Buzz Hargrove has been saying for days the two sides are close.<br> Ford was facing a strike dealine of 7 p-m this evening.
<hr>
<b>Reserve Smokes</b><p>
Operations at one of the largest employers on the Six Nations Reserve are touch and go.<br> This after charges were laid against 9 founding members of Grand River Enterprises.<br> 32 people work at the cigarette manufacturing plant.<br> The RCMP claim the plant has illegally manufactured and sold cigarettes without a federal licence since it opened in 1994.<br> The Six Nations Band Council called a meeting this morning to support the members charged.
<hr>
<b>Restructure</b><p>
Some are calling it Meech Lake... and it kind of looks like it, right down to the open bar.   A provincially appointed mediator called together political delegations from every municipality in Hamilton Wentworth Region for a closed door meeting at a downtown Hamilton hotel last night.<br> When regional chairman Terry Cooke arrived, he was appalled to find a fully-stocked bar in the meeting room.<br> Knowing the discussions would require clear heads, Cooke ordered the bar removed, and the meeting began.<br> Politicians are trying to find the common ground necessary to carry them to a united vision on restructuring local government. ...the mediator has forbidden politicians from talking to reporters as long as there is hope they can reach a compromise.

<b>Gambling Survey</b><p>
The Ontario government appears to be backing away from a plan to introduce video lottery machines in licensed restaurants and bars.<br> The issue was debated in the legislature yesterday without a final vote.<br> Afterwards, premier Mike Harris said they are still looking at introducing the VLTs into controlled locations where there is already gambling, such as racetracks and charity casinos. Meanwhile, Ontario's Liberals say a majority of people are opposed to video gambling in the province.
<hr>
<b>Success at Shaw</b><p>
It's a record-breaking year so far for the Shaw Festival in Niagara on the Lake.<br> Revenues have already hit 9.2 million dollars, surpassing last year's high by more than 160-thousand dollars. Paid attendance has reached 282-thousand-643, or 75 per cent of capacity.<br> Agatha Christie's, "The Hollow" has been such a success it is held over until November 24th.
<hr>
<b>Macarena Madness</b><p>
All "macarena" all the time -- well, at least for a day-and-a-half.<br> New radio station KUJ in Walla Walla, Washington kicked off its launch Sunday with an all-"macarena" format, playing the dance song for 36 straight hours.  The county's emergency dispatch centre even called the station to ask if its disk jockey had died.

<hr>
<b>Yeltsin Heart</b><p>
Russia is currently in the hands of prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin.<br> That's because president Boris Yeltsin has successfully undergone open heart surgery.  <br> Yeltsin has spent the past six weeks preparing for the bypass operation. He's expected to reclaim his powers as soon as possible after the surgery.<br> 
<hr>
<b>U.S. Elexn.</b><p>
South of the border Bob Dole is leading the U.S. presidential election -- so far. The first presidential votes of 1996 were cast early today morning in two tiny new hampshire towns.<br> In combined results from the towns, Dole had 31 votes to 20 for president Clinton and five for Ross Perot.<br> Despite those results the United States headed for the polls today with all signs pointing to a triumph for president Bill Clinton and the end of the trail for old soldier Bob Dole. But the opinion surveys that unanimously forecast re-election for democrat Clinton also suggest that grudging voters might hinder him with another republican congress.
<hr>
<b>Bhutto Fired</b><p>
Pakistan's president has called for new elections to replace the prime minister and her government.<br> The president sacked prime minister Benazir Bhutto and her government, accusing her of rampant corruption.<br> Soldiers are on guard outside Bhutto's residence.<br> A party spokesman says her phone lines have been cut, and only her family is being allowed to see her.<br> The spokesman also says Bhutto's husband has been arrested, along with 20 other party members.
<hr>
<b>Ford Talks</b><p>
Ford Canada workers could hear about a new contract agreement with the nation's second-biggest automaker today.<br> Ford has decided to "track the pattern" established at Chrysler and GM and has agreed to restrictions on outsourcing.<br> It has also offered a six per cent wage hike over three years.<br> CAW leader Buzz Hargrove says a deal is "within reach."
<hr>
<b>Doc Deal</b><p>
It's back to the bargaining table today for negotiators for the government and Ontario's doctors.<br> Last week, representatives of Ontario's 20-thousand doctors soundly rejected a proposed settlement in their dispute with the province.<br> The Ontario Medical Association had said it would accept most of the provisions, including reduced salary clawbacks and increased malpractice funding.<br> But the association balked at conditions that would force new doctors into underserviced areas.
<hr>
<b>Burton St. Arson</b><p>
Investigators on the scene again today at a suspected arson in Hamilton's north end.<br> Just a month ago, police say a fire was deliberately set at the vacant Burton Street Markethon Flea Market.<br> Then last night witnesses say they a couple of teenagers running from the building just before flames shot out the second floor window.<br> Damage in this latest fire is estimated at 30-thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>Reyes Verdict</b><p>
A Hamilton man who hacked his wife to death with a machete was convicted Monday of second-degree murder.<br> 53 year old Carmelo Reyes, pleaded guilty to a crime that crown attorney Denis Allan described as ``unbelievable brutality in a public place.''<br> Court was told that in early December 1994, Alba Fuentes-Reyes was struck down by a van driven by her estranged husband and then slashed to death in front of her home. She died from severe head injuries.<br> Several people rushed to defend the 47-year-old mother of four.<br> The prosecution and defence jointly asked that reyes be given a life sentence with no chance of parole for at least 15 years. He is scheduled to be sentenced Friday.<br> One of the men who tried to help Alba Fuentes-Reyes has been nominated for an award with the Carnegie Hero Fund out of Pennsylvia.<br> Alexander Lee, a student at Western University, was treated for 26 stitches after he tried to stop the attack.
<hr>
<b>Missing Woman</b><p>
Police need help in locating a Stoney Creek woman, missing for more than a month now.<br> 41 year old Kathryn Burton was last seen October 3rd.<br> Police say she is unemployed and was depressed around the time of her disappearance.<br> A neighbour reported Burton missing from her apartment.<br> If you think you've seen Kathryn Burton, please call Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police at 546-4925.
<hr>
<b>H.W. Restructure</b><p>
There will be no meeting of regional council in Hamilton Wentworth as per usual tonight...<br> The regional chairman has cancelled the meeting...  so that politicians can push ahead with talks aimed at streamlining local government.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>One suburban mayor describes Gardner Church favourably as a man in a hurry.  Evidently, Church has found reason to continue. Regional business will grind to a temporary halt with the cancellation of Tuesday night's council meeting. Instead, each of Hamilton- Wentworth's six municipalities will send a delegation to another round of negotiations, under the guidance of Church.  And there's probably good reason for political co-operation. Hamilton- Wentworth councillors are no doubt aware of the provincial government's proposal to merge Toronto's six municipalities into one super-city. But as long as Gardner Church is still on the job, Ontario's municipal affairs minister says it's premature to think about imposing the super-city model on Hamilton- Wentworth.  <br>Leach says he expects a progress report from Church by the end of the week.  At that point, the two will decide how best to proceed. </i>
<hr>
<b>Kissing Judge</b><p>
The Ontario Court of Appeal says a lower court exceeded its jurisdiction before removing judge Walter Hryciuk from the bench in 1993.<br> Hryciuk was dismissed for kissing and making lewd remarks to female prosecutors.<br> The appeal court ruled that justice Jean MacFarland had a "narrow mandate to conduct an inquiry" based on complaints from two crown attorneys and no one else.<br> MacFarland went on to hear evidence from three other women who complained of similar behavior before dismissing Hryciuk.
<hr>
<b>Roux Commons</b><p>
The Chretien government is ignoring opposition calls for the firing of Quebec's lieutenant governor for Nazi sympathies during the second world war.<br> Cabinet ministers feel that Jean-louis Roux's politics of 1942 took place a long time ago.<br> But Montreal Liberal MP Sheila Finestone isn't as forgiving.<br> She says she was disgusted at Roux's interview in a French news magazine, and wants him to apologize.
<hr>
<b>Philip at Fair</b><p>
There is royalty in our midst. Prince Philip is in Toronto for a two-day visit. He was greeted by bagpipes last night as he entered a gala party to benefit the World Wildlife Fund -- his favorite charity. He's also in the city for the Royal Winter Agricultural Fair. He'll hand out his own Duke of Edinburgh Youth Achievement Awards to 100 young Ontarians and wrap up the day with a celebrity dinner.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Smoking</b><p>
With the number of smoking bans coming our way, we've heard plenty of complaints about how such bans will hurt business at restaurants.<br>  Now comes a survey from the Hamilton Wentworth Public Health Department that claims the opposite.<br>  Annette Hamm explains.
<i><br>  It's just an estimate, but Hamilton Wentworth's healthy lifestyles branch says a smoking ban will bring in at least 685-thousand dollars to the region's hospitality industry.<br>  The numbers come from average restaurant receipts and a random telephone survey of smokers and non smokers.<br> That phone poll showed 27 per cent of Hamilton Wentworth residents smoke.  <br>  The region's telephone survey found 69 percent of restaurant customers who asked for non smoking seating found it unacceptable.<br>  Just over a third have left restaurants because they couldn't get a seat in the non smoking section.<br>  And 26 per cent have left restaurants because the smoke bothered them.<br>  The public health department will be meeting with Hamilton Wentworth municipalities later this month to come up with a draft bylaw to go smoke free by the year 2-thousand.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Jackson Baby</b><p>
It turns out that the tabloid rumor about Michael Jackson having a baby is true. Jackson's publicist, Christine Holevas, confirms that longtime friend Debbie Rowe will have his child next year. Jackson says in a statement that having a little one "is my dream come true."<br> Holevas denies reports that Rowe was artificially inseminated and that she's being paid 528-thousand dollars to have the baby. The statement from Jackson also asks for privacy for him and the mother-to-be.
<hr>
<b>Mars Mission</b><p>
Where once we earthlings concentrated on getting to the moon, our attention is now centered on the red planet. Even before scientists raised the possibility of life on mars, NASA had been planning to probe the surface of our mysterious galatic neighbour.
<hr>
<b>Cold Myths</b><p>
Welcome to the cold season. If you've noticed everyone seems to be fighting the sniffles these days, you're not alone. But what medications help? And which ones don't?

<b>Porn Bust</b><p>
Ontario Provincial Police say they think they've made the largest bust of child pornography ever in Canada.   <br>     The OPP's anti-pornography squad has seized 20-thousand computer files containing photos and video clips of child pornography. Police describe the nature of the material as "shocking." 22 year-old Trevor Davis of Kirkland Lake has been charged with several offences concerning the making, possession and distribution of child pornography. He's scheduled to appear in court in Kirkland Lake November 18th. The investigation in Ontario followed an FBI probe. Several people in California have been arrested after police linked them with a group called the Orchid Club.
<hr>
<b>Lumberyard Fire</b><p>
The Ontario Fire Marshall has been called in to investigate a Tapleytown lumberyard blaze.<br> The inferno erupted at Davey Lumber and Building Supplies late yesterday afternoon with smoke and flames quickly spreading to a storage shed. As many as 40-firefighters, mostly volunteers, were called out to the scene... and extra tankers were brought in from Grimsby and Glanbrook. One firefighter was injured, but not seriously, battling the flames.
<hr>
<b>Fergus Murder</b><p>
A 52-year-old Fergus man appears in court today in connection with the shooting death of his estranged wife.<br> Gordon Ray Abbott was arrested Saturday afternoon and charged with first-degree murder.<br> Forty-year-old Patricia Abbot of nearby Fergus was shot several times with a small calibre weapon when she went for lunch from her job as a legal secretary.
<hr>
<b>Domestic Courts</b><p>
The province will open two new courts next year dedicated to dealing with domestic assaults.<br> The government has announced 140-thousand dollars in funding.<br> The courts are scheduled to open in January and will have specialized teams of prosecutors, police, abuse intervention experts and counsellors.<br> Police will be expected to collect more evidence to allow for convictions if a victim won't testify.<br> That would include 911 tapes, audio and video tapes of the initial victim statements, and photographs of the victims and the crime scenes.
<hr>
<b>Police Warning </b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth police are urging doctors who perform abortions to be cautious in the wake of the anniversary of two shootings of Canadian gynecologists.<br> 63-year old Dr. Hugh Short was hit in the arm by a sniper's bullet last year as he sat with his wife in their Ancaster home.<br> Short who has yet to return to work was on the second floor of his home when a shot was fired from a ravine behind his house.<br> The shooting happened two days after the first anniversary of a Vancouver abortion doctor's near fatal wounding by a sniper. Police won't give details about added security measures being taken in Hamilton.
<hr>
<b>Ford Update</b><p>
The Canadian Auto Workers union is expecting a "good economic offer" from Ford of Canada today following a weekend of negotiations. Ford should be ready to table its first contract offer in a bid to avert a strike Wednesday. Auto workers president Buzz Hargrove says Ford is still dealing with local union issues, as both sides work towards the deadline.
<hr>
<b>OHA Conference</b><p>
The Ontario Hospital Association wants the Harris government to move more quickly to close or merge hospitals.<br> The association begins its annual convention today in Toronto with the message that the restructuring process is at risk. It wants to know by June which facilities will be closed rather than waiting for the health care restructuring commission to finish its work in 1999. Association president David Mackinnon says hospitals need time to adjust. He also says the government's plan to spend 167-million dollars a year to help surviving hospitals with renovations and new equipment isn't enough.
<hr>
<b>Grit Poll</b><p>
The honeymoon isn't over for the federal Liberals. An Angus Reid-Southam News poll indicates the Chretien grits still enjoy the support of 52 per cent of decided voters. Reform is up to 14 per cent, the Tories are down to 13, the Bloc Quebecois has 12 per cent, while the NDP stands at nine. In Quebec, the poll suggests the Bloc Quebecois has 46 per cent of decided voter support, six points more than the Liberals.
<hr>
<b>Prez Poll</b><p>
Meanwhile, south of the border, it's the final day of the U.S. presidential campaign. President Clinton will spend the day in New Hampshire. Republican challenger Bob Dole was in Phoenix Arizona this morning. Labouring with laryngitis he kept up his tirade against Clinton ethics in a last ditch attempt to sway the American public. It may do him no good though. The latest CBS poll out today indicates the Dole-Kemp ticket is still way behind president Clinton and vice president Al Gore. Third party hopeful Ross Perot is trailing badly.
<hr>
<b>Refugees - Zaire</b><p>
Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire have declared a ceasefire to allow for repatriation of refugees who want to return to Rwanda.  A spokesman says the ceasefire will be in effect for at least three weeks so international relief workers can evacuate refugees to their native country. However, he says the fighting will resume if Zairian troops fail to respect the ceasefire. Battles between Tutsi rebels and Zairian troops flared last month, scattering more than one million refugees.
<hr>
<b>lt. Gov. Nazi</b><p>
Quebec's lieutenant governor has admitted to wearing a nazi symbol during the second world war. In the French news magazine l'actualite, Jean-louis Roux admits wearing swastikas during the war. He also participated in an anti-semitic demonstration in Montreal in 1942 in which the windows of stores with foreign-sounding names were smashed. But he's also quoted as saying that in France after the war, he could see the devastation "caused by nationalist ambitions" and changed his tune. A militant Quebec sovereignty group has sent a telegram to the Queen calling for Roux's dismissal.
<hr>
<b>Copps Flags</b><p>
Heritage minister Sheila Copps says her national flag giveaway will cost taxpayers far less than she first predicted. The government has delivered more than 683-thousand free flags since last February. Copps had expected the tab would be 23-million dollars, but now, it looks like it will come in eight-million under budget. Reform MPs have trashed the flag program as a waste of money, yet at least nine of them have called to get some.
<hr>
<b>Unity Cycle</b><p>
What have you done for your country lately, beside paying your taxes? A Hamilton man believes that each of us needs to do something to bring Canada closer together ... and he wants us to get it done before the turn of the century.<br> As Jamie West reports Mr. Intensity is planning to cycle where no one has cycled before...
<i><br>  Tthis was perhaps Canada's most passionate moment last year in Montreal on the eve of the Quebec Referendum ...<br>  An outpouring of Canadian unity ...<br>  A sign says this man, that Canadians can get fired up when push comes to shove...he should know.. he and his son were there ...<br>  Chris Roberston's gift is a 6,520 kilometre cycling journey called "To the Top Canada" launching March first...<br>  A similar ride is already underway by a man from Fort McMurray travelling across Canada, and their message as they stop in dozens of cities and towns will be similar.<br>  That every Canadian has their own unique gift and in response to the priviledge of living in Canada every Canadian should try to carry out their own personal good deed project to make Canada better than when we found it.<br>  By being the first person to cycle that far north... Robertson hopes to show Canadians that despite the challenges, they too can overcome ... and make Canada a better country .. <br>  For more information you can call Chris at (905) 387 0721. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Jackson Baby</b><p>
A British tabloid says Michael Jackson's nurse has conceived a baby boy by the rock star through artificial insemination.<br>   The "News of the World" says the child is due in February. It quotes Debbie Rowe as saying she's known Jackson for 15 years and is being paid 528-thousand dollars to have the baby. The newspaper also says the infant, shown on a scan to be a boy, will be named Michael Jackson Junior.
<hr>
<b>Box Office</b><p>
Moviegoers are in love with "William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet."  The modern telling of the tragic love story was the weekend's number-one film. Industry sources say Romeo and Juliet sold an estimated 11.6-million dollars worth of tickets. "Sleepers" falls to number-two after two weeks on top. Jon Lovizt's "High School High" is third, followed by Bill Murray's pachyderm comedy, "Larger Than Life" and the killer lion adventure, "The Ghost and the Darkness."
<hr>
<b>Elvis Auction</b><p>
No blue suede shoes, but there was plenty of polyester on hand in Los Angeles at an auction of Elvis Presley items. The total take yesterday was just under a half-million dollars U.S. an opal and diamond ring brought more than 25-thousand dollars, while Elvis's "Thunderbird" stage cape sold for 50-thousand.
<hr>
<b>Sinatra Hospital</b><p>
Legendary entertainer Frank Sinatra isn't being released from the hospital, just yet.  He was admitted to Cedars Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles Friday for what was expected to be a weekend stay. But doctors yesterday decided to keep him in for a few more days. The 80-year-old star is being treated for a pinched nerve. A hospital spokesman says Sinatra is doing quite well -- but is uncomfortable because of the nerve. The hospital and Sinatra's publicist are denying a report he's being treated for pneumonia and possible heart trouble.

<b>Cities - Reaction</b><p>
Halton Region will cease to exist, and Hamilton- Wentworth will become a supercity, if Ontario's influential "who does what" panel has its way. <br> The panel forwarded a series of recommendations on municipal government reform to the province today.
<br>  If adopted, GTA cities like Burlington would gain more local clout.<br>  But towns like Dundas and Flamborough would lose their battle against amalgamation.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br> As expected, the who does what panel suggests scrapping all five regional governments in the greater Toronto area, replacing them with a GTA board to co-ordinate services.  It's part of a stretegy to streamline local governments throughout Ontario.  <br>Suburban GTA municipalities like Burlington would gain power under the Crombie plan, a prospect that pleases the city's mayor.  <br>The Crombie panel also urges the province to move quickly on the Hamilton- Wentworth supercity proposal, a suggestion that puzzles supercity opponents.  They figure what's good for the GTA, is good for Hamilton- Wentworth.  </i>
<hr>
<b>UI  Stats</b><p>
 Job losses are expected as a result of this latest push to reform and streamline municipal government. And this latest push comes as unemployment creeps higher across Canada. According to November figures, it's up to 10 per cent now, the highest in three months.<br>  In Ontario, the jobless rate is up to 9.3 per cent.<br>  Hamilton, at 7.3 percent is still one of the lowest rates in the country and Niagara reports some improvement.
<hr>
<b>Casino Niagara</b><p>
It was hoped that what's being called Niagara Falls' second wonder would help stimulate the local economy.<br>  Casino Niagara is set to open its doors to the public on Monday.<br>  But the media was given a sneak preview today and it makes a storybook first impression.
<hr>
<b>GM Layoffs St Kits</b><p>
The news isn't good for 33 workers in Niagara.  They're GM in St. Catharines and they have one week left on the job. They will be laid off, December 15th; as the plant cuts production of its v-6 engines, and winds down its foundry operations. 88 more workers will will be laid off, March 1st.
<hr>
<b>Main St. Flood</b><p>
It's been a busy day on the job for regional workers in Hamilton. They've been investigating numerous complaints of flooding at homes and businesses in central Hamilton after a water main broke during this morning's rush hour. It sent water spewing for blocks.<br>  A road construction crew had been working nearby just before the break at Main and Grant Avenue.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Attacked</b><p>
Convicted sex-killer Paul Bernardo was attacked by another inmate at the Kingston Penitentiary today.<br> Corrections officials say it happened when Bernardo was being escorted back to his cell this morning after taking a shower.  Another inmate outside his cell stepped up and punched Bernardo in the face.  Bernardo suffered a cut on his cheek and a swollen eye.  The unidentified inmate has been placed in segregation.
<hr>
<b>Pot Bust</b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth drug officers with help from the east end heat team and tips from Crime Stoppers have put an end to a budding marijuana growing operation.<br>  Late this afternoon our camera's were on hand to capture the arrest of one suspect as drug officers executed a search warrant on a farm house at 363 Mud Street near Tapleytown Road.<br>  Police found 50 marijuana seedlings with a street value of about 40-thousand dollars. Police say the operation was just getting started and that two suspects will be facing charges of cultivating marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possesion of stolen property.<br>  Regional police have put an end to 62 hydroponic operations in the last year, that's up from about half a dozen five years ago...
<hr>
<b>Crack & Cash</b><p>
Police have seized more than 18-thousand dollars in cash and drugs after stopping a vehicle in east Hamilton. They found several small packages of cocaine and crack and 15-thousand dollars in cash after a subsequent search of a Stoney Creek home.<br> Charged with having proceeds of crime and possession of narcotics for trafficking is 31 year old Marijuan Vlasic of Stoney Creek.<br> 32 year old Jack Ring of Hamilton also charged with narcotics possession for trafficking.
<hr>
<b>Sailing Death</b><p>
The search has been called off the search for an 18 year old Fonthill resident, missing, and presumed drowned in a freak accident off the north coast of Australia.<br> Derek Zavitz was part of a student adventure program; and was sailing on board the Concordia, when the ship's battery exploded, and apparently threw him overboard. His body has not yet been recovered. A memorial service for Zavitz is planned for tomorrow, in Wainfleet.
<hr>
<b>Grenade - Ancaster</b><p>
It was a show and tell project he'll never forget. Nine year old Barron Thompson of Ancaster was on his way home when he pulled a hand-grenade from his back pack on board the school bus. A startled driver, who did not know that the grenade was inactive; stopped the bus, and evacuated the students. Police bomb squad officers moved in to take the device away. That left Thompson to explain to his father, how the souvenir he had picked up at a sportsman's show; had suddenly disappeared.
<hr>
<b>Massacre Vigil</b><p>
At this hour at Hamilton City Hall, and city hall's across the country, an annual vigil is underway to remember the 14 women gunned down by Marc Lepine at the Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, seven years ago.  In Hamilton, the vigil marched from city hall to the YWCA on Macnab Street. Donations to Canada's National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women go to help fund anti violence programs.

<b>Halton - G.T.A.</b><p>
The Ontario government's "who does what" panel is poised to release recommendations for sweeping changes in the way the province's municipalities are governed. <br>  Reports published today suggest the panel wants to create a greater Toronto area commission to deliver services now provided by regional governments.
<br>  But its recommendations will also affect municipalities well beyond the borders of the GTA.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>The "who does what" panel resurrects some of the recommendations of the Golden Report, endorsing the GTA-wide provision of services, and the elimination of overlapping layers of municipal government. But unlike Golden, the panel also looked at municipal government beyond the borders of the GTA.  <br>As a member of the "who does what" panel, Cooke won't comment on specific recommendations until they're released to the public.  <br>The chairman of Halton Region supports change, but only if it's change for the better.  <br>The mayor of Burlington wants more details before he comments on the recommendations. But Terry Cooke warns it's too late for Burlington to reconsider throwing its lot in with Hamilton- Wentworth.  <br>The recommendations of the "who does what" panel are just that.  It's up to the Ontario government to decide whether to accept them.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Students - Fumes</b><p>
Authorities still don't know the source of nauseating fumes at a Hamilton high school yesterday. Thirty students and staff at Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School were taken to hospital after being overcome. Dozens of people reported coughing, headaches, sore throats, nausea and burning eyes. The school was checked for natural gas but nothing unusual showed up.
<hr>
<b>Pot House</b><p>
Hamilton police have made an arrest after what began as a suspected house break-in at this Macallum Street house last summer.<br>  A neighbour had called after seeing two men run from the back of the house with two garbage bags.<br>  When police went inside to investigate, they found marijuana leaves spread out on a table and a hydroponic growing system with several marijuana plants in the basement.<br>  31 year old Matthew Gordon Kelly of hamilton now faces a string of narcotics charges.
<hr>
<b>Christmas Ride</b><p>
If you consider getting behind the wheel of a car after cosnuming too muc alcohol, beware: the annual holiday Ride program is underway.<br>  Ride lanes will be set up every day throughout the region to help reduce drinking and driving.<br>  Last holiday season, there were 33 collisions involving drunk drivers, including 2 fatalities.<br>  In the first week of Ontario's strict new driving suspensions for impaired driving, 4 people in Hamilton Wentworth have lost their licences for 90 days.<br>  Carol Redmond, whose husband was killed by a drunk driver 3 years ago, had a sobering message at the Ride kickoff this morning.
<hr>
<b>Car Lease Language</b><p>
The government is trying to take any mystery out of automobile leasing contracts.<br>  This morning Ontario consumer minister David Tsubouchi along with his federal counterpart and the Ontario Auto Dealers Association unveiled what is called the plain language auto lease agreement.<br>  A document that will tell consumers exactly where their money is going.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i><br>  Shopping for a new car can be an intimidating experience.<br>  Should they buy ..should they lease..what's it all going to cost ...<br>  Leasing started to become more popular as cars became more expensive.<br>  People couldn't deal with the sticker shock.<br>  The lower monthly payments were more palatable..<br>  But with leasing had its problems.<br>   People knew what their monthly payment was.<br>  But often weren't told what the residual value of the vehicle would be. <br>  But there should be no surprises now.<br>  Effective January 1st 1997 car dealers will be required to fully disclose what a vehicle costs a consumer.<br>  Taxes, mileage, down payments, responsibilities. <br>  Every thing will be laid on the line.<br>  Now dealers won't be able to simply tell customers what they want to hear.<br>  They'll have to put everything down on paper.</i>
<hr>
<b>Chanakuh Light</b><p>
Sundown tonight marked the beginning of chanuka, the annual festival of lights on the Jewish calendar. In a ceremony this afternoon at Hamilton City Hall the first chanuka candle was lit by children of the Hamilton Hebrew Academy. The festival lasts eight days and commemmorates the Hebrew victory over Syrians more than two thousand years ago but with only enough sacred oil to light the menorah in the temple for one day. Thanks to the miracle of the lights, however the oil lasted eight days and that is why today the menorah is lit candle by candle each night of chanuka.
<hr>
<b>X-mas Trees Cut</b><p>
It's no longer a question of fake or real, with a trend toward more nostalgic yuletides past, it's also parking lot or cut-your-own. <br>    With twenty days left until christmas, we sent Matt Hayes out to the wilds of Lynden in search of that perfect christmas tree.
<i><br>  Hubert will knows what he's doing he's been growing Christmas trees since 1966.  Will specializes in white spruce ...the only seasonal tree that is native to Ontario.  It takes 8 years and a lot of tender loving care to bring these trees to maturity.  There are plenty to choose from at his Lynden based farm and will believes more people are choosing real over artficial.<br>  Cut your own is meant to be a complete family Christmas experience.  Being a media man on the move I had to hurry things along. Nothing like a little fresh country air and some exercise the next three weeks are crucial at the Will farm and others like it. I proved to be an inspiration to Hubert will and his family ...an example of what cut your own is really all about.<br>  Now that we have the tree a few simple instructions from the expert.<br>  That's our day on the farm we leave with a reasonably priced tree of 16 dollars a great family experince and only a slight back ache.  What do you expect from a city boy. </i>
<hr>
<b>Troy Sing</b><p>
Finally tonight, it's become a modern-day Christmas tradition in the community of Troy, northeast of Brantford. <br>   And now every year at this time, big city meets small town when some divine inspiration from Toronto, comes to town. Alex Reynolds reports.
<i> <br>  Four years ago, the Grant African Methodist Episcopal Church Choristers were invited to celebrate the restoration of Troy's 19th century United Church. <br>  The congregation's upbeat response to that spring concert sparked the annual yule visit.<br>  An innovation for this fourth anniversary sing ....a choir-within- a-choir. <br>  With seven "witness" members composing original material, the concert choir has a life of its own, blending contemporary with traditional spirituals and gospel. <br>  Troy Church will be filled with joyful sounds Friday and Saturday...as "Witness" presents three concerts.<br>  </i>

<hr>
<b>Students - Fumes</b><p>
Emergency officials are scratching their heads tonight over something in the air at a Hamilton high school.
<br>  32 students and staff members at Sir Winston Churchill were taken to various hospitals over the noon hour after they were overcome by something unidentifiable.<br>  Whatever it was it had the greatest effect on staff and students near the main office before spreading to the second and third floors.<br>  The principal of the school says the substance was odorless and tasteless.<br>  900 students had to be evacuated for about an hour before the unknown substance dissipated. <br>    
<hr>
<b>Six Nations School</b><p>
The federal Department of Indian Affairs is being asked to re-assign an Ohsweken teacher.<br>  Parents say the non-native teacher is physically and emotionally abusing her elementary students and they want her gone.<br>  And, as Dwight Ryan reports, they have blockaded the school to get their point across.
<i><br>  Its a question of culture according to these parents of students at I.L. Yhomas School in Ohsweken. <br>  And they're seeking support for their cause by circulating a petition.<br>  For five days now they have blocked the entrance to the Cayuga Language Immersion School.<br>  As a result, the school has been closed.<br>  At issue a teacher who the parents say not only grabbed a child so violently that she suffered bruises, but also ejected two youngsters for speaking their native language.   <br>    Once all councillors have signed the resolution, it will be forwarded to the federal department of indian affairs. Chief Wellington Staats believes they'll act on it.  <br>      Parents meanwhile are prepared to let the school open, but only if the teacher is re-assigned.   <br>      A decision from Indian Affairs is expected Thursday.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Oakwood School</b><p>
And an inner city Oakville school slated for possbile closure by the Halton Board of Education is fighting back.<br> Students from kindergarten to grade five at the small school staged an assembly this morning to let trustees know how much they need Oakwood to stay open.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  The principal at Oakwood Public School in Oakville feels the small number of students, only 189, may be a reason it's been slated for closure by the Halton Region Board of Education.  <br>  Surrounded by apartment complexes, it's as close as you can get to an inner city school in Oakville.<br>  If it's closed, Oakwoods kindergarten to grade five students would have to be bussed to the next closest schools.<br>  The chair of Oakwood's council feels that would unfairly split up a very unique school community.  <br>  The students themselves wanted to hold this assembly, showing school trustees why they'd like to stay together as a learning group.<br>  Under the pressure of provincial cutbacks, the Halton Board of Education is expected to announce the fate of Oakwood on December 19th.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Crime Paralyzed</b><p>
Two teens including one who allegedly fired the gun that paralyzed a Dundas convenience store clerk appeared in Hamilton court today.<br> The pair were part of group of four who held up Farah's Food Mart last August.<br> Charges of attempted murder were laid against the guy who police believe fired the gun.<br> The violence charges were automatically transferred to adult court but the accused is appealing to have the case returned to youth court.<br> That hearing is set for January 23rd.<br> Meanwhile a 15 year old involved in the botched robbery has been sentenced to 18 months in custody.<br> The victim, Khaled Mujber remains in a rehab hospital paralyzed below the waist with limited used of his arms.
<hr>
<b>Bryden - Y.O.A.</b><p>
Meanwhile, Hamilton Wentworth MP John Bryden presented a petition to parliament today demanding changes to the Young Offenders Act.<br>  The petition was signed by 22 thousand canadians.<br>  The public has been screaming for the politicians to hand stiffer sentences to teenage violent offenders.
<hr>
<b>Workfare</b><p>
If the province approves it, Hamilton- Wentworth's Workfare program could be up and running by the middle of next month.<br>  Initially, only new welfare applicants will have to sign up for workfare.<br>  Another six-thousand people who are already collecting benefits will be gradually phased into the program.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br> Only a handful of Hamilton- Wentworth regional councillors object to the workfare program adopted by council this week.  <br>Anyone who's eligible, and refuses to participate in workfare, can have their benefits cut off.  <br>For the first four months, recipients have to conduct a job search.  After that, they'll have three options... register with a job placement agency, sign up for a retraining program, or work for a non-profit group as a volunteer. That's something many welfare recipients are already doing.  <br>Schuster says the workfare program won't cost Hamilton- Wentworth region a cent, and it's expected to produce a five per cent drop in the welfare caseload by next year.  </i>
<hr>
<b>CUPW - Copps</b><p>
A group of angry postal employees occupied Hamilton East MP Sheila Copps' office this afternoon.<br>  The group is upset over the government's decision to get out of the unaddressed admail business.<br>  Ten thousand people deliver admail across the country.<br>  Their jobs will be terminated by the end of the year.
<hr>
<b>Lake Erie Mill</b><p>
A major power failure at its shot strip mill has forced a shutdown at Stelco's Lake Erie Works.  The roughing mill will be closed for 11 days.  An electrical problem  with a six-thousand horsepower drive motor is to blame.  Stelco says it hopes any losses will be partially offset by insurance.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Booze</b><p>
 Hamilton- Wenworth regional council has decided residents here should not be able to stock up on Christmas spirit over the next three Sundays. <br>  That's the kind you find in a bottle.  This is the latest in a growing list of regions to say thanks but no thanks to the LCBO offer. Ian Dovey reports.                              
<I><br>  31 LCBO and beer stores in Hamilton Wentworth will not be open on the three Sunday's leading up to Christmas and New Years.<br>  By a vote of 16 to ten regional councillors overturned a recommendation to accept the Sunday openings.<br>  On the issue of drinking and driving councillor Frank D'Amico won the support of council. <br>    But it was opposed for other reasons. <br>    The LCBO loses 750 million dollars a year from contraband booze and for that reason other councillors supported the Sunday openings. <br>     </I>
<hr>
<b>Ancaster Toy Drive</b><p>
Ancaster firefighters will be giving Santa a boost this Saturday with their annual toy drive. <br> Toys or cash will be accepted on behalf of the Neighbour to Neighbour program.  Just look for the fire trucks at the Zehrs Walmart and K-Mart parking lots in Ancaster between 10am and 2pm.  Last year the firefighters collected more than 600 toys and three thousand dollars during their one day campaign.
<hr>
<b>Stolen Cop Car</b><p>
Finally tonight, one of those embarassing moments for Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police overnight.<br> Someone snuck into a parking lot full of cruisers at the central station and stole one ....the unmarked vehicle was found abandoned this morning on Lake Avenue North in Hamilton... with the front seats burned, the door locks broken and the ignition punched out.<br> The car is an administrative vehicle used for police training.<br> Police are still investigating.

<b>Fire - Homeless</b><p>
Less than a month before Christmas, 13 people find themselves homeless tonight after their Thorold apartment building was gutted by fire. <br> One man was rushed to hospital suffering smoke inhalation.
<br>   And a number of cats and one dog were killed in the blaze.<br> Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i><br>  The emergency call came in about 6:30 this morning.<br>  When firefighters arrived on the scene thick smoke and flames were pouring from the upper floor of a the building at 4 Ormond Street South.<br>  An apartment building that has 11 units.<br>  Everybody inside was led out safely thanks in part to two passersby who started banging on apartment doors. <br>  It was difficult blaze to put out. <br>  Some residents escaped with little more than a beer bottle in their hand. <br>  This afternoon John Daley had to start rebuilding his life piece by piece with the help of social service agencies. <br>  John and the other tenants are collecting clothes. odds and ends.<br>  Now they have to search for another roof to put over their heads.<br>  The relief effort is being organized at Thorold City Hall.<br>  Any items you would like to donate to the fire victims can be dropped off at Thorold City Hall on Carleton Street or at the Thorold Community Cares office in the basement of City hall. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Canal Body</b><p>
Police have now identified the body of a woman pulled from the Welland Canal in St. Catharines, yesterday. 46 year old Elita Johnson died, when her car left the road and plunged into the frigid waters just after one o'clock yesterday. Witnesses say they could hear the woman screaming, but could only watch helplessly as the car quickly sank in the canal. It took St. Lawrence Seaway divers 20 minutes to find the victim, and pull her from the car. Attempts to revive her in hospital, were futile. An autopsy will be conducted, today.
<hr>
<b>Vanscoy Deal Nixed</b><p>
The deal with the devil part two may be dead. Karen Vanscoy, the mother of a teen shot dead last September has won a review of a plea-bargain agreement with the young man accused of killing her daughter.  The 17-year-old's court appearance scheduled for monday has been postponed. Mrs. vanscoy had protested to the crown after learning of a possible plea reduction to manslaughter with the recommendation of a two-year sentence.  She had compared that to the so-called deal with the devil that saw Karla Homolka sentenced for manslaughter in the deaths of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in exchange for testifying against her ex-husband Paul Bernardo.
<hr>
<b>Grey Cup Survey</b><p>
The official numbers aren't in yet on the Grey Cup festivities of last week, but as Jamie West reports... an unofficial survey conducted by some area high school students reveals that most revellers dropped their cash between James and Bay Streets...
<i><br>  Bob O'Conner turned the Grey Cup into a class project...<br>  He was the guy in the 1929 football helmet partying with the westerners...<br>  Bob's class of grade 12 travel and tourism students  surveyed hundreds of participants and local businesses.<br> Their figures show that most partiers were male, university educated, 26-40 years old and earned an average of 60-thousand dollars a year.<br>  Most spent about 200 bucks on food...mostly the fast variety. And about 350 dollars on booze.<br>  Many registers in Jackson Square just didn't ring up massive sales ...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Flamboro Merger</b><p>
The mayor of Flamborough, Ted McMeekin wants to renegotiate the deal struck to turn Hamilton- Wentworth into a super city. His comments came at a public forum in Rockton last night.  Reporter Ian Dovey was there.
<i><br>  There have been few issues that have sparked the public's attention as the proposed supercity concept in Hamilton Wentworth.<br>  Mayor Ted McMeekin says it's time to reneogiate. <br>    A supercity that includes Flamborough is a sensitive issue for residents here, but still people came out to this public meeting to voice their distaste. <br>    The meeting also attracted this councillor from Dundas, a community that also opposes a megacity. <br>    A citizens group has started a petition against the supercity.<br>  Organizers hope the signatures end up on municipal affairs minister Al Leaches desk. <br>    </i>
<hr>
<b>Liberals - Hamilton</b><p>
Ontario Liberals are hoping to restructure their party's fortunes with the election of a new leader this weekend. 
<hr>
<b>McNichol Park</b><p>
The "Friends of McNichol Park" in Burlington have won a land mark court decision against the city of Burlington. A panel of three judges has ruled that the city violated its own zoning by-law when it issued a building permit for the construction of Wellness House... a facility for the aged... on part of the park.

<b>canal body</b><p>
Police in St. Catharines are investigating the death of a woman whose car plunged into the Welland Canal this afternoon.
<br> The accident happened on Government Road near Lock Two in the city's north end.  Witnesses say they watched helplessly as the Dodge Neon drove into the water.<br> The woman was rushed to hospital after having been in the water for up to 25-minutes.<br> But she apparently drowned before rescuers could reach her.<br> Police are not sure why the car left the road although there was some light snow on the road at the time.  The victims's identity has not been released.
<hr>
<b>Murder Charge</b><p>
There's been an arrest in connection with a shooting death earlier this month in Fort Erie.<br> The body of Fred Grondin was found lying beside a van on the shoulder of Highway 3 November 7th.<br> Niagara police have charged 30-year-old Patrick O'Connor of Fort Erie with first degree murder.<br> He is to appear in a St. Catharines court Friday morning.
<hr>
<b>"Gun" Incident</b><p>
A dramatic scene on the west Hamilton mountain over the noon hour, after a passerby spotted three males with what appeared to be a handgun enter the Westcliffe Mall. <br> Police responded within minutes and took the trio into custody after they emerged from the mall and got into a car. They found a gun in a gym bag. But it later turned out the gun, complete with an authentic-looking clip, was just a toy.  The three were subsequently released.  Police say they were following normal procedure when investigating a suspicious incident. Four youths are being sought after a robbery in the area over the weekend.
<hr>
<b>Scarf Bandit</b><p>
Police in Hamilton believe they may have nabbed the "scarf bandit".<br> Over the past few weeks, several stores and submarine shops on Hamilton mountain have been robbed by a suspect wearing a scarf across his face.<br> Yesterday, police arrested a suspect after a Bargain Shop on Fennell Avenue was robbed by a man wearing a scarf and matching the description from similar robberies.<br> 21 year old Kurt Gray of Hamilton is charged with robbery in the Bargain Shop hit.<br> Police are continuing their investigation.
<hr>
<b>St. Liz Villa 7</b><p>
The Hamilton Region's medical officer of health is set to meet with legal officials concerning allegations of poor treatment of the residents of St. Elizabeth Villa.<br>  Testimony this week at an inquest into five deaths at the villa deserves further attention according to Sr. Marilyn James.<br>  And, as Dwight Ryan reports, Dr. James told jury members today that St. Elizabeth Villa should never have been licensed in the first place.  <br>  <I>          <br> Dr. Marilyn James says St. Elizabeth Villa is licensed to operate as a second level lodging home, but is functioning poorly as an unlicensed nursing home. <br> The region's medical officer of health told jury members at the inquest into five deaths at the villa, that the facility should never have been licensed in the first place. <br> An investigation by the Hamilton Wentworth Regional Health Department showed that nearly half of the villa's residents required care greater than that of a lodging home.<br>  But, the villa's staff had neither the training nor the supervision required for such care.<br>  The regions chief doctor told jury members that the St. Elizabeth Villa in 1994 had a mortality rate of more than 27 percent. Suggesting that one's chance of dying was more than one in four and that the villa was not a place to go and live.<br>  She added residents of palliative care units have a greater chance of surviving.<br>  Pushed by the villa's lawyer Christopher Ashby, Dr. James held her ground saying something was going on in 1994 at St. Elizabeth Villa that was knocking them off.<br>  She admitted frustration saying lodging homes in Hamilton are subject to a city bylaw..a bylaw that in turn is enforced by the region.<br>  Dr. James believes the residents of lodging homes deserve better treatment and should be covered province-wide by Ontario legislation.<br>  Queen's Park is expected to be watching this inquest carefully with the jury's recommendations having province-wide implications.<br> </I>
<hr>
<b>Bell Cancer</b><p>
That high rate of cancer among workers at a Bell Canada office in Hamilton is apparently just coincidence.<br> Dr. Gilles Theriault, an epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal, says further testing would be useless.<br> Eight cases of cancer have been confirmed among 50 workers on one floor of the Bell Canada Centre, including five breast cancers.<br> In September, the workers moved from the third floor to the seventh.<br> Tests of air quality, electromagnetic and radiation emissions were done, but nothing unusual was found.<br> Bell Canada is setting up a cancer surveillance program for workers who were on the third floor.
<hr>
<b>Our Place Newser</b><p>
The sign outside "Our Place Tavern" on Beach Road says come party with us.<br> But nobody came to the Grey Cup party, not even the regulars.<br> Everyone, it seems partied downtown and at the beer gardens near Ivor Wynne Stadium on game day leaving many east end taverns owners fuming.
<hr>
<b>Ancaster / Broadway</b><p>
The Ancaster Arts Council goes broadway once again with its fourth annual community musical. "The Magic of Broadway," with a cast of over 60, taps into the blockbuster shows "Phantom".."Evita" ..Les Miz"."Guys and Solls" ....and "West Side Story" among others. Proceeds from ticket sales are donated to community programs. "The Magic of Broadway" runs tonight through Saturday at the Ancaster High School auditorium.
<hr>
<b>Santa Letters</b><p>
Canada Post opened its doors to students from Regina Mundi School today. The grade 2 students hand delivered thier Santa mail to the Stoney Creek processing plant. The highlight of the trip was an opportunity to speak to the big guy himself in a special conference call from the North Pole.  These kids had plenty on their minds.   If you have a letter to Santa adress it to Santa Claus, North Pole, H0H 0H0. Don't forget to include a return address and postal code.

<b>Health Workers</b><p>
Some 4000 CUPE employees in the Hamilton Wentworth healthcare system commenced a job action today.  They want you to know who they are ...and how important they are to the quality of your healthcare..
<br> As Jamie West reports...the so called "invisible" hospital workers want a fair shake ...
<i><br>  If these specific people weren't here to prepare your in hospital meal would it affect your healthcare ...the Canadian Union of Public Employees, thinks so...<br>  They've just launched a public information campaign called "The Faces of Health Care" to make people aware of the 4000 invisible faces in Hamilton healthcare...<br> Employees like housekeepers, food service people, registered practical nurses.<br> Some of whom are being replaced by private companies ..<br>  They earn an average of 26-thousand dollars a year.<br>  And find it absurd that they should have to take an 18 percent cut ...while doctors are sneezing at a 7 percent hike.<br>  And they're not against taking their message fully to the streets...<br>  Union leader Sid Ryan says two more days of action protests are on the books ...<br>  Sudbury in February...<br>  Thunder Bay in April...<br>  Both cities have seen the government force closure of hospitals.<br>  </i>
<br>  there's no official word on when any layoffs might take effect, but it's possible that notices could be sent out early in the new year.
<hr>
<b>St. Liz Inquest 6</b><p>
A coroner's jury heard today that a resident of St. Elizabeth Villa jumped to his death from an upper floor window.<br>  But, when his body was discovered, police weren't even called.<br>  Dwight Ryan is covering the inquest and has this report..  <br>  
<i><br>  Members of the jury had a first hand look at St. Elizabeth Villa ..touring the facility they have heard so much about in recent weeks.<br>  The coroner's inquest is investigating five deaths at the villa..five of more than forty in just over a year.  <br>  Earlier in the day jury members heard dramatic testimony about the suicide of an elderly villa resident not long ago.  The man's crumpled body was found outside the building shortly after ten o'clock in the evening. <br>  RNA Sherry Farrell said Sister Maria was flustered and asked her to call a doctor.  Armed with a flashlight the sister and Farrell saw that the man, surrounded by blood, was obviously dead.<br>  Further investigation showed that he had removed his screen and jumped from an upper floor window.<br>   It was the doctor who called the coroner and police.  Later the angry officer said if anything like that happened again, to call 911 immediately.<br>  The suicide story was just one of many that put the villa's management in a bad light.<br>  Former health care aide Linda Connoly told coroner Bill Lucas and jury members that she was repeatedly yelled at by Sister Maria.  It was her way or not at all.<br>  She detailed instances of sour milk being sent to the residents and fresh cereal poured over stale cereal.  Damp sheets being returned from the laundry. Improvising when supplies such as bed pads and diapers weren't available. <br>  When the investigation into St. Elizabeth Villa began, staff members were asked to write letters to the Medical Officer of Health defending the facility.<br>  Linda Connoly refused.  A couple of weeks later she quit.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Vanscoy Plea</b><p>
The deal with the devil, part 2?  That's how a St. Catharines woman describes a possible plea bargain deal between the crown and her daughter's accused killer.<br> Karen Vascoy, 14-year-old daughter Jasmine was shot in the head with a stolen gun in her home in September, has learned that the 17-year-old charged with second degree murder would plead guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter.<br> She's sent a letter of protest to crown attorney Ray Houlahan.<br> Both Houlahan and the accused's lawyer George Walker were party to the original so-called deal with the devil, which saw Karla Homolka testify against her ex-husband Paul Bernardo in the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy.
<hr>
<b>Mountain Robber</b><p>
Seems there could be a busy robber at work on Hamilton mountain these days.<br> His latest hit ... the Biway store on Concession Street.<br> He tried, unsuccessfully, to hold up the store yesterday, then bolted from his getaway cab after hearing his description broadcast on the taxi's radio.<br> Police looking for a black male in his mid-20's about 5-6 or 5-8, weighing 180 pounds.<br> They suspect he may be responsible for string of robberies at stores and sub shops in the area.
<hr>
<b>Supercity</b><p>
It's been 23 years so what difference will a few more days make? That was the issue at Hamilton city council last night as they decided not to decide just yet on restructuring Hamilton- Wentworth Region into a super city. Deborah Walker reports.                     
<i> <br>Several members of Hamilton city council came to the meeting ready to vote, especially because municipal jobs are on the line.  Even some who oppose the plan, are anxious to get on with the vote.  <br>In the end, council voted to delay the final vote for two more weeks.</i>
<br>
The Hamilton city council tally now stands at nine for and 8 against the supercity plan. That's not expected to change.
<hr>
<b>Motts Boycott</b><p>
The United Food and Commercial Workers union wants you to hold the Clamato juice next time you make a caesar.<br> While the label boasts the drink is "Canada's original" tomato-clam cocktail, the union says that hasn't stopped Mott's from shifting production to the U.S. and now it's calling for a consumer boycott.<br> The Mott's move south wipes out 165 jobs at the company's plant in St. Catharines.<br> Mott's says it was forced to make the move to remain competitive.
<hr>
<b>Opera Hamilton</b><p>
Internationally acclaimed baritone Allan Monk is back on stage at Hamilton Place this week.<br> The Calgary native, a regular with the Metropolitan Opera for thirty years,  is performing in the Opera Hamilton production of Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte."         <br>  Performances of "Cosi Fan Tutte" continue Thursday and Saturday at Hamilton Place.
<hr>
<b>Decew Stone</b><p>
And finally tonight, restorers of this century old flour mill in St. Catharines are giving vistors a chance to taste a bit of history.<br> The friends of the Morning Star Mill have four hundred pounds of stone-ground flour to give away.<br> They'll open the mill, which is on Decew Road, on Saturday from two until four.<br> Make sure you bring your own container.<br> The Morning Star Mill is the only water-powered mill in the Niagra region. It was built in 1872 and restored just a few years ago.

<b>st. liz inquest 5</b><p>
Dining room food routinely recylced and mouldy juice bottles often refilled. Dramatic testimony today at the coroner's inquest into the deaths of five people at a Hamilton home for seniors. It came from a former employee of St. Elizabeth Villa.

<br>   Dwight Ryan was at the inquest and has this report.  <br>  
<i><br>  Letitia Jones worked as a health care aide at St. Elizabeth Villa for three years.<br>     During that time, she testified she repeatedlay witnessed incidents of poor patient care.<br>  She told the jury that Sister Elizabeth often refilled milk bags from a bottle.  And that on one occasion curdled milk was served on porridge.  Health care aides refused to serve it to the residents and gave them toast instead.<br>   She said orange juice bottles with black around the edges and mould inside would be refilled.<br>  Soup bowls from the dining room would routinely be emptied back into the pot.<br>   Jones went on to say that Sister Elizabeth mixed mashed potatoes with her bare hands.   And that Louis, a resident who helped in the kitchen would peel carrots, potatoes and onions with his bare hands, despite having an infected finger. <br>  Inquest counsel Angela Paparella asked Letitia Jones if she had ever spoken to Sister Elizabeth about the incidents.  No, she replied, I was scared of her, she yelled at me a couple of times. <br>  In earlier testimony, registered practical nurse Debbie Smith told jury members that Sister Elizabeth had scolded her for calling an ambulance after an elderly woman had fallen and injured her back.<br>  RPN's weren't to call for help without following the correct protocol.<br>  Smith however returned to St. Elizabeth Villa after working in Mississauga for a month.  When the probe into allegations of poor care began, Smith wrote to medical officer of health and the media defending the villa.<br>  Jury members will tour St. Elizabeth Villa Wednesday afternoon.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Pool Fight</b><p>
A brawl at a downtown Hamilton bar has cost a 29 year old hamilton man his sight.<br>  Police say a fight broke out at the Artizan Diner between four men betting on a pool game.<br>  The 29 year old was robbed and had his eye stabbed with a beer bottle, and a 35 year old Hamilton man received bumps and bruises to his head after being hit with a pool ball.<br>  21 year old Joseph Edward Campbell and 21 year old Christopher William Boylan, both of Hamilton, face a number of charges tonight in that attack.
<hr>
<b>Karla Parole</b><p>
Karla Homolka doesn't appear anxious to get out of jail. She's eligible for day parole on January 6th, but   parole board officials say they haven't heard from her yet. If she does approach them, it would be at least five months before her application would come up for a hearing.<br>  Homolka is serving a 12-year sentence in Kingston's prison for women for her role in the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. By July 6th, she will have completed one third of her manslaughter sentence and will be automatically eligible for full parole and an automatic parole board hearing, unless she waives her right to the hearing.
<hr>
<b>Supercity Forum </b><p>
The first attempt to engage the citizens of Hamilton in a public debate on the supercity proposal failed to draw a significant turnout last night.  As a result, when Hamilton city council meets in two hours from now, it's expected to defer a final vote on political restructuring in Hamilton- Wentworth. 
<hr>
<b>Pelham Herald</b><p>
It's not big government they're battling in Pelham, but big business. A piece of history will be lost when the Pelham Herald Weekly newspaper closes it's doors December 31st.<br>  The shutdown is being called another casualty of the Conrad Black push for profits.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i><br>  For forty years the Pelham Herald has been keeping the residents of Fonthill and surrounding area informed on what is happening in their community.<br>  Flipping through the pages of the archives stored in the basement reporter Carolyn Mullin readily recognizes familiar faces.<br>  Publisher Martha Cepuch has called the Herald home for 17 years.<br>  Once it closes its doors she feels the community will lose part of its voice.<br>  And another paper has been positioning itself to takeover the Pelham market.<br>  The Welland Tribune which is owned by Conrad Black is not a union shop. <br>  The Pelham Herald which is owned by Southam and controlled by Conrad Black is a union shop.<br>  And even though the Herald is a profitable weekly the union feels this is another case of Black trying to flee the union. <br>  Dave Hall started this paper 40 years ago.  And he was shocked when he learned that the familiar storefront office will be closed. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Canadian stocks climb to new record highs today.<br>  Bank of Montreal reports a record profit of more than a billion dollars in 1996.<br>  Atomic Energy of Canada signs a 4-billion dollar contract to build two nuclear reactors in China.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Train Dismantled</b><p>
You might call it an underground railway. Located in the basement of the Delta Bingo Hall the Bay City Railway is about to go off track.  The location will soon be a grocery store and as quick as you can say bingo Bay City is being derailed.  More from Matt Hayes.
<i><br>  Delta area residents are happy.  In the new year they'll have a neighbourhood grocery store at this location for the first time in about 20 years. The Delta Bingo is moving up town to the old Kresge's building pending approval from the city and the Ontario Gaming Commission.<br>  They're also happy.  As for the Bay City Railway ...they're about to be derailed.  The Model Engineer Society has called the basement of the current Delta Bingo home for the last 16 years but they're world of miniatures is coming to an end.<br>  Its taken years to create this kind of detail.  And there was more in construction...<br>  Now they're talking demolition.<br>  A new 4000 square foot location is being sought...but that won't prevent the passion for this 22 member club from grinding to a halt.   An open house during Christmas week will provide the last run for this rail community.  After that the trains come off the tracks. Despite the setbacks the club has lasted 48 years. And somewhere the Bay City Railway will roll again. </i>

<b>Grey Cup Follow</b><p>
What a morning after. The showdown in steeltown is now history.<br>    What some feel will be the last ever Grey Cup is being hailed as an extraordinary success by just about everyone involved.<br>  Tens of thousands of people travelled to Hamilton for the CFL championship and left the steel city with nothing but good things to say about their hosts.<br>  Dwight Ryan has the story.. <br>  
<i><br>  The showdown in steeltown will go down as one of the best Grey Cups ever.<br>  Spectacular football.. <br>  And spectacular hospitality.. <br>  Hamilton was at its best hosting guests from one end of the country to the other.   <br>    Rooms at the Royal Connaught Hotel were booked solid almost a year ago.<br>    The situation was similar at the downtown Sheraton and the Ramada Inn.  <br>  And despite the partying, just one twelve-hour suspension from nine thousand ride checks  <br>  And now the massive task of dismantling the 1996 Grey Cup is underway.   <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cup Finances</b><p>
While the clean-up continues, the counting begins.<br>  There's no question the turn-out was huge, both for the game and the four day festival.<br>  But was it enough for Hamilton's Grey Cup organizers to turn a profit?<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>One day after the game, Grey Cup merchandise is selling at bargain prices.  And after week's of frantic activity, all's quiet in the Grey Cup office.  Time to clear up lose ends...and trade a few momentoes.  <br>The first chunk of Grey Cup profits will go to the CFL. Anything left will help pay off the five-million dollar municipal loan.  And even if the City of Hamilton were to lose a few hundred-thousand dollars, it won't worry mayor Bob Morrow.  <br>If profits exceed the five-million dollar investment, the money will be split between the city and the region.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Munitions Fire</b><p>
Firefighters are still on the scene of a stubborn apartment house blaze in Port Colborne.<br>  The fire at the Fraser Street home is believed to have started when two men put a smoldering couch up against the house.<br>  There are unconfirmed reports that there is a quantity of weapons and ammunition inside the building.<br>  There are no injuries.<br>  The blaze is still under investigation.
<hr>
<b>Mounties - Deaths</b><p>
The RCMP has been called in to investigate two boating deaths on the Upper Niagara River last week.<br>  Police discovered bags of liquor and cigarettes when the boat and one of the bodies were found.<br>   They want the Mounties to find out whether the goods had anything to do with the boating accident.<br>   The body of 66-year-old Baron Sciortino of Niagara Falls was pulled from the water last Friday. Fifteen-year-old Terry Baxter of St. Catharines is missing and presumed drowned.
<hr>
<b>Bus Passes Refund</b><p>
Hamilton Street Railway is giving a 26-dollar credit toward adult bus passes for December to those holding November bus passes. That's to make up for the week during which busses did not run due to a strike. Special monthly pass holders will receive a 19-dollar credit. In both cases, though, you'll have to hand in your November pass when you buy December's. If you're not going to buy a December pass, you can use November's up until december sixth.
<hr>
<b>New Saltfleet High</b><p>
Stoney Creek has a new jewel in its crown tonight. A brand new 20 million dollar high school. It's the new Saltfleet District Secondary School and it was officially opened at 4 o'clock this afternoon. It's a 21st centruy place of learning complete with classrooms equipped to handle computers and it's the only high school in Canada with an astronomy observatory. No telescope yet ...that's all part of a major fundraiser.  The new Saltfleet on Highland Road West was designed to accommodate a growing population on the mountain and replaces the old Saltfleet High located on Grays Road.  It has an enrollment of 11-hundred students.

<b>Cup Ticket Sales</b><p>
In just over 48 hours from now, the Edmonton Eskimoes and the Toronto Argonauts will meet at Ivor Wynne Stadium. And it's all about this: the Grey Cup.  Normally living a quiet existance inside the football Hall of Fame a few blocks away, it's been enjoying a busy social life lately.
<br>Is it the league? Is it the price? Or is it just the procrastination of Argo fans in southern Ontario? No one knows for sure; but a full 20 percent of the seats in the stands ... are still open for fans looking for tickets to Grey Cup '96. Scot Urquhart has that story:
<i><br>  In fact, there are thousands of seats going begging for the big game, less than 48 hours from kickoff. How many seats? <br>  Eight thousand tickets were left unsold ... when George McGow went to get his tickets ... was he surprised? <br>  But eight thousand empty seats for the national championship? That would be an embarrassing flop: <br>  And that's what the Grey Cup committee is hoping for too: <br>  But in Gretzky's bar in Toronto, that excitement is not enough to compensate ... for a ticket price that exceeds a hundred dollars:  <br>  These from Ottawa however, are apparently a heartier, well-heeled bunch: <br>  But is that event enough to sell the Canadian game, or have fans given up? <br>  But will that confidence be borne out, by the fans, in the stands? <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>East vs. West</b><p>
A quieter start to Grey Cup festivities in downtown Hamilton today.<br>  But once last night's cobwebs were cleared round two got rolling.<br>  As Jamie West reports word on the street is that when it comes to partying the west is the best...
<i><br> Ah the formality and majesty of the pipes...a sound you'd almost expect to connect to the slightly more subdued eastern fan...<br>  But this...this is definitely the west...party pros at their best...<br>  Western party animals are taking over...<br>  And another thing... what is it about guys in fur coats...<br>  Did he say "97 ...I guess he's having a real good time..<br>  And as far as east vs west goes ...who cares, we'll call it a draw...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>H.S.R. Vote</b><p>
We are expecting the results anytime on the HSR vote. It means Hamilton buses could be rolling in time for Grey Cup Sunday. The city's transit workers are voted on a tentative agreement today. More than 600 drivers, mechanics and inspectors have been on strike since last weekend, in a contract dispute that centres on job security. They've been without a contract since March.  A marathon bargaining session produced results yesterday with the announcement of the tentative pact. Aside from the out of towners looking for transit to the big game on Sunday, some 60 thousand daily users of public transit in the Hamilton region will be looking to board the buses that have been idled all week.
<hr>
<b>Cops Cup</b><p>
A fairly well behaved crowd at the first night of Grey Cup Festivities last night.<br>  Police say they laid only 3 liquor arrests last night, and didn't make any drunk driving arrests after stopping more than 25-hundred vehicles in ride programs.<br>  Police say they'll have 350 to 400 officers deployed across the region at the peak of the weekend's party.
<hr>
<b>Road Closure</b><p>
Recapping the downtown core road closures on now through the weekend.  King Street remains closed from James to Bay and MacNab Street is closed between Main and King.  Stay with us for Sunday's road closures around Ivor Wynne Stadium and tomoroww's parade route.  
<hr>
<b>Meningitis Shots</b><p>
 16 hundred Hamilton high school students were vaccinated against meningitus today. Regional health authorities now say St. Thomas More students who became ill earlier this month did indeed both have the same vaccine preventable strain of meningitis. Shots were also to be administered to children attending a day care centre attached to the school. Health officials say Grey Cup visitors have nothing to fear, because the general public is not at risk.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Boaters</b><p>
A man's body has been found in the Niagara River in the search for two missing boaters.  An aluminun boat carrying the boaters failed to return to Chippawa after a trip on the upper Niagara River yesterday. Around 11 o'clock this monring, the body of a 66-year-old man was located in a boat in the section of the river above the horseshoe falls. A 15-year-old boy is still missing.
<hr>
<b>Missing Person</b><p>
Police in Hamilton want your help in their search for a missing man. 40-year-old Luis Medeiros is mentally challenged. He was last seen when he left home at noon yesterday. He's described as white, 5-5, 130 pounds, slim build with short brown hair. He was wearing a bomber jacket and a black baseball cap. If you know where he might be, call police.
<hr>
<b>St. Joes Layoffs</b><p>
St. Joseph's Hospital is cutting 32 full time and 8 part time support staff jobs as of next may. The workers were given the required six months notice today. But hospital spokesman Hugh Greenwood says St. Joe's is hoping to use early retirment and buy-outs to take care of most of those workers.
<hr>
<b>Parade Map</b><p>
Tomorrow's Grey Cup/Santa Claus parade starts at 2 o'clock.  The route takes us from York Boulevard up Queen Street to Main...along Main to John....down John to King ....then north on Bay St.  Again start time, 2 o'clock, and don't forget to bring along canned goods and non-perishables, kinettes will be accepting donations along the parade route.
<hr>
<b>Game Map</b><p>
And looking ahead to game day on Sunday.  Road closures in the vicinity of  Ivor Wynn Stadium: Melrose and Balsam will be closed between King and Barton. Beechwood and Cannon will be closed between Melrose and Balsam.

<b>Grey Cup</b><p>
Good evening, from the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel, headquarters for Grey Cup 96. It's been 24 years since Hamilton has played host to the Canadian classic. <br>  This Sunday at Ivor Wynne Stadium, the Toronto Argonauts take on the Edmonton Eskimoes in the 84th battle for Earl Grey's Cup. But the partying is already underway.
<br> As east meets west, the street barriers have gone up and provincial barriers have come down.<br> As Jamie West reports...the spirit of fun mixed with football came fast beginning this morning.
<i><br>  Western hospitality arrived to satisfy a fierce eastern hunger...<br>  And that's no lie...look at the line up...<br>  Downtown was buzzing with excitement long before noon...<br>  Joe Short from Baltimore would give anything to see the cup again ...<br>  Inside the convention centre the legends luncheon packed them in...<br>  Tony Gabriel with two rings to his credits remembers this phenominal play in '76...with 19 seconds left to win it over the Green Riders...<br>  And theres Grey Cup 96 currency now in circulation...<br>  Over at Chedoke McMaster Hospitals the Calgary Grey Cup Committee entertained to the delight of dozens of sick youngsters.<br>  This is obviously the spirit of the west easterners have heard about. <br>  And this is only day one... the party continues right through Sunday.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Festival Closures</b><p>
And once again the downtown core road closures now in effect through 3 o'clock Monday morning:<br> King Street from James to Bay.<br> McNab Street is also closed between Main and King, all part of the Grey Cup street festival.
<hr>
<b>H.S.R. Deal</b><p>
And if you just don't want to go anywhere near your car this Grey Cup weekend ... some good news ... Hamilton's bus strike may be over, by tomorrow morning: more on that from Scot Urquhart.
<i><br>  The mood on the picket line is considerably lighter ... now that a tentative deal is in the works for drivers and mechanics at the HSR. But there is still some unfinished business. Some 70 inside workers, represented by this man, are trying to complete a deal of their own: <br>  Job security, particularly as it concerns the possible privitization of the HSR: <br>  As long as the inside workers remain without a deal ... the pickets will stay up, and the buses will remain silent. How long will that take? <br>  And so with luck, there could be bus service this Grey Cup weekend, after all. </i>
<hr>
<b>Mac Donation</b><p>
A financial boost today from the DeGroote family of Laidlaw fame for Mac's new university centre ... a complex that will centralize all student services under one roof. Mac president Peter George and student union president Geoff Ritchie joined the DeGroote sons, Michael Junior and Gary in cutting a cake to commemorate the occasion. The four million dollar donation is the largest ever received by Mac, excluding bequests... and it brings the total amount raised toward the project to 12 million dollars. Total cost is expected to be almost 19- million.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
After a long string of setting new record highs, stock prices paused today as investors took some profits.<br>  Since the Seagram Company introduced its Tropicana Fruit Juices in Canada, it has captured more than half of the Canadian market share with opportunity for more growth.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Derry Death</b><p>
One person died this morning when a car slid under a tractor-trailer and burst into flames outside of Milton. Ironically, the truck had been carrying a load of seat-belts to the Ford plant in Oakville when it collided with the car at Trafalgar and Derry Roads.<br> The resulting fire engulfed both vehicles.<br> The body of the car's driver was trapped inside the smoldering wreck. The victim's identity has not been released.
<hr>
<b>Glancaster - Booze</b><p>
A stolen tractor trailor loaded with rye whiskey has been found, empty, in Mount Hope.<br> The rig had been reported stolen from Simcoe Tuesday night.<br> Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police found the trailor, abandoned on Airport Road.<br> Anyone with information on the stolen booze is asked to call Crime Stoppers.
<hr>
<b>Cops Cleared</b><p>
Niagara Regional Police have been cleared of wrongdoing in the death of a man found hanging in his cell.<br> the special investigations unit has wrapped up its probe into the death of Donald Yacura.<br> Arrested last March, he was treated for a gash to his head after struggling with officers.<br> Yacura was placed in a holding cell in Grimsby, but later moved to a St. Catharines lockup.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Aid</b><p>
Paul Bernardo has been told he can't get legal aid for his appeal.<br> But officials won't say why.<br> Bernardo has been attempting to appeal his convictions in the sex slayings of teens Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. The legal aid money would have paid for his lawyer and research for his case. Bernardo has now applied for an "inmate appeal," which doesn't require a lawyer and doesn't take place before a full court.
<hr>
<b>QM School</b><p>
Hamilton's historic Queen Mary School has officially reopened. It happened with much pmomp and ceremony last night.<br> The original school, built in 1913 was demolished two years ago.  Parents, staff and students packed the gym for the ceremony. On hand, was 91-year-old Helen Mepham who attended Queen Mary School when it opened 83 years ago. Today Helen's three great granddaughters are Queen Mary students.
<hr>
<b>Parade Tree</b><p>
A large blue spruce will be among the floats Saturday's Grey Cup parade.<br> The 55 foot tree was moved this morning from it's Hamilton mountain Empress Avenue home.<br> The gigantic fir has been growing in Jim and Janice Scott's front yard for the past 35 years.<br> But it had gotten too big, so the Scotts decided to donate the tree to the CHML Christmas Tree of Hope. After the parade, it will tower over the corner of King and James.

<b>H.S.R. Mediation</b><p>
On the eve of one the biggest parties Hamilton has ever thrown, a slim chance remains tonight of getting the city's transit system moving in time for the Grey Cup. <br> Mediation talks continue at this hour to try to end the four day old strike by drivers and mechanics at the Hamilton Street Railway.... and both sides admit, this could be a crucial turning point.
<br> They suggest that a settlement will either come quickly ... or the talks will collapse and the strike will drag on for at least another month. Scot Urquhart has the details:
<i><br>  Early morning on the picket line, and the mood is not optimistic. A half page ad in the newspaper outlining the region's final offer ... is angrily dismissed as propaganda ... payed for with tax dollars: <br>  Cheeseman says, his members have offered to maintain the status quo, and extend the current collective agreement for two years, rather than go with the offer outlined in the paper. Something he says, is rotten on Wentworth Street: <br>  What's obviously missing at the moment... are the buses. That's bad news for senior citizens at Mohawk Gardens; who are having to find other ways to get around: <br>  And the Board of Education says 11-hundred public system students are on their own for at least the next two weeks .... but so far, they've had few complaints.  On the other hand, the strike is good news, for businessmen like Blue Line Cab owner, Tony Rizzuto: <br>  As the two sides in the dispute gather for mediation at a Burlington hotel; there is word from the Canadian Urban Transit Association that the cost to run the HSR... is one of the highest in the province. Even the TTC; which is a far bigger and more complex system ... is cheaper to run ... and London Transit ... which serves roughly the same number of customers ... spends only a third of what the HSR does, for administration. Does that mean the HSR is top heavy? Or poorly managed? <br>  So how long will this strike last? Who knows? But this cannot be a good sign: <br>  The HSR is already handing out refunds for November bus pass holders ... at this temporary office on Catharine Street. And sources tell us that union executives have laid plans to keep their pickets in place for at least another four weeks. But as in all strikes; depending on what happens at the bargaining table, all of that could change, overnight. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>403 Lane Closure</b><p>
And also just in time for Grey Cup, expect more traffic problems just outside the city on Highway 403 between the Highway 6 north cutoff and the Main Street East ramp. Transport ministry crews are busy putting up concrete barriers and high mast lighting, upgrading pavement, and repairing bridges and guard rails. The bottleneck will be there until late next summer.
<hr>
<b>Festival Closures</b><p>
These are the Grey Cup festival road closures that will take effect tomorrow morning at 10 through until 3 a.m. Monday: <br>  King Street from James to Bay.<br>  And MacNab Street between Main and King, where another tent will be located. Throughout the rest of the week we'll update you on the Grey Cup parade route and game day closures.
<hr>
<b>Kenilworth Reopen</b><p>
After being closed since last Tuesday, the Kenilworth Access will re-open tomorrow.<br>  Crews are putting the finishing touches on the access today, back-filling behind a cracked retaining wall and finishing up the curb and paving around it.<br>  Hamilton Wentworth's senior director of roads, Ted Gill, tells us the access should reopen sometime after tomorrow morning's rush hour, but before the afternoon drive home.
<hr>
<b>Supercity Region</b><p>
There's a chance the plan to amalgamate Hamilton and the five outlying suburban municipalities that now make up Hamilton-Wenworth could go to the people for a vote. Last night regional council agreed to debate the merits of holding a region wide referendum.<br> That discussion will take place in two weeks.<br> Flamborough and Dundas oppose the supercity concept.<br> The mayor of Flamborough senses support for the deal is falling apart.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Low inflation with Canadian interest rates edging lower encouraged investors to move more money into stocks today breaking new record highs.<br>  Shares of Philip Environmental are soaring after U.S. analysts rate Philip shares as a strong buy. <br> 
<hr>
<b>Mac Microscope</b><p>
There is spaceage beacon sending out a signal from inside a tiny basement lab at Hamilton's McMaster University. <br>  It's attracting a lot of attention and money from the local scientific and industrial community and as Jamie West tells us...it's already being seen throughout the world...
<i><br>  A definite reason to celebrate... this is what scientist's have been waiting for.<br>  A scanning electron microscope that sees samples the way they've never been seen before ...like this spacy looking ion exchange bead that to the naked eye is half a millimetre in size.<br>  No more having to dry out or freeze samples to view... <br>  Instead for the first time technicians can get a new moving view of what happens to samples of metals, ceramics, concrete, paper, foods and microgels used in drug delivery. <br>  The 633-thousand dollar microscope is one of only a handful worldwide, and was unveiled officially to local industry, government and students at a special seminar ...industry believes the tool will lead to new products...<br>  The microscope came through a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and will be shared Waterloo, Guelph, Western, U of T and Ryerson. Revenue will be generated from research by private industry.<br>  The aquisition cements McMaster's standing as the leading electron microscopy centre in Canada. </i>
<hr>
<b>Flush & Shut </b><p>
Finally tonight, just when you thought you'd have to throw your husband out, along comes a device to save your marriage. <br>    It's a gadget that Thomas Crapper probably wished he'd thought of when he invested the porcelain commode.<br>  It's called the "Flush & Shut".  Its a special lever that puts the lid down every time you flush the toilet.<br>  The device is being demonstrated at the Seaway Mall in Welland.

<b>Dundas Says No</b><p>
The region of Hamilton- Wentworth debates its future tonight. <br> When council meets within a couple of hours from now, it will consider its course of action on the road to becoming a super city.<br>
But instead of moving towards unanimity, the town of Dundas is actively working to ensure it's not part of a supercity in Hamilton Wentworth. An ad campaign will help spread the anti-super city message and a call for a referendum is likely to be presented to regional council tonight. As Ian Dovey reports last night Dundas council voted unamimously against the mega municipal concept and to advise the province of its desire to remain an independent town.                                     
<I><br>  It's not the first time Dundas has threatened to withdraw from the region,  as this copy of an 1859 separation bylaw infront of Dundas Town Hall states. <br>There wasn't much to discuss, the vote was unamimous Dundas wants to remain distinct and independent from any unified municipal structure. <br>    Mayor Addison has been a strong critic to the process that lead to unified government concept for Hamilton Wentworth telling his council and the public it the least democratic he's ever witnessed.<br>   The mayor had no problems gaining councils support to go it alone. <br>   Addison says he'll now try to persuade the other outlying councils to do the same. <br>    </I>

<hr>
<b>Private Transit</b><p>
The two sides in the HSR dispute hope that a provincial mediator will help them bring a quick end, to the three day transit strike in Hamilton. But behind the scenes there are stories of bad blood between the two sides; and a suggestion that perhaps the HSR might be better off, in private hands. 
<hr>
<b>Fire Master Plan</b><p>
Hamilton firefighters are warning the city that further cuts could put residents at risk.<br>  As Mike Murphy reports the firefighters say the city may save some money...but it could cost lives.
<i><br>  So many firefighters turned out to sound the alarm over potential budget cuts ...they had to find a bigger room.<br>  Then...the firefighters warned a committee of Hamilton council that major cuts in service and manpower could be disastrous.<br>  Their concerns surround Hamilton's master fire plan.<br>  A plan that lays out potential scenerios which could see up to 60 of 440 firefighters lose their jobs..and budget cuts of up to 3 million dollars<br>  Already the city has downsized the fire department. There are fewer vehicles on the road.<br>  And fewer firefighters to pull trapped motorists out of cars.<br>  This alderman says he'll fight any further cuts.<br>  The new fire master plan will be hotly debated when it comes back to the politicians for action early next month.</i>
<hr>
<b>Pharmacy Awards</b><p>
A Hamilton pharmacist has been recognized for bringing his drug store down to the people. <br> His innovative design ideas recognize a shift towards patients having to take more responsibility for their own healthcare as government funding decreases ...<br>  Jamie West explains...
<i><br>  So Hilton Silberg brought his Day Nite Pharmacy down to street level...<br>  A number of innovations have won him a national award of excellence for design...<br>  Among them hands free telephones...<br>  Shy about family planning, drug interaction or even itching? no problem...<br>  A number of counselling areas have been built that range from public to semi-private to very private ...<br>  The pharmacy's old computer system and counter have been donated to Mohawk College's pharmacy assistant program. A valuable donation that will be built into a fake full service pharmacy.<br>   Silberg believes with more governent cutbacks to healthcare.. patients are going to be treating themselves more often and that will create a need for a closer relationship between patients and pharmacists.<br>  </i>

<b>HSR Strike</b><p>
For the first time in 14 years, bus drivers with the Hamilton Street Railway are walking the picket line. <br>  Marathon talks over the weekend collapsed early Sunday morning ...just hours after the union strike deadline.
<i><br>  With the buses idle and the picket lines up, the situation politicians wanted the least has become a reality.<br>  For the first time in fourteen years, drivers with the Hamilton Street Railway are on strike.<br>  Regional chairman Terry Cooke briefed politicians on the situation this morning.<br>  Cooke says he was certain that marathon talks on the weekend were heading toward a settlement.  Cash awards in lieu of benefit reductions and reduced pension contributions were settled.   <br>      And the regional chairman denies reports of a hallway deal late Saturday night that would have led to an agreement.   <br>     Details of the regions' offer will go into newspaper ads tomorrow.<br>  But most union members had the opportunity to vote on it today.<br>  Under provincial law, they must if its a final offer.<br>  Union head Kim Cheeseman says the region forced them into a strike.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Leach Re: Supercity</b><p>
Hamilton- Wentworth Region took another step toward becoming a supercity today.<br> Municipal affairs minister Al Leach has announced his endorsesment of the plan, brokered ten days ago through provincial mediator Gardner Church. He also wants all councils involved to complete deliberations on the plan quickly so that the new structure can be in place for the 1997 elections.<br> As for Dundas and Flamborough, the two dissenting municipalities,              last week, Flamborough indicated it would opt out of a supercity. As for Dundas, that council meets tonight, along with Glanbrook and Ancaster. After a stormy debate last week, regional council put the matter off until next week.
<hr>
<b>Hospital Needs</b><p>
The Niagara District Health Council is doing some restructuring of its own these days.<br> The council is looking at how much it can cut before the province's restructuring commission comes in and does it for them.<br> It's released a report warning that within five years Niagara residents are going to have access to fewer hospital beds and fewer hospitals.<br> Lauran Sabourin has more.
<i><br>  During its eight month review the groups involved in drawing up this report asked themselves three key questions. <br>  What are the trends?><br>  What can be done outside the hospital? <br>  What the needs of Niagara residents in the year 2001.? <br>  What the restructuring committee found is that Niagara could do with fewer acute care beds, fewer chronic care beds, but a significant increase in rehab beds. <br>  All told it would mean that the peninsula would have about 5 percent fewer hospital beds in five years. <br>  In the future those people giving care will be doing it more on an outpatient basis.<br>  Caring for fewer people admitted into the hospital for more than a day.</i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Low interest rates gave investors enough incentive to buy more stocks today sending Canadian share prices to their 59th record high of the year.<br> Analysts expect Canadian share prices to move even higher. <br> 
<hr>
<b>Suspicious Package?</b><p>
The Hamilton Regional Police bomb squard responded to a call at the James Street Armouries this afternoon ... after a suspicious package was spotted in a baby carriage, in the court-yard of the facility. The call forced police to close James Street for over an hour; while the package was retrieved by a police robot.<br> Police blew the box open with a water cannon ... and found nothing.
<hr>
<b>Vanderkley Sentenced</b><p>
A Niagara Falls man has been sentenced to three months in jail after killing a police officer in a hit and run last April. This morning 68 year old Frank Vanderkley was sentenced in a St. Catharines court, and also ordered not to drive for another year and half.<br> Vanderkley struck and killed veteran OPP officer Mike Goula, who was helping another officer with a traffic accident when he was struck by the side of the road in Niagara Falls.
<hr>
<b>Christmas Dolls</b><p>
Have you started your Christmas shopping?  If not, reporter Annette Hamm has a suggestion if you're looking for something very special.  She has the story of a Stoney Creek senior who's been busy all year hand-making her creations with needle, thread and a lot of love.
<i><br>  The sewing machine is rarely idle at Bea McPherson's Stoney Creek apartment.<br>  88 year old McPherson spends most of the year working her magic for this time of year.<br>  She's putting the finishing touches on a spare bedroom full of dolls hoping for new homes this Christmas.<br>  Bea estimates she's refurbished thousands of second hand dolls since 1941, when her husband asked her to send some Canadian dolls overseas.<br>  Now she does donates her dolls to local charities.  <br>  Picking up remnants throughout the year, with the help of her friend Kathleen Cortolucci, Bea fixes up one doll at a time.  <br>  Each one is given special attention in the hopes it will become someones special doll.  <br>  Bea McPherson's dolls will be available at the Christmas Bazaar at Stoney Creek United Church this Saturday.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Thief Back</b><p>
Finally tonight, an update on a crime story we brought you on Halloween.<br> A suspect had smacked his skull while running from Tabby's Variety with a plastic bag over his head.<br> Last night, police say the same suspect returned to the store, this time to buy something.<br> A clerk recognized him, though, and held him for police.<br> 34 year old Shawn Gray of Hamilton is charged with robbery.

<hr>
<b>restructure war</b><p>
The deputy mayor of Flamborough wants his municipality to go it alone, if a Hamilton- Wentworth Region becomes a supercity. <br>  Dave Braden is bitterly disappointed with an agreement that he says has little to do with good government, and everything to do with political ambition.
<br>  And he adds he feels betrayed by both the provincially- appointed mediator, and Hamilton- Wentworth's regional chairman.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>The deputy mayor of Flamborough says politians who negotiated municipal government reform were bullied by the empty threat of provincial intervention, and duped by provincial mediator Gardner Church.  <br>But Braden feels equally betrayed by the regional chairman.  Braden hopes taxpayers will revolt against the supercity concept, and if it goes through, he wants Flamborough set free.  <br>Tory Toni Skarica, whose riding includes Ancaster, Dundas and Flamborough, has reservations about the deal. <br> But Liberal Dominic Agostino favours the agreement, as long as local councils have the final say on whether it comes to pass.  <br>Ontario municipal affairs minister Al Leach has promised to make a statement on the supercity plan on Monday. </i>
<hr>
<b>HSR - Grey Cup</b><p>
Will the Hamilton Street Railway face a strike tomorrow at midnight?<br> Reporter Jamie West says both sides are optimistic that a settlement will come through...
<i><br>  Keeping the buses rolling is what both sides want...<br>  The region has tabled what it calls it's final offer...<br>  The union is seeking terms identical to their last contract. They gathered at the Royal Connaught just before heading into negotiations...<br>  Mediated by Bob Pryor...<br>  They've accused the HSR of trying to strip their pensions...<br>  The HSR will save money through the elimination of some benefits and the reduced pension contributions by employees.<br>  The last HSR strike was in 1982 and lasted 92 days. The union has been in a strike position since june 2nd. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Crowd Control</b><p>
Regional police have their contingency plans for the Grey Cup too. Fearing, but not expecting the worst, a special crowd management squad of 40 Hamilton- Wentworth officers has been preparing for the game and its festivities since January.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i> <br>  The 93 riot in Montreal after the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup.<br>  It's exactly the kind of situation police don't want to see happen in Hamilton Grey Cup weekend.<br>  And this is their insurance.  <br>  Since January, forty officers have been practicing hard tactical manoueuvres, preparing for the very worst Grey Cup weekend may have to offer.  <br>  Police don't know exactly what size crowd they'll be dealing with, but insist they won't be on hand to intimidate them.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Grey Cup Volunteers</b><p>
And the volunteers are ready.  It was wardrobe call at the Hamilton Convention Centre last night. Some 1300 volunteers began suiting up with Grey Cup hats and jackets.  <br>Most are from the Hamilton Wentworth Region, but some are from as far away as north bay.
<hr>
<b>Escaped Custody</b><p>
He was to be picked up on a breach of recognizance, but now a Hamilton man is wanted for escaping custody.<br> This after a suspect bolted while being escorted to a police cruiser last night in Hamilton.<br> A warrant has now been issued for the arrest of 31 year old John Daniel O'Callaghan of Hamilton.
<hr>
<b>Barnesdale Fire</b><p>
Fire resulted in a narrow escape for a Hamilton man... he was taking a shower when the blaze erupted in his 3rd floor apartment in a fourplex at 51 Barnesdale North. He climbed from a window onto the roof. Neither he nor the six others who occupy the building were injured. Careless smoking is the suspected cause. Damage is estimated at 40- thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>Retaining Wall Down</b><p>
The wall came tumbling down today. At one point that buckling retaining wall identified earlier this week along Hamilton's Kenilworth Access appeared ready to topple, leaning at a 45 degree angle this morning. A Hamilton firm has started demolishing the wall.<br>  Once it's down, engineers will examine the foundation to find out why the wall failed.<br>  Officials shut down the access Tuesday night. It's expected to be reopened next Thursday.
<hr>
<b>Bus Banner</b><p>
It you're travelling the roadways of St. Catharines in a few weeks, watch for some winning spirit.<br> St. Francis Secondary School has won a school spirit banner contest.<br>  Today some 300 students signed the banner which will be featured on the side of a St. Catharines Transit bus for a month.
<hr>
<b>Lakeport Buy</b><p>
The future is bright for Hamilton based Lakeport Brewery.<br>  Company founder and president Bill Sharpe, along with his vice-president of finance have acquired the 90 percent of the company owned by Cott Corporation.<br>  The future of the company was in doubt for some time after Cott announced it wished to sell off its interest.<br>  In order to finance the 17 million dollar deal, Sharpe sold the brewing rights of several popular beers to Molson Breweries.<br>  Still, Sharpe says all jobs will be saved as he introduces new products starting in January.
<hr>
<b>Linehan</b><p>
Hamilton native Brian Linehan has built a career out of his unique chats with Hollywood celebrities. <br>  This Saturday marks his return to the steel city with a special premiere edition of a weekly show beginning on CHCH-TV in January. Alex Reynolds interviews the man who interviews the stars.
<i> <br>  The Hamilton native combines a photographic memory with meticulous preparation... movie names responding with amazement to little known facts Linehan reveals during sessions.<br>  But it isn't always easy. <br>  Linehan will be back on the home screen with a weekly series beginning in January.<br>  A kick-off special is set for Saturday night on CHCH-TV.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Library Windfall</b><p>
After decades of borrowing from the Hamilton Public Library ... Ed and Connie Dowler decided, they would give something back. The well known Hamilton residents died within days of each other ... earlier this year and today all proceeds of their estate were officially turned over to the library... a bequest of some 350-thousand dollars. The generous gift will be used to begin an endowment fund at the library; and income generated will be directed to the upkeep and improvement of bookmobile services... a particular favourite of Ed Dowler.

<b>Church - Restructure</b><p>
They're flexing their muscle. Local councils who have something to say about the plan to convert Hamilton- Wentworth into a super city.  And today, the man who brokered the deal said the province, though determined to streamline local government, may listen.<br>    Gardner Church was addressing a joint meeting of the Hamilton and District Chamber of Commerce, and the Hamilton Construction Association.
<br>  His remarks are at odds with comments he made earlier this week, suggesting the merger is a done deal, despite growing resistance to the idea from local councils.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>If Hamilton- Wentworth politicians embrace the supercity deal reached last week, Gardner Church says they'll become the first to provide one-stop shopping for all government services.  And he says instant access to those services is critically important to small businesses, the current leaders in Canadian job creation.  <br>But some local councils reject the supercity concept outright, while others are having second thoughts. Earlier this week, Church suggested it's too late for councils to undo the deal.  Today, he stressed he's no longer an active player in Hamilton- Wentworth's struggle with government reform, and has no inside knowledge of what the province plans to do.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Biz Backs Reform</b><p>
Meanwhile, a group of Hamilton-area business executives endorse the idea of streamlining local government, although not necessarily the specific agreement signed last week.<br>  Individuals respresenting businesses, big and small, plan to take out ads in the Hamilton Spectator and the region's weekly newspapers, applauding political leaders for taking a first step towards government reform.
<hr>
<b>Meningococcal</b><p>
Parents of St. Thomas More Secondary students are reading notices tonight from the public health department. They're investigating the occurence of meningococcal disease among grade 11 students at the Hamilton high school. A teenaged girl was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital earlier this week and a male student, suspected of having the disease was admitted to McMaster Medical Centre last night.  There is no apparent link between the two but those in close contact with the two teens are being treated with a prophylactic medication and area health care professionals are on notice. Meningococcal disease is a serious but rare infection which occurs in the blood or lining of the brain.
<hr>
<b>Joe Brant - Elderly</b><p>
A Burlington family is outraged that Joseph Brant Memorial Hospital has billed their 93 year old mother nearly 9-thousand dollars after she refused to be transferred to a nursing home.<br> As Jamie West reports... the hospital blames bed shortages and funding cuts for their policy...
<i><br>  Pat Morris says she's happy that her 93-year old mother Catherine Duffy is now being cared for in Mt Nemo Lodge about 10 minutes from her home...<br>   Joseph Brant Hospital orginally wanted the family to sign a paper agreeing to have her mother placed in a home up to an hour's drive away. Pat flatly refused...<br>  About 86-hundred dollars...all tolled.<br> And some bad attitude to boot ...<br>  The hospital says it needs the space for acute care patients...<br>  It's already down 60 beds 80 jobs and will cut another 4 million from it's operating budget to please the province. The daily cost of a hospital bed is between 4 and 5 hundred dollars compared to about 60 dollars in a nursing home.<br>  This Toronto based health lawyer says it's illegal for hospitals to bill patients...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>St. Liz Villa 3</b><p>
A coroner's jury today heard the intricate details concerning long term care for the elderly.<br> Form after form was recited to the jury as the inquest probed the deaths of five people at Hamilton's St. Elizabeth Villa seniors' residence.<br> Dwight Ryan has the story..  
<i><br>  In all, 42 deaths occurred at St. Elizabeth Villa between January of 1994 and March of 1995.<br>  This inquest, before Niagara Regional Coroner Bill Lucas is looking into five of those deaths.<br>  Much of Thursday's testimony centred on the placement of those in need in long term care facilities of all sorts.<br>  St. Elizabeth's Villa is licensed as a 2nd level lodging home..not a nursing home. Despite that, public health officials felt many of the residents required more care than the home provided.<br>  Joyce Cahill who is a placement co-ordinator told jury members that even when doctors recognize the need for further care, its the family who is ultimately responsible for the well-being of their relatives.<br>  Two of the deaths in question were residents who doctors said shouldn't have been in the villa. But, at the request of their families, both remained there until the end.<br>  Miss Cahill told the inquest that second level lodging homes do have the right to say take them home, but she's never seen that happen.<br>  Adding, they're too humane.<br>  The inquest, which is scheduled to last more than a month will resume Friday morning.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Heart Drug</b><p>
It was an apirin a day but doctors may soon be prescribing a new drug for heart and stroke patients. A Canadian team headed by researchers at Hamilton Civic Hospitals has tested the blood thinner -- called clopidogrel, it reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes by one-third, compared with one-quarter for aspirin with milder side effects. It'll likely cost a little more though.
<hr>
<b>Smoking</b><p>
Ontario's top public health official is warning of an epidemic of heart disease and lung cancer because we're losing the war on tobacco. Dr. Richard Shabus says after years of decline, tobacco use by teens has shot up 20 per cent in the past two years.  He blames lower taxes and slick promotions.
<hr>
<b>Doctor Charged</b><p>
A doctor who practices in Hamilton faces twelve counts of sexual assault.<br> 55 year old Dr. Lam Dam Nguyen of Mississauga was charged after a woman complained she had been assaulted over the period of a year. Police say the complainant is not one of his patients.
<hr>
<b>Fire Kills Kids</b><p>
Still no word on the cause of yesterday's tragic fire that killed two Brantford toddlers.<br> The bodies of three-year-old Samantha Dixon and her two-year-old sister Natalie were found huddled under a bed in an upstairs bedroom. Police say the girls' mother, Muriel, noticed smoke in the house and managed to escape next door with her nine-month-old daughter Copelyn. But she was overcome by smoke and flames when she tried to rescue her other daughters. The First Baptist Church of Brantford is accepting food and clothing donations for the family and the Bank of Nova Scotia has set up a fund at all of its Ontario branches.  It's transit number 90852, account number 0067385.
<hr>
<b>Emergency Landing</b><p>
In the end there were no injuries but some terrifying moments for eleven passengers on board a U.S. Air flight from Pittsburgh to Hamilton last night.<br> Just before eleven o'clock the pilot radioed the tower saying he had a problem with his landing gear.<br> The twin engine prop circled the airport several times to allow emergency crews to get into position.<br> The aircraft managed to land safely with all landing gear down in tact.
<hr>
<b>Stelpipe Pickets</b><p>
A few tense moments high atop Stelco Tower today. Striking Stelpipe workers gathered on the 24th floor of the building and then locked the elevators for about an hour. When asked to leave they took their protest outside blocking traffic on King Street for a short time. The four hundred workers from the Page Hersey Plant in Welland have been off the job since November 1st. They want better pension packages and increased wages. The workers say they have not had a raise in nine years.
<hr>
<b>Overflow Tank</b><p>
Hamilton West MP Stan Keyes joined regional chairman Terry Cooke and Hamilton mayor Bob Morrow to celebrate the completion of a major construction project at King and Main Streets. The 25 million dollar overflow tank project, funded by all three levels of government will reduce storm water overflow. It will also improve the water quality in Chedoke Creek and Cootes Paradise.
<hr>
<b>Gallery of Dist.</b><p>
Hamilton took time last night to honour some of the people who have made significant lifelong contributions to the steel city.<br> In this, Hamilton's Sesquicentennial year, seven names were added to the Gallery of Distinction: congratulations to former Tigercat owner David Braley, former McMaster University president, Alvin Lee, Firan Corporation founder, Morgan Firestone, businessman Chester Waxman, and Grey Cup 96 co-chair, Marnie Paikin. The gallery posthumously honoured painter Frank Panabaker, and the reverend John Bonomi. <br>   And a distinctive individual at CHCH-TV was also honoured last night at the Annual Spirit of Style Fashion Show for the Lung Association. Community Relations Manager Denise Dickie was presented the community spirit award for her support over the years.

<b>fire kills kids</b><p>
Four deaths in four fires in the last 24 hours have the Ontario Fire Marshall's Office clambering to find out why. <br> The November ice and cold were factors in fighting the blazes but were they factors in the causes?
<br> In the latest, two children have perished in a house fire in Brantford this afternoon.<br> Over come by smoke and flames two young girls aged 4 and three died in a house fire in Brantford's core area.<br>  The Brantford fire department received the call from an occupant of the house just before one o'clock this afternoon.<br>  When firefighters arrived at 27 Durham the two storey clapboard home was fully involved.<br>  The platoon chief says they had to battle the flames before they could attempt any rescue.<br>  The two girls were found in an upstairs bedroom.<br> The house has been completely gutted.
<hr>
<b>Deadly Blaze</b><p>
This time last night, reporter Ian Dovey was on the scene of another. It was the second fatal fire in two years in the valley town of Dundas. And it claimed the life of 46-year-old Debbie Trafford.

<b>Thorold Fire</b><p>
A 72-year-old Thorold woman was rescued from a fire in her home, only to die of her injuries.

<b>Quebec St. Fire</b><p>
And yet another blaze... this one minus serious injuries although one firefighter ended up in hospital with a cinder in his eye.

<b>St. Liz Villa 2</b><p>
Meanwhile, efforts continue in the search for what lead to the deaths of five residents of a Hamilton retirement home. The director of nursing for the Hamilton Wentworth Region admitted to a coroner's inquest that her officials found little evidence to support allegations of substandard care at St. Elizabeth Villa.  Dwight Ryan reports.   
<i><br>  St. Elizabeth Villa is the largest facility of its type in the Hamilton Wentworth Region.<br>  The inquest is investigating the deaths of five people at the second level lodging home between January of 1994 and March of 1995. Although the probe is into just five deaths, 42 residents died during that period. <br>   Officials were alerted when the former nursing director of the villa wrote a letter to the board then the health department detailing alleged problems.<br>  On the stand, the region's nursing director said many of Helen Demchuk's allegations seemed serious and worthy of further investigation. <br>  Vicky Woodcox identified them as abuse, inappropriate handling of food, including recycling leftovers, management style, staffing, resident transfer techniques, infection control and emergency procedures.<br>  Public health officials began an immediate investigation.<br>  Later working with a villa consultant, public health nurses felt that the facility was violating a local bylaw in that many of the residents required more care than their license allowed.<br>  But Wilcox told the inquest that her officials found no evidence whatsover of the stronger allegations contained in the letter that started it all.<br>  No evidence of abuse, no evidence of recycling food or inefficient infection control.<br>  She added that St. Elizabeth Villa officials acted immediately when the region's public health department sent an order to comply following their initial probe.<br>  The inquest, is expected to last more than a month.<br>  </i>

<b>QEW Crash</b><p>
It was a slow ride to work for commuters in Niagara today. A tractor trailer jack-knifed in the Hamilton-bound lanes at Casablanca Boulevard. The westbound lanes were closed and eastbound traffic was reduced to one lane. Despite the rush hour traffic headaches, there were no serious injuries as a result.

<b>White Rose Robbery</b><p>
A few moments of terror for customers of the White Rose Nursery on Hamilton mountain this morning. Two gunmen burst into the store ... ordered everyone to the floor ... and emptied the safe. They escaped in a blue Mercury Mystique .... driven by a third suspect. Police say the three men are white males in their late twenties. The two gunmen wore ski masks ... the driver; however, was clean cut, had black hair, and a slim build. Anyone with information on the hold-up, is asked to call mountain detectives, or Crime Stoppers.

<b>St. Liz Inquest 1</b><p>
Two years ago the city of Hamilton cited a retirement home for violations ranging from recycling food, to failing to arrange proper care for residents whose needs exceeded those normally provided by a second-level lodging home.  Today an inquest opened into five deaths at Saint Elizabeth's Villa on Hamilton mountain.<br> A coroner testified she investigated the deaths of forty-two residents that occured over a sixteen-month period in 1994 and 1995.
<br>  She chose five of those deaths because she felt they were representative of possible problems at the villa.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br> St. Elizabeth's Villa is one of the largest of Hamilton's eighty-nine second level lodging homes. There is no provincial legislation to regulate such homes.  But St. Elizabeth's does have a license, issued by the city of Hamilton.  Dean Barrow is a senior city license inspector.  He testified he inspected St. Elizabeth's in November 1994, after receiving a complaint from the villa's former nursing director.  Barrow says he was impressed with the facility, finding it modern and clean and in compliance with all aspects of the second-level lodging home bylaw.  <br>The violations included recycling rood, delayed response to medical emergencies, the admission of residents who may have needed a higher level of medical care than the home could provide, and the failure to transfer residents whose health had deteriorated.  Barrow says all the deficiencies were corrected in two months, and no charges were ever laid.  But a month-and-a-half later, former regional coroner Doctor Bonita Porter was contacted by Hamilton- Wentworth's Medical Officer of Health, who expressed concern about mortality rates at St. Elizabeth's.  Doctor Porter launched her own investigation into forty-two deaths at the villa, and found a number of areas of concern... concerns like nutrition, whether St. Elizabeth's had enough personnel to provide adequate care to its residents, and whether some of those residents might have been better off in a nursing home.  Doctor Porter hopes the five deaths singled out for this inquest will help illustrate whether or not those concerns are justified.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Nochar Demo</b><p>
Containing a gasoline spill safely is a time consuming process.  Anyone stranded on the QEW yesteday knows just how long it takes. But a new line of chemical products may be about to change that. Matt Hayes was on hand for todays demonstration that proved very timely.
<i><br>  Yesterdays tanker rollover was a nightmare for motorists. The QEW at Burloak was closed for more than 15 hours. The bulk of that time spent cleaning up spilled gasoline. Its one day later ...not far from the accident scene.  These people represent firefighting spill control and waste management services. They're here at the Petro Canada refinery in Oakville to see if their's a better way. Nochar Canada is using this demonstration to unveil a new line of fire and environmental protection products.<br>  In light of yesterdays accident the demonstration couldn't be more timely.  Sher says his product is perfect for tackling spills like this one.<br>  This turtle pool contains gasoline.  Once the Nochar chemical is applied it goes from gas to goo. Easier to cleanup and transport.  Other demonstrations show how fire retardants can slow the burning process.  The boxes that have them chemical applied smoulder but don't burn. As for the second set of boxes.  From fire to spills. New technology may not prevent accidents like this one yesterday but could go a long way to making the cleanup quicker and safer. </i>
<hr>
<b>Police Services</b><p>
The Tory government's who does what panel has handed down its recommendations when it comes to emergency services.  Among them, that local councils set policing budgets to make the system more accountable to the taxpayer. The panel also suggests municipalities appoint police services board members, instead of the province, making the process more open to public input.
<hr>
<b>Bill 84 - St. Kitts</b><p>
In its cost-cutting mission, the Harris government is also aiming at the province's professional firefighters. The firefighters accuse the government pushing through legislation that will allow municipalities to cut costs at the expense of people's lives. Lauran Sabourin has that story.
<i><br>  This is the contentious legislation. Bill 84.<br>  The problems the province's professional firefighters have with Bill 84 is that it diminishes their right to negotiate hours of work.<br>  It allows the hiring of part time firefighters.<br>  And it gives the municipality the option of privatizing the firefighting service.<br>  All of these changes are designed to save money...<br>  But going so fare as to privative the fire service is something that the mayor of St. Catharines rejects. <br>  Professional firefighters spend about 40 percent of their time fighting fires.<br>  The remaining time is spent on other kinds of calls. Extricating people from wrecked vehicles.<br> Trying to resusitate heart attack victims.<br>  Assisting is high angle rescues. <br>  Most people in St. Catharines remember the seeing pictures of firefighters plucking frightened workers off a narrow ledge on the Garden City Skyway after their scaffold collapsed. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Drug Sting</b><p>
It may be cold outside but that's not keeping schoolyard drug users and traffickers from plying their trade. <br> And as Jamie West reports tonight... Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police are turning up the heat in efforts to get the anti-drug message through to teenagers...
<i><br>  9am and the Hamilton Wentworth High Enforcement Action Team are getting ready...<br> The six member team changes it's focus every few months...they've already made a big dent in car thefts,  kept loitering youths off the streets, and are now conducting daily undercover surveillance of 10 high schools, trying to put a damper on drug use...<br>  Education is a big component of the programme,...<br>  So far over 25 arrests...for possesion and trafficking...<br>  And word is getting around that the heat is definitely on...<br>  Marijuana is the drug of choice followed by hasish oil and L.S.D.<br>  The numbers say less than 5% of students are users on a regular basis, but the percentage of first timers is way up...<br>  Even being where you're not supposed to be will get you in trouble with this team...<br>  Identification arrests, prosecution and effective followup are proving to the community that heat means business.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Video Vote</b><p>
Finally tonight, an update now on a story we brought you a few weeks ago, about the controversial animated sex-education video, that some parents claimed was too graphic. Last night, the Wentworth Board of Education approved by a 6-4 margin, a new material-review policy. The ten-point program will allow school councils the opportunity to view, and approve sex-education videos that may be deemed controversial, by board staff.

<hr>
<b>Truck Rollover </b><p>
It's a nightmare on the 403 highway this hour.  It's been closed in both directions at Burloak Drive since early this afternoon when a tanker carrying gasoline flipped over, spilling it's load. Clean-up operations are continuing but it look like the highway will remain closed for some time yet.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Cenotaph</b><p>
Traffic a little lighter today with the November the 11th holiday.<br> Hundreds packed downtown cenotaphs across the country to remember the 100-thousand Canadians who lost their lives so than we could live in freedom today.  At Gore Park in Hamilton, veterans, politicians and students alike gathered for a re-dedication of the cenotaph. Dedicated orginally to honour our first world war heroes, as of the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, 1996, Hamilton's war memorial now officially commemorates those who died in valour in world war two and korea.
<hr>
<b>Niag. Cenotaph</b><p>
At the St. Catharines cenotaph, a double blast from a Howitzer gun launched Remembrance Day services. It was sunny but cold as some 500 people, of all ages stood silently with heads vowed as our thoughts turned to the ultimate sacrifices made by so many, so long ago.
<hr>
<b>Cadets Vigil</b><p>
Services began last night for members of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet corps renown, of St. Catharines and for Stoney Creek's 713 air cadet squadron.  These young people decided to do something special for this year's November the 11th. They stood guard at the town cenotaph from 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon until 11 o'clock this morning.
<hr>
<b>St. Creek Fire</b><p>
A Stoney Creek family won't forget this Remembrance Day.<br> They've lost everything in a fire, including some Chistmas gifts. An investigator with the Ontario Fire Marshall's Office spent much of today sifting through the ashes of their barton street east home.<br> By the time Stoney Creek firefighters arrived on the scene last night, it was totally engulfed in flames.<br> The three people who live there, a mother and her two sons were out of town for the weekend.<br> Damage is set at 130-thousand dollars.  A neighbour, Ann Tebow is accepting donations on behalf of the family.  The two boys are aged 4 and 17.  The family has been left with only the clothing on their backs.
<hr>
<b>Marvin Caplan</b><p>
Efforts to revitalize downtown Hamilton are too little, too late for one well-known retailer.<br> Marvin Caplan Gentlemen's Apparel will close by the end of the year, a victim of both changing consumer shopping patterns, and the city's failure to react more quickly to the deterioration of the downtown core.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>They're liquidating the inventory at Marvin Caplan Gentlemen's Apparel.  They're also liquidating three full-time jobs, several part-time positions, and an eighteen-year-old business.  The company's president, who's also a Hamilton alderman, says he can't afford to keep losing money while the city dickers over what to do about the downtown.  And he wishes the city would simply let its staff do the job they're paid to do.  <br>Caplan says the city merely needs to create the conditions necessary to allow business to thrive.  The businesses themselves will do the rest.  <br>And Hess Village is not the only high point. Caplan points out the International Village, and James Street North and South are thriving, proving it's premature to sound the death knell for the downtown core. </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Canadian banks and government offices were closed for Rememberence Day.<br>  Howevever stocks markets were opened and stock prices surged to new record highs again in Toronto and New York.<br> Some market watchers believe interest rates can still edge lower.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Remembrance - Schools</b><p>
Time heals all wounds... that old saying may be true when it comes to the body.., but many men and women that served know too well that the same cannot always be said for one's emotions. <br>  The memories for most are still as vivid as the events that created them. As Jamie West reports...some young Hamiltonians are helping to preserve those memories...
<i><br>  Two ceremonies, one in song... one in silence ... both recognizing Canadian freedom and the sacrifice it took to preserve it.<br>  Fifty-one years since the end of World War Two. Eight lifetimes for many of the students at George R. Allan School... <br>  At St. John the Baptist School ...a tulip garden has been planted. <br>  To them Officer Bob is a crossing guard... but the pride is taking root.</i>

<b>Hamilton One Tier</b><p>
After more than two decades, municipal government as we know it in Hamilton- Wentworth is about to disappear.  Bleary-eyed municipal politicians met into the wee hours of this morning with provincial mediator Gardner Church, and finally came up with an agreement which almost everyone could live with.
<br>  We have special reports tonight beginning with Deborah Walker who was there for the twelve-and-a- half hour marathon session, and has this report.
<i> <br>For the first seven hours, they staked out their positions, conferring in corridors... or closeting themselves away from others outside their own municipality. Gradually, all the suburban politicians congregated in one room, with occasional emissaries from Hamilton dispatched from the floor above. By midnight, everyone re-assembled for a last-ditch effort at reconciling their differences.  <br>But an hour later, the deal-making nearly collapsed, as Dundas and Flamborough walked out on the talks.  <br>The rest soldiered on, and at four-thirty this morning, they reached an historic agreement.  <br>Under the proposal, Hamilton- Wentworth's six municipalities will disappear, replaced by one, as yet un-named municipality, governed by one local council, with less than half the current number of politicians.  The former suburbs will retain their historic names, and have the choice of setting up community councils, to deal with local issues.  <br>In exchange for giving up their boundaries, the former suburbs will have the same number of seats on the new council as Hamilton has.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Dundas / Flamborough</b><p>
The new arrangement reflects the view of 85 percent of Hamilton Wentworth's residents.  But, as Deborah reported, two communities were thumbs down on the deal.  Dwight Ryan has their story..  
<i><br>  When the historic document was signed  some signatures were notably absent.<br>  Delegates from Dundas and Flamborough left in the middle of the night saying they could no longer take part in the process.<br>  Mediator Gardner Church respected their view saying their departure was magnificently civilized.  <br>  Flamborough mayor Ted McMeekin favours the deal and stayed till the end. But his two colleagues walked.<br>  Today a weary mayor McMeekin said he still likes the new arrangement.  <br>  The new supercity, with or without Dundas and Flamborugh comes into effect on January 1st, 1998.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Teachers Vote</b><p>
Whatever happens to school boards in the future, today, secondary teachers voted overwhelmingly to reject the Hamilton Public School Board's last offer.<br> They also voted 86-percent in favour of strike action.<br> Both votes were supervised by the Education Relations Commission, the provincial body overseeing teacher-board negotiations. the high school teachers will be in a legal position five days after giving the board notice.
<hr>
<b>Van Shooting</b><p>
Police in Niagara have relased the name of the murder victim found shot to death early yesterday morning in Fort Erie. He is 48-year-old Frederick Steven Grondin of Port Colborne.  Police say Grondin was last seen leaving the Donut Diner on Garrison Road in Fort Erie at about 5:15 yesterday morning. His body was found at the side of Highway Three about 15 minutes later. Between midnight and 4 a.m., he had been at the Plaice Restaurant Charity Casino. Police want to speak to anyone who saw Grondin in the 24 hours before he died... they also want to speak to the driver of a white pick up truck with dual wheels that was apparently at the scene where the body was discovered before police arrived.
<hr>
<b>Machete Sentence</b><p>
A Hamilton man who admitted to murdering his wife will not be eligible for parole for 15 years.<br>  Mr. Justice John Cavarzan, in sentencing 53 year old Carmelo Reyes, described the machete attack as an act of "appalling and unspeakable cruelty".<br>  47 year old Alba Fuentes-Reyes died after being struck by a van and struck repeatedly with a machete.<br>  Before his sentencing, Carmelo Reyes broke down momentarily, admitting he was wrong and was willing for pay for what he had done.
<hr>
<b>Inquest Goes</b><p>
An Ontario divisional court judge has rejected a bid by Hamilton's St. Elizabeth Villa to derail a coroner's inquest into the deaths of five residents last year. Judge John O'Driscoll called the application "vexatious, frivilous and entirely without merit". The inquest will proceed as scheduled, starting Tuesday. The villa claims the deaths were the result of natural causes and that the coroner plans to use the probe to push for changes in municpal bylaws that control how retirements homes are run.
<hr>
<b>Rick Hansen</b><p>
Finally tonight, Canadian hero Rick Hansen, was in Hamilton last night, as guest speaker at a fundraising dinner hosted by our own Paul Hendrick.<br> It's been ten years since his two year, 33-country Man in Motion tour came through Hamilton.<br> Hansen's 40-thousand kilometre trek raised more than 16-million dollars for spinal cord research.

"Very serious" is the way police in Halton describe the injuries to the driver of a mini-van that collided with a gravel truck on Ford Drive in Oakville near the auto plant today. They say that both vehicles were travelling in the same direction at the time... and are at a loss to explain why the mishap occurred. The truck driver was uninjured.
<hr>
<b>Burton Search</b><p>
Police in Hamilton Wentworth stepping up efforts in the search for a missing Stoney Creek woman. 41 year old Kathryn Burton disappeared October 3rd.<br> Police say she is unemployed and was depressed around the time of her disappearance.<br> A neighbour reported Burton missing from her apartment where she lived by herself.<br> If you know anything about the whereabouts of Kathryn Burton, you're asked to call police.
<hr>
<b>Restructure Deadline</b><p>
Tonight is a make-or-break night for Hamilton- Wentworth politicians, trying to agree on how to re-design local government in the region.<br>  As councillors prepared to meet behind closed doors for a third straight night tonight, a provincially- appointed mediator said it would only take a matter of hours to announce whether they'd reached concensus, or an impasse.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br> They're burning the candle at both ends... carrying on regional business by day, then bargaining over the future of Hamilton- Wentworth until midnight each night.  The regional chairman says as long as they're still talking, there's still hope.  <br>If there's any concensus, details will be released to the public. If there's an impasse, Church will head straight to Queen's Park and report to Ontario's municipal affairs minister. Whichever alternative comes to pass, the discussions that produce it remain locked behind closed doors.  </i>
<hr>
<b>HSR Update</b><p>
A mediator will try next week to avert a strike the could bring Hamilton busses to a halt during Grey Cup week.<br> Hamilton Street Railway bus drivers have set a November seventeenth strike deadline.<br> Union leaders say members have no intention of accepting concessions.<br> But Hamilton- Wentworth Region faces the possibility of another seven-million dollar cut from the province.<br> And at least one councillor believes the failure to accept concessions now, could ultimately lead to the death of the HSR.
<hr>
<b>Halton School Update</b><p>
Groups opposed to school closures in the Halton Region are joining forces to pressure trustees to keep them open.<br>  Six schools are scheduled to close, but the groups say its not the answer.<br>  Dwight Ryan reports from burlington.
<i> <br>     The children are singing in the gym at Lakeshore Public School in Burlington.<br>  They've been making music for generations at one of the city's oldest schools.  <br>    The board is facing a 24 million dollar shortfall.<br>  Parent groups from all six schools are joining forces to fight the cuts.<br>  They believe school closures are not the answer.   <br>  And so with a well organized campaign they are trying to convince trustees to vote against closures.   <br>       Still, the director of education believes closures are the answer.   <br>      Parent groups will have the opportunity to voice their opinions in communtiy meetings.<br>  A final answer from the board will come before Christmas.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Noranda Closure</b><p>
More than 200 employees at Fraserpapers may be looking for work if the company can't find a buyer for its Thorold mill.<br>  Mounting losses are promping the sale at the specialty papers mill.<br>  The mill only produces about half its capacity for specialty papers. It will take a multi million dollar capital investment to make the operation competitive.<br>  If a buyer isn't found by the end of January the mill will likely close.
<hr>
<b>Seaway Jobs</b><p>
Meanwhile no major job losses expected in Niagara when the St. Lawrence Seaway is turned over to a consortium in the new year. Seaway chief Glendon Stewart admits some local jobs could disappear and others might be contracted out.<br> But he says for the most part operations will remain the same.<br> The seaway employs 355 full-time employees in the Niagara Region with a payroll of 20 million dollars.
<hr>
<b>Guilty Poll</b><p>
All around the world, too many of us feel guilty about tour pleasures in life and that could make us sick. A survey conducted by associates for research into the science of enjoyment, or arise, questioned 4-thousand people about such indulgences as smoking, chocolate, drinking and lack of exercise and found we're plagued by guilt. Australaian were the most remorseful with 27 per cent showing angst about their indulgence; the Dutch feel the least guilt, at 13 per cent. Stress, arise believes, can undermine the positive benefits of enjoyment which can protect the immune system. The organization just warns of the dangers of overinulgence.
<hr>
<b>Workers Museum</b><p>
It's been in and out of the news for decades, and now another chapter is about to be written in the history of Hamilton's old Custom House.  After eight years, workers are putting the finishing touches to the Ontario Workers Arts and Heritage Museum, set to open tomorrow in the landmark northend building.<br>  Annette Hamm reports.
<i> <br>  There's a lot of work still to be done at the Ontario Workers Arts and Heritage Centre in north Hamilton.<br>  The floors need to be cleaned.  The elevator for disabled visitors has to be installed.<br>  But it's frenzied work like this that the centre is built on.<br>  It's the only museum of its kind in Canada designed to honour the everyday labourer.  <br>  Among the first displays, what a 1930's working class household would have looked like.<br>  An exhibit by Carole Conde and Karl Beveridge on the strike of 46 is still being set up.<br>  And upstairs there'll be a resource centre for labour.<br>  The building itself, Hamilton's old Custom House, is steeped in labour tradition.  <br>  The Ontario Workers Arts and Heritage Centre opens to the public Friday afternoon at 5:30.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Xmas Seal Launch</b><p>
Matt Hayes found himself in a sticky situation today. The Lung Association decided to have a little fun at the launch of their Christmas Seal Campaign.  Three teams pasted local celebreties with the christmas stamps in a three minute contest in the Spectator cafeteria. Spec columnist Wade Hemsworth and his team "The Airbags" won the competion. The Lung Association hopes you'll use your christmas seals on letters and packages instead this holiday season.
<hr>
<b>Dunnigan - Davoe</b><p>
Finally tonight, a few weeks ago we brought you the story of Justin Devoe, the little Hamilton boy battling brain cancer, with his mom Charlene at his side. Today, Justin gained another supporter, Ticat Matt Dunnigan dropped by the cancer centre at Henderson Hospital, while Justin was ungergoing his daily radiation treatment and presented him with a team sweater. Friends of the family have setup a fund to help pay some of the bills for Justin. All CIBC branches from Toronto to Niagara are accepting donations on the family's behalf.

<b>Hamilton - Charity</b><p>
We begin tonight with a good news story. <br> When it comes to giving to charity, the people of Hamilton- Wentworth have a lot to be proud of.
<br> Figures released by Statistics Canada indicate we are among the most benevolent in the country.<br> Dwight Ryan has the story.  
<i><br>  Canadians as a whole donated three and a half billion dollars to charities in 1995...that's up three percent from the year before.<br>  Seniors were the most generous, averaging 910 dollars, well above the national average of 650 dollars.<br>  The median donation, that which half were higher and half lower was 150 dollars.<br>  Surprisingly the highest median amount was St. John's Newfoundland at 220 dollars a person.  Next was Saskatoon Saskatchewan at 210 dollars followed by Hamilton at 200 dollars.  St. John New Brunswick and Windsor, Ontario were tied with Hamilton.  <br>  Whether its supporting the United Way, a hospital or just buying Girl Guide cookies, the people of Hamilton Wentworth take pride in the fact they are amongst the most generous in the country.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Wesley Centre</b><p>
The legal existence of a Hamilton drop-in centre, that sometimes shelters more than a hundred homeless people a night, has been questioned by staff at Hamilton City Hall.<br> Neighbourhood complaints about the centre prompted city staff to issue an "order to comply" against Wesley Urban Ministries.<br> But at a meeting today, staff conceded the city simply has no bylaw to control the location and operation of drop-in centres.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>It's lunch-time at Wesley Urban Ministries in Hamilton.  Up to two hundred people will stop in for a hot meal.  But neighbours are complaining about another Wesley Urban Ministries program... a drop-in centre for street people that's open from midnight to noon. The complaints are numerous enough that Hamilton city staff have questioned Wesley's right to operate the centre under its present zoning conditions.  <br>Allan says it's reached the point where anything that goes wrong in the Wesley neighbourhood is blamed on clients at the drop-in centre.  <br>After hearing an appeal from Wesley Urban Ministries, Hamilton aldermen learned there is no bylaw on the books governing the existence of drop-in centres. They've directed city staff to study the possibility of enacting one.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Ford Settles </b><p>
Autoworkers in Canada can breathe a collective sigh of relief tonight. They reached a tentative agreement with Ford just hours ahead of the union's strike deadline.  If ratified, the deal wraps up bargaining with the big three carmakers.  
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Falling interest rates fueled yet another record high close on the Toronto Stock Exchange today.<br> Canadian banks announced another cut in mortgage rates pulling borrowing costs down to 35-year lows.<br> A new Stoney Creek company plans to hire more people as it trys to keep up with the demand for its unique portable fence.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Welland Scissors</b><p>
A Welland man has been charged following a savage domestic dispute attack.<br> Thirty-six-year- old Linda Even was suffered scissor wounds to her forehead, arms, hands and thighs last night.<br> A man, who fled after the attack, was found by a police canine unit, with self-inflicted wounds.<br> Thirty-eight- year-old Paul Mercier, the woman's former common law husband, is charged with attempted murder.
<hr>
<b>Domestic Assault</b><p>
A Hamilton woman was taken to hospital with several cuts and bruises, and her common law husband arrested after a domestic assault early this morning in downtown Hamilton.<br> Police had to force their way into an apartment after someone called saying they saw the woman being forced down a flight of stairs and into the unit.<br> 24 year old James Mann is charged with forcible confinement and assault level two.
<hr>
<b>Downtown Breakins</b><p>
Four people in custody after a pair of break-ins at downtown Hamilton stores overnight.<br> Police nabbed three men running from "Discount Sellers" on King Street East.<br> 20 year old Kelly Frederick Charles of Toronto, and two 15 year olds from Hamilton are charged with break and enter with intent.<br> In the second break-in, an officer on patrol noticed a window shattered at "Unique Hair Design" on James Street, then spotted a man inside.<br> 31 year old Joseph Arnold Carter, of no fixed address is charged with break enter and theft.
<hr>
<b>MADD- Grey Cup</b><p>
Mothers Against Drunk Driving is warning Grey Cup revellers to take it easy during the Hamilton celebrations.<br>  At a news conference this morning at Ivor Wynne Stadium, representives of MADD kicked off their annual red ribbon campaign against drinking and driving.<br>  Alcohol plays a role each year in the Grey Cup celebrations, and the anti-drunk driving group is reminding partiers to act responsibly.  <br>  
<hr>
<b>Kids go to Work</b><p>
Across the nation today, grade nine students went to work.<br> No...there isn't a labour shortage ..just an opportunity for young people to spend one day in the work world with a parent, relative or friend. <br> All day we've had a number of young people learning about television news, and one in particular seems to have caught on pretty well...<br> Jamie West has the story...
<i><br>  This is Kelly, my cousin, she's fourteen and just like many of her friends, hasn't given much thought to what career path to follow....<br>  Today...however she'll give news reporting a try ...<br>  The newsroom veterans were happy to mix and mingle with a number of youngsters paired up with various members of the CHCH TV news team.<br>  But once the introductions were out of the way it was time to get to work... <br>   Our first stop was in Hamilton's industrial core, Dofasco, where Phil Smith spent the day teaching his daughter about the intricacies of being a production engineer in the coke ovens...<br>  Next stop the Hamilton Wentworth Roman Catholic Seperate School Coard.<br>  Michael Davidson like thousands of grade nine students in 6 provinces has spent the day with his dad superintendant of finance Tony Davidson...<br>  The three year old program has grown in popularity with educators and businesse alike, ...<br>  Now back to Kelly she learned about deadlines...<br>  How to manage her time...<br>  Get the interviews write the story...<br>  And then work with perhaps the most important members of the team the editors. And finally how to get the story to air.<br>  </i>

<hr>
<b>H.W. Restructure </b><p>
The face of local government in Hamilton- Wentworth could change significantly if a meeting underway in Hamilton at this hour produces results.
<br>  Provincially appointed mediator Gardiner Church has called together political delegations from every municipality in the region for a closed door meeting at a downtown Hamilton hotel. They're trying to find the common ground necessary to carry them to a united vision on restructuring local government. <br>The mediator has forbidden politicians from talking to reporters as long as there is hope they can reach a compromise.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Restructure?</b><p>
Meanwhile in the peninsula politicians are balking at the idea of a Niagara supercity.<br>  Twenty five years ago 26 towns in the Niagara amalgamated to form 12 municipalities and Niagara Region.<br>  And as Lauran Sabourin reports the feeling is that's enough change for now.
<i><br>  Niagara regional politicians started talking seriously about cost cutting last December.<br>  A committee was struck to look at ways where the region and municipalities could possibly save money. <br>  They were looking at sharing services. But one of the ideas that came up was that Niagara's 12 municipalities should be amalgamated into one huge city of Niagara.<br>  Niagara regional councillor Peter Partington chaired that municipal reform committee.<br>  He doesn't see the supercity option working in the peninsula.<br>  The 370 thousand people who live in Niagara have a strong affinity to their own town.<br> St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Welland and the smaller communities all have their own identities. <br>  Even Niagara's regional chairman Brian Merrett isn't pushing for a one tiered regional government or city called Niagara.<br>  He realizes that Niagara is different from Toronto, different from Hamilton. Where community identity is very strong.<br>  The region has been looking forward.<br>  The Kitchen Report completed in 1989 had a vision for the year 2000. In his conclusions the author Harry Kitchen saw region wide government as a more efficient option. <br>  Pushing toward a Niagara supercity would only meet resistance right now.<br>  The region itself is 25 years old.<br>  As a political entity its still young.<br>  It's an idea that wouldn't work right now.<br>  But nobody's ruling out the larger city in the future.</i>
<hr>
<b>Welfare / Transit </b><p>
Municipalities, including Hamilton- Wentworth, will have to pay the full cost of public tranist, sewer and water services, if the Ontario government accepts the latest recommendations of its "who does what" commission.<br> In exchange, the province would foot the full bill for children's aid societies, and shelters for abused women.<br> Currently, the province pays half the cost of running the Hamilton Street Railway, down from seventy-five per cent just two years ago.   <br>  The region would also have to pick up the capital costs of buying new busses, a cost that is currently shared fifty-fifty with the province.
<hr>
<b>Brantford PUC</b><p>
A shake-up in Brantford.  City council there is moving ahead with plans to take-over management of the public utilities commission, in hopes of saving close to a million dollars a year in duplication of services.  The amalgamation is seen as the only way to deal with a total of nine million dollars in provincial cuts in recent years. Mayor Chris Friel says most of the PUC's 168 employees will not be affected. 14 senior management jobs will go though.<br> Commission chairman Ted Oliver  is hinting at fighting the plan.
<hr>
<b>Reyes Verdict</b><p>
A Hamilton man will be sentenced Friday after admitting to hacking his wife to death with a machete.<br> 53 year old Carmelo Reyes, pleaded guilty to a crime that crown attorney Denis Allan described as ``unbelievable brutality in a public place.''<br> In early December 1994, Alba Fuentes-Reyes was struck down by a van driven by her estranged husband and then slashed to death in front of her home.<br> The prosecution and defence jointly asked for a life sentence with no chance of parole for at least 15 years.<br> Several people rushed to defend the 47-year-old mother of four.<br> University student Alexander Lee, was treated for 26 stitches after he tried to stop the attack. He's been nominated for an award from the Carnegie Hero Fund out of Pennsylvia.
<hr>
<b>Missing Woman</b><p>
Police need help in locating a Stoney Creek woman, missing for more than a month now.<br> 41 year old Kathryn Burton was last seen October 3rd.<br> Police say she is unemployed and was depressed around the time of her disappearance.<br> A neighbour reported Burton missing from her apartment.<br> If you think you've seen Kathryn Burton, please call Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police at 546-4925.
<hr>
<b>Burton St. Arson</b><p>
Fire officials investigating another suspected arson in Hamilton's north end. Last month, police say a fire was deliberately set at the vacant Burton Street Markethon Flea Market.<br> Then last night witnesses say they saw a couple of teenagers running from the building just before flames shot out the second floor window.<br> Damage in this latest fire is estimated at 30-thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>St. Elizabeth</b><p>
The owners of a Hamilton retirement home are going to court to try to stop an inquest into the deaths of five residents.  The inquest, called last March is scheduled to begin next week. St. Elizabeth Villa claims the deaths were the result of natural causes and the coroner hopes to use the probe to push for changes in municpal bylaws that control how retirements homes are run.
<hr>
<b>Flasher</b><p>
Police in St. Catharines are looking for a sex deviant. So far he has not harmed anyone.<br> Women who have encountered the man say he exposes himself and makes sexually suggestive comments, but doesn't try to touch them.<br> In the latest incident a woman says the man walked toward her wearing no pants or underwear.<br> He has also been seen driving a small red car that might have a baby seat in the back.<br> He is described as in his mid 30's with brown hair.<br> Police are warning women to be cautious if they are out at night.
<hr>
<b>Bogus Bucks Niagara</b><p>
A former nursing home manager from St. Catharines will be sentenced January 20th after pleading guilty in a funny money scheme.<br> Niagara regional and 10 other police services were involved in the investigation that turned up more than half-a-million dollars in the bogus dough.<br> Mary Grant made the money with the help of a high-tech copier.<br> An associate is already serving three-and- one-half years.<br> Grant's son Myles was sentenced to eight months.<br> He is also charged with planting a phony bomb at St. Catharines General Hospital October 3rd.
<hr>
<b>Success at Shaw</b><p>
It's been the real thing at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake.<br>  and lots of it. So far revenues have hit a record-breaking 9.2 million dollars, surpassing last year's high by more than 160-thousand dollars.<br> Agatha Christie's, "The Hollow" has been such a success it is held over until November 24th.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
The party in Canadian financial markets grew wilder today with the dollar surging above 75 cents U.S.<br>  Interest yields paid on 30 year government bonds fell to their lowest level ever.<br>  Stocks smashed through new record highs led by more exraordinary gains in Canadian bank shares.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Smoking</b><p>
Could a smoking ban in restaurants actually increase business? <br> A new survey compiled by the Hamilton- Wentworth Public Health Unit seems to indicate just that.<br>  Annette Hamm explains.
<i><br>  It's just an estimate, but Hamilton Wentworth's healthy lifestyles branch says a smoking ban will bring in at least 685-thousand dollars to the region's hospitality industry.<br>  The numbers come from average restaurant receipts and a random telephone survey of smokers and non smokers.<br> That phone poll showed 27 per cent of Hamilton Wentworth residents smoke.  <br>  The region's telephone survey found 69 percent of restaurant customers who asked for non smoking seating found it unacceptable.<br>  Just over a third have left restaurants because they couldn't get a seat in the non smoking section.<br>  And 26 per cent have left restaurants because the smoke bothered them.<br>  The public health department will be meeting with Hamilton Wentworth municipalities later this month to come up with a draft bylaw to go smoke free by the year 2-thousand.<br>  </i>

<b>Climate Change</b><p>
It's been a chilly November but some Canadian scientists are worried it's getting too warm. <br> They've launched a study on the impact of global warming on the golden horseshoe.
<BR>They say the temperatures of the great lakes are rising, the water levels are falling and there in an increasing cloud of rain and smog blanketing southern Ontario.<br> Lauran Sabourin reports on day one of a two day conference on global warming in Toronto.
<i><br>  Floods, droughts, heat waves, scientists have no dought that global warming actually exists. <br>  This summer's flooding in Quebec is a event that scientists are looking at closely.<br>  The experts can't say with certainty that global warming contributed to the flooding conditions.<br>  But they are looking for weather patterns that point in that direction. <br>  Over the next two days environmentalists scientists, members of the insurance industry are meeting in Toronto to discuss what they can do to mitigate the impact of global warming on the golden horseshoe. <br>  Scientists in Canada are already seeing the impact of global warming in the north west part of the country.<br>  They predict that if the temperature of the earth continues to rise a few degrees the impact will be devastating.<br>  Not only will future generaations struggle simply t maintain a viable source of food in Canada.<br>  Future generations will struggle simply to survive. </i>
<hr>
<b>H.W. Restructure</b><p>
There is a changing political climate evolving in Hamilton- Wentworth. The regional chairman has cancelled tomorrow night's council meeting, so politicians can push ahead with talks aimed at streamlining local government.<br> A provincially- appointed mediator met individually with representatives of all six municipal councils on the weekend.<br>  Tomorrow, he'll bring all six together for another round of talks.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.<br>
<i> One suburban mayor describes Gardner Church favourably as a man in a hurry.  <BR>Evidently, Church has found reason to continue. Regional business will grind to a temporary halt with the cancellation of Tuesday night's council meeting. Instead, each of Hamilton- Wentworth's six municipalities will send a delegation to another round of negotiations, under the guidance of Church.  And there's probably good reason for political co-operation. Hamilton- Wentworth councillors are no doubt aware of the provincial government's proposal to merge Toronto's six municipalities into one super-city. But as long as Gardner Church is still on the job, Ontario's municipal affairs minister says it's premature to think about imposing the super-city model on Hamilton- Wentworth.  <BR>Leach says he expects a progress report from Church by the end of the week.  At that point, the two will decide how best to proceed. </i>

<b>Hospital Pickets</b><p>
There was a picket outside Chedoke Hospital on Hamilton mountain today to protest the results of a changing hospital structure: contracting out housekeeping services. Their union claims that workers were threatened with disciplinary action if they participated in today's demonstration and that they've been replaced by minimum wage workers employed by contractor Marriott Incorporated. A CUPE national rep says that patient care will suffer as a result.
<hr>
<b>Porno Bust</b><p>
Police say they are shocked over the nature of computer child pornography seized in a major bust in northern Ontario, possibly the largest ever in North America. OPP seized 20-thousand computer files. A Kirkland Lake man has been charged. 
<hr>
<b>Fergus Murder</b><p>
A 52-year-old Fergus man appeared in court today, charged with the first-degree murder of his estranged wife.<br> Gordon Ray Abbott was arrested Saturday afternoon without incident.<br> Forty-year-old Patricia Abbot was shot several times with a small calibre weapon when she went home for lunch from her job as a legal secretary, October 23rd.
<hr>
<b>Police Warning </b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth police are urging doctors who perform abortions to be cautious in the wake of the anniversary of two shootings of Canadian gynecologists.<br> 63-year old Dr. Hugh Short was hit in the arm by a sniper's bullet last year as he sat with his wife in their Ancaster home. The bullet that struck short, who has yet to return to work, was fired from a ravine behind his house. It happened two days after the first anniversary of a Vancouver abortion doctor's near fatal wounding by a sniper. Police in Hamilton- Wentworth have implemented additional security measures but are not offering any details.
<hr>
<b>Senior Drivers</b><p>
For seniors over 80, it was an annual worry.<br> Now the Ontario government has replaced the mandatory drivers test with a group education session every two years. As Annette Hamm reports, transportation minister Al Palladini says the new program will help keep seniors mobile, and our roads safe.<br> 
<i>> For the past three years, 83 year old Joe Shepherd has had to take a driver's examination to prove his skills are up to speed.<br>  While he says the test hasn't been stressful for him, it is for many seniors.<br>  It's hoped this class will put an end to that.<br>  These seniors are part of the first driver education session in Ontario, interupted for a P.R. appearance by the two ministers responsible for the program.  <br>  Every two years now, drivers 80 years and over will take a vision and knowledge test, part of a 90 minute group session focussing on issues facing older drivers.  <br>  Transportation minister Al Palladini expects only about ten percent of the drivers who take the new session will have to take a road test.<br>  His ministry is also looking at introducing sessions for drivers under 80.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
With the anticipation of yet another reduction in Canadian interest rates, investors shifted more money into blue chip Canadian stocks today.<br>  The value of shares in Toronto rose to the 51st record of they year.<br> <hr>
<b>Heart Matters</b><p>
Heart attacks are growing in numbers...and as the baby boom generation turns grey those numbers will likely double or triple current rates. <br> The Hamilton Public Health Unit has been reaching out to heart attack victims with a support program called "Heart Matters".  As Jamie West reports, it's helping dozens of people to regain their confidence...
<i><br>  That's why they meet every month at St. Joeseph's Health Centre...<br>  They're all victims of heart attacks... <br>  But it's other common experiences they've come to share...<br>   In the case of Audrey Hickling she didn't suffer the heart attack, but suffers the consequences of her husband Doug's....<br>  But Doug has risen to regain his life and he credits the heart matters program ...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Veteran's Week</b><p>
Finally tonight, Jean Chretien has declared this week, Veteran's Week in Canada. <br> In Hamilton, the downtown Veteran's Affairs offices opened it's doors to host an informal open house.<br> Veteran's and their families, legion members, schools and the general public were welcomed in to revisit the stories of glory and sacrifice that Canadian soldiers made during decades of confict throughout the world.<br> Of great concern to veteran's this year is that many of Canada's young people have forgotton or have little knowledge of Canada's contribution to the preservation of freedom...

<b>Mac Fundraising</b><p>
A Hamilton MP is screaming for legislation today, that makes charities more financially accountable to the public. <br> Hamilton Wentworth Liberal MP, John Bryden is claiming that in many cases less than 30 percent of money raised gets used as donors intended.

<br> Among the examples he sites --- Hamilton's Chedoke McMaster Hospitals Foundation.... Jamie West has the story...
<i><br>  Stop the music says John Bryden less than half that amount actually goes to patient care furthermore...the majority of the cash has been paying for the costs of the telethon and lately the 818-thousand dollar severance package given to Chedoke McMaster's former CEO Dr. Jennifer Jackman .. <br>  Although Bryden took his figures from a 1994 tax return filed by the hospital, the foundation insists Bryden's accounting is way off and less than 25 cents on the dollar goes to cover administration costs...<br>  Bryden is sticking to his guns and insists new legislation is long overdue to ensure better accountability...<br>  After their fixed costs the foundation says the money they raise only goes to patients...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Violence Concludes</b><p>
There was no budget for this. in fact the rule was, these solutions couldn't cost a dime. But tonight, 100 citizens of Hamilton- Wentworth have a new mission. Educators, doctors, nurses, councillors, students and broadcasters who have each agreed to take on a project to help stop violence in their communities.                         Among the commitments by CHCH-TV at the conference: to set up a public stakeholers consultation process, including an advisory committee focusing on standards for our news and sports and we will work to improve our news coverage to promote a better understanding of the causes and effects of violence.
<i><br>  Two days of talking, defining identifying specific issues,  devising, refining, specific practical do-able actions.  The end result, a lot of paper to be recycled and a grassroots collaborative plan these 100 citizen delegates believe can help create a more positive environment in our schools, our streets, our homes, an environment that will help end the cycle of violence, the experts say is perpetuated by images and sounds like these.  <BR>A student media relations committee to promote positive achievements by our young people for others to emulate.... nutrition programs in schools to curb the problems caused by empty stomachs, improved access to recreation for at risk youth, and more training for coaches, community councils to bring nieghbourhoods together.  Could the solutions be so simple. It may take months or even years to implement all the actions committed to this week but this group says just give it a chance.</i>
<hr>
<b>Stelpipe Strike</b><p>
Four hundred workers at Stelpipe's Page Hersey plant in Welland are walking the picket line this evening.<br> They're contract expired at midnight.<br> And as Lauran Sabourin reports the key issue in this dispute is money.
<i><br>  They gathered for an informal rally in front of the Stelpipe plant gate this morning.<br>  Four hundred plant employees in a legal strike position walked off the job at midnight. <br>  They're looking for a better pension package.<br>  A package that gives them parity with other Stelco divisions.<br>  They're looking for a wage increase.<br>  Stelpipe's Page Hersey plant produces half inch to 16 inch pipe for oil and gas transmission and other industrial uses.<br>  The company's third quarter report for 1996 says that Stelpipe has shown a 25 percent increase in sales over the previous quarter.<br>  Ammunition the union is using to bolter it's position that the company can afford to pay them more. <br>  In a statement released today Stelpipe simply acknowledged there was a strike. But said little else..<br>  The union memebers sense this strike may be a long one.<br>  The company issued a notice saying that the members insurance policy had expired. <br>  The last strike at Stelpipe was in 1987. That lasted for three and half months.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cop Relatives</b><p>
Last night we told you how Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police were looking for relatives of two officers who died on duty in the 1920's.<br> Friends and family of both men have now come forward.<br> Constable Reg Pryor died in 1921 when he swerved on his motorcycle to avoid a pedestrian in downtown Hamilton.<br> In 1929, Constable Fred Raynes died when a streetcar hit his motorcycle.<br> Police wanted those close to the men to be present when they honour both constables at a date to be announced.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Foreign investors are in love with Canada and right now they can't buy enough Canadian dollars.<br>  The loonie is on the threshold of breaking through 75 cents U.S.<br>  That is allowing Canadian interest rates to drop further.  
<hr>
<b>Principal on Roof</b><p>
Students at a private school in Burlington sent their principal through the roof today.<br> Bob Euesden promised students at Park Academy that if they'd raise 15-thousand dollars for the school, he'd spend a day on the roof.<br> Well, the students reached their goal, and Mr. Euesden spent a chilly day perched on top of Park Academy.<br> More than 180 students participated in a family day and walkathon earlier in the school year, raising 15-thousand, 9-hundred dollars.<br> The money will go towards the school's budget.
<hr>
<b>Cape Breton Choir</b><p>
Cape Breton's world renowned "Men of the Deeps" went deep into Dofasco's shipping yards today for an inprompteau performance.<br> Dofasco is sponsoring the choir's performance at Hamilton Place Saturday night.<br> That show is completely sold out, so the "Men of the Deeps" stopped by the steel company's shipping yard to to belt out a few bars.<br> Members of the choir are all working or retired coal miners from Cape Breton who joined to preserve the rich folklore of that island's mining communities.
<hr>
<b>Neil Young</b><p>
There were plenty of slick tricks, and musical treats as Canadian rock n roll icon Neil Young and his band Crazy Horse rolled into steeltown's Copps Coliseum with a Halloween concert last night. A somewhat disappointing audience of about eight-thousand attended. But those who traded Halloween for Young had no regrets.

<b>Violence Conf.</b><p>
There was a declaration of war in Hamilton today, a war on violence. But the battles will be peaceful ones, fought at the neighbourhood level using dialogue as ammunition.  
<br> A two-day conference called Stop the Violence opened in Hamilton today, to develop a plan of action at the neighbourhood level to reduce violence in our schools, our homes, and our streets. And these ordinary citizens are doing it with no more money and no new laws.                                 <br> Some examples of the actions conference participants are considering: in schools, more parental involvement, nutrition programs, protecting early childhood education and teaching media literacy. In sports, promoting positive adult role models, improved training for coaches, rewarding participants, other than winner. In public safety and security: expanding community-based policing, a violence education program for parents, and an advisory group to help CHCH-TV guide programming standards.  Tomorrow conference participants will refine and evaluate a plan of action and CHCH-TV will be there for the results.
<hr>
<b>Health Corp</b><p>
A new era in health care is officially underway in Hamilton.<br> The new Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation held it's first board meeting after the Hamilton Civics and Chedoke McMaster Hospitals merged earlier this month.<br> As Jamie West reports...public accountability and openess will be a priority.
<i><br>  These new board members are getting the nickle tour of Henderson General Hospital one of four facilities they will now help to govern...<br>  The board is comprised of 26  members including 6 each from the Civics and Chedoke McMaster.  Other members include regional chairman Terry Cooke and Hamilton mayor Bob Morrow. Hamilton city council is asking for two additional members to better ensure public accountability... <br>  A number of housekeeping items were on the first agenda of board of trustees including the appointment of a new chief of staff.<br>  He will be Dr. William Shragge a respected cardiac surgeon.<br>  The merged hospital's new CEO Dr. Scott Rowand says patients will benefit from the merger.<br>  Another more contentious item the board is dedaling with behind closed doors is the matter of severances and salaries. Word is a new policy is being hashed out that will prevent a repeat of the controversy that plagued Chedoke McMaster Hospitals recently over the 818-thousand dollar severance shelled out to former CEO Dr. Jennifer Jackman.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Redland Fini</b><p>
They're toasting their health in Greensville tonight. A ten year battle against a landfill site has ended in victory.<br> The provincial government officially declared today that the Redland Quarry proposal was dead.<br> Dwight Ryan was there for the announcement.
<i><br>  It was a community nightmare. Redland Quarries hoped to turn this defunct mine this site into 26 million tonnes of industrial waste.<br>  Residents were assured there would be no environmental problems.<br>  But,  after 140 days of municipal and environmental assessment hearings,  it was decided the dump wouldn't go ahead.<br>   The community celebration was short lived as Redland Quarries appealed to the provincial cabinet.  Now it was time for an answer.  <br>  Local MPP Tony Skarica campaigned against the dump.   <br>    The man who led the fight against the dump was delighted..yet conciliatory.   <br>    And for once someone (albeit) in disguise, held a sign praising the Mike Harris government.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Ancaster Fire</b><p>
An early morning fire in rural Ancaster has gutted a farmhouse. Fire fighters say the home on Powerline Road was totally engulfed in flame when they arrived on the scene shortly after five this morning. There was no one in the house, and the cause is under investigation.<br> Damage is listed at more than 150 thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>Ancaster Crash</b><p>
While fighting that blaze, Ancaster fire officials were called to a multi-vehicle crash on Highway Two, at Shavers Road. It resulted in a number of minor injuries, and firefighters had to use the jaws of life to pry one victim from his car.<br> Ambulance crews then rushed him to hospital for emergency treatment of serious but not life-threatening injuries.
<hr>
<b>Truck Accident</b><p>
A dump truck driver is lucky to be alive after his truck rammed into the back of a transport on the QEW in Niagara Falls this afternoon.<br> The driver had to be extricated from the crushed cab.  He suffered serious leg injuries.<br> The driver of the transport was treated for cuts to his face.<br> The QEW at Sand Plant Hill was closed for about an hour.<br> Niagara Falls bound traffic was being diverted onto Highway 405. The accident is still under investigation.
<hr>
<b>Masked Robber</b><p>
A warning to trick or treaters tonight not to run with masks on their head.<br> A robbery suspect in Hamilton did just that last night, and ended up falling on his face.<br> He was running away from the Tabby Variety in downtown Hamilton, where he had tried, unsuccessfully to grab some cash with a plastic bag over his head.
<hr>
<b>Bricks Follow</b><p>
City inspectors in Hamilton will be examining all high rise buildings in with brick facades like the one that collapsed Tuesday, sending 50 tons of bricks crashing down on the street below. Luckily no one was hurt. The construction technique is rarely seen anymore, but city officials are not sure how many buildings share the design, and want to determine if there are any potential safety concerns.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Canadian stock prices roared to their 50th record high close so far this year.<br>  Stocks were propelled higher by falling interest yields on government bonds. Despite falling interest rates, the Canadian dollar strengthened to its strongest level in a year.  
<hr>
<b>1920's Cops</b><p>
Finally tonight, Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police want to honour two of their own, but need some help.<br> They're trying to get the names of two constables, both killed in the 1920's, added to the police memorial in Ottawa for officers killed while serving their community.<br> Now they need help locating the officers relatives.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  Before the use of patrol cars in the 1950's, motorcycles were the vehicle of choice for Hamilton police.<br>  But helmets were unheard of.<br>  29 year old constable Reg Pryor died in 1921 when he swerved on his motorcycle to avoid a pedestrian at King and Sanford in downtown Hamilton.<br>  Four years later, a streetcar hit the motorcycle ridden by 31 year old constable Fred Raynes.<br>  Both officers were honoured with police funerals, but Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police have no records of the incidents.  <br>  When constables Pryor and Raynes are honoured, police would like their relatives to be present.<br>  They're hoping anyone with information will call the central police station at 546-4707.<br>  </i>

<b>Winds/Accident</b><p>
A storm packing 100 kilometer winds has hit much of the province of Ontario.  In northern regions, salters and sanders are battling ice and snow. In the golden horseshoe it's winds gusting to 100-kilometers an hour that have proven fatal.
<br>
Three people were killed in a two-vehicle collision in Thorold when a car entered an intersection that was missing a stop sign. The accident occurred at Merrittville Highway and Holland Road.<br>   Police say the car was hit broadside by a dump truck, killing the three occupants.<br>   The two occupants of the truck were taken to hospital with injuries that are described as non-life threatening.<br>   Police say they aren't sure if the winds blew the sign away or it was stolen.<br>  In downtown Hamilton the gusts have created an extremely dangerous situation.<br>  Pains of glass from some highrise office towers have lossened, some have even blown out sending them crashing to the street below.<br>  Throughout the province power lines and trees have been downed and motorists are being urged to be extremely careful.<br>  Even though the high winds are expected to die down overnight a high wind warning from the Ontario Provincial Police remains in effect for the Burlington Skyway Bridge and the Garden City Bridge in St. catharines.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Bricks Follow</b><p>
The high winds making clean-up efforts difficult at the site of the 13 storey apartment building downtown Hamilton that lost the bricks off one side yesterday.<br> Engineers and architects spent the day removing the rest of the facade and checking inside the apartments involved.  The property ownrs are waiting for the results of an engineering report looking into the cause.<br> In the meantime, the city building department has determined there is no structural damage or danger to any tenants.
<hr>
<b>Mountain Fire</b><p>
Fire officials were to sift through the ashes of an overnight blaze at a new home under construction on the east Hamilton mountain. They're trying to determine how the fire was sparked but they think it was the work of an arsonist.<br> No one was hurt, but damage extensive with estimates  at upwards of 300-thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>Turned in Kid</b><p>
Checking the police file now, a pair of Dundas grandparents decided the law should handle their 14 year old grandson.<br> They found marijuana and a pair of ninja throwing stars in the boy's possession and marched him into the Dundas Police Station last night, where the teen was charged with possesion of marijuana and possession of a probibited weapon.
<hr>
<b>Beach Robbery</b><p>
A man's been charged with robbery after an unusual confrontation on Hamilton's beach front.<br> Police say the suspect pulled up beside another vehicle in the parking lot of Hutch's Restaurant, and started yelling at the driver about his driving habits.<br> He then reached into the car and took off with the victim's glasses and cell phone.<br> Charged is 48 year old Zenon Gluckowski of Hamilton.
<hr>
<b>NHL Again</b><p>
The city of Hamilton will put its assets where its mouth is in its efforts to lure an NHL team here. Last night, city council gave its entertainment branch the go-ahead to bid for a team, and agreed to use city assets to prove it's good for 75-million dollars. Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <br>Hamilton Spectator publisher Pat Collins handed city council a cheque for 100-thousand dollars, money that will be delivered to the NHL in New York City Friday, as part of Hamilton's application for an expansion team.  And the bid will be submitted by HECFI, the city corporation that runs Copps Coliseum, Hamilton Place and the Convention Centre.  <br>And the city of Hamilton will promise to deliver the money needed to pay the franchise fee.  <br>If Hamilton beats the odds, and is actually awarded an expansion team, mayor Bob Morrow is certain the city can unload it.  If not, Hamilton taxpayers will own the team, and HECFI will run it.  <br>But before any of this can happen, Hamilton must petition the province to change the legislation that created HECFI, and currently prohibits HECFI from owning any property, including a hockey team.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Medical</b><p>
Ontario doctors are putting together a bid of their own right now, a last minute offer to their leadership aimed at avoiding a mass withdrawal of services on Friday.<br> The new offer could give health minister Jim Wilson a way out of a dilemma.<br> His ministry faces the prospect of shelling out millions of dollars for contingency plans if the doctors withdraw their services.<br> Jamie West reports that most Hamilton and Halton doctors say no one's life will be jeopardized...
<i><br> Sticking it to them...that's how doctors especially young interns in Ontario feel about a tentative deal reached between the Ministry of Health and the Ontario Medical Association...<br>  Under the agreement not yet ratified...many new Ontario doctors could be forced to work in underserved parts of northern and southern Ontario ...<br>  A group within the OMA is now racing toward a last minute committment by the government to keep negotiating in exchange for a recommendation to it's members to hold off on Friday's job action. Dr. David Wismer an orthopeadic surgeon say's the government's original refusal to recognize the OMA as a negotiating body has delayed a meeting of minds.<br>  Many doctors are threatening to refuse new patients, to withdraw from hospital service and to cancel all but emergency surgeries.<br>  Meanwhile the OMA is still sorting out the results of polling on the tentative agreement in Toronto...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Chedoke Petition</b><p>
A 3-hundred- and-5 name petition, calling for a public inquiry into the brain injury program at Hamilton's Chedoke-McMaster Hospital, is now in the hands of the Ministry of Health.<br> MPP Toni Scarica accepted the petition this morning in Hamilton, and was to present it this afternoon at Queen's Park.<br> Wendy Littlejohn, alleges her son Timothy was abused while enrolled in the program.<br> She wants some answers.
<hr>
<b>Dofasco </b><p>
Dofasco of Hamilton today reported a profit of more than 50 million dollars in this year's third quarter.<br>  At the same time the company unveiled its new electric arc furnace mini mill that began operating in Hamilton last month.<br>   President John Mayberry also announced Dofasco will spend 14 million dollars to build a tube mill in Hamilton that will make high pressure tubing for the auto industry.

<b>Building Collapse</b><p>
Some Hamilton residents will be spending the night in temporary quarters while officials secure their homes.   It's a mystery that began this morning when a deafening crash rocked the downtown core, sending residents and business people scurrying into the streets, wondering what had happened?
<BR> At this hour, there is still no explanation for the possible cause of the collapse of most of the brick facade on one wall of a 13-storey downtown Hamilton apartment building. As Anthony Pooley reports tonight thankfully, no one was hurt by the falling brick.
<i><br>  It happened without warning and for no apparent reason ... most of the clay brick facade over a concrete wall of this apartment building at Forest and John Streets simply fell off, as tenants inside felt tremors and heard noise consistent with a minor earthquake. Fortunately, it started at the bottom and fell stragiht down limiting the spread of debris to the roof over the building's underground garage... with some spillage out onto John Street. Surprisingly, no one was hurt... and no vehicles were damaged. Even so, crews will clean up the debris by hand as part of standard rescue procedure ... even though there is virtually no likelihood that anyone was buried by the bricks. <br>  The structure is 25-years old and that was the original brick work. The building is well maintained. Engineers couldn't explain why the wall's brick veneer collapsed... and neither can the building owner's property manager. <br>  Meanwhile, this block of John Street will remain closed for the time being... while work continues to remove the remaining danger hovering above. Tenants who were evacuated are to be allowed to return... since the building real concrete wall remains intact and structurally sound.</i>
<hr>
<b>Flag Dispute</b><p>
In Brantford, another home is at the centre of a controversy tonight. And it has a Brantford woman more determined than ever to fly her Canadian flag outside her townhouse.<br> The single mom says its in honour of her grandfather.  But condo residents says its a disgrace..and that its only there to support a C.B. radio antenna.<br> Dwight Ryan has a report on the Brantford flag flap.  <br>  
<i>Tens of thousands of Canadians travelled across Canada to show their support for national unity.<br>  Just days before the Quebec Eeferendum, the show of national pride was nothing short of phenomenal.<br>  At the centre of that pride was the Canadian flag.   <br>    This is the flag, mounted outside the three story residence of Sue Saraceni.<br>  Condo rules however say no structures outside.   <br>  But Sue says she put it up legally.  <br>  Not good enough says neighbour Ede Simmons-Karolyi.   <br>    In Ottawa, local MP Jane Stewart tried to stay clear of the conflict, but..   <br>  Still condo residents say Sue's flag was put up to comouflage a C.B. radio antenna thats messing up their cable t.v. and cordless phones.<br>  The flag's out the front now, the antenna protrudes through a bedroom window.     </i>
<hr>
<b>Female Bandit</b><p>
An eighteen-year -old girl appeared in a Milton courtroom this afternoon charged with five counts of robbery. Her arrest yesterday follows a month-long investigation into a string of bank robberies in Milton. Halton police struck "target team" to try to catch a female suspect wanted in connection with seven robberies.<br> Yesterday's arrest of Lorraine Esther Chicoine of Brampton followed a robbery at a Toronto Dominion branch on Main St. in Milton staked out by police as a likely target.<br> The suspect was apprehended by target team members as she tried to enter a vehicle.
<hr>
<b>Computer Theft</b><p>
Halton police are hoping this surveillance video will bring about the arrest of two computer thieves smashing their way into a Brighton Road business in Oakville.<br> The culprits made off with a Macintosh computer central processing unit worth more than two thousand dollars.<br> Halton police hope that someone may be able to identify these individuals.<br> If you can help call the Halton Regional Police break and enter squad at 825-4747 extension 2216, or Crime Stoppers at 825-8477, that's 825-tips.
<hr>
<b>Ancaster B & E</b><p>
A rude awakening for an Ancaster father last night.<br> After hearing noises in his son's room he found three teens ransacking the place.<br> They fled, but one left behind a knapsack with his name in it.<br> A 15 year old Ancaster boy has been charged with break and enter with intent.<br> Further investigation revealed the same teen was also involved in a house entry the night before.<br> He's charged with break and enter in that incident.
<hr>
<b>Bawdy House</b><p>

<b>N.H.L. Update</b><p>
The city of Hamilton is once again going after an NHL franchise.<br>  The deadline for bids, in what could be the last league expansion, is this Friday.<br>  And Hamilton will be there with a one hundred thousand dollar application fee and the promise of 75 million dollars if the team is awarded.<br>  Dwight Ryan has the story.  
<i><br>  People in the steel city love NHL hockey.  Not only that, Hamilton has, in Copps Coliseum, one of the finest venues for professional hockey in North America.<br>  So officials here are not giving up on their bid to get a team.<br>  The Hamilton Spectator has offered a hundred thousand dollars U.S. for the application fee. The bid goes in Friday in New York and officials say they're ready.    <br>    HECFI, the group that oversees the city's entertainment facilities will present its report to city councillors Tuesday night.<br>  With expected unanimous approval, the application will go to the NHL in New York on Friday.   <br>    The National Hockey League is expected to award four new franchises when they meet in Phoenix in December.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Church - Restructure</b><p>
A provincially- appointed mediator says it will take only a matter of days to decide if Hamilton- Wentworth politicians are willing to try to end their deadlock over municipal government reform.<br>  Gardner Church arrived in Hamilton today, and immediately began soliciting opinions from politicians, cab drivers, even people he met on the street.<br>  He wants the broadest view possible of what's right and what's wrong with our various layers of municipal government.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.<BR>
<i> Gardner Church won't waste time in Hamilton- Wentworth, if he encounters political inflexibility on the issue of reforming local government.  <BR>That kick will be delivered by Queen's Park, and a government disinterested in the long-time provincial practice of bailing out inefficient municipalities. Church says he does sense Hamilton- Wentworth politicians are willing to at least explore opportunities for reform.  <BR>Just don't expect Church to keep an open mind.  He says an open mind is like a vacant mind, and he has definite views on the need for local governments to be accountable, and cost-conscious. </i>
<hr>
<b>Youth Chase</b><p>
Checking the police file tonight, a stolen car with five teenagers inside crashed on Hamilton mountain this morning during a police chase.<br>  The car reached speeds of 70 km an hour, then hit a median after an officer tried to pull them over.<br>  All five bolted from the car after the crash, but were eventually nabbed.<br>  The 17 year old driver is charged with dangerous driving and possession over five-thousand dollars.<br>  Police say a 12 year old boy, two girls aged 13 and 14 and a 15 year old boy inside the car had all been reported missing by their families.
<hr>
<b>Westdale Grabber</b><p>
Police in west Hamilton on the lookout for a man wanted for fondling two 21 year old female McMaster University students.<br> In both cases, the description of the suspect matches. The suspect is described as a short, middle aged man who smokes and walks with a hunch.<br>  The latest incident occured late last night, and another student was grabbed three weekends ago.
<hr>
<b>BC Escapee</b><p>
And an escapee from British Columbia's electronic monitoring program is back in custody after a fight in Hamilton.<br>    32 year old Mark Culp of no fixed address faces a number of charges, including assault with a weapon and possession of burglary tools. Two women and a man confronted another man as he was trying to break into a car over the weekend. The suspect turned a screwdriver on them during the fight, then ran away, right in the direction of an oncoming police officer.
<hr>
<b>Liberal Convention</b><p>
The federal Liberal's four-day policy convention in Ottawa closed with a pep rally for an election. The prime minister told delegates he could call the vote any time during the next two years. But senior Liberals expect he'll most likely call it next year.<br>   The two-thousand delegates produced only one surprise over the weekend -- they backed a non-binding resolution to legalize support doctor-assisted suicide. Chretien admitted it's a delicate issue that won't be resolved swiftly.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
As expected, the Bank of Canada lowered the trend setting bank rate by a quarter of a percentage point today.<br>   Canadian chartered banks will cut their prime rates by the same amount to a 40-year low of five per cent, effective tomorrow.

<b>Toronto Protest</b><p>
Day one is done. Labour and social groups tried to shut-down Canada's largest city.  They say they did it. But premier Harris wonders just what was accomplished. 
<hr>
<b>Protest - Hamilton</b><p>
Two busloads of Hamilton steelworkers left early this morning to take part in the protest. They stopped first at S.A. Armstrong to show support for those on strike against that company... then continued on to Bay Street and the stock exchange. 
<hr>
<b>School Closures</b><p>
This is one of the reasons for todays protest: cuts to education front and centre in Halton last night...as the board of education released its hit list of schools slated for closure and the auction block... and as ian dovey reports.                                
<I><br>  Bob Williams the director of education says it's never an easy decision to close schools.<br>  But faced with a financial crisis, the Halton Board of Education says it must close facilities and sell property.<br>  A staff report recommends the following schools be closed: In Burlington; Fairfield, Lakeshore, Mohawk and Mountain Gardens.<br>  In Oakville, Oakwood...and in Milton Percy w. Merry Public School.<br>  Sale of the following schools is recommended; Elizabeth Gardens, Fairfield, H. Wrigglesworth, John A. Lockhart, Lakeshore, Mohawk, Mountain Gardens, Oakwood, Percey W. Merry, Speyside and Woodside. <br>     Some board staff members and parents were relieved...others were obviously disappointed. <br>     Halton's two vocational high schools, General Brock in Burlington and General Wolfe in Oakville will remain open and become adult education centres. <br>      The staff report is also recommending Aldershot, Central, Nelson and Lord Elgin High Schools implement grades seven to O.A.C. inorder to remain open.<br>  Teaching staff and class sizes are not expected to change.<br>  However, there could be principal, secretarial and custodial lay-offs.<br>  Further public input will be allowed before the board makes the closure and sales of these schools before December 19th.<br>  </I>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
For the second day in row the value of Canadian shares edged lower. the dollar and interest rates remained stable.<br>  Market watchers expect the Bank of Canada to lower the trend setting bank rate as early as next week. 
<hr>
<b>Booze Bust</b><p>
It could be a dry December, for those accustomed to tippling tax-free booze, in southern Ontario. The RCMP has moved in to smash a major bootlegging operation, that was smuggling truckloads of American liquor across the border. As Scot Urquhart reports; many of those arrested, live in the Hamilton area:
<i><br>  This, is just a fraction of the contraband seized in this region, over the last few months. In total ... some 16-hundred cases of illegal booze. ... half a million dollars worth ....  guns, drugs, money too, and the paraphenalia of sophisticated smugglers. <br>   Some 45 thousand trucks a month cross the border between the U.S. and Canada .... one percent of them, are carrying contraband. This ring preferred to bring booze in from Massena New York; using access points near Cornwall... but border crossings as far away as B.C., were also employed. Staff Sgt. Armstrong says, the work of the RCMP, has just begun: <br>  The criminal penalities are relatively insignificant ... fines of ten thousand dollars ... jail terms of 3 to 6 months in most cases; but police are able to seize assets from the proceeds of crime; and grabbing the toys and cash of the crooks, is what really hurts: <br>  Of the 12 arrests so far; 7 suspects are from the Hamilton area.<br>  Douglas Samson of Ancaster; Carl Kaarsemaker of Waterdown; Thomas Jacobs of Flamborough; Leslie, Robert and Brent Maxwell ... all of Stoney Creek ... and another Stoney Creek resident ... Mary Clark. All charged with a number of smuggling-related offences.<br>  Police also arrested suspects from Cornwall, and Massena New York, and are looking for two other Americans ... including 66 year old Richard Rancati of Las Vegas Nevada.<br>   The irony in all of this... the public complains about crime... and then promotes criminal activity... by buying smuggled booze.</i>
<hr>
<b>St. Kitts Fire</b><p>
One man suffered severe injuries to his hands in his attempt to put out a fire in a St. Catharines highrise apartment building last night.<br>  The building at 292 Oakdale Avenue was evacuated when a fire broke out in a sixth floor unit.<br>  The blaze caused about 50 thousand dollars damage.<br>  The fire is still under investigation by the fire marshall's office.
<hr>
<b>Catholics - 2000</b><p>
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton has launched its own Days of Action ... spiritual action as it prepares for the year 2,000.<br>  At 7:30 tonight the Diocese, which represents nearly 400-thousand catholics from across central Ontario, will hold a special celebration at Hamilton's Cathedral of Christ the King to launch a programme of spiritual renewal.<br>  Christians across the world are counting down to the anniversary of Christ's birth.
<hr>
<b>Jennya Leaves</b><p>
Nine months after arriving in Hamilton for hip surgery five year old Jennya Poluhovich is leaving for home in Belarus.<br>  Jennya and her father will depart for Kiev tonight.<br>  Last January doctors, nurses at St. Joseph's Hospital donated their time and services to perform the corrective surgery on Jennya.<br>  She returns home still wearing a brace, but now able to walk and run.

<b>50 Rd. Pileup</b><p>

Police are not saying how she died. The woman lived in the home with her boyfriend and teenaged daughter. Her slaying has shocked neighbors who describe abbott as a happy person who loved her daughter very much.  
<hr>
<b>Interest Rates</b><p>
Never say never. That seems to be the new slogan for mortgage lenders, real estate agents, and home buyers. The wildly unpredicatble state of interest rates, has almost everyone wondering, how low, can we go? Scot Urquhart reports
<i> <BR>It's happening so fast, and frequently, that not even the banks can seem to keep up.<br>  Mortgage rates, are coming down, again! <br>  Well, the last time we saw rates like these ... Hamilton looked like this.   and the beatles had a number one hit ..... <br>  Gorette da Silva says, the number of people looking for mortgage money is on the rise ... but despite record low rates, customers are still trying to squeeze the best possible deal they can, from the banks: <br>  Gord Majic is one of those who decide that now, is the time to jump: <br>  And Derek Carter says, he's having a record year ... but while lower interest rates are helping the real estate market ... there is still a down side to all of this: <br>  And as long as buyers remain uncertain; and the economy sluggish... no one is willing to predict just how low ... the rates can go. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>

<i><br>  Beginning this week on Hamilton mountain, and next week in the lower city, there's a new way to handle your trash.<br>  If you're backyard composter can't handle the amount of leaves or grass clippings or other garden waste in your yard, you can now leave it out on the curb every other week on your regular garbage day.<br>  Just make sure it's bundled, in a clear plastic bag or in a container clearly marked for composting.<br>  Your yard waste will eventually end up part of a new composting facility in Glanbrook.  <br>  The compost collection will take place from now until the middle of December.  <br>  If you have any questions about leaf and yard waste recycling in Hamilton, you can call Public Works at 546-2785.<br>  </i>

<b>CAW - GM Deal </b><p>
Twenty six thousand striking General Motors workers in St. Catharines, Oshawa, Windsor and Quebec are poised to celebrate tonight. Ratification votes held today are being counted this hour.<br>  The tentative deal reached yesterday gives workers a 10 percent wage increase over three years, and protects jobs for the term of the contract.<br>  CAW president Buzz Hargrove spoke told more than 5 thousand GM workers in St. Catharnes this afternoon and called the job protection provisions a huge victory for the union.          <br>  
<hr>
<b>CUPE 1287 Cote </b><p>
Six hundred, fifty Niagara regional employees will be back on the job tomorrow.<br>  The workers ratified the latest contract offer by a margin of 72 percent.<br>  Niagara regional employees had been on strike since Labor Day weekend.<br>  They were demanding a contract that gave them job security.<br>  The 32 month contract they accepted today has job security provisions but the workers had to offer other concessions.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton - Protest</b><p>
 Organizers in Hamilton say, at least one thousand demonstrators from this city, will take part in the Toronto Days of Protest, this weekend. Some twenty buses have been lined up, to ferry demonstrators from this city to Toronto on Friday and Saturday. Scot Urquhart has more on those preparations:                             
<i><br>  The Coalition for Social Justice is ready. They will take five bus loads of people to Toronto to deliver a message to Mike Harris: <br>  Organizers hope that the Toronto Days of Protest this weekend will dwarf the rally that brought 100-thousand demonstrators to Hamilton, last February. At least 20 buses will roll out of Hamilton on either Friday, or Saturday ... about half of them sponsored, by the United Steelworkers. Union organizer Peter Leibovitch says the steelworkers will target existing picket lines ... like the strike at S.A. Armstrong, in Toronto: <br>  But are these rallies having any effect? It seems as though the Harris Tories have simply ignored the demonstrations and carried on. Not so, according to Catherine Hudson, of CUPE: <br>  And despite some increasingly heated rhetoric between labour leaders, and the government ... Hudson is confident that the Toronto Days of Protest will be both peaceful, and successful. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Hosp. Board Reps</b><p>
In the wake of a controversial severance package, Hamilton politicians will ask the province for a greater presence on a new hospital super-board.<br>  The board will run Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, the product of a merger between the Hamilton Civic Hospitals and Chedoke-McMaster Hospitals.<br>  Hamilton's mayor and Hamilton- Wentworth's regional chairman will serve on the board.<br>  Now Hamilton's finance and administration committee has voted to ask the province to add two more politicians.<br>  Aldermen believe hospital boards must be more accountable to the public, especially after Chedoke-McMaster agreed to hand its outgoing CEO an 800-thousand dollar severance package.
<hr>
<b>River Rescue</b><p>
A New York state man is alive and well after he was rescued from the icy waters of the Niagara River by a Honduras boy living in Fort Erie. Police say 67-year-old Richard Urbanski of Williamsville, New York, was fishing from his 16-foot aluminum boat when it overturned and landed him in the drink. He was clinging to the side of the craft when 17-year-old Luis Rodriguez of Fort Erie swam out, battling strong currents, and rescued Urbanski. He was shaken and cold but otherwise uninjured.
<hr>
<b>Frumusa Trial</b><p>
Double murder convictions against a Niagara Falls man, who has spent eight years in jail, have been overturned by the Supreme Court of Ontario.<br>  37-year-old Peter Frumusa has been ordered a new trial. The reasons will be released later in a written judgement. Eight years ago 70-year-old Richard Wilson and his 48-year-old wife, Annie were clubbed to death in their Niagara Falls-area home. The court heard new evidence in the case, including a statement from a police informer who admitted making up a story that Frumusa confessed to the murders while in jail.
<hr>
<b>Graffiti Kids</b><p>
An alert Hamilton mountain resident, aware of a growing graffiti problem because of recent media reports, helped to catch two would-be artists in the act.<br>  Police say a 16 year old and a 14 year old were spray-painting a supply building at Bruce Park late yesterday when a neighbour spotted them.<br>  Both boys are charged with mischief.<br>  Although several other pockets of graffiti on the mountain are gang related, police say they don't believe the pair are gang members.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Canadian stock prices smashed through new record highs again today as investors anticipate another reduction in the bank rate.<br>  Canadian banks are anticipating lower interest rates and will cut mortgage rates tomorrow. <br>  
<hr>
<b>Rally Recap</b><p>
 Beyond the Grey Cup there's the 2001 Canada Summer Games. The cities of Hamilton and Brantford officially launched their joint bid to host the summer games last night. The rally at the convention centre followed a tour by the provincial site review committee, which will now whittle down the to three, 9 Ontario communities bidding to be host.

<hr>
<b>Harris Protest</b><p>
Picketers not celebrating but protesting at Hamilton City Hall this hour. They're target premier Mike Harris in town for a Tory fundraiser at the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel. 
<hr>
<b>State of Region</b><p>
The Harris government may soon have something to say about regional government in Hamilton- Wentworth. The region's chairman Terry Cooke believes the key to region's survival lies in it's ability is to follow the lead of the private sector.<br> That was the theme of his annual "state of the region" address this morning. Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  Handing over the Hamilton Airport to Trade Port International.<br>  It's a business-like move the region of Hamilton Wentworth felt it had to make because it couldn't run the airport as lean and mean as the private sector could.<br>  The same with establishing a private public partnership to deliver the region's sewage and water service.<br>  The regional chair feels getting out of the governing of business of into the business of governing is the best way to keep Hamilton Wentworth thriving.  <br>  Cooke especially wants to apply that aggressiveness to regional government itself.<br>  Taking a cue from successful businesses by getting rid of the fat.  <br> Cooke says it's imperative Hamilton Wentworth have a new municipal council in place before the next municipal election about a year from now.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Crystal Beach Renew</b><p>
In the region of Niagara, some local citizens feel they have the right prescription for the economic revival of the town of Crystal Beach, the one-time thriving summer resort on the shores of Lake Erie that became a ghost town when the amusement park shut down in 1989.  Lauran Sabourin reports.
<i><br>  In it's heydey Crystal Beach was a magnet for anybody looking for some fun in the summer.<br>  <br>  But after Labor Day in 1989 people didn't come back... <br>  The main streets are deserted...<br>  Graffitti covers walls...<br>  Business signs are disintegrating...<br>  Birds build nests in holes left by bricks that have fallen out...<br>  Most of the buildings are boarded up..<br>  This building was once the Ontario Hotel...<br>  But a group calling itself the Friends of Crystal Beach sees beauty where others see decay .. <br>  Paul Kassay and Stella Ziff want to put a stop the deterioration of Crystal Beach... <br>  Crystal Beach has history rooted in the early 1800's..an important site during the war of 1812.<br>  Local entrepreneurs want to transform this community into a centre of some cultural activity.. <br>  Look toward the glistening waters of Lake Erie and you see the dramatic transformation already taking place in Crystal Beach.<br>  A community of gleaming colonial houses is springing out of the sand where the amusement park once stood.<br>  A residential and recreational compound that community activiists will be the spark for economic recovery in the rest of the village. </i>
<hr>
<b>Gretzky Road</b><p>
A road leading into Brantford, will soon bear the name of that city's famous son and one of hockey's greatest players. City councillors have voted unanimously to rename it the Wayne Gretzky Parkway. The hockey superstar was born and raised in the city and his parents still live there.
<hr>
<b>Bad Dad</b><p>
A confrontation between a Hamilton mountain father, and his teenaged daughter; has resulted in an arrest, and several weapons-related charges. Police say the 45 year old man, enraged by the continual defiance of his 14 year old daughter ... grabbed a weapon in his home, and began to threaten the girl. the teen reported the incident to her school guidance counsellor; and last night, just after midnight, the emergency response unit of the regional police surrounded the man's home ... and negotiated his surrender. no names have been released.
<hr>
<b>Blood Shortage</b><p>
The situation is becoming critical at blood banks in the region. Red Cross blood centres in Toronto, Hamilton and the Waterloo region have issued an urgent appeal for donors. Reserves of group "O" positive have fallen drastically, but the Red Cross says they need all types of blood.  Some hospitals are talking about postponing elective surgery.

<b>G.M. Niagara</b><p>
There are significant developments on the labor front in southern Ontario this evening.<br>  Twenty six thousand General Motors workers are counting on a resolution to their strike by the end of the day.<br>  This afternoon Canadian Auto Workers president Buzz Hargrove said after 45 hours of marathon bargaining there are still issues to be settled.<br>  The hurdles include some local issues as well as some snags in outsourcing.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Deal</b><p>
Municipal workers in St. Catharines could be going back to work soon.  Six hundred and fifty members of CUPE local 12-87 will vote on a tentative deal Wednesday after a 60-hour marathon session all weekend. They've been on strike 49 days. The strike involved St. Catharines administrative and welfare workers as well as road, sewage and water-plant employees.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Docs</b><p>
It's a great deal. That's the line the health minister is taking. Jim Wilson has announced a new deal with doctors that would reduce government clawbacks, and restrict the ability of new physicians, to practice where they please. But will the agreement bring permanent peace to the medical community? According to reporter Scot Urquhart, many doctors say no:
<i> <br>  But just which doctors is the health minister talking about? <br>  Dr. Donna Fedorkow is an executive with the Ontario Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; one of the specialty groups threatening to withdraw services November 1st. <br>  Although she is hopeful, Dr. Fedorkow admits Jim Wilson's prescription may not be the medicine to suit all doctors: <br>  Certainly Dr. Lynn Nash, would agree. She's the president of the Ontario College of Family Physicians. She does not favour the deal announced by the province. One reason; she thinks forcing new doctors away from established areas; may be a mistake: <br>  In the end says Doctor Nash, pitting physicians one against the other; will damage the health care system: <br>  Doctor Gordon Guyatt, of the Medical Reform Group says; the government will have to de-list 50 million dollars in services from OHIP; to pay for the new agreement: <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Health Science Corp.</b><p>
When Jennifer Jackman and Pamela Reid left their executive posts at Chedoke -McMaster Hospitals, they were awarded more than a million dollars in severance.<br>    Its a payout that has created controversy and raised many questions.<br>  Now that the merger of Chedoke McMaster and the Civic Hospitals is official, the new board wants to see how it all happened...and why.<br>  Dwight Ryan with that.  
<i><br>  Its now official. Hamilton's Chedoke McMaster Hospitals will be merged with the Civic Hospitals.<br>  The amalgamation, known as the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation will create one of the largest health care facilities in the province.<br>  Word of the approval came from Ontario health minister Jim Wilson.   <br>    The health minister expresssed his concern in a letter to the Chedoke McMaster board.   <br>      Norman Preece chairs the board of the new Health Sciences Corporation.  Now that the merger is official, his first priortiy is to see the severance paperwork.   <br>       Preece and his lawyers will not only look at Jackman's severance, but that of one of her closest colleagues, Pamela Reid.  The Vice-president of Corporate Development quit her job last month and got more than a quarter of a million in severance.   </i>
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Homicide</b><p>
Her death has been ruled a homicide even though an autopsy could find no anatomical reason why she should have died.  72 year old Jean Lindsay of Hamilton was found dead in her apartment last week.  It was originally thought she had died of natural causes, until that is, an interview with Mrs. Lindsay's 45 year old son, who visited the central Hamilton Wentworth Police Station Saturday night.             <br>   45 year old John Lindsay of Hamilton is charged with second degree murder.   He'll appear in court on October 29th.
<hr>
<b>Reading Week</b><p>
It's library week and to start things off, a special story time for these students at Queen Mary School in Hamilton.  Hamilton Mayor Bob Morrow, read to a group of grade three students from the book, "Have You Seen Bugs?"<br>  Mayor Morrow is the first in a series of celebrity readers as Queen Mary School holds "Libraries: Let's Celebrate Week".<br>  The week, sponsored by the Hamilton Public Libraries, is meant to encourage kids to read.

<b>Region Restructure</b><p>
Councillors who want to abolish Hamilton- Wentworth Region are pushing ahead with plans to dismantle it. <br>    Some of them met today, to decide who can do the best job of delivering services to taxpayers.
<br> But the meeting was boycotted by councillors who oppose the motion to disband Hamilton- Wentworth, passed by regional council earlier this month.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <BR>Whether it's busses, sidewalks, or recreational programs, this working group of Hamilton- Wentworth regional councillors wants to know who can best deliver the services taxpayers expect.  But even though all of these councillors support the abolition of Hamilton- Wentworth Region, they're not prepared yet to start drawing up contracts authorizing Hamilton to sell services to the suburbs.  <BR>But these councillors intend to prove to the municipal affairs minister they're just as serious about doing away with the region, as chairman Cooke is about saving it.  <BR>So despite the boycott by chairman Cooke and some Hamilton councillors, this working group intends to keep on working to divvy up the services now provided by the region.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Severance Sit-in</b><p>
This Hamilton woman doesn't like the politics at Chedoke-McMaster Hospital. Anne Marsden is disabled.  She was fired from Mac without a severance package three years ago and today turned up on the hospital doorstep, seeking what she believes is her share of the generous severance packages now being handed out as the health care facility restructures. Ms. Marsden was a quality assurance analyst when Mac discharged her after seventeen years service... for writing a letter to the editor of the Hamilton Spectator suggesting that the hospital's senior management was spending health care dollars unwisely.
<br>  In a letter she delivered today to hospital chairman Paul Southall... Mrs. Marsden requests a meeting to discuss her case. And if she doesn't get it ... she says she'll sue.
<hr>
<b>Mountain Gang</b><p>
Regional police are taking on the Pinstripes, a multi-racial male-dominated criminal youth gang. These are their symbols, the graffitti is showing up everywhere and in the latest incident, a 16 year old Hamilton boy has been arrested after a brutal assault on a student.  It happened at Barton High School earlier this month.<br> A 19 year old was punched and kicked by a group of teens on his way home from school.<br> Earlier that day, police say he had accidently hit the accused with a hackey-sack ball.<br> The teen appeared in court this morning.<br> Police are trying to identify other members of the gang, but say witnesses are reluctant to come forward for fear of reprisal.
<hr>
<b>Cops and Gays</b><p>
 Police in Hamilton have another issue to deal with right now. During a private meeting last night, members of the gay community accused chief Robert Middaugh and his force of being homophobic and insensitive. They want gay officers recruited, increased patrols in areas where gay bashing is common and above all, a change in attitude. 
<hr>
<b>Sabia Obit</b><p>
She fought for women's rights, Canada's feminist pioneer who founded the National Action Committee on the Status of Women. Long time St. Catharines resident Laura Sabia has died after a 19-year battle with Parkinson's Disease.  She was 80. Sabia was often described as a fiercely outspoken traditional feminist, not a politically correct `men are the enemy' feminist.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
More evidence today of Canada's strengthening economy.  Trade figures show Canada with a four billion dollar trade surplus.<br>  Meanwhile stock markets in Toronto and New York closed higher again today and the Canadian dollar is up over seventy four cents U.S.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Jail & Bail</b><p>
They were singing behind bars today.... the charges are bogus, the jail is a fake, the judge is an actor.  But, the cause is real.<br>  Some of Hamilton's finest were arrested and charged today. They were put behind bars and told to raise bail.  It was the annual Canadian Cancer Society Jail and Bail in aid of Cancer Research and Camp Trillium. Fund-raisers are hoping to realize $50-thousand from the event... snd they're already half-way there.

<b>jackman deal</b><p>
The controversial cat is out of the bag.... <br>    Former Chedoke McMaster Hospitals CEO Dr. Jennifer Jackman was paid big dollars when she left her position at the beginning of September.
<br>  The word came through a hospital issued news release this afternoon.<br>  Jamie West who has been following this story has the latest.
<i><br>  818-thousand dollars,  a number lower than a rumoured 969-thousand but still a lot of money going to former Chedoke McMaster CEO Dr. Jennifer Jackman...<br>  Dr. Jackman publicly announced last summer that she would not seek the job as CEO of the new merged McMaster Civics superhospital.<br> However she became eligable for severance because her former job was eliminated by the planned merger.<br>  Regional chairman Terry Cooke has been a vocal opponent of the hospital's recent refusal to disclose the figure...<br>  The hospital says the anger of the public has been minimal...<br>  Chedoke McMaster says no funds donated and designated for patient care has ever been used to pay salaries or severances.<br>  </i>

<b>Municipal Act</b><p>
Ontario municipalities will have more power to charge user fees and cut the size of their councils, under reforms proposed today by the provincial government.<br>  Changes to the Municipal Act, introduced in the Ontario legislature today, would also exempt towns and cities from lawsuits arising from road maintenance, and sewer and water-main back-ups.<br>  But as Deborah Walker reports, even more sweeping changes are on the horizon.
<i> <BR> Proposed changes to the Municipal Act are based on the recommendations of David Crombie's "who does what" panel.  <BR>But opposition members say the "who does what" panel should be re-named the "who pays what" panel.  <BR>However the chairman of Hamilton- Wentworth Region says change is inevitable.  But Terry Cooke says it is worth investigating whether municipalities could assume school building and maintenance, and the transportation of students.  </i>
<hr>

<b>Breast Cancer Follow</b><p>
The Ontario government is bolstering its defences in the fight against breast cancer.  It's going to spend 24 million dollars to set-up 30 new breast screening programs over the next four years.
<br> Two of them will be located in Niagara:<br> One program at the Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls. And the other at St. Catharines General Hospital.<br> Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i><br>  The target group for the breast screening program in Niagara is 43 thousand women between the ages of 50 and 69.<br>  Its a routine screening program designed to detect breast cancer in women who may not suspect there is a problem.<br>  With the older populaton in Niagara having easy access to a breast screening program is critical.<br>  The incidence of cancer in this area is high.<br>  Breast cancer is one of the two leading causes of cancer death in women. <br>  It's estimated that 71 hundred women in the province will develop breast cancer this year.  Two thousand will die.<br>  In 1993, 84 percent of women who died of breast cancer were over 50.<br>  Breast screening is the best way to lower those death rates.  <br>   The government is alloting more than 24 million dollars to establish 30 new breast screening programs over the next four years. <br>  While screening won't prevent cancer,  it will certainly give women a better chance at survival. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Auditor Follow</b><p>
As for the health of the air we breathe, yesterday the provincial auditor's report criticized a lack of air monitoring by the Ontario government.<br> However, in Hamilton, ministry of the environment officials are breathing easier knowing their equipment is state of the art ... <br> And after you hear this report from Jamie West maybe you will too...
<i><br>   If it looks and sounds a little complicated it probably is...<br>  But it's nice to know that the air that sometimes hangs thick over the steel city is being examined carefully on a daily basis and through some of the best equipment in the province.<br>  The cost of operating this station in Hamilton's Beasly Park is about 10-thousand dollars a year.<br>  A bargain considering the importance of monitoring particles in the air...<br>  The real good news is that Hamilton air quality is three times better now than 20 years ago.<br>  And the number of days that the pollution index has reached the danger point has dropped steadily since 1970.<br>  And that should allow all of us to breathe a collective sigh of relief.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Lady Bandit</b><p>
Halton's lady bandit has struck again.<br> It happened yesterday afternoon at a Royal Bank in the Milton Mall. After indicating she had a gun, she got away with an undisclosed amount of money.<br> She's described as white, 25 to 35 years old, 5'5" with a slim build and dark wavy hair pulled back in a pink hairbands.  She wore a light brown bomber jacket, dark track pants and white runners.<br> Police believe the same suspect is responsible for a number of hold-ups throughout the region.
<hr>
<b>Agg. Assault</b><p>
Police still trying to get to the bottom of an aggravated assault case last night in Hamilton.<br> A 42 year old woman was found lying in front of a home on Carrick Avenue in central Hamilton.<br> She is being treated in hospital for a facial fracture, and possible broken ribs and a broken collarbone.<br> But she's not co-operating with the investigation, by refusing to tell police who attacked her.
<hr>
<b>Homolka - Coroner</b><p>
The coroner who handled the investigation of Tammy Homolka's death didn't do the job properly.<br> And the reason, says Ontario's chief coroner, is that Dr. Joseph Rosloski didn't have the experience to look at the case properly.<br> Dr. James Young says Rosloski now understands where he went wrong and no disciplinary action will be taken against him.<br> Tammy Homolka apparently died after she was drugged and sexually assaulted by her sister Karla and Paul Bernardo in 1990.<br> An inquiry into the investigation of the Bernardo case criticized Rosloski for mislabelling Tammy Homolka's death.
<hr>
<b>Radar Message Board</b><p>
Burlington residents are getting the message across load and clear ... don't speed on their residential streets!<br> With help from a piece of technology on loan from Alberta, the city of Burlington is trying to slow down drivers enough to read the signs of speeding.<br> Annette Hamm explains.
<i><br>  Ever wonder how fast you're really going while zipping through town?<br>  These drivers along Headon Road in Burlington found out thanks to this radar message board.  <br>  The radar board is being tested throughout the city of Burlington to try and make residential areas safer, and to make drivers aware of their actual speeds.  <br>  No speeding tickets are handed out during the test runs, it's more of an awareness project than speed enforcement.<br>  Residents in this neighbourhood are also keeping a watch on speeders by jotting down licence plates and sending them to police.  <br>  The city of Burlington hopes to raise money through corporate sponsors to buy at least one of the 23-hundred dollar radar boards for permanent use.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Partners / Education</b><p>
Statistics Canada says high school drop-outs returned to class in droves during the early nineties, because they were unable to find work.<br>  If those students returned to school in Hamilton- Wentworth, they're in luck.<br>  A partnership between schools and businesses in the region, gives students a decisive edge when it comes time to enter the workplace.
<i>  Hamilton- Wentworth's Industry Education Council is the oldest in Canada.  It's a partnership between educators and employers, a partnerership that allowed this grade twelve student to spend a one-month summer work-term at Burlington's Genum Corporation.  <BR>Goodridge says you can complain about change, or you can learn to control it.  It's those who adapt who won't just survive in a changing economy ... they'll thrive in it. </i>

Informative or excessive? A controversy has erupted over a Hamilton and Wentworth school boards video series on human sexuality. <br>   They're too hot to handle ...especially for elementary school children.
<br>   That's the feeling of some parents who are against the Wentworth County board's use of the videos.<br> Jamie West went to see what the fuss is about and a word of warning ...his report contains some sexually explicit images taken from the videos in question.
<i><br>  And this is what the fuss is about ..<br>  Sexual health is one thing but sexually explicit video's cartoon's or not are too much for some parents...<br>  The seven year old video entitled Head Full of Questions isn't just about mechanics its also about relationships and how Fred and Anna live day to day and care for one another...<br>  The Wentworth County Board has heard screaming from some parents about the video but mostly applause, still they're taking a second look...<br>  The video remains available through both the Wentworth County and Hamilton Boards of Aducation...

<b>Good Shepherd Dinner</b><p>
 Here in Hamilton weeks of planning by good samaritans resulted in a happier Thanksgiving for hundreds of people at the Good Shepherd Centre this afternoon.  The annual Thanksgiving Dinner gives hope to those who have been dealt a low blow by circumstance.<br>  They feel "thanksgiving" is just a word, rather than a day of celebration.<br>  Brother Richard and his dedicated corps of volunteers catered to over 600 visitors at the centre's Cannon Street facility.<br>  Mothers with children were more in evidence this year, which Brother Richard notes is a disturbing change from the past.
<hr>
<b>Mario's Thanksgiving</b><p>
Non-profit agencies weren't the only ones serving up turkey with all the trimmings today.<br>  Staff at the East Side Mario's restaurant on Queenston Road in Hamilton volunteered their time today, to provide Thanksgiving dinner for more than two-hundred people who might otherwise miss out on a holiday meal.<br>  The dinner was co-ordinated by the New Westminster Presbyterian Church, and six other charitable agenices pitched in to help.
<hr>
<b>Red Hill Walk</b><p>
 After the turkey dinner, the next item on the Thanksgiving tradition list is the walk. "Friends of Red Hill" enjoyed perfect weather for their annual Thanksgiving hike through the valley today.<br>  They found the jaunt was easier, now that work is under way on a nature trail.<br>  Alex Reynolds joined the group.
<i> A natural oasis, right in Hamilton's backyard, was the focal point, as supporters took to the trails on this Thanksgiving Day.<br>  The lobby group, dedicated to the preservation of the 16-hundred acre, 8 kilometre long nature preserve, explored the newest section of the Red Hill Valley Trail.<br>  It was a leisurely stroll, in unspoiled natural surroundings that in future could yield to a manmade concrete monolith, which for the "friends" is an abomination. <br>  Opposition to the expressway goes beyond environmental issues. <br>  With employment downsizing in the city's industrial core, the group feels future traffic volume doesn't justify a road through the valley. <br>  <br>  When told to go take a hike, "Friends of Red Hill Valley" just smile, because that's their mandate for this natural wonder in the east end of the city.<br>  As a matter of fact, it's been a great day for a walk...cameraman Nick Garbutt and I walked off our big thanksgiving meals from last night, but it's only anticipating another go at the turkey tonight.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Toronto Fatal</b><p>
It's been a tragic Thanksgiving weekend for some. OPP are investigating a crash on the QEW that killed a 42-year-old Hamilton woman. Police say Lori Ann Alleyne Millette's car struck another vehicle at Mississauga Road around 3 p-m yesterday and rolled as many as six times. Her four-year-old daughter is in serious condition with head injuries while her husband and their 18-year-old son were slightly hurt. No one in the other vehicle was injured. The mishap closed the eastbound QEW for more than four hours.
<hr>
<b>Boy - Train</b><p>
Police have now released the name of a young Beamsville teen struck and killed by a CN train early yesterday. Niagara Regional Police say 15-year-old Brook Everet Mackey was walking with three friends along the tracks when the train approached and they decided to stay on the tracks and wait until the last moment to jump out of the way. Brook was pronounced dead on arrival at Lincoln Memorial Gospital.<br> The four boys were all students at Blessed Trinity High School in Grimsby.
<hr>
<b>Disguise B&E</b><p>
It was a Thanksgiving weekend Jill Kaup won't ever forget.  The Niagara-on-the- Lake woman risked her life when she tackled a knife-wielding thief disguised with halloween make-up, she surprised in her bathroom early Sunday morning. The suspect got away but was tracked down by with the help of the niagara police K-9 unit. A 14-year-old niagara-on-the- lake boy will appear in court tomorrow charged with break, enter and theft, assault with a weapon and disguise with intent to commit. Our heroine received a small cut to her hand but is okay.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
 Banks, government offices and financial markets in Canada were closed today for Thanksgiving.<br>  It will be business as usual again tomorrow.<br>  However in the U.S. today, stock prices roared to new record highs helped by stronger than expected third quarter profits at Chrysler Corporation.<br>

<b>Vineland Artfest</b><p>
While most of us had our minds on Thanksgiving today, hundreds of crafty consumers were already thinking ahead to Christmas.<br>  The fifth annual Vineland Thanksgiving Artfest gave visitors a chance to get a head-start on their Christmas shopping.<br>  Craftsmen and artists from across Ontario displayed wares ranging from scultures and wood carvings, to furniture and baked goodies.<br>  Proceeds from the artfest will go to buy extras for students at the Vineland Public School.<br>  And although visitors did not have to pay any admission charge, they were asked to bring along food and clothing donations for the Lincoln Community Care agency.

<b>Local School Boards</b><p>
They say it makes no sense at all ...this next big step in the Mike Harris commons sense revolution.
<br>   A published report says the province plans to scrap all 166 school boards in Ontario and replace them with as few as five regional school councils with restricted mandates.<br>  The Toronto Star says the government expects to save one billion dollars on non classroom administrative costs...<br> As Jamie West reports... in Hamilton... ...the idea is earning a failing grade.
<i><br>  The Star report says part of the rationale for abolishing school boards is that the government believes they're getting in the way of chopping administrative education costs, and would be too quick to raise local property taxes in response to provincial funding cuts.<br>   5 regional replacement councils would be structured to include the constitutional rights of Catholics to govern their own schools.  <BR>The chairman of Barton Secondary's School Council shudders at the plan...<br>  Under the changes the government is expected to impose province wide teacher bargaining.<br>  There are 294 wage contracts between teacher unions and 166 school boards.<br>  The Tories are said to believe it's a waste of time and money.<br>  Teachers argue different areas call for different agreements...<br>  The changes would likely come just in time for the November 1997 municipal elections. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Parkview - Legionaires</b><p>
From our youth to our seniors, there is concern tonight at a Hamilton senior's residence over a flu-like respiratory illness that has affected one-third of the 126 patients.<br>  Parkview Nursing Centre is collaborating with the Regional Public Health Department in the investigation and management of the outbreak, which surfaced three weeks ago.<br>  Of the 39 cases, eight seniors had pneumonia. all but four of those affected have recovered...two of these are in hospital.<br>  There was concern at the outset, the problem could be Legionnaires disease.

<hr>
<b>Satans Choice</b><p>
One of two men in custody after a weapons search at the Satan's Choice motorcycle club in Hamilton earlier this week now faces further charges.<br>  During a search of an east Hamilton home, police found a pair of brass knuckles, three pounds of marijuana, and evidence of cultivation and resin manufacturing.<br>  32 year old William Weir of Hamilton faces several new weapons and narcotics charges.
<hr>

Two men have been arrested after an elderly Hamilton woman was forced to pay for a driveway repair she wasn't happy with.<br>  The 76 year old woman put a stop payment on the cheque for the repair back in September.<br>  Two men showed up at her door and forced her to go to her bank and withdraw the money.<br>  34 year old Donald Clark and 36 year old William Shellard, both of Brantford, face charges of exortion and forcible confinement.
<hr>
<b>Harnick - Victims </b><p>
More help on the way for victims of crime in St. Catharines. Victims rights advocates Priscilla Devilliers and Donna French applauded the announcement today by attorney general Charles Harnick. It invovles a new victim witness assistance program for the garden city and a dozen other new offices to be established over the next two years.<br>  The 160 thousand dollar investment will pay for experts tp help crime victims cope with the trauma of dealing with the justice system. A victim notificaton service will also help keep them informed on the status of their offencder. The attorney general admitted the moves are designed to make up for how the system has wronged crime victims in the past. 
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Wentworth Business Information Network </b><p>
With the national unemployment rate up again, more people need help finding work. The rate climbed a half a point to 9.9. per cent last month. The rate dropped in Hamilton and the golden horseshoe and is still below national and provincial rates. But with more and more full time jobs disappearing, the Hamilton Wentworth Business Information Network couldn't have come along at a better time. The service, officially launched today, is linked to the internet, and provides a community-wide service addressing employment, training, career planning and economic development needs.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
There is more speculation today that the Bank of Canada may once again reduce interest rates.<br>  Federal figures indicate Canada's jobless rate surged to 9.9 percent in September, up significantly from the month before.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Fountain Draw</b><p>
When the restored Gore Park fountain is officially turned on next Saturday, the ceremony itself will be flowing with tradition.<br>  Back in 1860, two students helped with the original opening ceremonies in downtown Hamilton's Gore Park.<br>  Today, some 136 years later, a grandson of one of them, Colin Gibson, drew the names of two youngsters of this generation who will with be a part of the opening ceremonies for the restored fountain. Matthew Ventura and Tanya Pimentel, both six, entered a colouring contest and each won the chance to participate in this historic event.<br>  The fountain will be dedicated Saturday, October 19th.
<hr>

Finally tonight, a new addition has made its way to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Mount Hope.<br>  The last Cf-100 ever made will become an interactive display at the museum.<br>  The jet fighter interceptors were issued in 1946, and built by Avro in Malton, Ontario.<br>  The canucks, as they were nicknamed flew as defenders in northern Ontario, Quebec and BC until 1981.<br>  The two-seat all-weather fighters usually had a polished aluminum exterior, but the one at the museum, because it is the last one built, was painted black like its prototype.<br>  It will be ready for display in about three weeks.

<b>Jackman Bonanza</b><p>
With a health care system teetering on bankrupcy, one Liberal MPP calls it an outrage. <br> A CEO's severance package, reported to be close to a million dollars.
<br> The hospital involved, Chedoke McMaster, remains mum on the deal they struck with Dr. Jennifer Jackman before she stepped down last month...<br> And as Jamie West reports tonight...the public may never find out the terms of the deal ...
<i><br>  Was there a back room deal struck here at Chedoke McMaster worth $969, 600 dollars?<br>  Hamilton MPP Dominic Agostino says the information came through two unnamed sources one of whom Agostino claims is a director with the new Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation.<br>   He's outraged and wants the hospital to fess up...<br>  The lump sum payment is said to be based on 80 percent of Dr. Jackman's salary over four years.  She earned 303-thousand dollars a year as CEO before stepping down last month just before Chedoke McMaster and the Hamilton Civics merged. Legally, it's the hospital's choice whether to publicly disclose the details...<br>  Employment lawyer Ed Canning says it's difficult to sort through without the specifics of the deal but...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Belly Buttons</b><p>
Some may call it just a bandaid solution but it could save the hospitals six-thousand dollars a year: a team of nurses at Chedoke McMaster have released the results of a year long study that shows the cords of newborns dry up and fall off faster, if left alone. Traditionally alcohol swabs have been used and prescribed to speed the process along. A randomized trial of 1811 babies in Hamilton and Kitchener showed that those whose cords were left alone...separated 20 percent faster. The nurses say it costs hospitals about a dollar seventy five per newborn for alcohol and swabs.
<hr>
<b>GM - St. Kitts</b><p>
The union representing striking General Motors workers in St. Catharines is calling on the mayor to apologize for remarks he made to two Toronto newspapers on Tuesday.<br>  Mayor Al Unwin said he feared the strike would push GM to move its St. Catharines operation to the U.S.<br>  The union is charging that the mayor is helping GM with comments like that.<br>  Despite the controvery morale was buoyant on the picket line today, the fourth day of the walkout in St. Catharines.<br>  Talks between GM Canada and the autoworkers union, meanwhile, have recessed for the Thanksgiving weekend.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Strike</b><p>
 Meanwhile striking regional workers in Niagara are accusing their employer of watering down the issue.  The union representing 650 striking Niagara Region employees claims Niagara Region is allowing bacteria laden drinking water into Niagara homes. CUPE is warning don't drink it, the region says it's okay.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more.
<i><br>  CUPE president Sid Ryan says he won't drink Niagara water because there's bateria in it.<br>  Ecoli and fecal coliform bateria.  The type that came make a person very sick. <br>  CUPE local 1287 says inspectors who test the drinking water have told them the bacteria levels in Fort Erie, Port Colborne and Lincoln are unacceptable.  And the reason they are unacceptable is because unqualified people have been running the water treatment plants during this five week strike. <br>  The union's calling on the environment minister to rescind the contingency plan drawn for the strike.  To conduct and independent investigation.  And to fully disclose test results. <br>  The region did show us some test results.  Results that indicate no amounts of bacteria in the drinking water.<br>  The union is saying that it's warning the public of a potential health hazard.<br>  The region is charging the union with fearmongering. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Halton Meeting </b><p>
Hundreds of parents jammed into school gyms in Oakville and Burlington last night to hear details of the Halton Board of Education's plans to close a dozen of their schools.<br> The director of education expxlained provincial cutbacks have placed the board in a desperate financial situation.<br>  Bob Williams says the sale of 12 schools, that have yet to identified will save the board 24-million dollars.<br> Some parents fear the board is moving too quickly.
<hr>
<b>Brantford Fatal</b><p>
<br>  Highway 403 near Cainsville Road in Brantford remains closed at this hour after an as yet unidentified motorist was killed this afternoon in a major car crash involving several vehicles. Details remain sketchy... it isn't clear if charges are pending. Provincial police officers remain on the scene, sorting out what actually happened.
<hr>
<b>St. Kitts Bomb Arrest</b><p>
A Stouffeville man has been arrested in connection with last week's bomb threat at St. Catharines General Hospital. 33 year old Myles Bentley Groulx is facing a number of charges, including possession of explosives. The incident forced the evacuation of a wing of the hospital. Police say Groulx had no connection to the hospital. They say the motive for the bomb threat is interesting, but they're not releasinge details of that motive, until the suspect's trial.
<hr>
<b>Satan's Choice</b><p>
And two members of the Satan's Choice motorcycle gang in Hamilton were arrested last night.<br> Police recovered a revolver and two sawed-off shot guns.<br> The revolver was found in the car of a gang member.<br> The shotguns were seized during a search of the Satan's Choice clubhouse on Lottridge and Biggar.<br> 35-year-old Peter Grigorovsky of Stoney Creek faces two weapons charges.<br> 32 year-old William Weir of Hamilton faces three weapons offences.<br> Bail has been opposed.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Get ready for another interest rate cut.<br>  The Canadian dollar has climbed to its strongest level so far this year, above 74 cents U.S.<br>  Investors have a renewed confidence in Canada because our government budget deficits are falling faster than expected. The experts say that should lead to lower interest rates.<br>

<b>sean o'sullivan lab</b><p>
His name personified hope to many and now the Father Sean O'Sullivan Research Centre is keeping that hope alive.
<br>   Hope in the form of cures and treatments for patients, and hope in the form of expansion at St. Joseph's Hospital, as the centre reaches its fundraising goal.<br>  Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  Former Ticat Bernie Faloney quarter-backed the fundraising kickoff for the new research centre.<br>  In less than two years, they've raised more than 10 million dollars.<br>  The money won't be spent on bricks and mortar, the centre itself operates throughout St Joseph's Hospital.<br>  Instead, the funds will be spent on new researchers ... from graduate students to senior scientists.  <br>  Their work focuses on new approaches to clinical care and research on urinary, bone and joint and chest and lung diseases.<br>  The research centre is named after Father Sean O'Sullivan for the spirit of discovery and optimism he was known for.<br>  At the age of 20 he became the youngest member of parliament in Canadian history, then he left politics to enter the priesthood.<br>  Father O'Sullivan died in 1989 of leukemia.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Wayne Gretzky Way?</b><p>
Could it just be a Canadian thing? We just don't respect our heroes when they become too successful.<br> The managing editor of a Brantford weekly paper thinks so, after readers overwhelmingly opposed naming a street after Wayne Gretzky.<br> But, as Dwight Ryan reports, many Brantford residents heartily disagree.  <br> 
<i><br>  It was Alexander Graham Bell who first put the city of Brantford on the map.<br>  But a young hockey player soon turned the telephone city into the home of Wayne Gretzky.  <br>  A flap has developed in Brantford over the renaming of a street.  Should Park Avenue North become Wayne Gretzky Boulevard?<br>  Readers of a weekly newspaper overwhelmingly said no.  And managing editor Ron Kowalsky was surprised by their venom.   <br>    Since then the so-called controversy has taken on a life of its own.<br>  Kowalsky is even quoted in the current issue of Time Magazine.   <br>    Soon the daily newspaper was defending the great one.<br>  The local radio station decided to downplay the issue saying it wasn't news.   <br>    While the naysayers called the weekly newspaper,  they were hard to find on market square over the noon-hour.   </i>
<hr>
<b>Niagara Stunt</b><p>
Charles Blondin did it in 1860 and made quite a name for himself. Now over a century later, stuntman Jay Cochrane wants to try it too: walk a tight rope across Niagara Falls. Just last month, the Toronto native, who's been doing this kind of thing since 1971 thrilled thousands in Shanghai when he skywalked more than 200 yards between two skyscrapers without a safety net.  A year ago, he crossed the Yangtze River in one of the longest highest crossings ever attempted.  As for the Niagara feat, the queston is will he be allowed to?  At this time, Niagara Falls mayor Wayne Thompson and his American counterpart are enthousiastically endorsing the plan and city council has given it's approval in principle
<hr>
<b>Super City Vote</b><p>
It wasn't a difficult feat for Hamilton city council last night.  They voted 9-6 to replace the Hamilton-Wentworth Region with a super-city.  The vote essentially undoes from a city stand-point what the region did last week when the majority of councillors voted to disband the region in a bid to revert to single local governments.                 The city's actions last night are also seen an as invitation to the province to intervene and settle the long-standing squabble over regional government in time for next year's municipal election.
<hr>
<b>Glendale Experiment</b><p>
It turned out to be a science project. Students at Glendale Secondary were rushed into assemblies this morning after to learn that the subject of yesterday's bomb scare was a grade nine girl's science project, left behind when she moved lockers.<br> Glendale's principal called the assemblies to to talk about the dangers of calling in bomb scares, and playing with combustible materials.<br> As it turned out, the liquid in the 2 litre pop bottle was coloured water, not gasoline as originally suspected.
<hr>
<b>Missing Person</b><p>
Police in Niagara are seeking your help in finding a missing Welland woman. 43-year- old Audrey Desjardins was last seen almost a week ago driving a red wine coloured 1985 Ford LTD 4-door sedan, license OJM 741. She is described as white, five-three to five-four, 115 pounds, slim build, blonde hair, fair complexion. If you have any information that could help, calll Niagara Regional Police at 905-735-7811 extension 3300.
<hr>
<b>Most Wanted</b><p>
A Hamilton man wanted for almost a half-million dollars in income tax evasion has been named as most wanted by Hamilton- Wentworth Crime Stoppers.<br> Police say 55-year-old Herman Gebele also faces possession of stolen property charges in connection with numerous break and enters between 1989 and 1994.  Herman Gebele is a former Hamilton businesman. He is 55 years old, 5-foot-eleven, has thinning light brown hair and has been seen recently in the Hamilton area even though he is believed to reside in the U.S. now.
<hr>
<b>Connors Brewery</b><p>
The Brick Brewing Company is taking over Conners Micro-brewery of St. Catharines. Few financial details of the deal have been released but brick plans to move the Conners operations to its Waterloo facility by the end of the month. Only six Conners employees have been hired by Brick -- the other 20 people in St. Catharines will lose their jobs. Conners president Glen Dalzell says he's selling the brewery in the face of stiff competition and financial pressures.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
  Canada's major bank's announced today they are cutting mortgage rates for the second time in a week.<br>  Federal finance minister Paul Martin told a parliamentary committee the federal deficit is falling faster than the government expected because of low interest rates.<br>  K-Mart is chopping 150 jobs at its Canadian headquarters in Brampton.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Cumis Apples</b><p>
Finally tonight, for the fifth year in a row, a Burlington company is in the giving spirit.   The Cumis Group is donating its entire 225-apple tree orchard crop to charity. This morning volunteers from Cumis, were joined by an army of others from the Burlington Fire Department, Halton Regional Police, Hamilton Bulldogs, more than 15 social service agencies, even a team of celebrity volunteers for a picking fest at the Cumis head office. In previous year's the event has netted 800 bushels during the single day blitz, not to mention a few sore muscles.

<b>Glendale Evacuation</b><p>
Classes were cancelled for hundred of Hamilton high school students today after two separate bomb threats.  And one turned out to be the real thing.
<br> Some tense hours for staff and students at Glendale Secondary School in east Hamilton this morning.<br>  A dangerous device was discovered in an empty locker prompting a full evacuation and a full police response...<br>  Jamie West has the story...
<i><br>Police were called about an hour after classes started at Glendale Secondary School.<br>  The school was immediately evacuated...and the Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police bomb squad called in...<br>  The device described by police as incindiary in nature as opposed to explosive was taken to a nearby quarry and destroyed.<br>  School officials say the finding came with no warning, and that there had been no trouble around Glendale in recent days.<br>  And police were barely finished clearing the scene... when at noon they were called to Winston Churchill School just a few miles away after an anonymous caller said a bomb would explode in 45 minutes.<br>  Again a full evacuation... students cheered, but daycare workers next door looked worried and upset.<br>  And again police did a full sweep of the building...<br>  No one was injured but classes at Churchill and all after school activities were cancelled.<br>  Glendale re-opened for afternoon classes but few students returned.<br>  Police are hoping to hear from anyone with information on either incident. </i>
<hr>
<b>Skyway Fatal</b><p>
And work crews fixing the highway over the Burlington Bay Skyway... watched in horror last night ... as a lone car pulled out past a group of escort vehicles, and slammed into the back of a paint truck. 27 year old Paul Boswell of York, Ontario, died immediately.<br> The driver of the paint truck, was not injured.
<hr>
<b>Jeep Wheel</b><p>
And police are continuing their investigation, into an accident on the QEW near Burlington Street yesterday.<br> A jeep travelling on the road, lost a wheel at high speed... the tire flew across the highway and slammed into an oncoming tour bus, injuring six people....one seriously. The jeep is being held, pending a full mechanical inspection of the vehicle.
<hr>
<b>Cannon St. Fire</b><p>
Yesterday we told you how an ambulance attendent rescued five people from a burning house in central Hamilton.<br> Well today we know what caused the 30-thousand dollar blaze ... a hydroponic marijuana growing operation.<br> A spokesman for the Hamilton Fire Department says makeshift wiring to the lamps, fans and pump to run the system sparked the fire.<br> Police recovered 60 plants from the attic, and have charged 26 year old Raymond Burns with cultivation of a narcotic.
<hr>
<b>Stolen Van</b><p>
Quite the surprise for a Hamilton man yesterday when he saw two teens driving around in his stolen van.<br> He called police who managed to stop the teens while they were stuck in traffic along Stonechurch Road on Hamilton mountain.<br> A pair of teenaged boys, aged 15 and 16 are charged with possession over 5-thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>Boyle </b><p>
Under intense pressure to resign over the Somalia Inquiry, Canada's chief of defence staff, General Jean Boyle quit today. His resignation, accepted by the prime minister follows David Collinette's departure as defence minister just four days ago.  
<hr>
<b>Downtown Plan</b><p>
City and regional councillors in Hamilton Wentworth are at this moment listening to plans for the rejuvenation of downtown Hamilton.<br>  At the urging of Mayor Bob Morrow, area homebuilders came up with a plan for renewal.<br>  Dwight Ryan reports, that for a modest investment of taxpayers money, the homebuilders say they can bring back life to the city's core.  <br>  
<i>The Hamilton Halton Homebuilders' Association has spent months preparing a renewal plan for downtown Hamilton.  It was an initiative that was started by Hamilton Mayor Bob Morrow several months ago.<br>  Many of the downtown buildings are in fact owned by members of the association, and it is in their interest too to see the downtown core revitalized.<br>  In an unusual meeting of city and regional councillors, the plan was unveiled, shrouded in secrecy.  <br>    It'll cost just over 400 thousand dollars to get the plan in motion.  The homebuilders want 90-thousand from the city, 90-thousand from the region.   <br>    Already apartments and offices above existing businesses are beginning to rent as people begin to sense an air of renewal.<br>  Condon says with downtown development fees already scrapped, no further concessions from the city are needed.   <br> City alderman and downtown businessman Marvin Caplan likes the plan.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Team Hamilton</b><p>
Meanwhile, fiery rhetoric is on the agenda for tonight's Hamilton city council meeting, when aldermen are asked to re-affirm their support for turning Hamilton- Wentworth region into a super-city.<br>  A slim majority of Hamilton councillors oppose last week's vote at Hamilton- Wentworth regional council to disband the region, and leave its six municipalities intact.<br>  Last June, Hamilton city council also voted to disband the region, but wanted Hamilton to gobble up its five suburban neighbours to create a super-city.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Housing Up</b><p>
The politics may be on shakey ground but the Hamilton housing market is sound.<br> Low mortgage rates and housing prices continue to spur new home construction.<br> Figures released today by Canada Mortgage and Housing show starts jumped to 265 units last month, up from 162 units in September of 1995.  That represents a 64 per cent increase.
<hr>
<b>G.M. Picket</b><p>
A real estate agent in St. Catharines meanwhile, says his phone has stopped ringing.<br> Michael Turner says it's been like a morgue since five-thousand autoworkers went on strike against General Motors a week ago, joining their counterparts in Oshawa and Ste. Therese, Quebec.<br> Mayor Al Unwin says he's worried for the five-thousand striking autoworkers, suppliers and the company.  Buzz Hargrove, head of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, says the prospects for a quick settlement still look dim because after four decades GM seems determined to scrap ``pattern bargaining,'' in which the union reaches a deal with one automaker and expects the other two to match it.<br> GM says it doesn't intend to copy the deal reached with Chysler last month.
<hr>
<b>Jobs Poll</b><p>
Don't ask the autoworkers but according to the latest Angus Reid survey, 9 out of 10 Canadians like their jobs.<br> The poll says pay is not the top factor. Instead job satisfaction, respect from bosses, and a feeling of control are the more important.<br> That's why, the survey says, the self-employed are the happiest workers, even though they work the longest hours. On the down side ... 22 percent of us worry that we will lose our jobs; a result of downsizing, and continued unemployment.
<hr>
<b>Hands - Peace</b><p>
Nearly one hundred and 50 young school children joined hands in Hamilton this morning to mark the YWCA's Week Without Violence.<br> As they walked around Whitehern Museum downtown, the children were raising their hands in support of the Y's initiative to promote practical alternatives to violence at home, at schoool and in their neighbourhoods.

<b>St. Kitts Pickets</b><p>
The latest word is the General Motors talks are going nowhere and there's little hope of averting a huge autoworkers strike as thousands more prepare to join the picket lines.  We have a number of stories on the autoworkers strike tonight, beginning with the domino effect. A Toronto area GM supplier has laid off 15-hundred workers and in the United States, a thousand workers were sent home today from a GM powertrain plant in Tonawanda near Buffalo and 800 will be laid-off from a transmission plant in the Detroit area tonight.  
<br>   More than five thousand GM workers in St. Catharines hit the picket lines midnight last night.<br>  The striking employees were joining their counterparts in Oshawa and Ste Therese, Quebec who walked off the job last week. All in all there are some 20-thousand out now in Ontario and Quebec. 46-hundred more are ready to go out in London, Woodstock and Windsor at midnight Wednesday. The main issue in the dispute remains outsourcing. The workers feel they will lose their jobs if GM contracts out work to other manufacturers who pay less.
<hr>
<b>CAW - Ford</b><p>
 And in another development, the head of the CAW, Buzz Hargrove is threatening to break-off negotiations with GM and start talks with Ford. 
<hr>
<b>Palladini - Highways</b><p>
While the automakers work to keep the industry going through all of this, Queen's Park is trying to keep the traffic moving smoothly through Ontario's highway system.<br>  But they need more money to do it.<br>  And as Dwight Ryan reports, the province's transportation minister is hoping some of it will come from the federal government.  <br>  
<i><br>  Ontario drivers pay the federal government two billion dollars a year in gas taxes.  None of that money is returned to the province for road maintenance, even though sixty percent of Ontario's roads are in need of repair.<br>  The province's transportation minister says its not fair..and today he went before a federal transporatation committee demanding cash.   <br>    Al Palladini wants two cents out of every ten cents a litre in tax returned to Ontario.  Asked by committee members what committment Queens Park was willing to make, he said 700 million dollars will be spent this year alone on highway repairs.   <br>    Some Liberal commitee members don't see it that way.   </i>
<hr>
<b>Cannon St Fire</b><p>
Hamilton firefighters say it will be some time before they know the extent of this damage. A three story home on Cannon Street near Wentworth went up in flames this morning. There is no word on what sparked the blaze.<br>  Five people escaped without injury thanks to the assistance of ambulance officer Tim Spence who arrived just before fire crews.
<hr>
<b>Tennis Arrests</b><p>
A tip to a school's liason officer has led the arrests of four teens.  The boys aged 14 to 17 have been charged in a break and enter at the Valley Park Tennis Club in Stoney Creek, we featured last week.<br>  The newly constructed club was nearly ready for use when vandals broke in two weeks ago, breaking windows, punching holes in walls and throwing paint throughout the building.<br>  The spree caused 15-thousand dollars in damage.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Interest rates paid on Government of Canada Bonds are falling while Canadian stock prices continuing smashing new records.<br>  A new wave of investors confidence is also strengthening the loonie, lifiting the dollar close to 74 cents U.S.
<hr>
<b>Welland Food Fest</b><p>
Finally tonight, another successful Niagara Food Festival has come and gone.  The 3rd Annual Welland Food Festival drew record crowds once again and while eveyone ended up a winner, three of them have ended up winners of a CHCH TV food festival draw. They are: first prize: Internet In  A Box goes to Maggie Joyce of Coquitlam, B.C., Norma Warner of St. Catharines wins a CHCH-TV shirt and basball cap, and Gary Dolan of Lowbanks, Ontario takes home a CHCH-TV T-shirt and baseball cap.

<b>St. Kitts Bomb</b><p>
The emergency room at St. Catharines General Hospital became an emergency last night and was evacuated after police found what they are calling explosive materials inside the emergency room.  Lauran Sabourin has more.
<i><br>  Just before six last evening the switchboard at the St. Catharines General received an anonymous call that a suspicious package was left in the emergency room.<br>  Police found the package inside ceiling tiles in the men's washroom in the emergency room area.<br>  One report suggested that the explosives may have been sticks of dynamite but police will not confirm that.<br>  Within minutes of the package being located the emergency room was evacuated.<br>  One hundred, sixteen patients in the floors above the emergency room were moved to another building. <br>  The bomb squad removed the package from the building by tying and line to it and then pulled it out...<br>  The prodedure took quite a while.<br>  Patients and staff still in the building were left wondering what was going on .. <br>  The package was taken to an empty lot where it was destroyed. <br>  Police say at no time was the package a danger to the public. <br>  As a result of this incident the hospital is reviewing it's security measures. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Mountain Murder</b><p>
Yet another murder on the books for Hamilton Wentworth. Police are canvassing a neighbourhood on Hamilton's east mountain this morning, trying to locate witnesses after a man was found dead in his home. The body of 43 year old Gary Gatecliffe was discovered in his bed by his mother, who went the house because she hadn't heard from him for a couple of days. Police say there were obvious signs of trauma to Mr. Gatecliffe's head. An autopsy is to be performed later this afternoon.
<hr>
<b>Bank Robbery</b><p>
Police in Hamilton are looking for the bandit who made off with cash from a Bank of Montreal branch on Queenston Road this morning.<br> It happened just before ten oclock.  The suspect told the clerk he had a gun and demanded money.  He made off in what turned out to be a stolen Honda Civic.  By the time police recovered the abandoned car the thief had escaped in a second vehicle.<br> The suspect is described as being a white male with reddish hair.  He's 5-feet, eight inches tall and was wearing dark clothing.  The weapon he said he had wasn't seen.
<hr>
<b>Highway Six Crash</b><p>
An 11 year old Toronto girl remains in serious, but stable condition in McMaster Medical Centre, following a serious car crash, yesterday evening.<br> Limore Gutman received major injuries, when the van in which she was a passenger, was rear-ended by a second vehicle on Highway 6, near Safari Road. Gutman was flown by air ambulance to McMaster University Medical Centre, with neck and back injuries considered serious but not life threatening.<br> 4 other teens and the two adult drivers were treated and released from hospitals, with minor injuries.<br> Police have now charged the driver of the car, 57 year old Roger Hansell of Campbellville, with careless driving.
<hr>
<b>Old Dumps</b><p>
The cost of eliminating health and environmental risks at old dump sites in Hamilton- Wentworth, is a hefty one.<br>  Next week, a regional committee will consider a report that says it will cost thirteen-and-a- half million dollars to make the dumps safe.<br>  And in some cases, if the region fails to act immediately, it risks facing charges from the ministry of the environment.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i><BR>The prospect of spending millions to clean up old dump sites comes at a time when Hamilton- Wentworth region can ill afford it.  Hamilton- Wentworth inherited responsibility for ten old dump sites when the region was created in 1974. Six of them pose little or no risk to human health or the environment.  One of them, the former Brampton Street landfill site in Hamilton, has been given a medium priority for action. The remaining three have high priority, and staff recommend immediate action to correct problems, primarily with leachate.  <BR>The old Ancaster dump needs improvements to its leachate collection system, to ensure well water is not contaminated. Tests also show groundwater contamination has occurred south of the old Edgewood landfill site in Flamborough, which has no leachate collection system at all.  Mayor McMeeking has no fear that Hamilton councillors, upset by this week's vote to disband the region, will retaliate by refusing spend money on dump clean-ups in the suburbs.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Dundurn Delights</b><p>
Hamilton's Dundurn Castle will be fragrant with the scent of history this weekend.<br> This as the Garden Club of Hamilton holds its first ever juried flower show at the castle.<br> The show is a floral fundraiser to raise money to restore the castle grounds to their former splendour.<br> Annette Hamm gives us a preview.
<i><br>  These arrangements are bringing a dimension to Dundurn Castle not seen since the days of its first owner, Sir Allan McNab.<br>  His gardening staff would have seen to it the home was filled with beautiful floral designs all year round.<br>  Sir Allan himself was quite the flower enthusiast.  <br>  This weekend, Dundurn is filled with beautiful bouquets and arrangments to celebrate the castle's restoration and Hamilton's sesquicentennial.<br>  It's the club's first public show, a high end competition for both professional designers and an open class.  <br>  As judges in the flower show, co-chairs Elizabeth Pigott and Elizabeth Coons keep an eye out for specific elements of design.  <br>  Dundurn Delights, A Castle Revisited runs Friday until 8 o'clock, Saturday from 10 to 5 and Sunday from 12 to 4.<br>  Proceeds will go towards restoring the castle's landscape.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Canine Demo</b><p>
Police K-9 dogs in training were showing off their skills today at the Niagara Regional Police training facility in Niagara on the Lake.<br> Police dog Thunder is three weeks into his training. When he graduates in December, Thunder and his handler Constable Yancy Eddie will be serving on the Haldimand Norfork Police force.<br>  The Niagara Police Canine Training Program is recognized as one of the best in the country.  And has trained 27 dogs for various forces in tracking techniques.

<b>G.M. - St. Kitts</b><p>
Autoworkers in St. Catharines are cobbling together picket signs and collecting steel barrels for fires to keep their hands warm as they prepare to strike. And it could happen within days if a deal isn't reached between G.M. and their union.
<br>  In Oshawa and St. Therese, Quebec, meanwhile, auto workers are already carrying picket signs. And those on the lines say there's a lot of support among members of the Canadian Auto Workers for the strike. So far, 15 thousand GM workers are on strike, and thousands... including those in St. Catharines ... more are set to join them next week. All of this as economists warn the GM strike will throw roadblocks in the way of economic recovery in Canada.
<hr>
<b>Niagara-CUPE Update</b><p>
A pep talk today for striking regional workers in Niagara. CUPE national president Judy Darcy congratulated workers on five differnet picket lines for what she described as their courageous stand. Union officials are anxious to get back to the negotiating table, and are awaiting a call from the region. The strike by 650 inside & outside workers is in its fifth week.
<hr>
<b>H.W. Animosity</b><p>
Back in the endangered region of Hamilton; Hamilton city councillors, who voted earlier this week to dismantle the region, today admit their support for the plan is conditional.<br>  And at least one of them is prepared to reverse his stand, unless Hamilton's suburbs are willing to share both their wealth and their land with the city.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> <BR>Some Hamilton councillors have their eye on lands to the south of the city.  They'd also like a piece of the suburban tax revenues generated by development, made possible through the expenditure of regional tax dollars.  And they figure it's a fair price for the suburbs to pay in exchange for their support of the motion to abolish Hamilton- Wentworth Region.  <BR>On Tuesday, Hamilton city council is expected to reaffirm its position in favour of creating a super city, encompassing the entire region. Morrow says municipal affairs minister Al Leach has agreed to take the city's position into account before reacting to the request to abolish Hamilton- Wentworth Region. </i>
<hr>
<b>Fatal Accident</b><p>
Police looking for witnesses to a fatal accident in Hamilton shortly after six o'clock last night.<br>  A man, stepped off the curb at the corner of Prospect and Main Street East, was struck by an oncoming car.<br>  39 year old Wayne Haylock of Hamilton died.<br>  Police are still investigating, and would appreciate a call from anyone who may have seen the crash.
<hr>
<b>Harbourfront Fine</b><p>
This east Hamilton recycling business has been fined 10-thousand dollars for endangering the environment. And the Hamilton Fire Department warns it could face up to 50-thousand more in fire code violation fines if these huge piles don't get a whole lot smaller. Harbour Front Properties on Burlington St. East pleaded guilty to the violations last November. The monstrous mounds contain combustible recycled building materials. It took weeks to locate and entinguish smouldering fires deep within the mounds that began last Christmas Day. At 10 meters in height, the piles of recycled building materials are more than three times higher and more than 30 times wider than allowed by law.
<hr>
<b>Robberies</b><p>
Police investigating a number of robberies in Hamilton overnight.<br>  Uncle Tommy's Variety and a 7-11, both in Hamilton's east end were hit early this morning.<br>  Just a few hours before, another gas bar, this one on Hamilton mountain, was robbed.<br>  The clerk refused a man's demands for cash and sent him on his way.<br>  The clerk called police with a description of the suspect's getaway car, noticing it had no licence plates.<br>  Police found the car, with the plates inside, and traced them back to the suspect's home.<br>  27 year old Mark Johnston of hamilton is charged with robbery.
<hr>
<b>Dangerous Offender</b><p>
 A Hamilton man; who cannot be named ... has been declared a dangerous offender.<br>  Mr. Justice Nick Borkovich handed down a harshly worded ruling yesterday; describing the 45 year old man as "a cancer on the public body" and seemed to suggest that a punishment of inderminate sentence in prison, was not harsh enough. The man's identity has not been released to protect the identity of his victims.
<hr>
<b>Rolider Review</b><p>
They claimed this man was a dangerous offender when it comes to the treatment of brain injured patients.....<br>  In 1989 Dr. Ahmos Rolider was hired to head up a new program to treat young people with brain injuries at Hamilton's Chedoke McMaster Hospitals.<br>  Early in 1995 several staff and former patients of Rolider came forward with allegations of abuse. The hospital told CHCH News in March of 1995 that they had done their own review of the program and that no staff complaints had been brought forward.<br>  Earlier this year the family of another former Rolider patient stepped forward with more allegations of abuse at Chedoke during Rolider's tenure and they've been calling for an investigation.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Financial markets took a rest today after setting record highs on stock markets over the past two days.<br>  There's new speculation that the Bank of Canada might cut interest rates further.<br>

<b>Region Abolished?</b><p>
Months of political bickering over the future of local government in Hamilton- Wentworth came to an abrupt end last night, as regional council voted to eliminate itself. <br> Nine suburban councillors and eight Hamilton councillors voted to abolish Hamilton- Wentworth Region, and to give the City of Hamilton responsibility for what are now regional services.<BR>
And the Ontario cabinet minister responsible for approving the abolition of Hamilton- Wentworth is surprisingly receptive to the idea.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i>The seventeen councillors who voted in favour of dismantling Hamilton- Wentworth Region have been branded as separatists, and accused of betrayal. Regional Chairman Terry Cooke condemns the vote as the product of an unholy alliance between suburban and Hamilton politicians, who are motivated only by the desire to protect their council seats.  <BR>Hamilton councillor Henry Merling introduced the motion, and lined up the votes necessary to give it a decisive victory. He says abolishing the region is preferable to the City of Hamilton's proposal to annex its five suburban neighbours.  <BR>Meanwhile, Cooke predicts the province will now be forced to step in.  But don't count on the province the rule out the elimination of Hamilton- Wentworth Region.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Bourassa</b><p>
Politicians at all levels of government were paying tribute to former Quebec premier Robert Bourassa today.<br> He died this morning after a lengthy battle with skin cancer at age 63. 
<hr>
<b>Piccolo Funeral</b><p>
They filled the pews of St. Francis Xavier Church, they filled the chairs in an ajoining hall.<br> More than 1200 people gathered today to say goodbye to three victims of violence.<br> A mother and her two young children were stabbed to death a week ago.<br> Today a preist referred to their deaths as an annihilation of innocense.<br> Dwight Ryan reports.   <br>  
<i>An air of profound sadness surrounded St. Francis Xavier Church in Stoney Creek.<br>  More than 1200 family and friends of Fran Piccolo, her ten year old son Jason and eight year old daughter Alisha came to say goodbye.<br>  The funeral mass was conducted in both english and italian.<br>  Father John Van Hees called their violent deaths an annihilation of innocense adding they are now at peace.  They are with their god and they can see the light of god. As the three white caskets were placed in three silver hearses, the tragedy seemed overwhelming. Father Van Hees said if someone could give us the reasons why this happened, then we could better deal with our grief, yet no matter how many answers we receive they do not take away from us the pain of loss that we feel.  We are still left in silence.<br>  In that silence,  the procession moved away from the church. Classmates of Jason and Alisha at Our Lady of Peace Catholic School formed an honour guard. Each held a single white carnation.<br>  Across the street, the students of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Elementary School lined the street to show their respect.<br>  Through their tears, they knew they were witnessing an enormous loss of innocense.  And they wondered why?</i>
<hr>
<b>Car vs. Pedestrian</b><p>
A serious accident over the noon hour on Hamilton mountain.  A car, making a turn off West Fifth onto Mohawk Road collided with another vehicle.<br> An unfortunate pedestrian was crossing the intersection at the same time.<br> She was struck and has been admitted to hospital with serious injuries.<br> No charges have yet been laid.<br> Police are still investigating.
<hr>
<b>Bikers Charged</b><p>
A Milton man is lucky to be alive tonight after after an attempt on his life in front of this industrial building on Lawson Road in Milton. It could have been the first bloodshed in the feared turf war between rival biker gangs in the golden horseshoe. Two members of the Satans Choice have been charged with attempted murder and a string of weapons offences after shots were fired at 31-year-old Rayne Doherty of Milton, the past president of the Lost Souls.<br> Doherty was able to run away and hide and call police on his cell phone.<br> Police stopped a vehicle fleeing from the scene. Charged are: 30-year-old Michael Peter O'Shaughnessy of Oakville and 29-year-old Kevin Eric Zita of Mississauga.
<hr>
<b>Gas Bar Arrest</b><p>
The arrest of a robbery suspect over the weekend has helped Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police solve five other gas bar hits.<br> A man arrested after a gas station was robbed Saturday night has been charged with five additional counts of robbery.<br> In less than one month, six Hamilton gas stations were robbed at knifepoint.<br> Charged is 28 year old Rade Maglov of Hamilton.
<hr>
<b>Design Network</b><p>
Take eight very talented women, all specialists in their own craft.<br> Put them together in the homey backyard setting of a restored carriage house.<br> What do you get?<br> A design network with a unique approach.<br> Annette Hamm explains.
<i><br> From this inviting carriage house in Waterdown, eight enterprising women hope to make the world of design a little less intimidating.<br>  They want to dispel the myth that asking a designer for help means spending a lot of money.  <br>  The design network was the brainchild of Deby Milford, an interior designer who's worked together with her seven colleagues for the last 10 or 15 years.<br>  Together, they cover the whole spectrum of what it takes to make your house a home.  <br>  Starting next week, the design network is offering classes in everything from Christmas decorations to faux finishes and wild and free floral arranging.<br>  An open house will be held this weekend from ten til 5 at the carriage house on John Street.<br> </i>

<b>Hamilton / Niagara Housing</b><p>
Hot. hot. hot. The housing market in Hamilton Wentworth, and across the country, is experiencing a dramatic turnaround. <br> And delegates to a Hamilton conference heard today that the market is expected to remain strong.
<br> Dwight Ryan tells us, the main reason is low interest rates.
<i><br>Residential housing sales in Hamilton Wentworth are up 30 percent over a year ago.  And the market is expected to remain strong.<br>  Houses on the market are usually sold within 90 days and selling prices are 94 percent of the list.<br>  The market is so hot that Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation says there are housing shortages in some areas.    <br>  Not only is the resale market hot, new home construction starts are up 50 percent over a year ago.<br>  Helen Hutton is a senior market analyst with CMHC.  At a Hamilton conference she said first time buyers are driving the market, primarily due to low interest rates.   And the scenario is similar across the country.   </i>
<hr>
<b>Niagara Hospitals</b><p>
 The news isn't so bright when it comes to the health care industry.  With the announcement of the closing of two of Sudbury's three hospitals the ontario government is showing that it's serious about cutting health care spending.<br> Hamilton hospitals have been through a major restructuring and now Niagara is tackling the issue.<br>  Lauran Sabourin reports.
<i><br>  Niagara region has 430 thousand residents.<br>  Ten hospitals and about 900 hospital beds.<br> That's about 35 percent hospital beds than the region had just five years ago.<br>  But if the government has its way the region will do will even less.<br>  Fewer hospital beds.<br>  Possibly even fewer hositals. <br>  It's the goal of the Niagara District Health Council to come up with a savings plan for health care in Niagara. <br>   The District Health Council is looking for ways to save money.<br>  Individual hospitals are doing the same thing.<br>  This afternoon Hotel Dieu Hospital in St. Catharines announced plans for a partnership with Haldimand War Memorial Hospital in Dunnville.<br>  They're looking to share some technology and expertise.<br>  The hospitals are scrambling for ways to cut costs.<br>  The District Health Council is doing the same thing.<br>  Everyone wants to remain in the health care ministry's good books.<br> </i>
<hr>
<b>McCull./Reg. Motion</b><p>
From restructuring hospitals to regional government. It's a debate that's raged on in Hamilton-Wentworth since the early 70's. Vic Copps was the mayor then and he went as far as chaining himself to the gates of the legislation over the issue. In just about two hours time, Hamilton alderman Bill McCulloch will introduce a notice of motion at regional council that he hopes will once and for all end the impass. 
<hr>
<b>Vanscoy Suspect</b><p>
One day after the funeral of 14 year old Jasmine Vanscoy ... the young offender charged with her killing appeared in court. The 17 year old boy, charged with second degree murder made a brief appearance this morning. Police say Vanscoy was shot in the head with a.45 calibre pistol that was stolen from an Oshawa sporting goods shop, six years ago.
<hr>
<b>Robbery Arrests</b><p>
Two Brantford men are in custody tonight awaiting a bail hearing, nabbed by the Hamilton-Wentworth police bank robbery task force.  They've been charged in connection with a Royal Bank robbery in Dundas last Friday, but further charges are also pending. 24-year-old Neal Anthony McMullan and 28-year-old Wesley Earl Woodcock are both from Brantford.
<hr>
<b>Thieves Caught</b><p>
A man walking back to his van last night in downtown Hamilton managed to catch a thief red-handed.<br> Police say two men were breaking into the van when the owner approached.<br> One suspect took off, but the owner was able to tackle the other one, and hold him until police arrived.<br> 18 year old William James Charles Mason of Hamilton is charged with attempted theft and possession of burglary tools.
<hr>
<b>Crack Cash</b><p>
It might have paid just to sit still ... but a passenger in a car stopped by police bolted as the cops were questioning him and the driver.<br> On his way out the door, the suspect dropped several pieces of crack cocaine before police grabbed him.<br> They also found a large quantity of cash.<br> 29 year old Jason Grandville of Rexdale is charged with obstructing police, possession for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of property obtained by crime.
<hr>
<b>Fox 40 Suit</b><p>
The makers of the Fox 40 are blowing the whistle on a competitor. Hamilton businessman, entrepreneur Ron Foxcroft has filed a statement of claim in federal court against the makers of the Acme Tornado 2000, claiming their whistle is a copy of the famous Fox 40 pea-less whistle designed and manufactured here in Hamilton and shipped all over the world.  The Acme Tornado 2000 whistle is made by J. Hudson and Company  and is distributed in Canada by A. Conway Beacham Limited. Foxcroft, a basketball referee and an industrial designer unveiled the Fox 40 in 1987 originally for the professional referee market but now, it's used widely for safety and protection.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Low interest rates and renewed investor confidence setoff a buying spree of stocks in Toronto and New York today, sending share values in both Canada and the U.S. to new record highs.<br>  More improving forecasts for Canada's housing industry.

<hr>
<b>Manufacturing</b>
<br> Canada's economy is on the rebound.  Figures from Statistics Canada indicate our economic pulse is getting stronger.<br>  Despite an increase in the gross domestic product, economists feel more must be done to turn the economy around.<br>  Dwight Wyan has that story.      
<i><br>  Canada's economy is humming along.<br>  The gross domestic product, a total of all the goods and services produced in the country, rose in July by 0.5 percent. Just about every sector increased meaning our economy is finally pulling out of the doldrums.  <br>    Slowly but surely however, those attitudes appear to be changing.   <br>  Federal economists feel the jump in the GDP will lead to a revival in consumer spending and job creation.<br>  This McMaster University economist says its great, but more has to be done.   </i>
<hr>
<b>Seaway Update</b>
<br>  By February of next year control of the St. Lawrence Seaway is going to be handed over to those who use it.<br>  As Lauran Sabourin reports, the federal government wants out of the shipping business, and it's trying to negotiate a deal with its U.S. counterpart to do the same.
<i><br>  Since 1959 the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority has been guiding ships down the river from the Atlantic Ocean to Thunder Bay.<br>  And since then the Seaway Authority has been an agency of the federal government.<br>  Subsidized by taxpayers.<br>  But with the mounting debt the government wants to get out of the shipping business.<br>  It wants to hand control of the system over to those who use it most: the shipping companies and the companies whose comodities are being shipped.<br>  But in the longer term the Seaway Authority is negotiating with its U.S. counterpart to have one agency running the system.<br>  As the government sees it, one agency will be more efficient.<br>  Commonality on the kinds of things such as ship inspections and regulations.<br>  More co-operation between the U.S. and Canada on navigational aids. <br>  The St. Lawrence Seaway isnt' a huge money making operation.<br>  Tolls have been lowered to lure more business to the system.<br>  But tonnage has remained flat in recent years.<br>  In 1995 it was just over 48 million tonnes moved on the system.<br>  Down from a peak in the late 70's of more than 70 million tonnes. <br>  The Seaway Authority is looking at handing over control of the system  to the Canadian users in the new year.<br>  But when exactly the U.S. and Canada will successfully negotiate the terms of a new cross border agency is still being explored. </i>

<i>They're close to wrapping up another year of business at Reardon's Meats where they see the city of Hamilton's liscense rate increase as a lot of baloney. Going from 50 dollars a year to 135 dollars annually.<br>  The same rate now applys to all establishments regardless of what they previously paid. <br>  And in fact because of the blanket rate of 135 dollars some businesses will actually see a decrease.  The city says reduced provincial transfer payments are the reason... and they'll rake in an additional 477 thousand  in revenue in 1997.<br>  Pub owner Ed Fisher says the city's double dipping.<br>  He isn't the only business owner crying in his beer, but can you fight city hall.<br>  It's not likely the city will be all ears when they come calling. <br>  </i>

A top Hamilton criminal lawyer says cuts to legal aid are letting mentally ill people fall through the cracks of the justice system.<br>  Dean Paquette was among the featured speakers today at the national conference of the Canadian Mental Health Association.<br>  Mental health professionals and consumers have gathered in Hamilton this week to examine the interaction between the mentally ill, the media, and the criminal justice system.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> Panelists say an increasing number of mentally ill people have come in conflict with the law since legislative changes were enacted three years ago.  But criminal lawyer Dean Paquette says those charged with minor offences have little chance of finding a lawyer because of cuts to legal aid. And because of the Jonathan Yeo case, he says mentally ill people charged with violent crimes have little chance of getting out on bail.  <BR>Yeo was out on bail when he murdered two people, before killing himself. And Paquette says no one wants to run the risk of freeing another Jonathan Yeo.  Despite intense media coverage of cases like Jonathan Yeo's, Narozniak says that type of high risk offender is relatively rare.  <BR>The Canadian Mental Health Association national conference wraps up tomorrow.  </i>

It's just members of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry practising. About 25 members of the rhli will be engaged in fibua training.  Fibua stands for fighting in build-up areas, a technique was used by rhli soldiers in peackeeping missions in Bosnia and Cyprus. Passersby will likely see and hear some activity around the James Street Armories around the noon hour ..it will last untl about 4. But rest assured only blank ammunition will be used.

<b>Triple Killing Follow</b><p>
A shattered community is trying to come to grips with its worst nightmare tonight. <br>   Stoney Creek residents are still in disbelief following the slaying yesterday of a young mother and her two children.
<br>  The woman's boyfriend faces three first degree murder charges.<br>  Dwight Ryan reports tonight that the separate school board was quick to respond to the fears and questions of the victims' classmates.
<i><br>  It will be some time before this quiet Stoney Creek townhouse development returns to normal.<br>  The continued presence of police investigators is a reminder of the horrors of Wednesday... the violent deaths of a young mother and her two young children.<br>  Fran Piccolo, son Jason and daughter Alisha, whose lives were cut short by repeated stab wounds, underwent autopsies this morning.<br>  The man accused of murder, Fran's boyfriend, made a brief court appearance.<br> He'll return to court Monday morning. <br>  A few blocks away at Our Lady of Peace Catholic School, the process of healing begins. A crisis team counsels teary eyed children.    <br>    School board psychologist Dr. Clinton Davis says there are no easy answers.    <br>     Jason Piccolo was in grade 5, his sister Alisha in grade three.   <br>       A school memorial service is planned following the young victims' funerals.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cops Re: Campbell</b><p>
The long awaited review on the Campbell report into the Paul Bernardo investigation was released this afternoon by the Niagara Regional Police Services Board.<br>  The 29 page report has 16 recommendations that the force should implement in an effort to prevent another Bernardo from stalking and killing innocent victims.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more this report.
<i><br>  Among the key recommendations that all officers on the Niagara Regional Police Force be familiar and aware of the importance of the Viclas computer.<br>  The Viclas system tracks all relevent information involved in sexual assaults and homicides.<br>  A system that justice Campbell advised be used across the country.<br>  A system that the Niagara force is using now but was not widely used when Paul Bernardo was hunting, assaulting and killing young women in southern Ontario. <br>  The Niagara force was criticized by justice Campbell for it's handling of the Bernardo stalking complaints.<br>  In 1991 a young women complained twice to police about Bernardo following her.<br>  His license plate was given to police.<br>  Bernardo was never questioned in that incident.<br>  An incident that at the time may seem trivial to an officer.<br>  But an incident justice Campbell believe should have been taken more seriously. <br>  The chief is promsing a change in attitude. But it's also reinforcing that with a dispatch system that won't allow stalking complaints to be easily dismissed.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>School Closures</b><p>
In it's history the Halton Board of Education has closed 28 schools.<br>  With budget cutbacks hitting even harder in 1996, a consultant's report is calling for the closure of more schools by next September.<br>  As Jamie West reports...the moves will save the board millions of dollars.
<i>It's not only students who are sharpening their pencils but the bean counters at educational consulting services inc.<br>  Their report focusses on accomodation of students...part of the board's ongoing renewal and restructuring plan.<br>  Somewhere between 8 and 12 in total... both secondary including Aldershot High and Elementary, likely Fairfield School built in 1913.<br>  The board will host a series of public input meetings all start at 7:30 in the evening...  they are September 30th at Georgetown District High School.<br>  October 2 at Aldershot High.<br>  October 3 at Lord Elgin.<br>  October 7 at Iroquois Ridge.<br>  October 9 at T.A. Blakelock.<br>  and October 16 at Milton District High School.<br>  The bottom line is that the board will try to achieve a better balance of service between north and south Halton while eliminating surplus space and saving 2 million dollars annually.<br>  Their timetable is tight,,,with final decisions expected by December 19th. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Mac - Strike H.Q.</b><p>
As Ontario doctors continue their funding feud with the province, Chedoke-McMaster in Hamilton is gearing up to become the province's command central for 24-hour emergency referrals, if doctors carry out their threat to strike November 1st. The hospital will also serve as the information source for the area on the status of medical services available. Both sides are still on talking terms with negotiations to avert a strike set to resume next Tuesday.
<hr>
<b>Greyhound - Hamilton</b><p>
It's full speed ahead for Greyhound Air which launched national passenger service out of Hamilton International Airport July 1st.<br> Today the airline announced a special reduced flylow airfare for passengers flying in and out of Mount Hope.<br> Between September 29th and December 17th, it offering round trip fare to the west for 199-dollars. That represents a 23 per cent reduction in the airline's economy prices and it's aimed at raising the awareness of the advantages of using Hamilton International Airport.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Canadian stocks fell today led by gold producers, metal issues, and banks.<br>   That breaks a string of record highs.<br>  Interest yields paid on Canadian government bonds moved lower.<br>  The chairman of the Hongkong Bank of Canada was in Hamilton today to open the bank's newly renovated downtown branch.<br>  
<hr>
<b>Bird Found</b><p>
 And finally this afternoon, a happy conclusion to the woeful tale of Charlie the cockatoo who had been missing from his home at pet city in Hamilton's east end. <br>  He was located by one of our viewers whose children spotted the unusual bird in their back yard. aside from a little squawking, Charlie is reported to be just fine, in spite of his day in the wilds of Hamilton.

<b>Stoney Creek Homicide?</b><p>
Tragedy in Stoney Creek tonight. A triple homicide. Three people: a woman and two children are dead and a man is in custody.  It happened at a townhouse complex in Stoney Creek.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Shooting</b><p>
And in Hamilton General Hospital this hour, a fourteen year old St. Catharines girl lies this hour hooked up to life support systems.<br> The teenager was shot in the head last night in her home by a 17 year old young offender.<br> The accused has been charged with attempted murder and appeared this morning in a St. Catharines court.<br> Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i>The 911 call came in eighteen minutes after eight last night.<br>  When emergency crews arrived at 18 Sherbourne Street in the north end they found Jasmine Vanscoy unconscious with a gunshot wound to the forehead.<br>  A 17 year old young offender was taken into custody and charged with the shooting.<br>  Police scoured the backyard for an hour before they came upon what they believe to be the weapon.<br>  A 45 calibre handgun stolen from a gunstore in Durham region in 1990. <br>  Jasmine Vanscoy was a grade nine student at Holy Cross Highschool.<br>  Friends who know her say they are shocked that she would be the victim of a shooting.<br>  There have been reports that this shooting was gang related.<br>  But police are downplaying that rumor.  And people who knew both Jasmine and the accused say they dont' believe that's true.<br>  The accused will appear in St. Catharines court next Tuesday for a bail hearing. </i>
<hr>
<b>School Discipline?</b><p>
Parents say they want more discipline in the schools.<br> Teachers, on the other hand, are faced with tighter restrictions than ever before ... and students, in general, seem to be more defiant and unruly, every year.<br> What happens?  Well, staff and students in a central Hamilton school are finding out, first hand... as Scot Urquhart reports:
<i> This central Hamilton parent says, the difference in his child, is like night, and day: <br>  The problem, he says, is one particular teacher; at Robert Land School. A teacher he claims treated his son in such a fashion, that he filed a complaint with the Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police: <br>  But the story doesn't end there. This week, a second parent also filed charges with the police, saying the same teacher physically disciplined her child: <br>  That, she says, is unacceptable: <br>  She suggests the teacher should have taken some privileges, like recess, away ... or possibly have called her at home. Instead, when she complained, she says, she was offered a meeting, and a chance to transfer her child out of the school: <br>  At the Board of Education; no confirmation that any incident even happened. The board is standing behind the right to privacy act. But what can the board do, in these situations? <br>  And what would satisfy this parent? </i>
<hr>
<b>Welfare Fraud</b><p>
Three more cases of welfare fraud have been cracked in Hamilton Wentworth.<br> In all three cases, Hamilton men were charged with collecting welfare while they were working.<br> The amount collected illegally in these individual cases ranges from just over 12-thousand to more than 16-thousand dollars.<br> 32 year old Jerardo Dezayas-Camacho, 37 year old Mohammad Kiana and a male teen who can't be identified under the young offender's act are all charged with fraud over 5-thousand dollars.
<hr>
<b>Phony 100's</b><p>
The Better Business Bureau and regional police have issued a warning about counterfeit 100-dollar bills passed in Hamilton recently.  The quality is good but the optical security device, that's the gold seal on the upper left corner, is poor. Anyone with information on a suspected phoney bill should call police.
<hr>
<b>United Way - Workfare</b><p>
With two million dollars at stake, practicality overcame policy today at a meeting of the board of directors of the Burlington- Hamilton- Wentworth United Way.<br>  The board averted the threat of a labour boycott by voting to amend its donor policy.<br>  Now anyone who objects to the provincial workfare program can ensure their money won't be spent on United Way agencies who take part in workfare pilot projects.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> The United Way funds seventeen- hundred agencies in Ontario.  To date, few of them have expressed any interest in workfare.  But that hasn't stopped organized labour from threatening to boycott the United Way, a move that could have cost the Burlington- Hamilton- Wentworth campaign two-million dollars in lost donations. So the United Way's board of directors voted to give contributors the option of writing "no workfare" on their donor ballots.  The board insists its a practical move, not a political one.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Following yesterday's decision by the American Central Bank to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged, Canadian banks reacted today by cutting mortgage rates.<br>  Canadian stock prices roared to another record high .<br>  Brantford auto parts maker TRW announced it will close the Brantford plant, affecting 183 jobs.<br> 
<hr>
<b>King St. Crash</b><p>
In downtown Hamilton this morning, it was a case of backed up traffic creating more of a back-up.<br> Three vehicles were damaged, but no one was hurt, during a three vehicle pile-up.<br> The car at the end of the chain reaction actually ended up partially underneath the pickup truck ahead.<br> Officers tell us the first vehicle in the pileup had stopped at a green light because traffic was so heavy, and the other two didn't stop in time.
<hr>
<b>10-Pound Mushroom</b><p>
Finally, quite the find during a walk in the woods in Binbrook for Teresa Lach and Ursula (mare-oh-no-veech). They brought home a ten pound mushroom.<br> It turns out the fungus, which was the size of three soccer balls before it was sliced up for cooking, is an edible puffball.<br> The women checked with the Royal Botanical Gardens, to ensure that it was safe to eat.<br> But Chris Graham, the RBG's chief horticulturist warns people to use extreme caution in eating any wild mushroom they find, to avoid poisoning.<br> Puffball mushrooms are common in this area in damp, cool conditions.

<hr>
<b>Ivor Wynne Zoning</b><p>
Bureaucratic bungling could cost the Hamilton Grey Cup more than a million dollars, and leave some ticket-holders with no seats to sit in. <br> At stake are eleven-thousand temporary seats to be added to Ivor Wynne Stadium.<br>  At war are the City of Hamilton's building department and its culture and recreation department, which operates Ivor Wynne Stadium.<br>  Building inspectors say culture and recreation staff should draw an illegal procedure penalty, for erecting the temporary seats without the necessary building permit.<br>  Deborah Walker reports.
<i> With exactly two months to go to the Grey Cup kickoff, top bureaucrats huddle at Hamilton City Hall.  They're trying to figure out who fumbled the ball, by failing to obtain the zoning change necessary to erect eleven-thousand temporary seats at Ivor Wynne Stadium.  <BR>With no zoning change, there's no building permit.  So inspectors had no choice but to shut down work on the installation of the temporary seats.  <BR>That's because Grey Cup profits will be split between the CFL, the City of Hamilton, and Hamilton- Wentworth region, to pay back municipal money used to lure the Grey Cup to Hamilton.  </i>

<b>Bike Lane</b><p>
Another controversy brewing again at regional council over those infamous bicycle lanes in the city's west end. Two years after scrapping them, council may be revisiting or perhaps re-peddling the idea.<br> Council will vote October first on a transportation committee proposal to mark the lanes between Macklin and Dundurn Streets on Main and King Streets at a cost of 10 thousand dollars. The region put the brakes on the old bike lanes when chaos erupted with rush hour traffic.
<hr>
<b>Prentice Dead</b><p>
The Dundas man who was known as Mr. Public Works has died. John Prentice who served on Dundas council for 36 years and a number of years on regional council, collapsed at a committee meeting last night, of an apparent aneurism and died in hospital this morning. He was Dundas citizen of the year in 1986, past president of the Dundas Lions Club and was chair for many years of the Lions Homes, an alternative housing project for seniors. John Prentice is survived by his wife Dorothy, and four children and served with the Royal Canadian Navy during world war two.  He's resting at the J.B. Marlatt Funeral Home in Dundas.
<hr>
<b>GM - Axle Plant</b><p>
Negotiations between General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers Union are underway.<br> The union has set next Wednesday at midnight as their strike deadline.<br> Even though both sides are talking, the union members we talked to in St. Catharines are preparing for the picket line.<br>  Lauran Sabourin reports.
<i>Fifty two hundred General Motors workers in St. Catharines have strike in the back of their minds.<br>  The last time GM Canada workers walked the picket line was in 1984.<br>  1996 could be another strike year. <br>  The union says hundreds of jobs have been lost in St. Catharines.<br>  Outsourcing is the main issue in the negotiations with GM.<br>  Three years ago the GM Axle Plant was sold to American Axle.<br>  The CAW negotiated a deal with the company to keep the 750 GM workers in the plant but production in St. Catharines is going to be phased out in 1998.<br>  Seven hundred fifty axle plant workers could be out on the street.<br>  Joining the 700 GM St. Kitts employees who lost their jobs when the foundry closed.<br>  Little by little the union says GM work is being contracted out to smaller and lesser paying manufacturers.<br>  The union fears the engine lines may be next. </i>
<hr>
<b>Inside Workers Vote</b><p>
  Our cameras were not allowed to show you but administrative and clerical workers were voting today on a tentative contract offer from the City of Hamilton.<br> 460 members of local 167 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees are eligible to vote.<br> Results are expected later this evening.<br> A week ago, Hamilton- Wentworth Region's inside workers, who are members of the same union local, voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new contract.
<hr>
<b>New WIC Boss</b><p>
As of November 1st, we have a new boss. John s. Lacey as been named the new president and CEO of WIC. WIC Western International Communications Ltd. is actually the parent company of CHCH-TV, along with numerous other broadcasting companies across Canada. <BR>Mr. Lacey, most recently an executive with Scott Hospitality Incorporated, brings with him many years of management experience in food services, transportation, hotels and the retail industry. This announcement concludes an extensive search that began in July when Douglas Holtby retired.
<hr>
<b>Bingo Stick-up</b><p>
Hamilton Wentworth Police are looking for a bingo hall bandit tonight.<br> A masked man walked into Centennial Bingo on Queenston Road around 10:30 last night, pointed a handgun at a cashier and demanded money.<br> The suspect is described as a white male, approximately five feet, ten inches tall.
<hr>
<b>Tassi Bravery </b><p>
A 67-year-old Hamilton man has been awarded the Governor- General's Medal of Bravery. First edition brought you the story of Philip Tassi in May of 1995.  He had confronted an armed masked bandit at a convenience store at Barton and Gage in Hamilton while paying for his gas fill-up. The man pointed a gun at his head and demanded his wallet.  Mr. Tassi grabbed the man's hand and after a struggle pinned him down until help arrived.  Two shots were fired narrowly missing our modest hero.     As a result of Mr. Tassi's actions, 42-year-old Peter Smyth was charged with three counts of robbery and firearms offences.  Mr. Tassi, the only ontario resident among nine Canadians to be awarded the Governor- General's Medal for Bravery, will be invited to a special reception in Ottawa on a date to be announced later.
<hr>
<b>Autism Cycle</b><p>
A team of wet and weary cyclists pedaled their way into Hamilton, this afternoon ... en route to Ottawa. The week long trip dubbed Cycle for Autism; is designed to raise public awareness about autism, and raise funds for research into the disorder. While in Hamilton, the group was joined by McMaster researcher Dr. Peter Zot- mah- ree ... who is internationally recognized for his work involving the neurologically based disorder. The ride organizer is Claudio Del Duca; a Windsor man who is the father of two autistic children.  October, is autism awareness month.
<hr>
<b>Cockatoo</b><p>
Finally tonight, workers at "Pet City" on Centennial Parkway in Hamilton's east end are on the lookout for a 13-week old cockatoo.  The large, white bird flew out the stores' front door this morning and hasn't been seen since.<br> The bird is still being hand fed and its owners are concerned that it might starve if not recovered. It's also the first time the cockatoo has been outdoors.<br> Despite being only 13-weeks old, the bird stands 26-inches from head to foot.

<b>palladini - red hill</b><p>
Make that one highway down... one expressway still to go for Hamilton- Wentworth region. <br>  Today, the province of Ontario loosened its purse strings just enough to allow completion of the stretch of highway 403 linking Brantford and Ancaster.<br>  However construction of the north-south leg of Hamilton's Red Hill Creek Expressway remains stalled.
And as Deborah Walker reports tonight, the question of who's going to pay for it won't be resolved until December at the earliest.
<i> They came from Ancaster, Brantford and Brant County to cheer Ontario transportation minister Al Palladini, who delivered the sixteen-and-a- half million dollar contract that will finish highway 403. The project will get unwanted traffic off highways two and fifty-three, and pave the way for economic development.  <BR>The province and Hamilton- Wentworth have agreed to disagree over the cost of completing the Red Hill Creek Expressway, with the province accusing the region of inflating the bottom line.  On Monday, a regional committee voted to pay half the four-hundred- thousand dollar cost of hiring independent consultants to settle the dispute.  <BR>And if the region's estimates are right, will the province chip in more than the 100-million dollars already committed to the project?  We'll find out in December, when the consultants deliver their report.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Milton Fatal</b><p>
This first full day of autumn has been a tragic one on golden horseshoe roads.<br> An Acton man died just before 8 o'clock this morning when a pickup truck travelling along Steeles collided with a minivan driving through the intersection at Tremaine Road.<br> The van rolled over into a ditch, killing 49 year old Gerald Dick. Halton police closed a section of Steeles Avenue from Tremaine Road to Peru Road in Milton while they conducted their investigation and are now seeking witnesses.<br> The driver of the pickup was shaken but received only minor injuries.

<b>Robert Pope Art</b><p>
It's an unusual art exhibit in an unlikely setting and sadly, the artists is no longer here to read the reviews.  You see he died after a battle with cancer. But he recounted his journey with a paint brush in hopes of offering support to others. Matt Hayes has the story of Robert Pope.
<i>When Robert Pope died in 1992 after a ten year battle with cancer he left behind a rich legacy. The 35 year old painter depicted the struggles of a cancer victim on canvas. His 32 piece exhibit is called &quot;illness and healing&quot; and is currently on display at Hamilton's Henderson Hospital. It is an emotional experience.<br>  Its hard not to be affected by what these pictures say and they speak volumes. Touring the exhibit with William Pope, the artists father, is like flipping through a proud father's scrap book of his sons life. One picture shows William driving his son home after a session of difficult therapy. He says he was privliged to be there for him then and the privledge continues.<br>  William Pope takes pride in a body of work that gives us all a greater understanding of the dark and difficult road the cancer patient takes.<br>  Illness and Healing, The Art of Robert Pope is on dispay in the hospital auditorium at Henderson Hospital daily from 10 am until 8:30pm Friday. Admission is free to this exhbit that deserves to be seen. </i>

<b>Ancaster Fair</b><p>
It's the last weekend of the summer of 96 and the roads are going to be busy. <br> There are fairs and celebrations gearing up throughout the golden horseshoe tonight and it looks like this beautiful weather is going to co-operate at least for a while. <BR>
Motorists are advised the 403 highway on the way to Ancaster between Mohawk Road and Main Street will be closed in both directions tomorrow morning between 10 and 10:15 while work crews do some blasting work in a rocky area of the escarpment known as the cascades.
<i>Now this is my idea of a day at school. Judging by the crowd everyone else had the same idea. 140 school buses carried kids out of the classroom for a day of farming and fun. Its the 146th year of the Ancaster Fair. The day can be an eye opener for kids of all ages. <br>    As for me I have other ideas.<br>  The word has traveled through the animal kingdom. The goats are very afraid. I'm back for my annual milking seminar.<br>  <br> We'll give the animals a rest and head to the midway for a little fishing and other games of chance along with food dizzying rides and death defying stunts.<br>  And there's still plenty more. Want to see for yourself? The Ancaster Fair continues through Sunday on Highway 53 at Southcoat Road.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Grape and Wine Festival</b><p>
Today marks the start of the 45th Annual Niagara Grape and Wine Festival.<br>  We take you to Lauran Sabourin in St. Catharines with more. 
<i>The Festival began with sausage and pancakes on the grill at the kickoff breakfast this morning in market square.  And over the next ten days there's so much more.<br>  But the reason this festival started was to celebrate the grape harvest and to showscase Niagara wines.<br>  Wine tastings, winery tours.<br>  Twenty one niagara wineries are involved in promoting this event.  The most number of wineries ever.<br>  Niagara grapes are at such a premium these days growers can't meet the demand.<br>  Not bad when predictions were just a few years ago that free trade would destroy the grape growing industry.<br>  The product is receiving world wide recognition and international awards.<br>  With fine wine goes fine food and this year many of the wineries are featuring gourmet dinners.<br>  trying to make the festival a more upscale attraction. <br>  But there are still some events that are tradition they will never change.<br>  This afternoon Howard staff was crowned the 1996 grape king.</i>
<hr>
<b>Chretien - Hamilton</b><p>
Enroute to the plowing match, the prime minister's plane landed at Hamilton International Airport.<br> The Canadair jet landed right on time and was greeted by a bevy of security officers.  The cavalcade was planned to quickly wisk the p.m. to the match.<br> But, office staff of the UPS terminal at the airport got an unexpected surprise when the cavalcade stopped abruptly and the prime minister got out.<br> Security officers quickly joined chretien as he went over to greet the flabbergasted workers.  He wouldn't stop however to talk to a CHCH-TV reporter but headed off to the plowing match.
<hr>
<b>Oakville Parade</b><p>
And some high profile visitors to Oakville this weekend as the city rolls out the red carpet to welcome home Donovan Bailey and its other Olympic heroes. A parade tomorrow morning at at 11:20 at Trafalgar Road and the QEW, proceeds south to Lakeshore Road, then west to Coronation Park for a noon civic reception.
<hr>
<b>High School Reform</b><p>
Yesterday it was getting rid of school boards, today it's changing the province's high schools.<br> Education minister John Snobelen says the current system is irrelevant.  He's proposing a massive jobs-oriented overhaul of Ontario's high school system.<br> Included are plans to let students decide if they'll pursue post secondary education before entering high school and establishing partnerships between schools and business.
<hr>
<b>Niagara - CUPE</b><p>
The union representing 650 striking Niagara region workers held a news conference today to explain why they rejected management's latest contract offer.<br> CUPE local 1287 also released the results of a survey that they say shows the striking employees do have support from taxpayers.<br> The union says even though the latest offer from management included provisions for job security it demanded other concessions.<br> And the union won't agree to concessions.<br> This morning union representatives rhymed off a litany of ways the region could save millions of dollars without asking its employees for concessions.           Niagara region says it needs to cut 8.7 million from its budget.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
For the fifth day in a row the value of Canadian stock prices in Toronto climbed to new all-time highs.<br>   The Canadian dollar also rose, closing above 73 cents US.<br>  Retail sales in Canada continue to improve. 
<hr>
<b>Take Back The Night</b><p>
A crowd of about 300 women and children walked through downtown Hamilton Thursday evening to "Take Back the Night."<br> This is the 15th year that women have reclaimed the streets in Hamilton.<br> The first Take Back the Night march was held in 1978 in San Francisco.<br> Since then the event has grown ...and now women around the world march in unison.
<hr>
<b>Cyclist Dies</b><p>
<br> Halton police are looking for witness to an accident that has claimed the life of a 16-year-old Burlington boy.<br> Dean Palmer of Elwood Road was hit by a car while riding his bicyle  Wednesday evening.  It happened on Walkers Line. The boy died from his injuries today at Hamilton General Hospital.

<b>Pot Fire Charges</b><p>
A Hamilton man has been charged after a marijuana growing operation went up in smoke Wednesday morning.<br> Firefighters stumbled upon the hydroponic setup while trying to put out flames at this downtown duplex.<br> 42 marijuana plants, a vial of marijuana oil and a bag containing traces of cocaine were found inside one apartment.<br> 37 year old Ken Churm faces a several narcotics charges as a result.
<hr>
<b>Car PSA</b><p>
Last March, we told you about a group of federally funded students trying to drive home the message that car theft isn't a game.<br> The group of 15 teenagers focussed on the Hamilton mountain area, targetting other teens through a mentoring program.<br> It seems their efforts are paying off.<br> Police say car theft in the target area is down 10 per cent over last year.<br> The group's funding has now run out, but they're work is not completely finished.<br> They've put together a public service announcement which will be airing here on CHCH TV, trying to prevent kids from joyriding in stolen vehicles.

<b>School Cuts</b><p>
Some startling words from eucation minister John Snobelen meeting with the Tory caucus in Vineland today. He says he's considering eliminating school boards.  <br>  He says people across the province have been telling him they'd feel more comfortable dealing with municipal councils than boards of education. And he's considering handing control over schools to municipally- appointed panels. The minister says it could help reduce school administration costs and give local politicians more control over educating children. Mr. Snobelen says he's waiting for recommendations this fall on changes to the education system from the so-called who does what committee.
<hr>
<b>Mac Career Day</b><p>
At the university level, aside from funding, a big problem is getting a job afterward. Today thousands of students at McMaster University tried to get a head start on their futures.<br>  47 companies set up displays to network with potential employees during the university's annual career day.<br>  Company reps talked with students about job opportunities, and how to prepare for the changing job market of the 21st century.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Vote</b><p>
In Niagara municipal workers have decided to stay off their jobs.  They'll be holding a news conference tomorrow morning to discuss the results of yesterdays vote to reject what the region calls its final offer. Region chairman Brian Merrett says he's disappointed and the region is not in a position to offer the union what it wants.<br> CUPE says it's willing to accept a wage freeze but is refusing to make any concessions.<br> The strike by 680 workers -- including social workers and garbage and maintenance crews -- began September 3rd.
<hr>
<b>AIC Booming</b><p>
 Concerns over job security and planning for the future has allowed one small Hamilton company to triple its business in the last year. Canadians have been pouring billions of dollars into mutual funds, and the AIC Group of funds, a money management firm has been a major benefactor.<br>  The other reason for its powerful growth is the performance of its investments.
<hr>
<b>Offender Watch</b><p>
Which part of the problem is the cause... and which part is the affect? Hamilton's Beasley Park has one of the highest reported crime rates in the city. It also has the largest concentration of social services in the province. is there a link between the two? That question will be the focus of a special neighbourhood meeting tonight; that will bring together residents, city staff, and social service agencies. Scot Urquhart has more:
<i> Hamilton's Beasley Park neighbourhood is said to have one of the highest concentrations of social service facilities, in the province. Half way houses, detox centers, shelters, counselling, and drop in centres. All within blocks of each other. It's believed that notorious pedophile Keith Legere; released in this area ... is still around. But if he is; no one has seen him, and he is certainly staying out of trouble. But that does not make area residents feel, any more secure: <br>  Rick took us on a walking tour of the area. past some of the facilites established within a four block radius of the park: <br>  Paul Johnson runs the Wesley Centre, one of the biggest targets of complaint, in the neighbourhood: <br>  And Linda Williams agrees. She lives in the building beside the Wesley Centre: <br>  And Rick says, it's not so much the daytime indigents at the centre ... as the gangs of youths at night time: <br>  How much is enough for one neighbourhood? And what responsiblities should agencies take; when they become residents of any neighbourhood? Those are just some of the questions that surround beasley park. The answers have yet to be found. </i>
<hr>
<b>Henkel Chemical</b><p>
In west Hamilton it's a bad smell that's become a major offender, at the site of an old chemical company.<br> Neighbours complained of nausea last night because of a smell eminating from the Henkel Chemical Company site.<br>  Henkel tore down the old Diamond Shamrock Company it purchased back in the late 80's, and is now trying to decommission the site for resale in a couple of years.<br>  The smell comes from a food preservative, BHT, which is decomposing in the soil and reacting with other chemicals.<br>  Henkel is issuing updates to residents living near the site, letting them know the smell may continue for the next couple of weeks, but there it doesn't pose a health risk.
<hr>
<b>Bailey Day</b><p>
A weekend of celebration is planned for Oakville as the town prepares to welcome its most famous citizen.<br>  Olympian Donovan Bailey returned home last night.<br>  And as Dwight Ryan reports, the town is all set to celebrate.  
<i><br>  At Donovan Bailey's Oakville watering hole, they're getting ready for a party. <br>  Another round of speeding bullets are served in honour of their most famous customer. <br>  The excitement began to build when the world's fastest man returned home Wednesday for the first time since winning double gold at the Olympics.  <br>    A whole weekend of events is planned to honour not only Donovan but three other Oakville Olympians.  <br>  Extra GO trains will be provided and free Oakville Transit will make it easier for the expected crowd.<br>  </i>

<hr>
<b>Hamilton Fire</b><p>
A Hamilton woman is grateful to her heroes today. She was asleep when fire broke out in her downtown apartment. But firefighers were in for a surprise; as Dwight Ryan reports, the 40-thousand dollar blaze resulted in a collection of marijuana plants going up in smoke.   
<i><br> It was just after 9:30 in the morning that firefighters were called to this 2 and a half story home on Arthur Street South.<br> The second story apartment was fully involved.<br> Kristopher Urech called 911.  <br>  Darlene Barlow was asleep in the lower apartment when the fire broke out.    <br>      It didn't take firefighters long to realize that the blazing apartment was home to a marijuana growing operation.   <br>         Hamilton Regional Police and the Fire Marshal's office will be investigating.</i>
<hr>

<hr>

<hr>
<b>Marijuana Garden</b><p>
It's not your average garden greenery.<br> Maybe that's why an elderly Hamilton woman didn't recognize she'd picked a marijuana plant from her own backyard as part of a bouquet for a friend.<br> But the woman's daughter knew what it was and called police.<br> Turns out the plant had grown from seeds blown across the yard from the next door neighbours.<br> 32 year old Mark Rogers of Hamilton is now facing charges of marijuana possession.
<hr>
<b>Welfare Fraud</b><p>
In what they promise will be the first of many welfare fraud crackdowns, Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police have arrested a 41 year old Hamilton man.<br> Investigators say the suspect had been working from 1991 to 1995, and collecting welfare at the same time.<br> Over the four year period, nearly 12-thousand dollars in social benefits were cashed.<br> 41 year old Brian Allayne has been charged with fraud.

<hr>
<b>Laidlaw Waste</b><p>
 One man's trash is another man's treasure ... and perhaps no one understands that maxim better; than James Bullock. The president of Laidlaw Waste Systems has just completed a huge deal; that turns garbage into a mountain of gold, for the Burlington company. Scot Urquhart has more:
<i><br>  What does this ... have in common, with this: <br>  Laidlaw Inc. The company best known for its garbage trucks, is getting out of the solid waste business. Selling its company to Allied Waste Systems of Scottsdale Arizona ... for one point six billion dollars. <br>  Laidlaw thought it could spend its money in more profitable areas. That's why it bought a piece of Scott's Hospitality Ltd. not for the chicken ... but for the six thousand school buses owned by Scotts: <br>  And in the U.S. ambulance companies are the target of Laidlaw takeovers: <br>  And as for these trucks: Laidlaw is getting out of low tech hauling, and into high tech handling... of waste: <br>  In all three business interests Laidlaw retains ... they are the largest operators in the field. And even by selling their solid waste business to Allied, and retaining a 20 percent share of the company ... they will be number three in North America. The Burlington based company has positioned itself for the future, and the future, looks bright. </i>
<hr>
<b>HW-Expressway</b><p>
He's hoping some private business will sift the Red Hill Creek Expressway into gear. For now it's idling in neutral.

<hr>
<b>Beamsville Jobs</b><p>
A company that makes spas and bathtubs plans to set up shop in Beamsville -- creating 60 jobs. Acryx is building an 80-thousand square-foot factory.<br> When it opens in January, it will be the largest plant in the town, west of St. Catharines.
<hr>
<b>Thorold Jail</b><p>
Mayor Mal Woodhouse of Thorold wants the provincial government to turn over the local jail to the city.<br> The Niagara Detention Centre in Thorold is one of 14 jails slated to close to make way for larger "super jails."<br> Woodhouse says he's not sure what use the jail would be put to by the city.<br> But he adds the government owes it to Thorold to transfer the jail to the city once it is closed.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Canadian stocks rose for the first time this week.<br> Interest rates remain stable while the dollar weakened a bit.<br> Most investors are still trying to guess how Canadian markets will perform if U.S. interest rates rise soon.<br>

<b>Taxes - Expressway</b><p>
Stop and go. That's the freeway situation in Hamilton and we're not talking about the traffic. <br> It's whether the Red Hill Creek Expressway will ever get built and when regional council meets in about two hours from now we may be a little closer to an answer.
<br> The latest sign of delay on the road... is a looming regional tax crunch, which has some councillors wondering whether we can now afford to build the road, or not.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Hospital Shakeout</b><p>
<br> With the amalgamation of the Civic Hospitals with Chedoke McMaster, personnel changes are a certainty.<br> Although the two hospitals have yet to merge, changes are already taking place.<br> Dwight Ryan has this update.  <br>  
<i>Fewer government dollars mean health care in Hamilton will change dramatically, and soon.<br>  Amongst the changes, an amalgamation of Chedoke McMaster Hospitals and the Civic Hospitals.<br>  McMaster's CEO Dr. Jennifer Jackman decided not to seek the new top administrative job.  She left Mac and is now out of the public eye.  Citizens have been kept in the dark over how much she got in severance.<br>  David McCutcheon of the Civic Hospitals applied for the new job but only got to the short list.  Yesterday he said he was off to Dublin for a new job.<br>  Taking the new job is R. Scott Rowand of Toronto.<br>  Civic officials can't say yet how much McCutcheon will get in severance. He had three years left in his contract.    <br>      Bienenstock says he'll take a few months to reflect and decide his options about the future.  He does say he'll remain in the community.  </i>
<hr>
<b>HW Workers</b><p>
Inside workers with the Region of Hamilton Wentworth have ratified a new collective agreement.<br> Members of CUPE Local 167 voted 83.5 percent to accept a deal that has been described as status quo.<br> Local 167 is also recommending Hamilton city workers accept their contract offer.<br> They'll be presented with a similar package Wednesday.
<hr>
<b>Business - First</b><p>
For the second day in a row, the value of stocks in Toronto closed at record high levels.<br>  Canada's biggest provider of funeral services, loewen group is being offered more than four billion dollars in a takeover bid.<br>  Auto industry watchers warn that new union contracts will lead to higher costs to consumers.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Rosenthal Dead</b><p>
A former Hamilton woman, murdered in New Jersey back in 1991, has been declared legally dead.<br> This even though Dede Rosenthal's body has not been found.<br> Rosenthal lived in Hamilton until six years ago, when she moved to New Jersey.<br> State prosectors there have obtained a court order for the death certificate so they can try to get a grand jury to indict the man who's confessed to killing Rosenthal.<br> Charles Reddish is also charged with the axe murder of a former girlfriend.
<hr>
<b>Oakville Fatal</b><p>
Halton Regional Police are looking for witnesses to an overnight car crash in Oakville that claimed one life. It happened on Bristol Circle east of Highway 5 and the 403. Officers say a vehicle slammed into a parked tractor trailer, and erupted in flames. The as yet unidentified driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
<hr>
<b>Kenilworth Crash</b><p>
A 39 year old man, up from Arizona for his father's funeral in Hamilton, remains in serious condition.<br>  This after a single vehicle crash overnight on the Kenilworth Access in east Hamilton.<br>  Police say Philip Kiley has severe head injuries and two broken legs.<br>  The car he was riding in went out of control, hitting a couple of medians at the bottom of the access.<br>  21 year old Angela Harris of Hamilton has been charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm.<br>  Harris was released from hospital with relatively minor injuries after the airbag on her side of the car deployed.
<hr>
<b>Flasher Caught</b><p>
Police have nabbed a man who exposed himself to two grade eight students this week on their way to school.<br> The girls were walking through an alleyway to Prince of Wales School in east Hamilton when they saw a man with his pants pulled down around his ankles.<br> 42 year old Daniel Ryan of no fixed address is charged with committing an indecent act, and breach of probation.
<hr>
<b>E.D. Smith - 115</b><p>
Back on this day in 1881, Ernest D'israeli Smith received his first income from the fruit business.<br> Now the Winona plant that bears his name is celebrating its one hundred and fifteenth birthday.<br> The business, still run by the Smith family, opened its doors to suppliers and employees' families for a special day of tours and activities.<br> The E.D. Smith plant, which supplies fruit and tomato-based products to companies across North America, now employs 350 full and 100 part time workers.<br> The Winona processing plant is also in the process of expanding, and by early next year will have added another manufacturing line.

<b>YOA</b><p>
<br>   Hamilton- Wentworth police are recommending major changes to the Young Offenders Act.<br> Police Services Board members are meeting at downtown quarters right now.  <br> This all comes on the same day the case of a 15-year-old charged with second degree murder is put over until January for a transfer hearing. The teen is charged in the beating death of 18-year-old Roberto Oliveira at Lime Ridge Mall last May.<br> He died after being struck over the head with a baseball bat.<br> January's hearing will determine if the youth will be tried in adult court.
<hr>
<b>HW Workers</b><p>
While changes to the Young Offenders Act could dramatically affect regional police services, so could a strike by its administrative workers. 1200 members of CUPE local 167, inside regional workers employed by the region, are voting on a new contract offer today. The union is recommended acceptance of the deal which essentially maintains the status quo although more job cuts are expected.  Local 167 is also recommending Hamilton city workers accept their contract offer. They'll be presented with a similar package Wednesday.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Negotiations</b><p>
<br> Meanwhile the union representing striking regional workers in Niagara is urging members to reject what the region has called its final offer.<br> Union negotiator Jim High says if the membership follows the union's recommendation, the regional government could reconsider its position.<br> The offer will be presented to the employees this week, but no voting date has been set.<br> The 680 regional workers have been off the job since September 3rd.
<hr>
<b>gorge body</b><p>
A woman fell 30 metres to her death in the Niagara Gorge early today.<br> She was apparently sitting on a stone retaining wall a kilometre from the falls at about 2 a.m.<br> A male companion called for help but it took firefighters about two hours to find the body.<br> The woman's name won't be released until relatives are contacted. An autopsy is planned.
<hr>
<b>Apology</b><p>
<br> On August 22nd, 1996, CHCH Television aired a report on its 5:30 and 11:00 o'clock news broadcasts regarding upaid property taxes, which drew particular attention to a property owned by Frank Levy, a local businessman.<br> Unfortunately, we went to air with the reports without having given Mr. Levy an opportunity to explain the tax arrears situation concerning his property.  Had we done so we would have learned that Mr. Levy's company, Usarco Ltd., had financial difficulties in the late 1980's, the result of which left him without control over the property for some 3-1/2 years between 1990 and 1994.<br> Mr. Levy says that it is during this period that the extensive tax arrears accumulated on the property. Now that he is back in control of the property, Mr. Levy says that he is anxious to work out a reasonable solution with city officials.<br> Our report gave the impression Mr. Levy was trying to avoid speaking with our reporter.  We understand now from Mr. Levy that he was simply out of town when our reporter tried to contact him.  We apologize if our viewers received a different impression.  We also apologize for publishing Mr. Levy's phone number on the air during our reports.  CHCH is pleased to make this apology and sincerely regrets any inconvenience and embarrassment which may have been caused to Mr. Levy.
<hr>
<b>Med Student Oath</b><p>
<br>  Medical students at Hamilton's McMaster University are about to take an oath.<br>  The oath, in part, puts patients first.<br>  Its something they feel is necessary with more and more stories making news about doctors and their fight with the government.<br>  Dwight Ryan has this report.  <br>  sot
<i> They are future doctors.  And they are concerned about their pending profession.<br>  So the 23 year-old second year med students at Hamilton's McMaster University are about to take an oath..an oath that puts patients first.<br>  Media stories about physicians and their fight with Queens Park have them wondering what happened to the patient.    <br>  The medical students feel that they must re-affirm their dedication to patients early in their learning process.   <br>    Hamilton cardiologist Lorne Finkelstein says the students will soon learn that being political is a necessity if you're a doctor.    </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
Scientists at  the Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Centre are getting a 20 million dollar investment from mutual fund investors to help develop a heart drug.<br>  The value of stocks in Toronto and New York closed at new record highs today as investors bet that interest rates will remain low for now.<br> <A HREF="../eveningnews/evngbusiness.htm">For further details see the Evening Business Report.</A> 
<hr>
<b>Philip Zinc</b><p>
<br> Turning waste into money.<br> It's something Hamilton-based Philip Environmental has been doing for years.<br> Now they've introduced a new system to recycle dust from the steel industry into metal and other reusable materials.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  It's being described as a breakthrough technology.<br>  This site will soon house the world's first zinc iron plasma process unit.<br>  It will also bring about a hundred jobs into the Hamilton area.<br>  Electric arc furnace dust is a hazardous byproduct of the steel industry.<br>  The dust has been recycled into the cement industry, but over the past few years it's changed in composition because of different steels being used in the auto industry.<br>  That means more metals can be recovered.<br>  At the new site, one hundred per cent of E.A.F. dust will be recycled, thanks to a unit which can quickly zap it using temperatures hotter than the sun's surface.  <br>  Philip's president and ceo, Allan Fracassi, says the pig iron will go back into the steel industry, and the zinc oxide could be used in everything from batteries to suntan lotion.  </i>

<b>Housing Starts/Sales</b><p>
<br>  Housing starts in Hamilton have tripled over a year ago.  This combined with a surge in the resale market, has homebuilders and realtors smiling once again.<br>  As Dwight Ryan reports, low interest rates aren't the only reason people are finally taking the plunge.  
<br> <i>Hammers havn't been hammering and saws havn't been sawing like this since the summer of '88. <br>  Canada's housing market is experiencing a dramatic turnaround. Figures from coast to coast show that construction is up and resale homes are selling in record time.<br>  Hamilton is no exception.  <br>    A shortage of resale starter homes means more first time buyers are turning to townhouses. Homebulders are smiling now that consumer confidence is returning.   <br>  That confidence, combined with low interest rates and reasonable home prices means happy days are hear again for realtors.    <br>Realtors and homebuilders believe the slow, steady pace of today's housing market will continue at least until the end of the year.</i>
<hr>
<b>Niagara Strike</b><p>
<br>  The strike by 650 regional Niagara workers is going into its second week and no new talks are scheduled.<br>  The striking employees look after regional public services.<br>  But does the public even notice that the workers are off the job.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more in this report.
<i>Walk into Niagara Regional Headquarters and non union staff are manning the front desk.<br>  Management personnel are running the departments while 650 employees walk the picket lines. <br>  Two weeks into labor dispute is it having a noticiable impact on service.<br>  Niagara regional workers are responsible for operating water and sewage plants, looking after roads, some day care services and handling welfare cases. <br>  The welfare office was busy.<br>  People are being promised cheques. but they have to wait.<br>  These four young men go to high school. They live in the same apartment. Two were offered service cheques today. But they say that isn't enough.<br>  Meanwhile talks between both sides in this dispute have stalled. <br>  The question now at least for those affected by the walkout is how long is going to last.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Education Cuts</b><p>
 Hamilton school children may score an extra week's vacation this March break, according to a tentative calendar issued by the Board of Education.  Chair Bob Stewart says the board hopes to negotiate some unpaid leave days to help cover a five million dollar budget shortfall, when contract talks with elementary teachers resume september 16th.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
<br>  Financial markets in Canada were quiet today with little change in stock prices and the dollar.<br>   Canadian double gold Olympic medalist Donovan Bailey helped a Canadian company launch a stock listing on the New York Stock Exchange.<br>  Several area companies are being awarded by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce tonight for outstanding business achievement.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Sewage Blame</b><p>
And the dispute continues between taxpayers and regional government in Hamilton- Wentworth over last winter's pump shutdown at Hamilton's Woodware Avenue Sewage Treatment Plant.<br>  One hundred and 16 residents, most of them from Stoney Creek, have filed statements of claim with Hamilton Wentworth Region for damages as a result of the flood.<br>  Those claims could end up costing the region millions of dollars.<br>  Today, members of the region's Environmental Services Committee voted to request Philip Utilities Management Corporation help pay for those damages.<br>  Philip operates the sewage treatment plant, which is owned by the region.
<br>  Hamilton Wentworth Regional Council will vote on the committee's recommendation next Tuesday night.
<hr>
<b>Barton Stand-Off</b><p>
A Hamilton man is in jail tonight after a stand-off with police.<br>  Police surrounded an east end apartment building after getting a call from a man claiming his neighbour had threated him with a gun.<br>  About two hours later, the suspect was arrested outside the apartment.<br>  After conducting a search warrant, police found a 22 calibre rifle in his apartment.<br>  44 year old Fred Baranowski is charged with threatening death, pointing a firearm and breach of probation.

<b>Private Red Hill</b><p>
<br> Hamilton Wentworth politicians say that if the Red Hill Expressway is built with private funds, it will be built sooner and cheaper.<br> But at least one member of the committee still feels the controversial roadway isn't needed at all.<br> Dwight Ryan has that story..
<i><br>   Traffic could flow from Hamilton's new east/west expressway down the Red Hill Valley by the year 2000, if a plan to privately fund the controversial north/south route goes ahead.<br>  In what will amount to a lease to own arrangement, the Red Hill route would be designed and built by a privte consortium ..and the region will buy it back over the next twenty odd years.   <br>   Members of the Regional Transportation Committee vow to go ahead with the roadway, even though the harris government has failed to live up to election promises.  <br>  Since then, the province has reduced the amount of money promised and offered it in stages.  But area politicians say the Queen's Park door isn't closed.  <br>    Members of the Regional Transportation Committee will meet again in two weeks to further examine the idea of private funding for the controversial roadway.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>United Way</b><p>

<b>hamilton-employment</b><p>
We begin tonight with some good news to wrap up the week. The unemployment rate is down dramatically in Hamilton and across the country. <br>  After reaching ten percent just a few months ago, Canada's jobless rate now stands at 9.4 percent. And Hamilton, at seven percent, just about the lowest in the country, continues to help lead the way.<br>  Dwight Ryan has that story.  
<i><br>  Job creation in Canada is bouncing back.<br>  82 thousand new jobs were created in August, mostly full time, far exceeding those lost in May and June.  Most of the new jobs were created in Ontario and Quebec.<br>  Susan Martin watches the job market from the Michael G. Degroote School of Business at McMaster University.  And she believes Canada's job outlook is bright.   <br>    The national unemployment rate now stands at 9.4 percent, down sharply from 9.8 percent in July.<br>  Topping the list is Newfoundland at nearly 18 percent.  The lowest rate is in Regina at 6.3.<br>   Hamilton's next at seven percent.<br>   Its welcome news to the region's director of economic development. Nick Catalano credits area industries for their confidence.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Labour Demo</b><p>
<br> There may be more jobs available in Ontario. But union leaders fear those jobs won't be safe, if the Tory government pushes ahead with its agenda for labour reform.<br> Dozens of injured workers, social activists, and unionized employees marched on the Hamilton office of the Ministry of Labour today.<br> They say it's time Ontario's premier and labour minister stopped turning a deaf ear on workers' fears for their safety.<br> Deborah Walker reports.
<i> These workers predict more people will be hurt and killed on the job, if Ontario's government cuts enforcement of workplace safety standards, and curtails an employee's right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions.  And union leaders say those who are hurt on the job will be further penalized by proposed reforms to the Workers' Compensation system, and the possible closure of Occupational Health clinics for Ontario workers.  <BR>What most frustrates these workers is the Tories' failure to meet with them face-to-face.  And while there would be no meeting today with the premier or the labour minister, the director of the Ministry of Labour's western region did give them a hearing.  <BR>This is the seventh time workers have staged a ministry of labour sit-in in a major ontario city. And they vow to keep on doing it, until the Harris government starts listening.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cancer Office</b><p>
<br> Last night we told you about the frightening problem at a Hamilton Bell Canada office.<br> Word today that fifty workers have been cleared out of the third floor of the building.<br> The company and federal industry hygienists are trying to find out why employees on that floor have shown an alarmingly high cancer rate and are developing an action plan.<br> Company and union officials say at least 10 of 50 workers on the third floor have been diagnosed with breast cancer, colon cancer, brain tumors or uterine cancer.<br> Bell Canada spokesman Perry Blocher says tests of air quality, radiation and other emissions have all come back within acceptable industry standards.<br>  But the union representing some Bell workers believes there's a link between the incidence of cancer and electromagnetic fields emitted by computers in the workplace.
<hr>
<b>Robbery Arrests</b><p>
Two 17-year-olds from Mississauga have been charged with robbery and one with breach of probation after a robbery at a Shell gas station in east Oakville.  The male brandished a large knife, threatening the lone female attendant, demanding cash and cigarettes. The pair ran from the scene but were arrested a at a Mississauga home a short time later
<hr>
<b>Blast Averted</b><p>
<br> That file is closed but an investigation is still underway after a Georgetown resident found a pipe bomb wrapped in a towel in his driveway.  The Halton Police explosive disposal unit neutralized the device but say it was powerful enought to kill someone and cause extensive property damage.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
<br>  Financial markets accepted today's strong unemployment statistics with a positive tone.<br>  Stock prices in New York and Toronto rose.<br>  Interest yields on government bonds moved lower.<br>  Analysts are forecasting good things for Canada's economy. 
<hr>
<b>City Colours</b><p>
<br> Finally tonight, how would you colour Hamilton? <br> The majority of those involved in a Cantel Colour Your City survey saw red:  red was associated with exciting, emergetic, courageous and passionate.  Most Torontonians were serene blue for intelligent, and sincere, Barrie tested sunny yellow, warm and optimistic, Ottawa peaceful green. The August survey was part of a promotion for new colour cell phones but the researchers found it interesting to note why certain colours were more popular in different cities.

<b>food bank woes</b><p>
Times are tough and getting tougher.  We've heard it all before.  <br>  But in this era of layoffs, and cutbacks, and funding problems; a disturbing new trend is beginning to emerge.

<br>   Not only are we as a society becoming leaner ... but in some ways it seems, we are becoming meaner, as well. Scot Urquhart has one example of what that means in Hamilton:<BR>
<i>Ester Benjamin is on her own, with three daughters. She is a client at the Neighbour to Neighbour Food Bank. The organization announced today, that it has put its staff on layoff notice; and could close its doors at the end of September. <br>  Originally; scores of churches on the mountain ran ad hoc food banks on a volunteer basis. Why is it then, that Neighbour to Neighbour needs full time staff? <br>  And what's more; Everest believes there is no need to apologize for the evolution of the organization. <br>  None of this matters, however, to Ester Benjamin. What matters in her life, is that when she was desperate; someone was there. <br>  But one day, may never come. Without government money to pay its staff, and 850 clients a month to feed; Neighbour to Neighbour says it is surviving month to month. It is clear the province will not carry the load any longer. the question is; who will? </i>
<hr>
<b>Bell Cancer</b><p>
Bell Canada officials have launched their own investigation, into a medical mystery at Bell Canada's Hamilton office. Workers on the third floor have been suffering from an alarmingly high cancer rate.<br>  Ten percent of the workers on the floor have developed cancer and there have also been several miscarriages.<br>  About 15 percent of the 150 employees have been affected. Union spokesman Gary Lloyd says people have developed breast cancer, brain tumours and colon and uterine cancer. The union suspects the cause is emissions from computers and fax machines. A Bell study found that radiations levels are within normal limits.
<hr>
<b>Sewage Spill</b><p>
Another health scare in Niagara. Almost two-million litres of raw sewage was flushed into Lake Ontario this week after a sewage plant was sabotaged. Niagara Region spokesman Michael Boggs says a piece of the plant's front gate was one of the objects found blocking the intakes to the Port Weller plant shortly before regional employees began a strike on Tuesday. By the time the two intake screens were cleared, an estimated 1.8-million litres of sewage had entered the Welland Canal and Lake Ontario.<br>   Ministry of Environment officials have visted the plant and agree someone "wilfully" blocked the intakes.
<hr>
<b>Robber Caught</b><p>
<br>  In Hamilton, police have made an arrest in a 4-month-old robbery.<br>  On May fifth, a male thief handed a note demanding money to a teller at an east Hamilton branch of the Royal Bank, claiming he had a gun. Today, police arrested a man on an unrelated matter who had a similar note in his possession. Charged with robbery is 45-year-old Richard Ernest Stanton of no fixed address.
<hr>
<b>Tickets - Buses</b><p>
<br>  Police in Hamilton have also been catching lots of speeders lately. A crackdown between August 18th and 31st netted 794 tickets.  Police tell us the high number shows too many of us are still driving too fast; people are just too aggressive.    <BR>And police are going to get agressive with drivers who fail to observe school bus laws. They've proclaimed next week school bus enforcement week. Aside from pushing education and awareness, they'll also be pushing fines of $265 and six demerit points. Watch out of you live near Mohawk Road and Upper Wellington, Highway 6 and Upper James.
<hr>
<b>Air Show Fiasco</b><p>
 And there's some turbulence in the skies over Hamilton right now...<br>  Hamilton- Wentworth regional politicians are flabbergasted at the news the Hamilton International Air Show lost nearly 200-thousand dollars this year, a loss that may have to be covered by regional tax dollars.<br>  As Deborah Walker reports, some of those politicians wonder whether taxpayers should keep footing the bill for a perennial money-loser.
<i> Hamilton- Wentworth regional politicians are used to bailing out the air show when bad weather grounds performers, and drowns attendance.  But this year, the weather was perfect.  <BR>Pat Sullivan is on the board of directors of the Hamilton International Air Show.  He blames poor attendance this year on the seniors PGA Golf Tournament held the same weekend.  To make matters worse, construction on Highway 403 backed up traffic for five kilometres, discouraging even people holding free air show tickets.  </i>

<b>The Morning Market</b><p>
 Starting Monday there's going to be a new early morning shift here at CHCH-TV when The Morning Market debuts at 6 a.m.<br>  Our new program will offer morning viewers an all-inclusive package of Canadian news and business from around the world.  <br>

<b>redevelopment plan</b><p>
Don't count on out-of-towners to save downtown Hamilton.  And don't count on taxpayer financed mega projects to stop the core's decay. <br> That's the advice of a report presented today to political and business leaders, who've been meeting for a year to develop a strategy to halt the decline of the heart of Hamilton.


<br> The report, entitled "Strong Medicine", prescribes thirty-three recommendations to rejuventate the downtown.<br> Deborah Walker has details.
<i> The report concludes people are the key to revitalizing downtown Hamilton ... people living here, working here, shopping here, and spending leisure time here.  The report suggests a partnership between the public and private sector, led by a newly-hired, independent downtown co-ordinator, can lure people back to the core.  <BR> Right now, much of downtown Hamilton is not a people-friendly place, littered as it is with empty storefronts and boarded-up buildings.  <BR> There are no storefronts or sidewalk cafes to entice pedestrians to browse or linger. The report considers this a prime area for redevelopment.  The report also suggests returning two-way traffic to part of King Street, improving pedestrian links between Hess Village, the King and James area, the International Village and Theatre Aquarius, judicious recycling of some older buildings, and a more lenient parking policy.  <BR>And while municipal governments can help by supporting development projects and tax appeals, the report says they should get out of the business of building mega-projects like Copps Coliseum. Because if you can't lure your own citizens downtown, you can't expect to draw tourists either.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Art Gallery Woes</b><p>
<br> A vibrant arts community could have a large role to play in the revitalization of the downtown core; but at the moment ... that community is anything but vibrant. Theatre Aquarius is down; the HPO... is out. and now the art gallery says, it, is on shaky ground. More on that from Scot Urquhart:
<BR><i>  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they say .... but beauty of this magnitude, is expensive. <br>  The government taketh away, and the Art Gallery of Hamilton is about to make an impassioned plea to them, to give it back. <br>  But Ted Pietrzak insists, this will be a hand up ... and not a hand out: <br>  The irony in all of this, is that the art gallery admits, it's financial position is better than either of those organizations. They have no deficit. They own the building. They have a huge endowment generating substantial interest income. Heck, they have an art collection worth 44 million dollars. Why do they need more public money, and why wouldn't they resort to the obvious; and sell some of this work: <br>  But Ted Pietrzak does. Selling gallery stock he says, is tantamount to sacrilege: and that, says Pietrzak, is why the gallery needs more than 700-thousand dollars over three years, to help them stablize their short term debt load. But no matter how you package it, it's going to be a tough sell. But will taxpayers, and regional council agree? The answer will come, over the next few weeks. </i>
<hr>
<b>Kocis Sentenced</b><p>
A Grimsby man, who shot a friend and co-worker twelves times, was sentenced today to ten years in prison, on top of the fourteen months he has already spent in custody.<br>  The body of David Heagle of St. Catharines was found June twenty-first last year at the Stoney Creek Agricultural Airstrip.<br>  Just as his first-degree murder trial was about to begin, 25-year-old Christopher Kocis of Grimsby pleaded guilty to manslaughter.<br>  Kocis admitted he was acting as a back-up for heagle at a drug deal, when he panicked and shot his friend.<br>  Heagle died two days before his twenty-fifth birthday.<br>  In a victim impact statement read in court today, family members described Heagle as a kind, loving productive young man.<br>  Instead of buying him a birthday gift, they said they were forced to buy him a funeral plot.
<hr>
<b>King St. Attack</b><p>
A 50-year-old Hamilton man is recovering in hospital tonight after a brutal assault last night.  It happened during a confrontation between two people downtown Hamilton. The man was rushed to Hamilton General Hospital after he received he was beaten severely about the head, inside an apartment at 415 King Street West. Police took a thirty year old man into custody. He is believed to be a former tenant.
<hr>
<b>Musitano Cleared</b><p>
The former owners of a Dundas hotel have been acquitted of plotting a 1992 arson attempt that threatened to turn the downtown landmark Collins Hotel into ``a ball of fire.'' Noting that ``suspicion heaped upon suspicion'' doesn't add up to guilt, Justice Walter Stayshyn found 28 year old Pat Musitano, and his 34 year old brother-in-law, John Trigiani, not guilty of conspiracy to commit arson and arson for the purpose of insurance fraud.<br> A potentially disastrous fire was averted at the hotel on March 5th, 1992, when an upstairs resident smelled gasoline and called 911.<br> Police and firefighters found timer-rigged toasters stuffed with paper leading to a trail of gasoline-soaked paper placemats through the hotel's lower level.
<hr>
<b>Villa Inquest</b><p>
An inquest into the deaths of five residents of the St. Elizabeth Villa between January  1994 and April of 1995 will begin November 12th. The inquest follows an investigation into what regional coroner Dr. Bonnie Porter had called a high mortality rate. 42 people at the Hamilton home for seniors and the disabled over a 15-month periods. The Villa says the deaths were expected but a number of former staff members insisted residents were receiving sub-standard care.
<hr>
<b>Morison Dies</b><p>
 A memorial servie has been scheduled for former Hamilton MP John Morison, who died in Ottawa yesterday at the age of 73. He was the MP for Hamilton-Wentworth and Burlington from 1963 to 1972 and is pictured here during a Liberal rally at the Palace Theatre in 1965.  A member of the RCAF. during world war two and a prisoner of war from 1944 to 1945, Mr. Morison was also a prominent Hamilton businessman who operated a successful general insurance business.  He is survived by his second wife Deidre, and five of his six children. The memorial service will be held next Monday at Melrose United Church at 2:30, with a reception at the Royal Hamilton Military Institute.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
<br>  Canadian stocks rose for a second day led by shares of oil and gas companies.<br>  Interest rates on Canadian government bonds are stable. <BR>The dollar is higher closing above 73 cents US<br>  Economists are suggesting Canada's economy will strengthen noticably in the second half of this year.  <br>  
<hr>
<b>Junos-hamilton</b><p>
<br> Guess what's coming back to Hamilton?  The Canadian music industry will be showcasing excellence in music making with their major event of the year.<br>  Once again the honors will be taking place in the city.
<hr>
<b>Hamilton Music</b><p>
<br> So as Hamilton prepares to host the Juno stars of today, Hamilton musicians aspire to be the stars of tommorrow. With a failed music career under his belt our Matt Hayes set out to find the secret to music success. He caught up to a young man whose music is about to take him a long way from home.
<i>And as Caras president Lee Silversides announced the March 9th date of the third straight Juno awards in Hamilton, down the street at Grant Avenue Studios a young hamilton man is mapping out his music career by a rather unusual route.<br>  Vincentis entering the music scene via Italy where he hopes his self penned album of Italian songs will top the charts. After winning a couple of Italian song competions he attracted the interest of Dig-it Records in Italy. Normaly the album would be recorded there but producer Vince Tempera came to Hamilton to capture what he calls the Canadian sound. <br>  So what's suddenly made Canadian music so hot. <br>  As for Vincent he plans an english version of the album to be released domestically.<br>  So it seems only fitting that as Hamilton prepares to play host to Canada's brightest stars at the Junos a young hamilton man launches a career that will take him around the world with the hopes that one day he will stand on this stage in his hometown for his moment of glory.<br>  </i>

<b>back to school</b><p>
More than 27-thousand public elementary students went back to school in Hamilton, this morning. <br>   ... but their back to school story, is not the only one. 15-hundred teachers spent their first day back in the classroom ...
<BR>
Many of them not knowing, whether they will have a teaching job at the end of the year. Scot Urquhart has the story, of one of those teachers:
<i><br>  It is back to school for Marlo Moore ... but unlike many of the students around her, who know they have many years of school in front of them... Marlo knows, this could be her last year. <br>  Marlo is teaching Special Ed this year. In a five year career, she's taught four different specialties, and been fired three times. Not because she's a bad teacher, but because education these days, is so uncertain. <br>  </i>
<br> The Hamilton Board of Education is still in contract talks with its elementary teachers. Those negotiations could end with further job cuts. Marlo Moore, is one of those who may once again face unemployment, come June.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Strike </b><p>
While teachers negotiate for their futures on the heels of Labour Day, hundreds of Ontario workers are now on strike. Six hundred, fifty employees with Niagara region walked off the job today at noon.<br> The members of CUPE Local 1287 have been in a legal strike position since Sunday.<br> The main issue in this dispute is job security.<br> To save 650 thousand dollars management says it may contract out certain jobs.<br> But the union charges that management hasn't done enough to cut costs in other areas.<br> Union members offered to take 8 days off without pay between now and the end of the year.<br>  The union represents welfare staff, sewage and water treatment workers, and those who manage the day care and seniors homes.
<hr>
<b>OPSEU - Hamilton</b><p>
And employees of one of Ontario's largest trade unions are on strike. In Hamilton, Ontario public service staff union workers picketed the Hamilton office of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union. The 250 member union of staff reps girevance officers and support staff are protesting over layoff notices, scheduled to take effect next week. OPSSU  members helped direct the strike by 46-thousand OPSEU members against the Harris government earlier this year.  
<hr>
<b>Mac - Civics</b><p>
<br>   The merger of Chedoke McMaster Hospitals and the Hamilton Civic Hospitals will create one of the largest health care organizations in Canada.<br>  And a 42 year-old Edmonton native will be at the helm.<br>  Dwight Ryan reports that after a lengthy and exhaustive cross Canada search, someone has been found to lead the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation.  <br>  
<i><br>  The cat is finally out of the bag...   <br>    With 1350 beds, a budget of 400 million dollars and a staff of eight thousand the merger will create one of Canada's largest health care providers.<br>  42 year old Scott Rowand was one of hundreds of applicants from across Canada.  Just five made the short list.<br>   An impressive resume helps and Rowand's is just that.. <br>  Assistant professor in the faculty of medicine at U. of T. <br>  President of the Association of Canadian Teaching Hospitals, <br>   Past president of the Ontario Council of Teaching Hospitals and  past chair of the Toronto Academic Health Sciences Council. There's more. He's a member of the advisory council for the Centre for Health Economics at McMaster and the Hospital Management Research unit at U. of T.<br>  Its the kind of C.V. one needs to earn 339 thousand a year. Not the highest paid hospital CEO in the province ..and not the lowest.   <br>    Rowand told his Toronto colleagues that he's on his way.<br>  And he's says he's up to the challenge for his new job in Hamilton.  <br>  The target date for the merger is October 1st.<br>  Rowand will start his five year contract as CEO in early November.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Health Sciences </b><p>
<br>  Almost 26 million dollars in funding over the next three years was confirmed today for a McMaster University and Mohawk College Centre for Applied Sciences, to be constructed on the Mac campus. Hamilton West MPP Lillian Ross made the announcement. The facility will train as many as seven thousand full and part ime students in occupational therapy, physiotherapy, nursing, medical imaging, and pharmacy assisting, among other skills.
<hr>
<b>Burlington Flood</b><p>
<br> A flood emergency in Burlington today. The sun was shining so it wasn't the weather...  but a 50-year-old watermain that simply had deteriorated with age.<br> The old cast-iron main, under Queensway Drive ruptured early this morning, sending torrants of water gushing into a backyard on Brinell Street.<br> That yard ended up under two feet of water. A city of Burlington official says there's no damage inside the house.<br> Crews spent much of the day pumping and making repairs to the road.
<hr>
<b>Police Auction</b><p>
<br> Looking for a good used bicycle? Try the Halton Police Auction set for this Saturday.<br> They'll be selling off about 180 bikes... as well as a variety of other unclaimed merchandise... to the highest bidders. Viewing at 8:30 a.m... the auctions starts at 9:30 at the police HQ building at the QEW and Bronte Road in Oakville.

<b>tax bullies</b><p>
<br> Few in number, large in debt. That's the story of a handful of delinquent taxpayers, who collectively owe the city of Hamilton millions of dollars in tax arrears.  All this week we've brought you their stories, or at least we've attempted to and have shared our efforts with you.
Tonight, the story of a disabled woman who also owes the city some money. She's been taken to court several times, and every day, she feels the burden of the taxman. Scot Urquhart has her story.
<i>Louise Lloyd, has not had an easy life. She's on her own. And she works hard. She was born with clubbed feet; and lost those seven years ago in an industrial accident. But she doesn't get a penny, in Workers' Compensation. Despite that, she want's to make it clear, she's not complaining: <br>  Louise owes about three thousand dollars, by her calculations; and she's trying to pay it back: <br>  She may be joking about it; but Louise admits she's: <br>  Louise says, she's tried and tried to strike a deal with the city: <br>  Louise knows that, only too well, and she vows to pay the money back. She says all she's looking for, is a chance, to survive. <br>  Bob Charters says, if she comes to see him ... she may get it. <br>  There are fifteen thousand cases of tax arrears in Hamilton ... and you can bet, there are two sides, to every story. </i>
<hr>
<b>More Region Reform</b><p>
<br>  Hamilton Wentworth Regional Council has agreed to disagree on the issue of regional reform.<br>   City councillors and suburban councillors will seek third party assistance in resolving the reform issues while keeping the region operating as usual...<br>  Jamie West reports...
<i>Finding the answer will likely be a much more difficult affair...<br>  To that end regional chairman Terry Cooke moved that a provincial mediator be brought in to help resolve the regional reform issues speciffically...a change in the political structure of regional government, consolidation of services and amalgamation of taxes...<br>  Flambourough's mayor is looking for a local voice of reason...<br>  Regional council in fact decided to go ahead with plans to seek a locally appointed facillitator...a person who unlike a mediator has no decision making authority...<br>  Councillor Dave Wilson says despite pressure from the province for municipal reform...in Hamilton Wentworth there are very few council members who really want change...<br>  Hamilton council wants a one tier supercity that would absorb all surrounding municipalities...<br>  The suburbs have proposed a modified two tier system that preserves local autonomy...<br>  Everyone agrees a resolution is going to be hard to achieve...<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>More Reform </b><p>
<br> One thing regional council did agree on today was to eliminate a fourteen year old upper tier tax discount for the suburbs. That means regional taxes in surrounding municipalities will increase, while city of Hamilton taxes will decrease.<br> No word yet on what it means to the bottom line of your regional tax bill.
<hr>
<b>Murder Charge</b><p>
<br> Police in Hamilton have cracked a two year old murder case.<br> They've charged 36 year  old Christopher Bank of Hamilton with first degree murder in the October 1994 death of Brother Daniel Morgan... a self-styled minister with the Church of the Universe. Bank is also charged with robbery. The break in the case came as the result of a Crime Stoppers tip allowing police to connect a car fire in Morgan's abandoned vehicle with another auto fire three weeks earlier in the same location. Bank is in custody awaiting a bail hearing.
<hr>
<b>Pizza Attack</b><p>
For the second summer in a row, an employee at this Pizza Pizza store in Hamilton has been attacked.<br> Overnight, he was trying to get three people out of the pizzeria when one of them cut his arm with a metal straw holder.<br> Police say he lost a considerable amount of blood, but is okay now.<br> 19 year old Jacob Kaloustian of Hamilton is charged with assault with a weapon.<br> Last summer, the Pizza Pizza employee was cut in the back of the head during an attack.
<hr>
<b>Crack House</b><p>
A winfall for Hamilton Wentworth Regional Oolice after they found a crack cocaine pipe in a car they'd stopped in east Hamilton.<br> They charged the driver, then traced the crack to this house on Holton Avenue North where they arrested seven more people on drug and weapon charges.<br> A ninth man was charged after he tried to trade six stolen football jerseys for crack cocaine while police were still there.
<hr>
<b>Brantford Crime</b><p>
<br> A five-month long investigation into a stolen-goods ring has come to a close with 24 arrests after raids in Brantford, Paris, Kitchener, Stoney Creek, St. Catharines, Mississauga, Pelham and Toronto. Police weren't surprised to find a large and varied haul of stolen goods including air conditioners, furnaces, computers, lawn mowers, weed-eaters, alcohol, blue jeans, sunglasses and baseball gloves.<br> But they didn't expect to find illegal cable television equipment: more than 1,200 so-called ``magic boxes,'' used to circumvent cable television systems.
<hr>
<b>Grand Drowning</b><p>
An autopsy scheduled today in Brantford after an apparent drowning in the Grand River. The body of 51-year-old Warren Pearce of Mount Hope was recovered just east of Mines Road in Caledonia, after a fisherman spotted someone in trouble in the water yesterday. By the time help arrived it was too late.  Police do not suspect foul play.
<hr>
<b>Plane Crash</b><p>
A 60-year-old Hagersville man is in serious condition in hospital in Hamilton after his ultra light aircraft crashed in a bean field in Springvale near Jarvis. David Rogers was testing his aircraft on a private airstrip when he encountered engine problems. He had reached an altitude of 100 feet when he nosedived to the ground and flipped over. Cayuga OPP are still investigating.
<hr>
<b>Missing Boy</b><p>
<br> A search is under way for an Hamilton teenager missing from a scout camp in Haliburton. Provincial police say 18 year old Jean Luc Renaut, who is autistic, disappeared from Camp Camac yesterday during a game of hide and seek. The search is being conducted by volunteers, police officers and scout leaders in an area just to the east of Haliburton village.
<hr>
<b>Jr. Achievement</b><p>
<br>  Canjac '96, an international conference of junior achievers is taking place at Hamilton's McMaster University.<br>  227 high school students from across Canada and ten other countries have gathered for the week to learn more about business and economics.  As well, they'll hone their entrepreneurial skills for future careers.<br>  Each of the delegates will get first hand advice from the corporations that are sponsoring the conference.

<hr>
<b>TD Robbery</b><p>
We don't know if he's paying his taxes but he seems to have changed his M.O. Hamilton's lunchtime bandit, is now behaving more like a brunch-time bandit.<br>  A suspect believed to be a serial bank robber has struck again in Hamilton.<br>  The latest hit, this morning at a Toronto Dominion branch downtown, is beleived to be his sixth in ten days.<br>  Yesterday, a suspect with the same description robbed a Bank of Montreal branch at almost exactly the same time of morning ... about twenty to eleven.<br>  Police have formed a serial bank holdup task force to find this bandit, and other repeat offenders.
<hr>
<b>Bomb Threat</b><p>
<br>    They're breathing sighs of relief on Hamilton's east mountain tonight after the police bomb squad converged on Stonechurch Square Plaza. A clerk in the Day- Night Pharmacy there had spotted someone leaing a suspicous looking black bag in the store. All of the usual precautions were taken... the pharmacy and adjoining stores were evacuated. After the bomb squad robot went it became clear that there was no bomb in the bag. It contained stolen audio CD's.
<hr>
<b>Gorge Rescue</b><p>
Two Toronto-area men face charges after a tumble into the Niagara Gorge early this morning. Niagara parks police say they were drinking and horsing around near the Rainbow Bridge and had climbed over a wall. The men lost their footing and fell 10 metres to a rock ledge. Niagara Falls firefighters rescued them using an aerial truck. The men were treated for minor injuries and then charged under the parks act.
<hr>
<b>Missing Kid Found</b><p>
  A happy ending to our story yesterday about the missing 11-year-old Hamilton boy. Christopher Hicks hadn't been seen since August 11th but police have located the boy. He is reported to be safe with relatives.
<hr>
<b>Region HSR</b><p>
 More busses will be running out to the suburbs.  A 15-to 10 vote today put the brakes on a hot debate over an extended urban transit area in Hamilton Wentworth.<br>  As Jamie West reports...the suburbs will pay more, but the city of Hamilton says the move will be more equitable for everyone concerned...
<i>And they were not alone...Ancaster, Stoney Creek, Dundas and Flamborough all gave thumbs down to a Regional Transportation Department recommendation calling for expansion of the HSR into their towns.<br>  The HSR now runs at a seventeen million dollar deficit, all of which in the past has been taken up by the city of Hamilton alone.<br>  Most suburbs including Ancaster have purchased service from the HSR on a pay as you play basis.<br>  After finally voting to approve the recommendation, the HSR will truly become a regionally operated service, that will cost each suburb more than 100-thousand dollars each over the next five years. </i>
<hr>
<b>Business - First</b><p>
  For the sixteenth time since may, interest rates in Canada are on their way down.<br>  The Bank of Canada dropped the central lending rate by a quarter point today leading the major banks to trim their prime lending rates.<br>  Mortgage rates are also on the way down again. The central bank hopes the move will help spur on our lagging economy which is already showing signs of recovery.<br>  Retail sales in Canada in June were up by 0.6%, their largest gain in nearly a year.  Economists now say the worst is behind us and the remainder of the year will bring more good news.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Air Traffic</b><p>
It seems more people are spending money to fly in and out of Hamilton International Airport.   In fact July was the busiest month for passenger service in almost six years.<br>  Air traffic last month, after Greyhound Air began service quadrupled over July of last year. Greyhound Air  is reporting strong business in its four daily flights in and out of Hamilton and USAir Express is also showing an increase in passenger traffic on its four flights between Hamilton and Pittsburg.
<hr>
<b>Teletouch</b><p>
<br>  A five minute phone call may be all it takes to make sure a senior citizen is safe and healthy, and to re-assure family members who can't be in touch every day. <br>  For the last 25 years in Hamilton and Halton, Tele-touch has been providing that service.<br>  As Annette Hamm tells us, the program needs more volunteers to meet the growing list of seniors who need a reassuring ring.
<i> Alone in her Hamilton apartment, 71 year old Mar looks forward to a phone call every morning from her Tele-touch volunteer.<br>  Mar signed up for the free service so that someone other than her cats would know if something went wrong.  <br>  Mar hasn't met her volunteer caller, and hasn't been told her last name or where she lives.<br>  The program likes to keep things on a first name basis only for security reasons.  <br>  Karli has spent her summer calling about thirty seniors a day from the Teletouch office.<br>  She's handling an overflow of clients and will be matched with her own client when she goes back to school.  <br>  It takes five minutes a day to become a Teletouch volunteer, and you can call from your home or office.<br>  If you're interested in helping out, or would like to be a Teletouch client, you can call 522-9567 in Hamilton or 875-0808 if you live in Halton.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Thoroldnet</b><p>
<br>   The city of Thorold, near St. Catharines, is about to become one of Canada's first "virtual" communities. "Thoroldnet" is set to go on line next week, allowing residents to use their computers to apply for things like building permits, dog licences and reserve library books. Thoroldnet is expected to help the city cut costs, eliminate red tape and best of all, eliminate lineups.

<b>tax cheats</b><p>
<br> Tonight more on our on-going coverage of Hamilton's tax delinquents who owe the city some 87-million dollars.  Last night reporter Scot Urquhart revealed the top 10 deadbeat taxpayer list, who alone account for 10 per cent of outstanding tax bills.
<BR>
Tonight Scot tells us more about these people and what they have to say for themselves.
<i><br>  It's no surprise really. if you owed this kind of money ... you wouldn't want to see the media either ...<br>  And so when we went to find out who was behind the 1.9 million dollar tax arrears on this property ... we had to speak to the tennants:<br>  Sam McKinlay rents space for his printing company here. He said they recently got a letter from the city:<br>  We also managed to get a phone number for Ed Palonek of Oakville ... the man who sam says, represents Rothwell, and acts as his landlord: <br>  So ... we went to check on number two on the list ... officially ... it's Theatre Aquarius. Just about a million dollars, in the hole. What about the grants they've been getting from the city: <br>  And Max Reimer says, they do have a plan to pay the money back. A plan to be unveiled to city council next month: <br>  Unofficially ... the real number two delinquent, is 1158929 Ontario Ltd. with two properties on Strathearne Ave. The combined tax arrears ... is in the order of 1.3 million dollars. We had trouble with the Ministry of Consumer and Corporate Affairs tracking down a principal for the numbered company ... so we went to the listed address. We didn't feel entirely welcomed: <br>  And what about those harbour commissioners? We asked them why they owed more than 800-thousand dollars.<br>  According to their annual report ... they made about 57 million dollars last year. How could they owe so much? We were told they were tax exempt... and while some of their tennants might be in arrears... they weren't.... we were'nt told much else <br>  There are more names on the list. More mysteries to solve. But for the most part it seems clear; that no one directly involved is in any kind of hurry; to clear things up. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Kays Charges</b><p>
Criminal charges have now been laid against the former owner of Kay's Pizzeria in Hamilton.<br> The charges stem from the failed operations of the restaurant and catering business.<br> 37 year old Jon Raffay of Stoney Creek will appear in court next monday on 3 counts of fraud and one of theft by conversion.<br> Police say the theft charge was laid after royalty payments were not made to a company which sold its recipes to Kays.
<hr>
<b>Missing Child</b><p>
<br> Police want your help in finding an 11-year-old Hamilton boy who has been missing for more than a week. Christopher Hicks was last seen on August 11th. He's described as five feet tall, weighing 91 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. If you've seen this boy or know where he might be, call Hamilton- Wenworth Regional Police at 546-4925.
<hr>
<b>Infanticide</b><p>
<br> A tragic story emerging out of a Hamilton courtroom. A 17 year old who gave birth to a baby girl while her family slept will be sentenced next month for infanticide.<br> Police and social workers were alerted to the case in January of 1995 when the teenager was brought to hospital bleeding badly. She denied having given birth but later relented. An autopsy revealed the newborn was full term and was alive and healthy but died of severe head injuries due to blunt force trauma.
<hr>
<b>Break-in Arrest</b><p>
<br> A Hamilton man appeared in court in Walkerton today after police siezed a carload of break-in tools. They included a police scanner, walkie-talkies, and crowbars. 23-year-old Jarem Corbett is charged with poseession of break-in instruments and breach of probation. A Woodstock man and two youths were also charged.
<hr>
<b>Falls Death</b><p>
<br> A crowd of horrified tourists looked on as a man was swept over Niagara Falls.<br> US state park police spokesman Peter Tarasow says the man went over the American falls at about 7:15 last night.<br> Tarasow says he's not sure if the man, in his 20s, fell in the water accidentally or if it was a suicide.<br> Witnesses say it appeared the man was in panic.<br> It's the fifth time this year a person has gone over the falls on either the American or Canadian side.
<hr>
<b>Depot for Sale</b><p>
<br> How often do you ride the bus? ...not enough according to the Hamilton Street Railway, so they're getting leaner while trying to find new ways to generate revenue.<br> As Jamie West reports the HSR is getting into the leasing business...
<i>The HSR's Wentworth Street garage has been home to most of it's operation since the end of June....<br>  That's when they pulled out of this 12 year old, 13 million dollar facility on Hwy 6....a facility that the region hopes to lease out...<br>  For the last five years the HSR has been stripping down it's operation ...after early eighties predictions of a booming Hamilton population failed to materialize...<br>  In 1996 about one in ten people ride the bus...<br>  The HSR will continue to service about 20 buses at a time at the Hwy 6 depot, including the new accesible low floor model that will hit the streets in late September.<br>  Those operations they say will not interfere with the business of their new tenant whoever it turns out to be. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
<br> More good news out of Burlington based Zenon Environmental today.  The international water treatment company has landed an eleven million dollar contract in Poland.  Company officials say the contract is a significant inroad into the Polish power plant market.<br> The news follows impressive second quarter profits for Zenon announced earlier this week.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Wesley Neighbours</b><p>
<br> Usually it's cries of "not in my backyard!" ... but for some residents of a Hamilton apartment co-op it's more like not in our front yard, or anywhere near our building. <br> They're complaining about clients from the Wesley Urban Ministries Drop in Centre next door.<br> Clients who sometimes use drugs or pass out on the grass nearby.<br> And while the ministry is trying to stem the problem, they say there's only so much they can do.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i> In other words, Richard Gillespie wants Wesley Urban Ministries to clean up the area outside their new location.<br>  Since the centre opened a few months ago, neighbours, especially those next door at the meridian co-op have complained about seeing clients sleeping on the grass, urinating in their garden, or shooting up drugs.  <br>  Some co-op members want a fence between their building and Wesley's, others see this as a problem in society, not just in their neighbourhood.  <br>  Wesley Urban Ministries would like keep the drop in centre open 24 hours a day, not just from midnight til noon... so these guys would have a place to sleep inside during the day.  But they don't have the money to do it.<br>  They have, however, banned two trouble makers from the centre.  <br>  Wesley Urban also runs the apartments above the drop in centre and townhouses behind it, so Johnson says they also want to keep things under control for their own tenants.  </i>
<hr>
<b>CNE - Killjoys</b><p>
 Two Hamilton area bands will be performing at the CNE ExMusicFest tonight.  The Killjoys of Hamilton, and the Rainbow Butt Monkeys of Burlington join Halifax artists Sandbox and Tempe and The Refreshments from Arizona.  The show starts at the bandshell at 6:30 and is free with your CNE admission.

<b>Crime Patterns</b><p>
<br> Get ready for another round of bank heists.<br> It looks like there's a serial robber at work in the Hamilton area.<br> The four most recent robberies, two yesterday within the span of a three hours, bear striking similarities.<br> Annette Hamm reports.
<i><br>  As soon as there's a bank robbery in Hamilton Wentworth, crime analyst Nancy Kaneva gets a call.<br>  The officers on the scene provide her with the robbery details, she tells them if it matches any others.  <br>  Often, suspects become comfortable with a certain style of robbery; they fall into a habit.<br>  That makes a crime analysts task of identifying patterns much easier.<br>  Then police can put bank branches on notice, even put undercover officers in place to protect employees and customers.  <br>  Now Kaneva's job is to try and pinpoint where and when this latest suspect might strike next.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Hit and Run</b><p>
 A 38-year-old Buffalo man was released on bail in Niagara Falls on our side of the river today. Glen Root will be back before the courts on September 11th. He's facing charges related to a tragic accident in which three teen-agers on bicycles were run down by a car, which fled the scene. A 13-year-old boy was killed in the mishap.

<b>Olson Parole</b><p>
A victim's rights group is outraged that Clifford Olson has applied for a review of his parole eligibility.<br> Olson has served 15 years of a minimum 25-year term for the sex slayings of 11 British Columbia children.<br> But, under the criminal code's so-called "faint hope" clause he's applied for a review to see if his earliest parole date can be moved up.<br> The group CAVEAT founded by Priscilla Devilliers, mother of Burlington murder victim Nina Devilliers, says the review is a show for Olson, who has become notorious for exploits involving challenges to the justice system, not to mention emotional torture for the families of his victims.
<hr>
<b>Bill 49 Hamilton</b><p>
<br> Ontario's Employment Standards Act has been changed more than 20 times since it was introduced 22 years ago.  <br> And now the Harris government wants to make more changes.<br> In Hamilton today, a standing committee began a 13 city tour for hearings on its proposed amendments.<br> Among them: putting a 10-thousand dollar cap on the amount workers can be awarded from the Ministry of Labour as the result of a claim.<br> Labour groups worry the changes may erode minimum work standards.
<hr>
<b>MTO Mobile Unit</b><p>
And a little bit of Queen's Park came to Duff's Corners today, that's the corner of Highways two and 53, to try out a weigh station on wheels.<br>  The Ontario Ministry of Transportation is testing its new mobile truck inspection station, in its ongoing campaign to keep unsafe trucks off the road.<br>  Inspectors say the mobile unit can do almost everything a permanent weigh station can do, with the added advantage that it can be moved to routes used by truckers trying to evade inspection stations on major highways.
<hr>
<b>Oakville Fire</b><p>
It's back to the drawing board for six small Oakville businesses after a million dollar fire gutted a strip mall.<br> Firefighters were called to the River Oaks Malls late yesterday afternoon to battle the blaze. However all six stores in the strip mall were gutted. A neighbouring senior's residence was evacuated as a precaution. The fire marshall has been called in to investigate the cause of the inferno. Fire officials say the flames started in a garbage bin outside the mall and spread engulfing the entire structure.<br> Luckily, no one was injured.
<hr>
<b>Turkstra - MD</b><p>
<br> It's a cross-Canada caravan, that's a cross between "home improvement" and good works.<br> The Dewalt Canada National Tour stopped at Turkstra Lumber on Hamilton mountain today.<br> The tour, sponsored by the popular power tool-maker, delivers expert home improvement tips.<br> At the same time, Dewalt holds contests and challenges to raise money for Muscular Dystrophy.<br> Seven specially- equipped Dewalt vans set out from Halifax earlier this month, on a cross-country odyssey that will end in Vancouver late in September.
<hr>
<b>Fastest Man</b><p>
Finally tonight, a Niagara Falls man is fed up with American claims that Michael Johnson -- and not Oakville's Donovan Bailey -- is the world's fastest man.<br> The last straw for Mike Leskiw was last night, when a US television magazine show claimed Johnson was the fastest man in the world.<br> Both Bailey and Johnson set world records at the Atlanta Olympics -- Bailey in the 100 metres and Johnson in the 200 and 400.<br>   Leskiw says he is going to spend 600 dollars US for an ad in the New York Times to explain to the Americans that Bailey is number one.

<b>Tax Arrears</b><p>
 We hear it again, and again. The city, is caught in a money crunch. Budgets are squeezed, and cash-flow, is tight. But there is a huge pool of money that could be... and should be pumped into the city treasury, to make sure the well doesn't run dry. How big a pool? 
<hr>
<b>Action Day Bill</b><p>
<br> It's been half a year since thousands of labour activists vented their frustration in Hamilton during a weekend of protest. And the bill still isn't settled. Annette Hamm tells us that may change tomorrow.
<i> The Hamilton and District Labour Council didn't call the Days of Action protest back in February.<br>  But now they're footing the bill.<br>  Several other unions planned to protest in Hamilton while the Tories held a convention, and the Ontario Federation of Labour asked the council to help organize things.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Royal Robbery</b><p>
The rash of lunch-time bank robberies in Hamilton continues, with the latest target the Royal Bank branch at Main and Sherman.<br>  A man walked into the bank just after one-thirty this afternoon, told the teller he had a gun, and stuffed cash into a beige plastic bag before making his getaway.<br>  The suspect is described as white, five-foot eight, and about twenty-eight- years-old.<br>  He was unshaven, and had dirty blond hair.<br>  This is the third lunch-time robbery in Hamilton in eight days.
<hr>
<b>Galley Shoot</b><p>
Two men have been charged after a weekend shootout outside a central Hamilton bar.<br>  It all started Saturday night after a man shot a semi automatic handgun into the air in the parking lot at the Galley Pump.<br>  One of the two men he was trying to scare retaliated by trashing his jeep.<br>  53 year old John Bothman of Wasago is charged with possessing a dangerous weapon.<br>  47 year old Thomas Grecko of Newbury is charged with mischief and uttering threats.
<hr>
<b>Bernardo Girlfriend</b><p>
<br> Convicted double murderer and serial rapist Paul Bernardo may be living in a segregated jail cell but he has a girlfriend, actually an old girlfriend. The latest issue of Macleans Magazine interviews an unidentified woman in her late 20's about her "strong emotional attachment" to Bernardo. She says she can't explain why she remains fond of a man found guilty of horrendous murders. And when she thinks about what Bernardo did she sometimes just "blocks it out." She and Bernardo had a relationship in the late 1980's, and she met him again shortly before his arrest in 1993 for the murders of teens Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
<br>  Canadian manufacturing shipments in June were down following two months of growth.  Taking the big hit: cars, car parts and electronics.<br>  And the U.S. Federal Reserve meets tomorrow.  Most analysts on both sides of the border believe the feds will leave interest rates alone. A hike in rates would probably lead to investors fleeing the stock markets.<br>   
<hr>
<b>Mac Code</b><p>
<br>  At university campuses everywhere students are gearing up for a new school year and for many, part of that involves the ritual of frosh. In recent years campuses in southern Ontario have seen an increase in more violent and objectionable behaviour like hazing. Over the past couple of years, students at McMaster University have taken the lead and tamed welcome week activities but this year new rules have been carved into stone. In May, following more than two years of studying policies across Canada and the U.S., the McMaster University Senate approved a code of conduct, setting out penalties for breaking clearly defined rules and that code comes into effect this fall.

<b>Macnab Apt. Fire</b><p>
   <br>  A dramatic high-rise fire in Hamilton this afternoon. Two people including a firefighter were rushed to hospital this aftenoon after a fire broke out in a north end Hamilton highrise.<br>  All of the tenants in the seniors building had to be evacuated.<br>  Lauran Sabourin has more..
<i><br>  Just after one this afternoon a fire broke out in unit 1105 at the Ken Soble Towers on Burlington Street.<br>  Smoke billowed from the 11th floor unit.<br>  Firefighters were battling the blaze from the inside.<br>  Most of the 11th floor sustained major smoke damage. <br>  The tenant of 1105 was rushed to hospital suffering burns and smoke inhalation. <br>  A firefighter who was overcome by smoke was also taken to hospital by ambulance.<br>  Three other people were treated for smoke inhalation on the scene. <br>  The buildings tenants, most of them seniors were herded into a transit bus so officials could take a head count. <br>  The Fire Marshall had been called to the scene.<br>  They are still not sure how the blaze started. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Wainfleet Body</b><p>
<br>  Niagara Regional Police are appealing to the public tonight in their search for a suspect in a fatal hit and run.  It happened sometime in the early morning hours in Wainfleet on Lakeshore Road near the golf course.  The body of a man in his late teens or early 20's was found around 5:30 this morning.<br>  He had suffered massive injuries after being hit by a vehicle.
<hr>
<b>Worker Pinned</b><p>
A city of Hamilton worker is in hospital tonight with serious leg and foot injuries after an accident on Barton Street just before the noon hour.  57 year old Dave McManus, was removing a concrete saw from a trailer, when it broke loose from a braking mechanism. The 15-hundred pound saw rolled over top of McManus and pinned him to the street. He was conscious when taken to hospital. Investigators are trying to find out why it happened.
<hr>
<b>Ancaster Speeder</b><p>
<br> A few months ago we told you how the town of Ancaster together with Brantford OPP and Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police are cracking down on speeders through its speeder of the month.  The winner for July clocked in at 122 in a 60 zone on Carluke Road. That motorist has been fined 450-dollars. First runner-up got nailed with a 365-dollar fine for doing 110 in a 60 and told the officer the speedometer was broken.
<hr>
<b>Paling Air</b><p>
<br> A new study, indicating an unusually high incidence of asthma in children living near the industrial core, has divided residents in a Hamilton neighbourhood. Some say the pollution-laden air is killing them.  Others say the air's fine, and they're sick of having people trash their neighbourhood.<br> Reporter Scot Urquhart went to Paling Avenue, and found both the issue, and the study, to be hotly contested items:
<i><br>  There are two sides to every story ... and these women say, no one is hearing theirs: <br>  The women are infuriated by a series of newspaper articles claiming that their street is an area with poor air quality, and serious health problems: <br>  Karen Bedard, was quoted in the paper, as a mom concerned about the health of her asthmatic son: <br>  In fact, the women even took issue with the picture that was printed with the article: <br>  These neighbours say, their street is as green and healthy as any other in Hamilton, and they are concerned about their property values being driven down, by false information ... but there's no doubt, the issue is a controversial one on Paling Avenue. This woman says; she's been harassed by her neighbours, for speaking out about air quality: <br>  In fact, says Hunter, asthma in general is on the rise ... for reasons yet unknown. And he cautions that the homeside health study is not definitive, by any means: <br>  Hunter cites diet, and dust mites in air- tight homes ... as other significant factors contributing to the rise in asthma. The neighbours on Paling Avenue say, that just goes to prove ... that you can't believe everything you read. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Cabinet</b><p>
A new minister is in charge of the air we breathe down at Queen's Park. Environment minister Brenda Elliot's out as environment and energy minister and Norm Sterling, the former consumer minister has her job, with the consumer portfolio going to controversial social services minister David Tsubouchi. It's all part of premier Mike Harris' first cabinet shuffle. Burlington MPP Cam Jackson is now the minister without portfolio in charge of seniors issues.            
<hr>
<b>Young Builders</b><p>
<br>  They were learning how to build their own cabinets in ancaster today.  You're never too young to learn a little self-sufficiency.<br>  That's the philosophy behind "Community Day", held at Ancaster's Home Depot today.<br>  Home Depot staff showed members of the boys and girls clubs the nuts and bolts of carpentry.<br>  By the end of the day, using materials provided by the store, the fledgling builders had constructed two picnic tables and a sand box.<br>  Home Depot says the program fosters a sense of team-work and accomplishment, and also gives kids the know-how to build items needed by their clubs.
<hr>
<b>Business First</b><p>
<br> The Bank of Canada today lowered its trend setting bank rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That triggered a reduction in the prime lending rate. <BR> Chartered banks dropped their prime rates by a quarter of a percent to six per cent.<br> That translates into lower interest payments on investments and on consumer loans.<br> 
<hr>
<b>Business Thrives</b><p>
<br> The construction equipment is gone and Ottawa Street is again open for business.<br> A special ceremony was held today to signify a new beginning for one of Hamilton's most thriving business areas.<br> Dwight Ryan was there...  <br>  
<i> Tony DiTomasso has been fixing cars on Ottawa Street for 42 years.<br>  He was in the crowd as the mayor unveiled two stunning murals signalling an end to constuction and the beginning of a refurbished business area.  <br>  Often referred to as the unofficial mayor of Ottawa Street, Tony takes pride in the service he and his neighbours offer.  <br>       Working on his mural, artist Cameron Mahy was overwhelmed by the friendliness of Ottawa Street merchants.   <br>      Sixteen thousand cars a day travel down the newly paved Ottawa Street.  New sidewalks and a stoplight make it safe for pedestrians.  <br>    A visit to Ottawa Street is like an international tour.    <br>  But if you want croation specialties, like lamb, pork and streudel, you'd better call ahead.   <br>  Whether its smoked meat, cakes or textiles, the newly refurbished Ottawa Street is open for business.<br> </i>

<b>Niagara Labor Strike</b><p>
 It's showdown time between municipal governments and their workers across the province. <br>  For the workers it's catch-up time, now that the ndp government's social contracts have expired. It all begins in Niagara, where the region thought it had a deal.<br> But union heavyweights from Toronto had a look at a proposed contract and told the employees it should be rejected.<BR>
 So six hundred, fifty employees there are taking a strike vote today and now, as Lauran Sabourin reports, CUPE national reps and bureaucrats are locked in a war of words.
<i><br>  On the one side Mike Stokes, veteran union negotiator. The man who along with CUPE Ontario President Sid Ryan is accused of trying to scuttle this deal. <br>  The most contentious issue in this dispute is a proposal to contract out jobs.<br>  Regional administrators admit that to save some some jobs may be contracted out. But employees will be guaranteed employment. <br>    The union is using radio ads to get its message across. <br>  The region is countering with a campaign over the fax machine..  The employees to which the messages are directed don't know what to do. <br>  In the end both sides say the interest of the taxpayer should be paramount. The union says providing less service is a disservice to the taxpayer. Regional politicians say asking ratepayers for more money is a disservice to the taxpayer. <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Blue Box Update</b><p>
  Published reports today indicate that metro Toronto stands to lose millions in its blue box program.<br> For most people, recylcing is now a way of life. As Dwight Ryan reports, the Hamilton Wentworth region put the process in private hands ..and may even make money on its blue box program.  <br>
<i><br>  Ontario residents are conscious of dangers to our environment and they're doing something about it. <br>  In fact two thirds of the population regularly uses blue boxes.<br>  Papers, bottles, cardboard and cans no longer fill our landfill sites, they go in the box to be recylcled.  What used to be waste is now a valuable commodity.<br>  Still metro Toronto stands to lose about five and a half million dollars with its recylcing program. Taxpayers will cover the loss.  <br>  The front-runners were Phillip Enviornmental and Third Sector Recycling...a non-profit firm.<br>  They teamed up and now handle the tons of reclyclables that people in the region put out in their boxes...   <br>    Alderman Dave Wilson chairs the region's environmental services committee.   <br>    </i>
<hr>
<b>Hunter St. Fire</b><p>
A Hamilton man repeatedly braved flames and smoke this afternoon, to drag his unconscious wife from their burning basement apartment.<br> 38-year-old James West was in the backyard of his Hunter Street West home just before three this afternoon, when he noticed smoke pouring out of the basement windows.<br> His 38-year-old wife Rebecca was inside.      
<br> Paramedics and firefighters revived Rebecca West, who was rushed to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.<br> Damage to the house is estimated at fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars.<br> The Wests had just moved into their new apartment on the first of August.
<hr>
<b>Bank Hit</b><p>
Police are investigating another lunch-hour bank robbery in Hamilton, the second one this week.<br> A white man, between thirty and forty, walked into the Bank of Nova Scotia branch at King and Sherman just before noon today.<br> He handed a teller a note, saying he had a gun, although no gun was seen.<br> The robber fled on a ten-speed bike, and a witness followed him in a car.<br> Police also gave chase, and although they found the shirt, hat and sunglasses the man was wearing, they failed to nab the robber himself.
<hr>
<b>Home Invasion</b><p>
Police are looking for two gunmen after a home invasion in a downtown apartment yesterday. It happened at the Hess Village Towers on Market Street around 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Three women and a seven year old girl were bound with duct tape and forced to the floor by the robbers. One woman was pistol whipped but not injured seriously. The tenant, while bound managed to open the door and get to the lobby for help.  The suspects escaped with cash and jewellry. They're described as two black males in their mid-20's, one about 5- foot-seven , wearing black jeans, a green t-shirt baseball cap and black and red running shoes; the other 5-foot-four,, wearing a green t-shirt and pants, white baseball cap and green and beige running shoes.
<hr>
<b>Child Porn Arrest</b><p>
<br>  Police have charged a 35-year-old Hamilton man with three counts of possession of child pornography.<br>  Police initially responded to complaints about a man loitering around the Gage Park wading pool, and video-taping activities in the park.<br>  They later searched an east Hamilton apartment, and seized eighty videotapes.<br>  Charged is thirty-five-year- old Daniel Patrik Gunn of King Street East.
<hr>
<b>Boy Assault</b><p>
<br> In St. Catharines, a 13 year old boy is facing two counts of sexual assault.  His arrest followed compliants from the boy's two female cousins, aged 11 and 8. No further information is being released to protect the identities of the accused and his alleged victims. The boy has been released from custody and is to appear in court September 9th.
<hr>
<b>Booze Bust</b><p>
Canada Customs officers at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie pulled over a cattle car this afternoon with more than 21 hundred bottles of alcohol stashed in a compartment.<br> The booze was under an adjustable floor in the trailer.<br> The 361 cases had an estimated street value of more than one hundred, six thousand dollars.<br> Charged is 50 year old George Blancke of Moorefield Ontario.

<b>Regional Structure</b>
<p>
The endless debate over regional government reform, plodded forward in a new direction, today. <br>  The first of three working- groups designed to help streamline local government, began deliberations over a new structure for the six area municipalities today.
<br> While no agreement seems to be in sight; reporter Scot Urquhart discovered that the easiest way out of this mess might be, to give the people what they want:
<i><br>  The city wants to do away with the region ...<br>  The region wants to do away with half a dozen municipalities.... <br>  And the municipalities just want the city and the region, to leave them alone, and go away. <br>  Somehow, this working group of regional politicians, must decide how to reconcile those wildly different visions: <br>  And that's the key ... although we are tied together by geography; suburban residents aren't prepared to let big city politicians gang up on them; and take their towns away: <br>  And so there is no mileage in pedalling the big city concept, in small towns like Ancaster. Just ask Enid Macdonald, who runs the local laundromat, and has lived in Ancaster for 43 years: <br>  And so the issue of government reform, goes 'round and 'round .... and in the end, says councillor Morelli, we might be better to drop the idea of a super city ... and concentrate on the things we can all agree upon: <br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>QEW Truck Fire</b><p>
<br> The Toronto bound lanes of the QEW just east of the Garden City Skyway were closed for hours today after a tractor trailer exploded into flames this morning.<br>  The truck was burning noxious plastics.<br>  And as Lauran Sabourin reports if the wind had been blowing the other way hundreds of residents would have been evacuated.
<i> <br>  The flames lit up the night sky as the tractor trailer sat burning on the Glendale ramp off the QEW. <br>  The driver of the truck had pulled onto the ramp after he could smell his brakes getting hot. <br>  He got out of his truck and saw smoke coming from the second axle brake drum which was glowing red. Authorities believe a tire had blown. <br>  Then an explosion. <br>  An explosion on a truck that was carrying more than 17 thousand kilograms of polystyrene beads.  <br>  When the fire was extinguished half of the truck was gone.<br>  Nothing was left but a charred wreck that was still smoldering hours later.  <br>  The firefighters were hosed down. That's because  polystyrene residue carries toxic fumes with it. The Niagara on the Lake  fire chief Bruce Little says if the wind hadn't been blowing north they would have had to evacutate nearby residents.  <br>  But the Toronto bound lanes of the QEW were closed for hours.<br>  The Glendale ramp was finally opened around three this afternoon. <br> </i>

<b>Explosive Promo</b><p>
<br>  Fears of a mail bomb resulted in a number of calls to police in Hamilton-Wentworth today.  The suspicious packages were plain white cardboard tubes.

<b>Yacht Close</b><p>
A well-known Canadian yacht maker is about to sail into the sunset apparently for the last time.

<b>Olympic Welcome</b><p>
 They gave us all they had. years of training, for a few thrilling moments, in Atlanta. And today it was time to say thank you, to the young men and women, who were the pride of Hamilton, in the Olympics. Scot Urquhart has more:
<i><br>  Who says, you can't go home again? Whatever these athletes may have done in Atlanta ... they are number one in the world, in the hearts of Hamiltonians. Even recent transplants; like cyclist Clara Hughes say their lives have taken root, and blossomed in Hamilton: <br>  Hughes ... who gave one of her bronze medals to her grandmother ... dedicated the second, in a moving tribute to the recently deceased Eddie Higgins; a major force in Hamilton's running community: <br>  From long-time veteran gymnast Alan Nolet, to the shining new star of swimmer Joanne Malar ... Hamilton had much to be proud of in Atlanta. And that Canadian pride came out in surprising fashion when runner Paula Schnurr told the crowd that her proudest moment of the Olympics, was watching the men's 4x100 relay team : quote: "kick some american butt" ... a remark that drew applause and laughter from the crowd, and her parents: <br>  But the true spirit of the Olympic challenge was perhaps best summed up by the mayor Bob Morrow's brother ... Al Morrow... coach of the national rowing team; who says the win at all cost attitude; has no place in his program, or in the world of sport: <br>  But losing, wasn't an issue here. For the people of Hamilton, these athletes, are worth their weight, in gold. <br>  </i>

<i><br> And who would know better than Dr. Murray Enkin, a retired, 72 year old Hamilton obstetrician and member of the medical reform group who's helped deliver thousands of babies and written several books on the subject since 1947....<br>  Enter government health insurance and that number rose to 90 percent...<br>  The problem says Dr. Enkin is with the system itself...<br>  Family physician Dr. Walter (oh-sean-ik) says Hamilton doctors have a better line to the government than their Niagara and southwestern Ontario counterparts...<br>  He believe's that the rhetoric of of angry doctors is just that...<br>  </i>

<b>Greyhound Close Call</b><p>
 There was more anger than fear ... for passengers on board a Greyhound Airlines jet, forced to make an emergency landing at Mount Hope Airport this morning. A relatively minor technical problem grounded the plane ... but as Scot Urquhart reports, the airline's handling of the issue ... was a public relations fiasco:
<i> After only a few minutes in the air, the troubled Greyhound 727 limped back into Hamilton Airport ... with fire crews trailing cautiously behind. 110 passengers were herded off the plane and into a flight lounge where they were then sequestered for several hours .... while this harried Greyhound representative tried to figure out what to do. What she was told by head office not to do, however, was speak to the media. <br>  
While mechanics tried to trace the problem ... the general manager of Ontario Flight-Craft came forward to answer a few questions. His company is a subsidiary of Greyhound's parent company, and services their planes. <br>  
It turned out an electrical malfunction caused a wiring harness to overheat. The pilot followed safety procedures, shut the engine down, and came home... making sure that no one got hurt. But there was still no information about what Greyhound intended to do with its flight schedule, or passengers. <br>  
We did find at least one, philosophical passenger. <br>  
In the end; Greyhound flew urgent priority passengers out of Toronto, on other airlines; set up alternative flights in the evening for some others, and arrange hotel accomodations for those who would have to wait until Saturday; to get to Kelowna. But none of that information, came out of Hamilton.  </i>
<hr>
<b>Mac/No OPSEU</b><p>
<br> Clerical workers at McMaster University have voted against being represented by the Ontario Public Service Employees Union.<br> Union organizers had said OPSEU representation would bring fairness to the workplace, but workers didn't buy their argument.  Less than 900 of the eligible employees voted on the certification. Of them, more than half said no.<br> David Wartman, McMaster's director of human resources says he's both surprised and pleased at the vote.  He adds contract talks with the staff association members will resume.
<hr>
<b>Pregnant Complaints</b><p>
<br> Hundreds of pregnant women in Ontario are scrambling to find doctors who will deliver their babies.<br> Dozens of obstetricians and other specialists are refusing to take on new patients in an escalating battle between doctors and the harris government over compensation.<br> Most of the calls are coming from southern Ontario especially the Toronto, Peel and Niagara regions.
<hr>
<b>Festival of Friends</b><p>
<br> At Gage Park, a musical extravaganza.<br> The annual Festival of Friends is underway and Dwight Ryan went to have a look.  <br> 
<i><br>  The magical sounds of taxi chain waft through the air of Hamilton's Gage Park.<br>  Scattered about, fans set to hear a full weekend of free entertainment.<br>  Hamilton's premier summer festival is underway again and runs through until Sunday night.<br>  The Festival of Friends offers something for everyone, especially kids.   <br>    But there's more...  <br>   The Festival of Friends continues through the weekend at Gage Park in Hamilton ..and its free.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Local Jobs & Homes</b><p>
<br> More people found work in Ontario last month. But the July unemployment figures do not show the dramatic drop that was hoped for by job seekers and economy watchers.<br> The unemployment rate in the province fell to 9.2 per cent from 9.5 per cent. <br>  In the past 13 months, 89-thousand new jobs have appeared in Ontario. <br>  Throughout the golden horseshoe the numbers look like this, in Hamilton the unemployment rate dropped to 7.4 from 7.9, St. Catharines and Niagara also fell 9.5 from 9.7 ....Toronto's unemployment rate bucked the trend and went up from 9.7 from 9.5. <br>   And another positive economic indicator today from Central Mortgage and Housing.  Their figures released this morning for Hamilton indicate starts of single family homes jumped 75 percent from 113 in 1995 ...to 198 in 1996, and thier best July for existing homes since July of 1988, analysts believe the housing market will stay healthy until at least the fall, even though housing starts nationwide are down.
<hr>
<b>Dermawand</b><p>
<br> A kitchener woman and her partner have engineered the latest in beauty care...<br> The technology has been around for years but is now finding a place in the consumer market ...<br>  And if you're looking to get an edge on acne or freshen up that tired looking face then this new product might be for you...<br>  Jamie West reports...
<i><br>  Lori South is treating her skin... and no this wand isn't from the starship enterprise....<br>  
Just take it from Dermawand president Christina Boves ...<br>

<hr>
<b>Kitchener Raccoon</b><p>
<br> A raccoon in Kitchener has learned a hard lesson about rummaging through people's garbage.<br> The furry little critter has been spotted running around town with a peanut butter jar stuck over his head.<br> Humane Society officials say they'd like to help, but they can't track the raccoon down.<br> They say the animal will likely lose weight because it can't eat, and hopefully the jar will fall off.<br> But if you should spot Rocky with a jar on his head, please report him to the authorities just in case.

<b>Tennant Woes</b><p>
 Get ready for the hard times to come. That's the message being preparte for a tenants forum at the Rotary Self Help Centre in Hamilton tonight ... area housing groups say a package of new provincial legislation will bring nothing but bad news to renters in Ontario ... but landlords, and some analysts say, the picture may not be as bleak as it seems. Scot Urquhart reports:
<i> Andrea Horvath is preparing to go to battle. She is a housing advocate who says new provincial legislation on rent control and tenants rights will bring renters the worst of all worlds, in Ontario.
<br>  Andrea says the rental market in Hamilton is already too tight ... with vacancy rates slipping below two percent.
<br>  But this man disagrees. He is Arthur Weisz chairman of Effort Trust; with more than 10-thousand units, they are by far, the largest landlord in the region. <br>
Weisz points to the renters news where some landlords are offering incentives like one month free rent ... or no security deposit. He says half of his buildings are not even charging the maximum rent allowed by law ... because tenants simply won't pay it.
<br>  And this building superintendant agrees. Madeleine Castonguay says, she's got five vacant apartments at the moment.
<br>  Helen Hutton is a market analyst with CMHC. <br>  Hutton sees a slight rise in rents, and tighter vacancy rates ... but nothing like the late 80's ... when Hamilton had a vacancy rate approaching zero. </i>
<hr>
<b>Clerk Shot Update</b><p>
<br> And a Dundas variety store clerk is facing an uncertain future today.<br>  This after a botched robbery tuesday left 28 year old Khaled Mugber with a bullet in his chest and paralysed below the waist. Police say a masked robber probably armed with a powerful .357 magnum revolver shot the Farah Food Mart clerk. Four teenage boys have been charged with robbery after they were stopped in a stolen vehicle in downtown Hamilton a short time after the shooting. Police have now laid further charges, including attempted murder and weapons offences today. Doctors at Hamilton General Hospital are waiting for the victim's condition to improve before they can consider surgery to remove the bullet.
<hr>
<b>Morgan Arrest</b><p>
<br> Hamilton police have made an arrest into part of their investigation of the murder of Daniel Morgan. The Church of the Universe minister was found dead in his Wentworth Street apartment on October 19th, 1994. Detectives have determined that Morgan's apartment was broken into and that he was beaten and robbed. Investigators have now charged 37 year old Willaim Edward Davies of Hamilton with break and enter and theft in connection with the incident.
<hr>
<b>Charlton Stabbing</b><p>
<br> Hamilton Regional Police have taken one man into custody following a stabbing incident this afternoon.<br> Police say two men got into a drunken argument on the balcony of this apartment building at Charleton and Walnut streets.<br> In the ensuing fracas, both men suffered minor stab wounds.<br> Both were treated at the scene...one was taken into custody.  No charges have yet been laid.
<hr>
<b>Body Recovered</b><p>
<br> A body recovered from the lower Niagara River has been identified as that of 25 year old Salvatore Palmeri.<br> The Hamilton resident fell into the fast-flowing river last weekend while hiking with a friend.<br>  Palmeri's body was recovered near Queenston.<br>  An autopsy conducted in St. Catharines revealed that the victim died from accidental drowning.
<hr>
<b>Brantford Drowning</b><p>
<br> A 24-year-old Brantford man has drowned following a boating accident in the Simcoe area.<br> Provincial police say Allan Hoyt was tossed out of an inflatable boat last night on Rainbow Lake near Waterford.<br> Hoyt was pulled from the water and rushed to a hospital in Simcoe.<br> He was later transfered to Hamilton General, where he died.
<hr>
<b>Quebec Relief</b><p>
<br> Hamilton is still responding to the victims of the devastating floods in Quebec.<br> This morning more than 300 boxes of clothes and household items were loaded up to be transported to the Saugenay region.<br> The depot at Jackson Square began collecting donations two weeks ago.<br> The goods will be delivered to the flood victims by Laidlaw free of charge.
<hr>
<b>Car Over</b><p>
<br> Authorities are mulling over how to raise a car that had plunged into Tewes Falls near Dundas.<br> The license plates on the car were stolen from Burlington.<br> Police are looking for the vehicle's owner.<br> They say it could cost thousands to tow the car up the gorge.
<hr>
<b>Hiway Rangers</b><p>
<br> Accidents as a result of careless and innattentive driving are down.<br> The OPP's special Highway Rangers Unit is claiming a growing victory against the carnage on the golden horseshoe's busiest highways.<br> All this after photo radar was mothballed over a year ago...<br> Jamie West reports...
<i><br>  Senior constable Al Boyce isn't the lone ranger, and that's all right with him. He's happy to have 17 other partners helping to keep the highways of southern Ontario safe...<br>  
In the past year nearly 59-thousand motorists have been stopped after seeing the OPP cruiser in their rear view mirror..<br> 
Hundreds of charges have been laid for various infractions... 
<br>  Success to be sure even without photo radar...<br>  Other tools like in car video have cut down on not guilty pleas, which means more cash in the can for Mike Harris... And speed is still the number one problem... and that will cost a hundred and five...and 3 demerit points...<br>   
Meri Oliver operates the general store on Hwy 2 near Alberton. A regular stake out point for the highway rangers ... and if the rangers have it their way, there'll be a lot more peace and quiet on the highways. </i>
<hr>
<b>Morrow re: Olympics</b><p>
<br> And today at Hamilton City Hall mayor Morrow announced plans for a civic reception for area athletes who have just returned from competing in the '96 Centennial Olympics in Atlanta. The mayor hoped to have all athletes in attendence and invited everyone to participate by showing up at City Hall at 1pm Monday afternoon.

<b>Shooting Heroes</b><p>
 The victim survived. Arrests have been made; and today, Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police are crediting the actions of ordinary citizens for helping them to apprehend four suspects wanted in connection with a convenience store shooting in Dundas, last night. Scot Urquhart has more on that story:
<i><br>  The shooting of a convenience store clerk in this quiet Dundas location ... has shaken employees and neighbours alike. Although there are obvious efforts to make the store more secure ... the surveillance cameras inside were not running at the time of the shooting, according to store owner Aiman Ahboonewaruh,  he visited the 28 year old victim; Kahlid Mogber... in hospital this morning. <br>  But there may be reason to worry. Sources say Mogber is still carrying the bullet, and is paralysed from the waist down. Doctors don't know whether those injuries are permanent, or not. <br>  
Witnesses saw the gunman flee the store and head up this embankment to a waiting getaway car. Other neighbours had already taken the licence number, and called police. <br>  
That taxi driver was Rick Ritchie. He happened to be stopped for a light at the corner of King and Main in Dundas; just as the suspect vehicle turned the corner in front of him. He called in the location; and trailed the car into Hamilton; all the while providing police, with a steady stream of information.<br>  
Does he feel like a hero? <br>  
In what police describe as a high risk take down at Hunter and James; the suspect vehicle collided with a police cruiser. Four young offenders were then taken into custody without further incident.</i>
<hr>
<b>Heat - Water Quality</b><p>
<br>  Its the hottest day of the year and many people are taking to area beaches to cool off.<br>  But, the humid conditions can cause high bacteria levels making the lake unsafe for swimming.<br>  As Dwight Ryan reports, regional officials are keeping a close eye on the water quality and so far its A-okay.  <br>  
<i><br>  Hot, hazy and humid.  Its weather like this that can make this great lake not so great.<br>  
Its weather like this that brings Mike Brady to the shore of Lake Ontario to see if its safe to swim.<br>  Brady from the Hamilton Regional Health Unit takes samples from the beach for study at the lab. They're looking for e-coli bacteria...a product of human waste.<br>  
Its just as disgusting as it sounds and it can make you feel rotten...      <br>  
Surprisingly warnings have not been posted this year at Hamilton beaches.  Though the water's cold, its reasonably clean.<br>  But not everyone likes the idea of swimming in it.      Just remember, it can make you sick.<br>  </i>
<hr>
<b>Dhaliwal Found</b><p>
<br>  Yesterday we reported on a missing 14 year old boy.  Nirmal Dhaliwal hadn't been seen since saturday when he was dropped off in the Guelph Line - Driftwood Drive area of Burlington to canvass for newspaper subscriptions. Halton Police today announced the boy has been found in Montreal and has been returned to his home.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Rescue</b><p>
<br> A tourist from Ohio is lucky to be alive after he tumbled down the gorge in Niagara Falls Monday night.<br> Twenty year old Mathew Shears and a companion had fallen asleep near Hubbard's Point when he rolled over and fell 20 metres down the rock face.<br> He had been lying there more than 12 hours before somebody on the US side of the river noticed him and called police.<br> Shear's in hospital with undetermined injuries.
<hr>
<b>SIU Probe</b><p>
<br> The province's special investigations unit will probe the death of a man who struggled with police in St. Catharines.<br> Police went to a home early sunday morning where a semi-conscious person had reportedly overdosed on drugs.<br> Niagara Region Police say the man struggled with police officers before being transported to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.<br> An autopsy suggested 34-year-old Beverly Ingraham died of a pulmonary edema, a condition in which excess fluid accumulates in body tissues.<br> The SIU is called in on any death or serious injury involving police.
<hr>
<b>Lake Swim Update</b><p>
<br> In spite of the near perfect conditions, Toronto detective John Munro has failed in his bid to swim Lake Ontario. Swim spokesman Dave Haggith says Munro developed a sore shoulder early today and was pulled from the water around 5:15 this morning -- just five kilometres short of his goal. The Toronto cop left Niagara On-the-Lake early yesterday, in a bid to raise money for an anti-youth violence program called chill-power.
<hr>
<b>Labor Woes</b><p>
<br> Provincial cutbacks may soon take a toll on labor relations in both Hamilton- Wentworth and Niagara.<br> 
Municipal employees in both regions and in the city of Hamilton are on the verge of striking against proposed contract concessions.<br> 
Concilliation efforts in Niagara have broken down and CUPE members there are awaiting a "no board" report that could put them in a 
legal strike position before the end of the month.<br> Civic workers in Hamilton- Wentworth and the city of Hamilton plan their own strike vote next Friday.  They're expected to take a hard line against proposed wage cuts reported to be in the five percent range.
<hr>
<b>Mars</b><p>
<br> For centuries earthlings have tried to find life on Mars, but the first study to present serious evidence of microbes on the red planet is being denounced quickly by other scientists.<br> A group of scientists with NASA claim to have found in a rock from Mars, organic compounds they say were deposited by primitive life forms, before the rock was blasted into space and sent on a 15-million year voyage to Earth.<br> The rock apparently landed in the antarctic about 13-thousand years ago and was discovered in 1984.<br> Interestingly enough, Hamilton's McMaster University holds one of only twelve samples of that original martian rock.<br> But reaction to the findings in the scientific community, ranges from cautious optimism to outright disbelief.<br> NASA says it plans several more mars projects for further study.

<hr>
<b>Neighborhood Safety</b><p>
<br> Its national "night out" day. Across the nation, tens of thousands of people will gather in neigbourhoods to give a "going away party" to crime and drugs.<br> Dwight Ryan has the story.  <br>  sot
<i><br>  At Carter Park in Hamilton's Stinson neighbourhood, there is not much to fear.<br>  A neighbourhood that was once plagued with drugs, crime and prostitution is on the mend. Residents don't mind walking the streets.  Their parks are safe.<br>  Like many other areas, the Stinson neighbourhood is working hand in hand with police to clean up its image.  And residents welcome the sight of police cruising their streets.  <br>  The Stinson neighbourhood in Hamilton is one of thousands across the country that will hold night out festivals this week.<br>  A going-away part for crime and drugs.  <br>  While the night out festivals will be held this week, the work to clean up canada's crime ridden communities continues throughout the year.<br> </i>
<hr>
<b>Air Quality - Heat</b><p>
<br> This is day two of what is expected to be at least four days of poor air quality in southern Ontario.<br> The first summer heatwave of 96, is making breathing difficult for those with on- going respiratory problems, and it's at very least a source of aggravation for people considered to be in good health.  Jamie West reports...

<i><br>  Hot enough to fry an egg on the road.... maybe not quite ... but in fact still cool enough for these seasoned heat handlers to be hard at it...<br>   A thick layer of ground level ozone has topped the 50 level on the official scale...in short that's bad...<br>  For most people in good health... a good hankerchief and lots of water will get you through...but a strong heat and pollution cocktail mixed from a lot of gas powered motors, can be deadly to the very young and the not so young...<br> But despite increased numbers of asthma cases in Hamilton ...there's very little evidence that points directly to air pollution as a cause.</I>

<hr>
<b>Stolen Explosives</b><p>
<br> Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police are asking for your help in solving an overnight break-in at a Dundas construction site.<br> As Dwight Ryan reports, explosives were stolen...and police say they are extemely lethal.  <br>  
<i><br>  Sometime during the early morning hours, thieves raided this dundas construction site. <br>  
Taken in the heist, a number of cylinders containing a potentially dangerous substance.   <br>    
If you have any information concerning the theft, call Hamilton Regional Police at 522-4925 or Crime Stoppers at 522-TIPS.</i>
<hr>
<b>Boy Missing</b><p>
<br> Halton Police are stymied by the disappearance of a 14-year old.<br>  Nirmal Dhaliwal hasn't been seen since Saturday when he was dropped off in the Guelph Line - Driftwood Drive area of Burlington to canvass for newspaper subscriptions.<br>  Dhaliwal, who lives on Derry Road in Mississauga, is described as an east indian male with short black hair and black eyes.  He's 5-feet, six inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.  When last seen, dhaliwal was wearing a grey t-shirt and light-colored pants.<br>  Anyone with information concerning this missing youth is asked to call Halton Police.
<hr>
<b>Baby Pool</b><p>
A 14-month-old Burlington boy is in critical condition in hospital after nearly drowning in a backyard pool. Jordan Belisaro was unconscious yesterday when he was pulled from the water. A neighbor, James Dring, responded to cries for help from the family and vaulted over a fence. He applied CPR until paramedics arrived. Police say Jordan is now breathing on his own, but remains unconscious.
<hr>
<b>Niagara Gorge</b><p>
<br> The condition of a Romanian man, injured while trying to climb down into the Niagara Gorge, has improved. Nicolae (krow-kan-ess-kue) is now listed in serious condition at the Erie County Medical Centre.  He suffered severe head and internal injuries Sunday after falling to the bottom of the US side of the gorge.<br> Officials say he fell after coming to the end of a clothes-line-like rope he was using.<br> US police say they are not sure if they will be laying charges or turning (krow-ken-ess-kue) over to immigration officials.
<hr>
<b>Lincoln Crash Update</b><p>
An early morning accident in the town of Lincoln yesterday has now claimed a life. Niagara Regional Police say 24 year old Phyllis Andrews, a visitor from Trinidad, succumbed to her injuries on Monday. She was one of six people taken to area hospitals as a result of the two car collision on 15th Street in lincoln. Police are continuing their investigation.
<hr>
<b>Stelco Erie</b><p>
<br>   Nearly one-thousand steelworkers employed at Stelco's Lake Erie Steel in Nanticoke have ratified a new contract. Eighty-two per cent of the workers who voted yesterday cast their ballots in favor of the tentative deal, reached last week. The new contract provides a two dollar-an-hour raise and pension improvements. Stelco has also promised to expand the Nanticoke plant, creating 30 new jobs.
<hr>
<b>Munro Swim</b><p>
<br> A toronto police detective is attempting to swim across Lake Ontario.<br> John Munro, 45, the husband of marathon swimmer Vicki Keith, stepped into Lake Ontario at Niagara on the Lake early this morning.<br> Munro says conditions are perfect. He says he is expecting a sunny day with calm water. Munro says it will take up to 24 hours to finish his swim at Vicki Keith Point on Toronto's waterfront.<br> The Toronto cop is raising money for chill-power, an education program aimed at preventing youth violence.  
<hr>
<b>CNIB - Japanese</b><p>
<br> Some special visitors for the CNIB in Hamilton this afternoon.<br> A group of university students from our twin city, Fukuyama, Japan, toured the facility and its transitional training centre.<br> The centre is in the midst of a capital campaign trying to raise 1.8 million dollars for much-needed renovations.

<HR>

<H3>Nanticoke Expansion </H3>

<P>
A ten percent increase in wages and a thirty five percent hike
in pension benefits. These are just two aspects of a labour agreement
reached between the United Steelworkers Union and Stelco's Lake
Erie Works. As Dwight Ryan reports, the historic agreement could
lead Stelco to go ahead with a massive expansion of its Nanticoke
plant. 
<P>
<I>Its a deal. A thousand steelworkers at Stelco's Lake Erie Works
will vote Monday on a contract that offers better wages, pensions
and bonuses. As well new jobs will be created as part of the four
year pact. </I>
<P>
<I>The trend-setting agreement follows more than a year of negotiations
in which the union says Stelco was more interested in taking than
giving. </I>
<P>
<I>In a small town, good news travels fast. The mayor is delighted.
Retailers in the city of Nanticoke, which includes Port Dover,
have seen some tough times. Times they hope are behind them for
good. </I>
<P>
<I>Steelworkers are expected to overwhelmingly accept the new
contract agreement. Word on the plant expansion is expected soon
after.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Seniors Spat </H3>

<P>
Call it grey power ... a wrinkled revolution is underway, at a
Burlington seniors' centre where some members are refusing to
pay a user fee, for the use of the facility. Scot Urquhart has
more on that: 
<P>
<I>A buck a day to play.. may not seem like much ... but it's
got these seniors fighting mad. It was the first day on the job
for Centre Director Cathy Lamb ... she says the euchre players
are the only group that refuses to pay the user fee. </I>
<P>
<I>But Cathy says the seniors are not helping to keep costs down.
But this angry senior points to a prison system where recreation
is free ..... and where will the seniors go ... if they lose?
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Stabbed Boy </H3>

<P>
A four-year-old Collingwood boy who was stabbed last weekend has
been released from a St. Catharines hospital. The child, whose
identity is being withheld, was treated for a punctured lung.
He's still suffering from breathing problems but is expected to
make a full recovery. 
<P>
The boy was visiting St. Catharines when he was attacked by a
seven year-old. The attacker is too young to face charges and
family and child services is forbidden to discuss the case. The
four year old is expected to get psychological counseling to deal
with the trauma. 
<HR>

<H3>Drowning </H3>

<P>
A 37 year old man is missing and presumed drowned after falling
into the Welland Canal in Port Colborne. Police say two men were
fishing off a dam last night when one of them tripped and fell
about three metres into the water. His friend ran for help. 
<P>
Emergency officials searched but found no trace. His name has
not yet been released. 
<HR>

<H3>St. Kitts Fire </H3>

<P>
Three people are in hospital after a suspicious fire in St. Catharines
last night. Niagara's arson task force and the Ontario Fire Marshall's
Office are probing the cause of the fire, that completely engulfed
the house. 
<P>
56 year old Sheila Mitchell and 26 year old Ian Page were sent
to Hamilton General Hospital in serious condition. 25 year old
Scott Page is also listed in serious condition. 
<HR>

<H3>Caribana Niagara </H3>

<P>
Niagara Falls is hoping the main event of Toronto's annual Caribana
Festival will help them out. Tomorrow's 10-hour street party which
includes a parade featuring elaborate and colorful costumes, is
drawing hundreds of American tourist and Niagara Falls officials
hope the Caribana visitors will also boost what has been a disappointing
tourist season so far in the city. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Canadian financial markets have changed dramatically because of
yet more economic data from the U.S. that indicates American interest
rates will remain stable. 
<P>
Investors aggressively bought Canadian stocks and bonds today
as interest rates on government bonds dropped sharply. 
<P>
Mortgage rates will fall tomorrow.

<HR>

<H3>Welfare Reasons </H3>

<P>
Where have they gone? Thousands of welfare recipients have left
the system since the Tory government cut benefits last fall ...
but no one seems to know exactly what happened to them. A Hamilton
study now gives at least part of the answer ... as Scot Urquhart
reports: 
<P>
<I>The exodus is on. More than two thousand recipients left the
welfare system in Hamilton Wentworth between October 1995, and
January 1996 ... but where did they go? The Social Planning and
Research Council survey says that roughly 80 percent of those
who left welfare did so, because they, or someone in their family
found work; or went back to school. And most said their lives
were marginally better ... without welfare. </I>
<P>
<I>Why does the food bank see things differently than the planning
council does? Well one reason ... may be the relatively small
size of the study sample. Susan West admits that it was tough
to track former welfare recipients ... and some of them couldn't
be found at all: and although recipients who are working now may
be saving the system money in the short run ... the longer term
indicated a disturbing trend.</I>
<P>
<I>Susan West agrees the study is not the final answer on welfare.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Crop Losses </H3>

<P>
Farmers in Ontario are taking a big financial hit thanks to the
weather. A cold, rainy spring is resulting in smaller crop yields.
and a fungus is destroying much of the province's wheat crop.
Dwight Ryan reports from Guelph. 
<P>
<I>A dark cloud hangs over Ontario's agricultural industry. Losses
to farmers could total 90 million dollars and the weather is to
blame. </I>
<P>
<I>Peter Hannam is a partner in Woodrill Farms near Guelph. He
says prices will remain high because of the cold wet weather.
</I>
<P>
<I>Professor Rick Upfold is with the University of Guelph. Fusarium
causes toxins which result in vomiting in humans and reproductive
problems in animals. With wheat harvesting about to begin, its
clear the fungus is widespread. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Squeegee Kids </H3>

<P>
They're on the streets and they're looking for you....more precisely
your car and it's dirty windshield. They're called <I>squeegee
kids </I>and have been a fixture on the streets of Toronto, Vancouver,
Montreal and Ottawa. Now they're hitting the streets of downtown
Hamilton as we hear in this report from Jamie West... 
<P>
<I>This occupation came out of New York City and has become a
regular part of the downtown landscape in several Canadian cities.
Jean Paul is sixteen and lives at the Good Shepherd Centre ...
he and his partners work together...and share the earnings...to
buy things like pizza and cigarettes ... and personal items like
soap, deodorant and toothbrushes.</I>
<P>
<I>The police are trying to find a way to reasonably deal with
the situation.... but just 30 minutes after we arrived so did
the police.</I>
<P>
<I>Jean-Paul told us he thinks about his future, he wants to go
back to school and one day become a carpenter.... but for now
he says he will continue to sponge a living off the windshields
of downtown motorists. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Huge Shipment </H3>

<P>
A huge shipment made it's way into Hamilton harbour this afternoon.
The sight of a 5 storey high storage tank, caught the eyes of
a lot of people near the Burlington Canal and lift-bridge. 
<P>
The tank was being towed from Oshawa en route to Pier 23 for delivery
to Canada-West Indies Molasses. The company will use the tank
to store canola oil. 
<P>
McKeo Marine says it took nearly 12 hours to make the journey.

<HR>

<H3>Steelworkers Deal </H3>

<P>
A tentative settlement was reached earlier today between the United
Steelworkers Local 8782 and Lake Erie Steel Co. Local 8782's president
said details of the agreement will not be released until union
members have had an opportunity to review terms of the deal, that
will be Friday at 11am in the Port Dover Community Centre, with
a vote scheduled for Monday, Aug. 5th. 
<HR>

<H3>Canoe Race </H3>

<P>
It's no secret that tensions have been simmering at times between
police and members of the native community. But as Lauran Sabourin
reports this afternoon members of both sides took a paddle and
canoe into the Grand River in hopes of smoothing these troubled
waters. 
<P>
<I>Their paddling their way to a better understanding. One hundred
twenty five law enforcement officers. One hundred twenty five
members of southern Ontario's native communities. </I>
<P>
<I>Constable Brian Urie is paired up with Jackie Samush. While
relations between natives and police officers have improved she
still remembers the stinging racist remarks. And the only contact
many native youth have had with police is over the hood of a car.
</I>
<P>
<I>For two hours this afternoon the canoeists meandered down the
Grand River from Paris to Brantford. The race may look more like
a recreational outing, but to the participants it means much more.
In the last four years the canoe race has grown from 40 participants
to this year's 250. </I>

<P>
The program is gone, but the controversy continues over a defunct
aversive therapy program for brain injured patients, at Chedoke
McMaster Hospital. The family of one former patient says, they
will now pursue criminal charges because their son may have been
treated without proper consent. Scot Urquhart reports: 
<P>
<I>It's not just what they did to him ... but whether they had
the right to do it ... at all. Diana Martin is Robbie Thompson's
mother. She says she's had power of attorney over Robbie since
1989 ... and had to produce that document to get Robbie admitted
to the brain injury clinic at Chedoke McMaster in 1991. She says
she never signed a consent form for Robbie's treatment. And the
only document produced by the hospital to show consent so far
... is one signed by Robbie; that is missing at least four signatures.
</I>
<P>
<I>Diana Martin says, that issue of informed consent has now led
her to the police. </I>
<HR>

<H3>University Enrollment </H3>

<P>
Many Ontario universities are increasing enrollments, despite
the fact that fewer students are applying. With increased tuition
fees, many high school students are opting for college, or just
looking for a job. 
<P>
But, universities have to make up for lower funding from Queen's
Park. Reporter Dwight Ryan wondered if standards are being lowered
in order to accept more applicants. 
<P>
<I>Across Ontario the number of applicants for full time first
year studies is down about one and a half percent. That follows
a sharp drop of more than five percent just a year ago. </I>
<P>
<I>Still acceptances are up.. about four percent. At Hamilton's
McMaster University, president Peter George says applications
are off by about seven percent. Enrollments however are up marginally.
</I>
<P>
<I>With higher tuition fees, some universities are accepting more
students just to cover cuts from Queens Park. Dr. George feels
tuition fees will increase for a few more years, then level off.
But do students feel they're getting their money's worth? </I>
<P>
<I>While some feel a university education is just for the rich,
McMaster hopes to help struggling students by raising money in
the community. Through the new student opportunity trust fund,
moneys raised by the school will be matched by the province.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Selkirk Fire I.D. </H3>

<P>
The victim of a fatal cottage fire in Selkirk Sunday night has
identified. A post mortem shows 69 year old Lorraine Robertson
of Stoney Creek died of smoke inhalation. 
<P>
The retired accountant was alone in the cottage when it was engulfed
in flames. The Ontario Fire Marshall's office is still investigating,
trying to pin down a cause. 
<HR>

<H3>More Mall Murder </H3>

<P>
Two more arrests have been made in the murder of a Hamilton teenager
at Limeridge Mall back in May. 18 year old Roberto Oliveira died
from injuries after an attack at the mall's theatre entrance.

<P>
A 15 year old was charged with second degree murder shortly after
the incident. Now, 18 year old Deel Yelda of Hamilton and a 17
year old face the same charge. 
<HR>

<H3>Native Artifacts </H3>

<P>
An important archaeological find has been announced in Brantford.
Archaeologists have discovered artifacts from an Indian settlement
said to be 1200 years old. Dwight Ryan has that. 
<P>
<I>Archaeologists work in the woods just metres away from the
Grand River. Their routine sight check next to the Brantford Water
Treatment Plant has turned up amazing treasures from Ontario's
past.</I>
<P>
<I>Brantford's PUC director Bob Patrick commissioned the archaeological
study. Topsoil examinations now will lead to a full archaeological
dig in the weeks ahead. Artifacts will then probably go on display
at the Woodland Indian Cultural Centre. Once they're removed,
it will no longer be considered an archaeological site and construction
on the water treatment plant can continue. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Shift Work Pt. 2 </H3>

<P>
Yesterday on First Edition, we began a two part look at shift-work.
While the time off may be great, the pitfalls of working around
the clock are many. Today we look at the role good nutrition and
exercise play in helping your body keep up. Annette Hamm reports.

<P>
<I>That's a trap many shift workers fall into. If you don't work
when everyone else does, you tend not to eat at regular times.
Tom and Maggie McKittrick, both HW Regional Police officers, know
the nutritional pitfalls of working unusual hours. </I>
<P>
<I>Many shift-workers tend to develop gastrointestinal and digestive
problems. A cup of coffee may be the energy boost most shift workers
reach for, but nutritionists warn not to go overboard. Limit yourself
to no more than four cups a day. </I>
<P>
<I>Maintaining a regular eating schedule is also important. For
example, it's recommended shift workers eat breakfast-type foods
upon waking, no matter what time of day it is. </I>
<P>
<I>As police officers, the McKittricks are expected to keep up
an exercise routine. They find it helps them sleep better and
gives them a chance to catch up with each other. Fitness experts
say any shift worker can benefit from exercise. more and more
employers, like Proctor and Gamble in Hamilton, are holding information
sessions to help shift-workers and their families. They realize
fit, well rested and well adjusted employees are more productive
and may be better able to make decisions.</I>

<H3>Fatal Fires </H3>

<P>
Two people have died as the result of weekend house fires. Crews
were called to a Brantford home early this morning where the body
of a man was discovered. 
<P>
Hours earlier, a woman perished when her Lake Erie cottage went
up in flames. Dwight Ryan has the story. 
<P>
<I>Investigators have yet to determine what caused an early morning
fire that claimed the life of a Brantford man. Emergency crews
were called to the house just after four o'clock Monday morning...
family and friends gathered as investigators went about their
work. </I>
<P>
<I>40 year-old Bob Allison has been identified as the victim.
Allison and his family were in the process of moving at the time
of the inferno. A family cat also perished. </I>
<P>
<I>Hours earlier, firefighters from Fisherville and Selkirk were
called to an inferno on the Lake Erie shoreline. A 69 year-old
Stoney Creek woman perished. No cause for the blaze has yet been
determined. </I>
<P>
<I>Fisherville volunteer firefighter Fred Elfner was the first
on the scene. Homeowner Sheila Yates has nothing but praise for
the volunteer firefighters. </I>
<P>
<I>Family members of the victim have not yet all been notified.
Her name has not yet been released</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Mac Staff Vote </H3>

<P>
The union says it wants to bring fairness to the workplace ...
but at least one staff member at McMaster University, is crying
foul. A certification drive to unionize clerical workers at Mac
will probably come to a ballot later this week... at a time when
many staff members won't even be around to vote on their own future.
Scot Urquhart reports: 
<P>
<I>Summertime at Mac. A time when there are probably more flowers
than students on campus ... a time when staff crawls out of the
ivory tower ... and takes off, for summer vacation. And that's
what worries this woman. Anne Taylor is an administrative secretary
who will be asked later this week, to vote for a union, that she
doesn't want. Anne says the fix is in ... OPSEU is trying to pull
a fast one; when staff members are on vacation.</I>
<P>
<I>David Wartman is the director of human resources at Mac. </I>
<P>
<I>Connie Huziak is the OPSEU organizer heading the union drive
at Mac.</I>
<P>
<I>Then why are they holding the vote now? Provincial legislation
requires a certification vote to be held within five days of an
application; and despite the questions about this vote; David
Wartman says, it will probably take place on Thursday August first,
as planned.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>St. Kitts Stabbing </H3>

<P>
A four-year-old St. Catharines boy, stabbed in the back during
the weekend, is recovering in hospital. Officials at the Chedoke-McMaster
Medical Centre in Hamilton say the boy's condition has been upgraded
to good. 
<P>
He was rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries on
Saturday after being attacked with a knife. A seven-year-old boy,
not related to the victim, is the prime suspect in the case. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Philip Environmental of Hamilton today announced it plans to accept
an offer to sell its solid waste business for 118 million dollars
U.S. 
<P>
Stock prices in Canada and the U.S. moved lower, the dollar strengthened,
interest yields on Canadian government bonds moved higher. 
<HR>

<H3>Shift Work </H3>

<P>
According to recent statistics, about 20 percent of Canadian jobs
require workers to work odd hours ....shifts of 8 to twelve hours
that start at all hours of the day and night. Its called shift-work
and shift-work has been linked with a variety of health problems
and safety issues. But there are steps you can take to lessen
the impact of working around the clock. Annette Hamm has this
report. 
<P>
<I>Like one out of every 5 Canadian workers, Tom McKittrick doesn't
have a 9 to 5 job. Neither does his wife, Maggie. Tom works ten
hour shifts with the Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police canine
unit ... half a week days, half a week nights. </I>
<P>
<I>Maggie McKittrick is also a police officer. She works ten hour
shifts, afternoons and nights every other week. Both agree the
key to keeping their schedules, and themselves, sane is to not
let the effects of shift-work get the best of them. Getting enough
sleep is the first hurdle most workers like Tom and Maggie have
to get over. </I>
<P>
<I>Dr. Jamie MacFarlane runs the sleep disorders clinic at the
University of Toronto. He says the first rule of sleeping on shift
is that there are no rules. You have to experiment which type
of sleep makes you feel best ... whether you nap or not, whether
you go to bed right after you come home or wait a few hours. Just
make sure sleep doesn't consume your life. </I>
<P>
<I>For most night workers, that low point hits between 3 and 5
in the morning. The corporate nurse at Hamilton's Proctor and
Gamble plant agrees that's a time many workers there complain
about. </I>
<P>
<I>Tom and Maggie McKittrick have managed to work out their sleep
schedules, largely through family co-operation. </I>
<P>
<I>Coming up tomorrow, we'll tell you how proper exercise and
nutrition can help your body cope with shift-work. </I>

<H3>Mike Strange Fight </H3>

<P>
They're celebrating in Niagara Falls tonight. And it's a strange
one. Boxer Mike Strange made it to the quarter finals at the Olympic
games in Atlanta this afternoon. He won a second round bout handily
over his Armenian opponent. 
<P>
Strange now advances to the quarter finals, and as Lauran Sabourin
reports his friends and family back in Niagara Falls were savoring
the victory at Mike's neighbourhood bar. 
<P>
<I>The songs came easily once this crowd realized that Mike Strange
was going to win his second bout. But only minutes earlier Strange's
friends couldn't bare to watch the start of this fight. A fight
that initially put Strange's Armenian opponent in the lead. </I>
<P>
<I>Mike's brother Jim watched the nine minute battle holding his
breath. Strange won gold at the Commonwealth Games last year.
This was expected to be an early victory. Late into the second
round Strange came back. landing clean blows that scored points
with the judges. </I>
<P>
<I>Derek McLatchie is a long time friend of Mike's and co-owner
of the bar. He knows Mike Strange as a determined and disciplined
fighter. A young man who has the confidence to win. </I>
<P>
<I>The round was over in minutes. But the partying at the Highland
Tap Bar will continue at least until Strange's next bout. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Golf Ball Divers </H3>

<P>
It's no secret that the business of golf is very lucrative and
the sport continues to grow in popularity, but questions about
recycling golf balls from water traps are being raised after the
second death in a month, of a trained scuba diver at a Toronto
area course. 
<P>
As Jamie west reports...there's a big demand for used golf balls
but some retrieval companies may be getting in over their heads...

<P>
<I>It's all about making a buck and saving a buck. Golfers gobble
up experienced balls by the dozen. </I>
<P>
<I>The Ministry of Labour has now requested that retrieval companies
only use machines to retrieve balls at least for the time being...
Jim Sara is an experienced diver and the course superintendent
at Carlisle Golf and Country Club...he says the looks of these
ponds can be deceiving. </I>
<P>
<I>Carlisle contracts out the retrieval of golf balls to an independent
Toronto area company called Nearly New...in exchange for balls
to re-sell in their pro shop. At the moment there are no regulations
governing who retrieval companies can and cannot hire to dive.</I>
<P>
<I>Yesterday's tragic death of experienced diver Murray Alcock
in less than two metres of water has surprised course operators
but not Rick Bullas a dive master who has strapped on the tank
over one hundred and fifty times. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Housing Help Centre </H3>

<P>
Hamilton Centre's Dave Christopherson is calling for an inquest
into the death earlier this month of a homeless man in a July
third fire that engulfed a downtown abandoned building. 
<P>
He also had some choice words today for the Harris government's
decision to yank the funding rug from beneath the Housing Help
Centre. Anthony Pooley has the details. 
<P>
<I>Dave Christopherson's provincial riding takes in Hamilton's
downtown... where by far the largest number of the city's homeless
find temporary refuge from the elements wherever they can. Abandoned
buildings are favored by those with nowhere else to go... and
it was in this such structure that 29-year-old transient Donald
Dupuis met his death in a fire three weeks ago. </I>
<P>
<I>So today... the Hamilton Centre MPP called for an inquest into
his death. Earlier this week, a local organization that helps
those who need it find housing fell victim to the Harris government's
cost-cutting ax ... as Hamilton's Housing Help Centre announced
it was closing it's doors in the face of lost provincial funding...
representing about 80-percent of its operating budget... a major
slap in the collective face of the homeless.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Drowning I.D. </H3>

<P>
An autopsy performed at Welland Country General Hospital has confirmed
that man who was found dead in a Welland backyard swimming pool
earlier this week did drown and his death has been ruled accidental.
48-year-old Kenneth Roland was from grand bend. 
<HR>

<H3>Jewelry Robbery </H3>

<P>
Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police are looking for two thugs who
held up a mountain jewelry store. Police say two white males scooped
two cases from Hummingbird Jewelers on Upper James over the dinner
hour. A large amount of gold was stolen. 
<P>
Store staff were unable to provide any further description of
the robbers. They escaped in a stolen car that was later recovered.

<HR>

<H3>Sub Shop Heist </H3>

<P>
And police are seeking a lone black male who held up a mountain
submarine shop last night. Police say the thief entered the Mr.
Submarine shop on Upper Gage shortly before ten o'clock demanding
cash. He indicated he had a gun, although no weapon was seen.

<P>
He's described as a male, black, in his late 20's ...about five
feet, 11 inches tall. At the time of the heist, he was wearing
a green and orange jacket with a black scarf over his face. The
suspect escaped with an undetermined amount of cash. 
<HR>

<H3>Musk Sniffs </H3>

<P>
Last week it was police dog Rocky. This week's canine hero is
Musk. The Revenue Canada detector dog sniffed out a haul of marijuana
during a search of a vehicle trying to enter Canada at the Fort
Erie border. It was contained in a number of heavily-packaged
bundles, two taped to the driver's ankles, five others inside
the vehicle. Estimated street value of the cache: almost 11-thousand
dollars. 
<P>
Richard Alfonso, 25 of Toronto is charged with importing a narcotic
into Canada and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Last
year, Revenue Canada's 29 detector dogs helped find more than
46 million dollars worth of illicit drugs.

<H3>Hamilton - Floods </H3>

<P>
The city of Hamilton has launched an Olympic effort to help flood
victims in Quebec. Mayor Bob Morrow this morning announced an
initial fundraising target of 150 thousand dollars, significant
in that this is the city's 150th birthday. Lauran Sabourin has
more. 
<P>
<I>The province of Quebec has established a 200 million dollar
fund to help the devastated communities rebuild. But it's expected
the damage figure will be much higher. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton wants to send more than good wishes. The city has
set an initial fund raising goal of 150 thousand dollars. In the
last 48 hours the Hamilton Red Cross has been overwhelmed with
calls to help. All of the major banks have set up flood assistance
accounts. </I>
<P>
<I>Other companies are also doing their part. Mobile Cartage is
collecting clothing and other goods that will be transported to
the affected area. If you want to drop items off you can bring
it to their warehouse at 354 Nash Road north in Hamilton. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Welland Drowning </H3>

<P>
An autopsy was scheduled today to try to determine how and why
a man died in a pool at a home in Welland. The 48 year old man,
who had been visiting the Edgar Street house, was found in the
backyard pool yesterday afternoon, floating face down. 
<HR>

<H3>Nusca-Fatal </H3>

<P>
A car truck crash early this morning has claimed the life of a
Hamilton man: 31-year-old Joseph Nusca. It happened at King and
Sanford in east Hamilton when a pickup truck ran a red light colliding
with a car. The truck then flipped onto its side and slid into
a Hydro pole. 
<HR>

<H3>Pyro Punks </H3>

<P>
Police and fire officials in Hamilton are investigating a number
of overnight arson fires. The blazes in garbage containers and
construction equipment caused little damage but kept firefighters
in north-central Hamilton hopping. In all, eight fires were set.

<P>
Witnesses say a group of teenagers, six boys and three girls,
were seen fleeing from the fires. 
<HR>

<H3>Condom Bomber </H3>

<P>
A late night prank has resulted in serious charges against a Hamilton
girl: mischief endangering life and assault with a weapon. Police
say the teenager was throwing water filled condoms from a 12th
floor balcony in Hamilton's northeast end. One of the projectiles
struck a woman on the hip and soaked her 18 month old daughter.

<HR>

<H3>Tainted Appeal </H3>

<P>
Hamilton AIDS activists say they are simply running out of time.
Disappointment and outrage tonight over the actions of the Canadian
Red Cross. It wants the supreme court to overturn a ruling that
the Krever Inquiry can name names in its final report on how thousands
of Canadians got HIV or Hepatitis C through blood transfusions.

<P>
The Red Cross contends the report could expose it -- and its workers
-- to criminal or civil court cases, and could suggest they were
responsible for the tainted blood scandal. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Stock markets made some strong gains today after better than expected
earnings at IBM helped revive dozens of technology stocks. 
<P>
Analysts are still bullish about many technology companies. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar lost almost a quarter of a penny against the
u-s dollar. 
<HR>

<H3>GO - Business </H3>

<P>
New businesses surrounding Hamilton's new downtown GO Centre are
finding it a tough go...just months after the station's grand
opening. As Jamie West reports their economic field of dreams
is turning out to be more like a field of broken dreams... 
<P>
<I>The battle cry was heard for years in downtown Hamilton...
if we build it they will come... new business owners a stone's
throw from the new GO Centre are stymied... even the cab drivers
are idle promises of big money circulating around the GO station...
so far have turned out to be nothing more than a lot of baloney.</I>
<P>
<I>Tucker Plus has been in business for fifty years over twenty
of them on John Street...but no longer are they giving the city
of Hamilton their rubber stamp of approval.</I>
<P>
<I>Three trains a day go in and out of Hamilton ...buses run all
day long... nearly 3000 passengers a day ...the equation doesn't
make sense to businesses that would rather be rolling in dough
than rolling it out at this slow rate.</I>

<H3>Keys - Marine </H3>

<P>
The federal government is looking at ways to improve the country's
marine transportation system. Harbors and other waterways will
have to improve the way they do business in order to remain competitive
in the 21st century. 
<P>
The Canada Marine Act, or Bill C-44, will seriously reduce the
involvement of the federal government in the operation of the
marine transportation system. But those who use the system are
being given a say in how the changes will be made. Today they
met with federal officials in Hamilton to have their say.

<H3>H.W. Marine Search </H3>

<P>
A group of young rowers who apparently set out to cross Lake Ontario
overnight has prompted an air and water search of Lake Ontario.
This afternoon the Hamilton- Wentworth police marine unit joined
other police and military rescue units in the search. They're
covering the section from Hamilton to Mississauga. We're expecting
results of their efforts anytime. 
<P>
While police have no reports of anyone missing, a white rowboat
with more than one person on board was seen early today about
100 metres from the east Toronto shoreline just after one was
reported stolen from woodbine beach. In addition to the lake search,
a ground search of the lake shoreline is also underway from Toronto
to Pickering in case the teens returned to shore. 
<P>
In March of 1995, six teens vanished without a trace in a boat
stolen from a marina in Pickering.
<HR>

<H3>Machine Fire </H3>

<P>
Damage estimated at close to a million dollars after an early
morning fire in Hamilton's industrial core. It happened at Central
Welding and Machine Knife at Depew and Beach road. The company
makes cutting blades for industry. 
<P>
It's believed the fire was started by a malfunctioning furnace
control. Falling debris from the gutted structure sent five firefighters
to hospital with minor neck and back injuries. All five have been
treated and released. 
<HR>

<H3>403 - Brantford </H3>

<P>
The provincial government is now saying the highway 403 link between
Ancaster and Brantford will be open to traffic late next year.
Tendering for the final leg of the roadway was announced today.
The project will include a new bridge at Shaver Road, interchange
improvements at highway two and 13-kilometres of new driving lanes.

<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Steel </H3>

<P>
Good news from the Hamilton steel industry today. Word late this
afternoon that Stelco earned 30 million dollars during the second
quarter of this year. That's down from the same time last year,
but still a sign on continuing promise. The results, however,
were even more promising for Dofasco. Anthony Pooley has more.

<P>
<I>This is what the nickname &quot;steel town&quot; is all about...
and even with all of the job cuts over the years, the steel industry
remains the backbone of Hamilton's economy... more or less. </I>
<P>
<I>Today, it looks like more as Dofasco posted second quarter
earnings, showing huge increases in both sales and profits for
the second quarter. Specifically, second quarter sales jumped
21.3-percent over the same period last year to 787.7-million dollars.
Profits are up a whopping 31.6-percent to 54.6-million. </I>
<P>
<I>The challenge, says president and CEO John Mayberry, is to
sustain the good results for as long as possible ... tough sometimes
in a cyclical industry. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Body Image </H3>

<P>
Yesterday we told you about the growing problem of childhood obesity.
Today, reporter Jamie West takes a look at another North American
trend...our obsession with body image.
<P>
<I>Experts say we put too much pressure on ourselves to measure
up to impossible standards set by the media...and it's high time
we learned to relax and accept different body images... </I>
<P>
<I>They're everywhere, and lately they're of Olympic proportions
body images, attractive, athletic, fit, slim and trim... for the
average person...a nearly impossible goal to achieve but one that
is placed centre stage by the media. And that often leads to medically
dangerous yo-yo dieting.</I>
<P>
<I>Marnie Wilson now 24 has felt the pressure since she was 16..
Experts say the pressure is far greater on women but men are not
immune... 42 year old stand up comedian Scot Harris buffed up
five years ago</I>
<P>
<I>But nutritionist's and doctor's say it's time to accept our
often genetically programmed and varied physical forms, take off
the pressure and find some peace ...because it's not likely we'll
ever find the perfect body.</I>

<H3>Henley Newser </H3>

<P>
The city of St. Catharines, home of the renowned Henley Regatta
is rowing its way to gold....in the form of the 1999 World Rowing
Championships and perhaps the 2001 Canada Games. 
<P>
The Ontario government today agreed to contribute 1.5 million
dollars in a partnership with the city and Ottawa for a major
upgrade of the Henley course. It's all part of the Martindale
Pond Henley Course Eco-system Management Plan. 
<P>
Serious problems with respect to water depth and movement had
threatened to end any future world class events including the
six annual regattas. That's a dollar value alone of about three-quarters
of a million dollars or 40 full-time jobs. 
<P>
The economic impact of the &quot;Worlds&quot; in 1999 is estimated
at more than 15-million dollars and a minimum of 804 full-time
jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Flood Assistance </H3>

<P>
The French community in Hamilton is responding to an appeal for
funds, relief funds following the devastating weekend floods in
the Saguenay region of Quebec. 
<P>
This morning the national office of the Red Cross issued a country
wide appeal on behalf of the thousands of flood victims. They're
asking for two million dollars to help them rebuild. And as Lauran
Sabourin reports a local relief effort has begun to mobilize.

<P>
<I>The rest of Canada watched with horror as the first pictures
of the of the devastating flood were shown on television. Torrents
of water ripped through buildings. Waters poured through a local
church as if it was a sieve. As the waters receded it left vehicles,
debris buried in mud. </I>
<P>
<I>At the local branches of the Canadian Red Cross calls for assistance
are beginning to come in. People offering assistance. A lot of
calls are offering clothing. The Red Cross would rather have money.
With money the relief workers can help victims more effectively.
They can buy the goods to begin the massive rebuilding project.
Others more sympathetic to the victims see the relief effort as
a way to help reunite the country. </I>
<P>
<I>If you do want to help the flood victims in Quebec you can
make a donation at any branch of the Toronto Dominion, Royal,
CIBC or Scotiabank or you can bring cash, cheque or visa to any
branch of the Canadian Red Cross. The national goal is to raise
2 million dollars toward the flood relief effort. </I>
<HR>

<H3>QEW Rollover </H3>

<P>
A Mississauga transport driver has been charged with careless
driving after the rig he was in rolled over on the QEW at the
junction of highway 403 in Burlington last night. The 18-wheeler
blocked both southbound lanes of the QEW for seven-and-a-half
hours, during which traffic was re-routed onto the 403. 
<P>
Police say further charges are pending against 47-year-old Amaritt
Singh bath, who sustained only minor injuries. 
<HR>

<H3>Carjacking Arrest </H3>

<P>
A Niagara police dog is being credited for nabbing two suspects
from a carjacking in Toronto. Last night, two people were seen
running from a car that had rolled over on highway 406 in St.
Catharines. Police dog &quot;rocky&quot; and his handler quickly
caught up with the pair. 
<P>
19 year old Dennis hertz of Hamilton and 20 year old Monique Jamotte
of Toronto are charged with possession of stolen property. 
<HR>

<H3>Drunken Conductor </H3>

<P>
And Hamilton- Wentworth police have now charged a 37 year-old
Niagara Falls man with the impaired operation of railway equipment
after a weekend incident. It happened at the CN railroad yard
in the city's Northend. Police were called over complaints of
a drunken driver. Police say the conductor of a train was under
the influence of alcohol. 
<P>
Co-workers managed to get him out of the locomotive before calling
police. 
<HR>

<H3>GM Engine Shutdown </H3>

<P>
Another engine line at the General Motors St. Catharines plant
will be shut down. The 3.4 litre v-6 engine line will stop production
at the end of 1997. The line employs about 200 people but it hasn't
been determined just how many people will lose their jobs. 
<HR>

<H3>Santa - July </H3>

<P>
What's Santa Claus doing out at this time of year? The jolly old
elf made a special summer trip from the north pole just to see
all of the kids in the &quot;Supie&quot; program at Hamilton's
Woolverton Park. 
<P>
So it was Christmas in July for these kids as they spent an enjoyable
day doing fun things with saint nick. About 50 kids showed up
for the event... and naturally, they were glad they did. 
<HR>

<H3>Obesity </H3>

<P>
Some of North America's top experts on childhood obesity say watching
television may be a bigger culprit than diet in contributing to
an alarming increase in overweight north American children. But
as Jamie West reports ...that's not all. There's a new factor
that's keeping our children from getting fit... 
<P>
<I>The American college of sports medicine says the news is not
good ... one in 5 kids between the ages of 6 and seventeen is
obese...experts say it's an epidemic. </I>
<P>
<I>Chedoke McMaster hospitals Dr. Oded (bar-or) was one of two
Hamilton doctors out of nine in north America invited to share
research on the subject, at a meeting last week in Indianapolis.
But interestingly enough, during the last decade consumption of
fatty foods has decreased.</I>
<P>
<I>Public parks ...that used to be the gathering place of kids
in the summer have become deserted. And why is that? ... well,
it's due to a factor that virtually didn't exist in north America
a decade ago... that factor is parental fear... and that trend
is costly... in the U.S. it's estimated that the psychological,
social and medical costs of raising obese children into obese
adults is in the 10's of billions of dollars. And Canada isn't
far off the pace. </I>

<H3>Olympics</H3>

<P>
A disappointing day for a Burlington gymnast at the summer Olympic
games in Atlanta. It wasn't Alan Nolet's day but what a weekend
for Hamilton's Clara Hughes. 
<P>
Lets take a look at the medal board on this day 3 of the Olympics.
The Americans top the medal board with 10 while the Germans remain
close just 1 back. Canada with 2 bronze thanks to Claire Hughes
and Curtis Myden. 
<HR>

<H3>Orchestra Limbo </H3>

<P>
It's been a marathon, albeit a slow one to try to bring music
back to the city of Hamilton. Competing interests in the race
to rebuild the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra met behind closed
doors today. 
<P>
<I>Community leaders came up with a twelve point plan to revive
classical music in Hamilton after the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra
collapsed in a sea of debt in January. But the plan came too late
for organizers to apply for Canada Council funding. The process
dragged on and on and the sound of music seemed further and further
away. </I>
<P>
<I>Former artistic director Boris Brott made it on time.. but
his application for funding appears doomed. </I>
<P>
<I>Today, after an hour long meeting, Hamilton mayor Bob Morrow
said both groups will now work together. What role Boris Brott
will play is unclear. Many former musicians feel it was Brott
who started the orchestra's downfall during his final days at
the helm. Today he wasn't talking. </I>
<P>
<I>Musician representative Paula Elliott is cautiously optimistic
about the future of a Hamilton orchestra.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>House Centre Close </H3>

<P>
It was a year ago that Jackie Gordon participated in this demonstration
against Harris government cuts to previously approved non- profit
housing projects. And today, with very little fanfare, the executive
director of the Housing Help Centre for Hamilton Wentworth announced
in a written release that the centre will close August second...
another casualty of cutbacks from Queen's park, which picks up
80-percent of the tab for the HHC's activities. 
<P>
She also says that the centre will re-open at some future date
when and if it finds alternate funding. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Interest rates in Canada are moving lower tomorrow. 
<P>
Canada's major banks will be cutting their prime lending rates
by a quarter of a percentage point to six and a quarter per cent.

<P>
Inco and Southam posted 2nd quarter earnings today. 
<HR>

<H3>Ancaster Livestock </H3>

<P>
A 67 year tradition has come to an end in a part of the Hamilton
Wentworth region that just 20 years ago was mostly farmland. 
<P>
The Ancaster Livestock Exchange has offered up it's last sale
to local farmers who as Jamie West reports tonight will now have
to travel a little further to buy and sell... 
<P>
<I>Monday morning at the Ancaster Livestock Exchange.... farmers
buying and selling livestock... a weekly tradition for 67 years,
and although the cattle don't seem to feel all that sentimental
the farmers do.</I>
<P>
<I>Bob Williams and Bill Walker both lawyers have owned the exchange
for 12 years. They say rapid land development is pushing farms
out of the area.... some farmers have been with the exchange since
day one, friendly people like 81-year old Les Gundy.</I>
<P>
<I>Local farmers will now have to buy and sell at stockyards in
Hagersville, Norwich, Wainfleet or Kitchener.</I>

<H3>Taro Okay</H3>

<P>
A four year battle in Stoney Creek ended this afternoon when a
company called Taro Aggregates was declared the winner. The winner
of an often emotional and bitter struggle with residents to keep
a state of the art landfill operation out of their community.

<P>
The Ministry of Environment and Energy has approved a proposal
by Taro to establish another landfill at Taro's east quarry. That's
off highway 20 in Mud Street, across the road from Taro's west
quarry which reached capacity late last year. 
<P>
The new industrial landfill for solid, non hazardous waste, will
have a capacity of 10-million tonnes. Residents who live near
the site have opposed Taro's proposal, saying a leak in the landfill
would spell disaster for the Niagara escarpment. 
<HR>

<H3>Mt. Hope-Tradeport </H3>

<P>
The deal is done. The documents are signed. Now it's time to get
on with business. Today, Hamilton International Airport officially
passed from municipal control to private hands, as Tradeport International
Corporation took over operations at the airport. 
<P>
By relinquishing control, Hamilton- Wentworth is counting on the
private sector to make the airport the heart of economic activity
in the region by the next century. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>With the kind of fanfare that normally accompanies the signing
of international trade agreements, Hamilton- Wentworth regional
chairman Terry Cooke, and Tradeport president Tony Battaglia signed
the documents that transfer the operation of Hamilton International
Airport from the region to private hands. </I>
<P>
<I>Tradeport has promised to lengthen runways, to entice businesses
to industrial lands around the airport, to expand cargo handling,
and to eventually attract a million passengers a year to Hamilton
International Airport. </I>
<P>
<I>To cap off today's ceremony, Tradeport also unveiled the new
logo that will carry the airport into a new era of privatization.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Ruthven Search </H3>

<P>
From the skies over Mt. Hope to below the waters of Lake Ontario.
The renewed search for a missing pilot and his rented plane in
Lake Ontario came to an abrupt halt last night. During a final
approach of the search area, the sonar unit from the HMCS Cormorant
hit something 8 metres off the lake bottom, disabling the unit.

<P>
Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police had requested assistance from
the ship in their attempt to find 63 year old Bill Ruthven. The
veteran pilot was returning to Hamilton from Brampton when he
disappeared mysteriously in February of 1994. 
<P>
Police are now trying to locate other vessels with side scan sonar
that will be passing through Lake Ontario so they can continue
their search. 
<HR>

<H3>Cormorant Tour </H3>

<P>
The HMCS Cormorant is in Hamilton to help celebrate Aquafest,
the Sesqui-centennial edition. The Canadian navy diving support
ship has been conducting research in the great lakes on everything
from shipwrecks to zebra mussels. 
<P>
The HMCS Cormorant is docked at the foot of Catherine Street and
will be open to public tours all weekend from 2 to 4 in the afternoon,
and 6 to 8 at night. 
<HR>

<H3>Brott Summerfest </H3>

<P>
The jazz festival is not the only musical game in town this weekend.
The Boris Brott Summer Music Festival opens Sunday, with a sold-out
performance by Ancaster pianist Valerie Tryon. 
<P>
This is the festival's ninth season, with thirty-two performances
planned between Sunday and August eighteenth. 
<HR>

<H3>Olympic Well Wishers </H3>

<P>
3.5 billion people around the world will be glued to their TV
sets tonight for the opening of the centennial Olympics in Atlanta.

<P>
Hamilton swimmer Joanne Malar is there, cyclists' Sue Palmer and
Clara Hughes, Burlington runners Graham Hood and Paula Schnurr,
Oakville's Donovan Bailey, gymnast Alan Nolet...the list goes
on. 
<P>
Atlanta is a long way from home, but starting today, anyone can
walk into one of the nineteen Mail Boxes Etc. stores, and fax
a free &quot;good luck&quot; message to our Canadian Olympians
in Atlanta. There are Mail Boxes Etc. centres in Hamilton, Stoney
Creek, Ancaster, Dundas, Waterdown, Burlington, Oakville, Milton
and St. Catharines. 
<HR>

<H3>Seniors Lock-Out </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton mountain seniors home locked out sixty-three health
care aides and service staff today, just as the workers prepared
to vote on what the company calls its final contract offer. 
<P>
Members of local 175 of the United Food and Commercial Workers
picketed outside the Wellington Retirement Community on Upper
Wellington at Stonechurch today. A union spokesman condemns the
lock-out as nothing more than an attempt to intimidate workers
into voting in favour of the contract offer.

<H3>TWA Crash</H3>

<P>
We begin tonight with a brief update on last night's TWA crash
off Long Island New York. We can tell you that rescue workers
have now pulled more than 100 bodies from the waters of the Atlantic.
All were among the 228 people aboard flight the 747 jumbo jet
that exploded into a fireball shortly after take-off. 
<P>
No survivors found, an FBI terrorism team is taking part in the
investigation. 
<HR>

<H3>Ruthven Search </H3>

<P>
And on this side of the border another search will begin tonight
in the waters of Lake Ontario for Bill Ruthven. The 63-year-old
veteran pilot was returned to Hamilton from Brampton in a rented
single-engine piper Cherokee in February of 1994 when he simply
vanished, somewhere near the Burlington Skyway Bridge. 
<P>
His last words described something hitting his windshield. No
sign of a wreckage was ever found. 
<P>
Exactly one year ago the HMCS Cormorant assisted Hamilton- Wentworth
police in the most recent search for any sign of Ruthven or his
plane. It turned up nothing. 
<P>
It's a mystery complicated by theories that he had faked his own
death. Shortly before he disappeared he had been accused of sexually
assaulting a friend's daughter in Muskoka in the early 70's. Bala
OPP even issued a Canada-wide warrant for his arrest. 
<HR>

<H3>Cartworld Reopens </H3>

<P>
Provincial inspectors gave a Mount Hope go-kart track permission
to re-open to the public today. Cartworld has been closed for
the past three days, while inspectors from the Ministry of Consumer
and Commercial Relations investigated a go-kart collision that
killed 26-year-old Dion Desterke of Hamilton. 
<P>
Because the victim was taller than average, inspectors believe
the go-kart's seat belt harness crossed Desterke's upper arms
instead of his shoulders, allowing him to hit the steering wheel
during the collision. 
<P>
Preliminary autopsy results show Desterke died of internal chest
and abdominal injuries. 
<HR>

<H3>Drugs/Guns </H3>

<P>
Two Oakville men face weapons and drug charges after police stopped
a car in Burlington for a traffic offense. In the vehicle, they
found a loaded hand gun, four rifles, a thousand rounds of ammunition
as well as narcotics and drug paraphernalia. 
<P>
25-year-old Nicola Radin faces two weapons charges, while 23-year-old
Ryan Schick is charged with possession of a narcotic. 
<HR>

<H3>Young Thief </H3>

<P>
A 17-year-old Hamilton youth faces several charges in connection
with the theft of a Mercedes. 
<P>
Police in Halton say they spotted the stolen car traveling along
Lakeshore Road in Burlington. They pursued it to a house on Beach
Boulevard in Hamilton into which the driver fled. He later surrendered
to police without incident. 
<HR>

<H3>BB Gun Shots </H3>

<P>
An unusual drive-by shooting on Hamilton mountain last night ...
unusual because the victim didn't know he'd been shot at. 
<P>
A 45 year old man was gardening in his front yard on Mountain
Brow Boulevard when he was hit in the back with a B-B from a passing
truck. He didn't realize what had happened until the truck's driver
came back to apologize. 
<P>
A passenger in the truck, 24 year old Lawrence Assiginack of Hamilton,
faces weapon and assault charges. 
<HR>

<H3>Good Grief </H3>

<P>
It was one of those days. Police near St. Catharines, called in
the canine unit after a wanted man was spotted in an orchard in
Fonthill. 
<P>
A police dog named &quot;Grief&quot; and an officer located the
suspect on a highway Monday night but he fled, and &quot;Grief&quot;
was sent in. Four times Grief clamped his jaws around the suspect's
leg. Four times police moved in to subdue the man. And four times
the 320-pound suspect got up and kept running. 
<P>
Police say the suspect, identified as Larry Pagee, was last seen
running naked through dense bush. 
<HR>

<H3>Orchestra Future? </H3>

<P>
Key players from Hamilton's music scene have been summoned to
a private meeting with top politicians, in order to harmonize
efforts to resurrect an orchestra in the city. 
<P>
Hamilton Mayor Bob Morrow and Hamilton- Wentworth regional chairman
Terry Cooke have scheduled the meeting for Monday morning. And
the invitation list includes musicians from the defunct Hamilton
Philharmonic Orchestra, and two men leading the drive to keep
symphonic music alive. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>The debt-induced death of the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra
last January, galvanized community leaders, who drew up a twelve-step
plan for a musical revival, a plan that called for a million dollars
in the bank, wage concessions from musicians, and zero tolerance
for deficits. Four months later, the vision for the new Hamilton
Orchestra has achieved little substance. </I>
<P>
<I>The task force recommendations came too late for orchestra
boosters to apply for provincial and federal grants. But the man
who conducted the HPO for twenty-one years did meet the deadline,
filing an application for funding for the New Academy Orchestra.
</I>
<P>
<I>Any day now, the Canada council will tell Boris Brott if he
was successful in winning funding for his proposal. If he does,
it's pointless to pursue plans to mount a second orchestra, in
a community that has already failed to support one. But if Brott
is unsuccessful, then the mayor and the regional chairman will
make it clear at Monday's meeting that only compromise, co-operation
and a unified front.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Deadbeats Local </H3>

<P>
The Harris government is stepping up its campaign to insure child
support payments are maintained. In a program aimed at deadbeat
parents...failure to make regular payments will mean driver's
licenses won't be renewed. Alex Reynolds reports. 
<P>
<I>It's one measure in a plan that isn't getting full marks. Ignoring
support payments is costly to the province, as mothers and children
frequently end up on the welfare rolls. </I>
<P>
<I>The family support plan, a mechanism designed to insure obligations
are met, is overloaded because of provincial cutbacks... the case
load is too heavy for the structure. </I>
<P>
<I>Statistics project child-support payments will be $1 billion
in arrears by the winter, thereby placing a greater financial
burden on the province.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Some disappointing 2nd quarter earnings spook investors into selling
stocks today. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar drops below 73 cents U.S. 
<P>
Canada's biggest gold mining company announces a big takeover
today. And Canadians increase their buying of light trucks and
vans in may.

<H3>Heat Crime Units</H3>

<P>
The heat is on in Hamilton- Wentworth and the target: neighbourhood
hang-outs that spawn youth crime. Last night we told you how Ancaster
has imposed a curfew in municipal parks. Tonight, Operation Hangout:
in about 90 minutes from now, police and community groups will
meet in a special session aimed at stemming this escalating problem.

<P>
Twenty parks and malls in Ancaster, Dundas, Waterdown, Glanbrook,
Flamborough and Hamilton mountain have been identified as problem
areas for loitering and disorderly conduct. &quot;Operation Hangout&quot;
will examine alternative places for teens to congregate. 
<P>
And on another front, more than a dozen officers have been assigned
to special heat units, setting up surveillance in hotspot neighborhoods.
For residents of Hamilton- Wentworth, it's all part of a grass-roots
movement to take back their neighborhoods. Annette Hamm tells
us how it works. 
<P>
<I>Constable John Ross is one of several officers giving Hamilton
Wentworth neighborhoods the heat treatment. Heat Units are special
units designed to target crime hot spots. Modeled on a New York
City program, they're designed for officers to focus strictly
on a problem at hand, freeing up other officers for beat duty.
That in turn gets officers on the street talking to residents
about what's wrong with their neighbourhood. </I>
<P>
<I>In Ross' unit, the big focus over the past several weeks has
been prostitution and car theft. On any given night, Constable
Ross tells us a heat unit will recover at least two stolen vehicles.
Most of the time heat unit officers are in plainclothes and unmarked
cars, sometimes they're out walking the streets, trying to stem
a variety of problems. </I>
<P>
<I>The Heat Unit is designed to make residents more at ease, and
if criminals know the special teams may be out there watching,
it's hoped their activity may be deterred.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Stabbing </H3>

<P>
A slashing victim in the Dunsmure and Cope area of Hamilton's
east end, is lucky to be alive, but police say he's not co-operating
with their investigation. 
<P>
Blood dripping from his throat, 45 year old David Birdsell ran
six blocks, refusing help from police or ambulance attendants.
Finally, they were able to get him to hospital, where he's listed
this morning in serious condition. Birdsell told police he was
jumped by people he didn't know, but is supplying very few details.

<HR>

<H3>Purse Snatching </H3>

<P>
And in Halton tonight, police are looking for two men after a
purse-snatching just after midnight in Oakville last night. They're
both black, one is 5 foot-three with a medium build, wearing a
white hat. The other, 5 foot-five, thin, wearing a dark hat and
baggy pants. 
<P>
Two women were approached at the corner of Chisholm and Lakeshore
road. One suspect grabbed a purse and when the women screamed
he kicked one of them and the pair ran off in different directions.
Two citizens tried to help but lost them. 
<HR>

<H3>Pistol Packer </H3>

<P>
A St. Catharines woman obviously couldn't take it anymore. Last
night five teens were standing in the parking lot of a variety
store on Rockwood Avenue, listening to a car stereo. 
<P>
Police say a woman pulled up in an older black car and pointed
a chrome, semi-automatic pistol at them and told them to take
off. They did. Police are looking for the woman, described as
about 30 years old with shoulder length brown hair. 
<HR>

<H3>Mountain Molotov </H3>

<P>
You never know what you might find in your own backyard. Last
night, a Hamilton mountain couple walking through a field behind
their house found a Molotov cocktail. They carried the bottle
back to their house, but bomb technicians moved it away to a safer
area to defuse it. 
<HR>

<H3>Go-cart Update </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton man, killed in a weekend go-kart crash, may have died
because he was taller than average. Investigators from the Ministry
of Consumer and Commercial Relations were back at Cartworld in
Mount Hope today, re-enacting the accident that killed 26-year-old
Dion Desterke. And as Deborah Walker reports, provincial inspectors
have now broadened the scope of their investigation to include
an earlier accident at Cartworld, that seriously injured a Burlington
man. 
<P>
<I>Exactly seven weeks before Dion Desterke died, 26-year-old
Kirk Ryder of Burlington was circling the Cartworld track, when
he was bumped from behind by another driver, just like Dion Desterke
was. Ryder, who still suffers from back and neck injuries, says
he was devastated when he learned someone had died in a similar
accident, in the same spot below the bridge on the Cartworld track.
</I>
<P>
<I>Using a go-kart similar to the one Dion Desterke was driving,
inspectors worked with private consultants and representatives
of the Go-kart Track Association to re-enact the fatal accident.
Although they were initially baffled, inspectors now believe they
know why Desterke died. </I>
<P>
<I>Benn says Cartworld's safety standards are actually higher
than those required by the province. With the investigation nearly
complete, Benn says Cartworld could re-open to the public as early
as tomorrow.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Docs. Update </H3>

<P>
If you're expecting a baby and live in Niagara, let's hope you
already have an obstetrician. Baby doctors there have carried
out their threat to stop accepting new patients July 15th to protest
Ontario government cutbacks. What many thought to be the major
issue -- government subsidies of doctors' malpractice insurance
-- has already been resolved after the province reinstated the
subsidies. 
<P>
But obstetricians are still upset over fee clawbacks. And they
say over the last ten years government cutbacks of one sort or
another have effectively cut their pay by about one third. 
<P>
St. Catharines General Hospital says despite the move, an obstetrician
will be available in emergency situations. 
<HR>

<H3>Simcoe Storm Damage </H3>

<P>
Tobacco farmers north of Simcoe are adding up the damage following
a severe thunder storm. A government adjuster says wind and rain
damage from last night's storm is severe, but no one will lose
a full crop. The storm hit about 30 farms in the area. 
<HR>

<H3>Niag. Airport </H3>

<P>
The Niagara and District Airport will officially change hands
to local authorities on Friday. It's being taken over by a group
called Tradeport International, which represents St. Catharines,
Thorold, Niagara-on-the Lake and Niagara Falls. 
<P>
Ottawa announced two years ago that it wanted to privatize regional
airports.
<HR>

<H3>Downtown Boost </H3>

<P>
The latest bid to boost Hamilton's stagnant downtown core is a
three month trial that will leave you with more money in your
pocket. Free parking is coming to most downtown parking lots on
evenings heading into the weekends. As Jamie West reports tonight
..the city hopes the move will be a positive step in right direction...

<P>
<I>Soon this Hamilton parking lot cash register won't be ringing
at all at least on Thursdays Fridays and all day on Saturdays.
The idea?... instead of putting your money in the meter.... you
can spend it on downtown business.</I>
<P>
<I>The three month free parking trial was agreed to at a Parking
Authority Board meeting yesterday ... and this man will have to
wave a lot harder just to earn a living ... Earl McAusland, general
manager of six privately owned downtown parking lots says he'll
feel the pinch.</I>
<P>
<I>But parking is just a small part of a much bigger issue ...
the experiment will cost the Parking Authority about 200-thousand
dollars in lost revenue, but that will not translate into staff
reductions or layoffs. </I>
<P>
<I>Fourteen lots in the downtown core are affected freeing up
997 parking spaces. Including the Convention Centre and Eaton
Centre Parkade.</I>

<H3>Bailey - Racism</H3>

<P>
Are Canadians racist? That's the question around the office water
coolers and in the coffee shops today. It all began with a line
in a magazine article about Canadian sprinter and Olympic hopeful
Donovan Bailey. Bailey said Canadians are as blatantly racist
as Americans. As Jamie West reports tonight, he is also disappointed
by Canadian's apparent apathy to his sport.
<P>
<I>In an article written by American sports journalist Michael
Farber... Bailey says &quot;people who don't appear to be Canadian,
people of color, don't get the same treatment. They associate
you with your parents birthplace or your birthplace.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Marauder basketball star Keegan Johnson remembers the Ben Johnson
scandal.</I>
<P>
<I>Bailey believes Canadians haven't yet recovered ...as witnessed
by a race at Copps Coliseum last January ...even though the race
was just a twenty minute drive from Bailey's Oakville condo...with
the gold and silver medalists from the world championships running...only
6000 showed up in an arena that holds 18-thousand. </I>
<P>
<I>Michael Farber says &quot;it was if the world's fastest man
were running next door and his neighbors drew the drapes.&quot;
--a big change since 88.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Stelwire </H3>

<P>
As the strike of '46 is remembered, 67 steelworkers in Burlington
are celebrating a new contract. Members of local 8460 have agreed
to a new six-year deal with Stelwire, a subsidiary of Stelco and
Canada's largest producer of steel wire products. 
<HR>

<H3>Joe Brant Chronics </H3>

<P>
Twenty five new jobs will be created at Burlington's Joseph Brant
Memorial Hospital next spring. Patient care attendants are needed
for a new nursing home operating within the hospital. Annette
Hamm tells us the restructuring will fill a need within the hospital
and within the community. 
<P>
<I>Halton region has had a shortage of nursing home beds for several
years. Currently, there are more than 5-hundred people waiting
for placement in a long term care facilities. Within a few months,
about a tenth of those people may be housed at Joseph Brant Memorial
Hospital. </I>
<P>
<I>The hospital is renovating two wards to accommodate 48 nursing
home beds. Hospital nursing homes aren't new in Ontario... Norfolk
General, West Lincoln and Welland Hospitals have had them for
years. Joseph Brant's president and CEO sees it as a trend for
urban hospitals. </I>
<P>
<I>Oakville Memorial is leasing space to a private nursing home
chain. Private or public, the cost of a nursing home room is the
same, set by the Ontario government. A spokesperson for another
private chain says the hospital is to be commended for keeping
Halton nursing home residents close to their families. Pending
provincial approval, the 48 beds should be ready next March.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Greyhound-Add </H3>

<P>
And private enterprise appears prospering in our skies: just a
week after its launch, Greyhound Air has announced a second daily
jet flight out of Mt. Hope Airport. 
<P>
As of today passengers can take an early morning plane in addition
to the early evening flight to five western destinations: Winnipeg,
Calgary Edmonton Kelowna and Vancouver. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Yesterday's big correction in stock markets re-ignited today with
dramatically sharp drops in stock prices. However by the time
markets closed, prices in New York made a recovery while losses
in Toronto moderated. The experts are calling this a healthy correction.
<HR>

<H3>Go-kart Follow</H3>

<P>
Preliminary findings indicate a Hamilton man, killed in a weekend
go-kart accident, died of internal chest and abdominal injuries.

<P>
26-year-old Dion Desterke was bumped by another go-kart, and crashed
into a barrier at Cartworld in Mount Hope on Sunday. Inspectors
from the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations have examined
the Cartworld track and the kart Desterke was driving, to see
if safety problems played any role in his death. 
<P>
The coroner's office will await the results of the government
investigation before deciding if an inquest should be called.

<P>
Cartworld will remain closed until the investigation is completed.

<HR>

<H3>Bank Robbery </H3>

<P>
Police are investigating a noon-hour holdup at a Bank of Nova
Scotia branch in Stoney Creek. A robber walked into the bank on
Barton Street at Green Road, showed a teller what looked like
a handgun, and handed her a note demanding cash. He fled on foot
with the money. 
<P>
The suspect is described as a black male in his thirties, five-foot-six,
with a thin build. He was wearing black sunglasses, a blue baseball
cap, a blue jacket, and a blue nylon track suit. He was last seen
running south on Green Road towards highway eight. 
<HR>

<H3>Ancaster Curfew </H3>

<P>
They're trying to crack down on crime in Ancaster, especially
youth crime... vandalism, a growing problem in the town. U.S.
president Bill Clinton thinks curfews are the answer and now Ancaster
council agrees. Ian Dovey reports. 
<P>
<I>A fire three weeks ago destroyed two thirds of Barbara Smith's
business. The late night blaze behind the Ancaster Bakery was
deliberately set. The same suspected group of young teens struck
again last Friday night. </I>
<P>
<I>Barbara Smith says the vandalism has gone beyond the thrill
of childhood pranks and has turned to fear. Town council agrees
these isolated incidents are beginning to dangerously add up and
has imposed a ten p-m to 6 a-m curfew. A restriction these young
kids scoff at. Even Barbara Smith has doubts about the effectiveness
of a nighttime curfew.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Mystery Woman </H3>

<P>
A mystery woman whose identity has puzzled police since she was
found last night in a remote section of Ancaster has been identified.
Her name won't be released until her family is contacted. The
young woman was discovered ankle deep in mud by hikers along the
rail trail just before dark. She's currently under doctor's care.

<HR>

<H3>Pantless Driver </H3>

<P>
Somewhere in Dundas there's a man driving around without any pants
on ... and police need help finding him. Two women saw the man
driving out of University Plaza early last evening. They told
police he saw them, and smiled as he masturbated in the car. 
<P>
The man was wearing a brown shirt, no pants, and had brown and
grey hair greased back. He was driving a late 1980's maroon Buick
Regal, without licence plates. Anyone with information is asked
to call Crime Stoppers. 
<HR>

<H3>Non-Body St. Kitts </H3>

<P>
Emergency officials in St. Catharines were led on a wild goose
chase today. Firefighters, ambulance crews and police were called
around 8:30 this morning by people seeing what they thought was
a body floating in Twelve Mile Creek. The waterway runs through
the city. 
<P>
It turned out to be a scuba diver taking his own unique tour of
St. Catharines. Even though he entered restricted water near a
Hydro dam, no charges have been laid.

<H3>Cartworld Follow</H3>

<P>
Government inspectors were back on the job today, investigating
a fatal crash at a Hamilton-area go-kart track. Both the coroner's
office, and the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations
are probing the death of 26-year-old Dion Desterke of Hamilton.
He died yesterday after he was forced into a barrier, by a collision
with another go-kart at Cartworld on Highway Six south near Mount
Hope. 
<P>
Despite the tragedy, go-kart operators insist the industry is
safe and well-regulated. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>It's business as usual at Lakeland Go-karts in Hamilton's Confederation
Park. The Firmi family has run this track for thirty-seven years
without serious incident. Lew Firmi says go-carting is safe. Despite
those regulations, the gates at Cartworld near Mount Hope are
locked, opened only to employees and a team of government inspectors
investigating the fatal go-kart collision that killed a Hamilton
man. </I>
<P>
<I>This novice driver recently joined a private club at Cartworld,
and has nothing but praise for its safety standards. Government
inspectors will make their findings public once they've decided
whether driver error of safety infractions caused the Cartworld
crash.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Apt. Fire Fatal </H3>

<P>
Police have now released the name of a Hamilton man killed in
an early morning fire. Firefighters arrived just before five to
find the flames from a burning chesterfield extinguished but the
body of 72-year-old Christopher Leonard in the kitchen area. The
fire marshall is investigating. 
<P>
So far officials say careless smoking is suspected, and the apartment's
smoke detector was not working. It's the region's fifth fire fatality
this year. Damage has been listed at 15 thousand dollars. 
<HR>

<H3>Gulliver's Drowning </H3>

<P>
Deaths by drownings in the golden horseshoe this weekend... in
Flamborough, 26 year old Mohammed Abdul Waheed of Mississauga
drowned at Gulliver's Lake yesterday while trying to save his
younger brother. 
<P>
The 19 year old man was later pulled to safety from an unsupervised
swimming area. And Niagara Region Police are investigating the
death of a man in a swimming pool at a Niagara falls motel. A
man in his 40's was pulled from the pool at the Queen Elizabeth
Motel Saturday afternoon. 
<HR>

<H3>Pool Drowning </H3>

<P>
Niagara Region Police are investigating the death of a man after
a swimming pool accident at a Niagara Falls motel. A man in his
40's was pulled from the pool at the Queen Elizabeth Motel around
4:15 Saturday afternoon. 
<P>
He died yesterday morning at greater Niagara general hospital.
The man's name is being withheld until relatives can be notified.

<HR>

<H3>Niagara Fatal </H3>

<P>
And a Guelph man slipped off the edge of the Niagara escarpment,
plunging to his death in the Niagara gorge Sunday. It all began
when Niagara Parks Police received a complaint from a pair of
tourists who had surprised a suspect during a theft from a car.
The suspect fled the scene but was not pursued. 
<P>
23 year old David Kucman died after falling about 11 metres on
to an Ontario Hydro access road near the Botanical Gardens. 
<HR>

<H3>Cottage Stabbing </H3>

<P>
Three Hamilton men have been charged following a knife fight at
a cottage near Sturgeon Falls that sent five people to hospital.

<P>
Charged with aggravated assault are 21-year-old George Koutsokeris
and 28-year-old Johnny Pantanella. A charge of assault with a
weapon has been laid against 30-year-old Daniel Pantanella. 
<P>
Four men suffered knife wounds in the disturbance, while another
received wounds to the face. OPP haven't said what caused the
disturbance, which broke out early yesterday. 
<HR>

<H3>Domestic Stab </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton woman is in hospital after being terrorized by her
boyfriend for two days. Police say the woman has been treated
for non life threatening stab wounds. 
<P>
40 year old Charles Martin of Hamilton is charged with assault
with a weapon and two counts of assault threaten death. 
<HR>

<H3>Restaurant Rob </H3>

<P>
A quick take out at a Hamilton restaurant has netted a suspect
one wallet and a diamond ring. Police say he grabbed the goods
off a man as he walked into the Del Mar Restaurant. The restaurant
is just a few steps away from the Hamilton Wentworth central police
station. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First</H3>

<P>
A massive stock market correction sent stock prices on a nose-dive.
Most of the selloff was fueled by disappointing earnings results
among technology companies. 
<P>
Despite the falling stock prices, TD Bank released an upbeat prediction
on Canada's economy.

<H3>Niagara Response </H3>

<P>
An Ontario court judge has handed down a scathing indictment of
the police forces who investigated the Paul Bernardo case. 
<P>
Mr. Justice Archie Campbell says the system failed and because
of that, a rapist slipped through their fingers and went on to
commit murder. 
<HR>

<H3>Bevan Reaction </H3>

<P>
The chiefs of police in Niagara, Halton and metro Toronto are
not talking tonight but they have issued a joint statement. They
say Campbell's recommendations will improve the way in which police
services manage complicated investigations, that they will take
steps to prevent a recurrence of systemic or specific errors identified
in Campbell's report. But they are asking for more time to go
through the document. 
<HR>

<H3>Rolider Inquiry </H3>

<P>
And now the latest on a call for another inquiry. Chedoke-McMaster
Hospital is holding out an olive branch to families who say their
children were abused by the staff of a controversial brain injury
clinic. But those same families do not appear anxious to accept
the peace offering. Scot Urquhart has more on that story: 
<P>
<I>Chedoke McMaster says, it's just trying to clear the air. The
Martins, John and Diana, along with Wendy Littlejohn, have accused
the hospital of turning a blind eye to alleged abuse ... carried
out by Amos Rolider; the director of the Chedoke McMaster Centre
for Behavioral Rehabilitation, in 1991. </I>
<P>
<I>In light of the controversy, the hospital says it will appoint
an independent investigator to conduct an external review of patient
records during the Rolider years, of 1989 to 1993. The hospital
has already had one such review. It was called &quot;The Wood
Report&quot;. It was conducted by Dr. Roger Wood early in 1994,
soon after Rolider left the hospital. The original draft of the
report was so harshly critical of Rolider, and his methods, that
horrified hospital officials asked Dr. Wood to re-write his report
and tone it down.  But Cynthia Janzen insists, that comparing
the Wood Report to the review they are now proposing would be
apples and oranges.</I>
<P>
<I>Indeed, nine months after his signature appeared on the revised
edition of the Wood Report, hospital vice president Jay Graydon
had this to say about Amos Rolider.</I>
<P>
<I>And so the Littlejohns and Martins will press their demands
for a full public inquiry into the Rolider affair.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Ecstasy Bust </H3>

<P>
It's called ecstacy and it's a drug that's hitting it big with
young people across southern Ontario. But a raid last night at
a home in Stoney Creek has put a big dent in the supply. 
<P>
Drug officers from Halton and Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police
have made what could be the biggest bust yet of ecstacy in southern
Ontario. The two men who live in the house, 40 year old Anthony
Williams and 28 year old Robert Williams face a number of drug
and weapons charges. 
<P>
Police estimate the street value of their haul to be worth 150-thousand
dollars. 
<HR>

<H3>Girl Hit </H3>

<P>
Some serious motor vehicle accidents over the past 24 hours...
police investigating one in which a 12 year old girl was hit by
a car on Hamilton mountain last night. She is recovering from
severe head injuries. 
<P>
Police say the girl was playing ball on East 24th street when
she was struck. 
<HR>

<H3>Creek Crash </H3>

<P>
Investigators also looking into a two car crash on Stoney Creek
mountain that sent a young man to hospital with severe head and
chest injuries. The 23 year old is listed in serious condition.

<P>
It happened around midnight when a car ran a stop sign hitting
an oncoming vehicle. 
<HR>

<H3>Farm Accident </H3>

<P>
And a Beamsville farmer has died of his injuries after being thrown
from his tractor when it left Tufford road yesterday and struck
a culvert. A passing motorist found 83 year-old Amedeo Dionis
and took him to hospital. 
<P>
Police believe he suffered an asthma attack. 
<HR>

<H3>Shed Arson </H3>

<P>
Another fire bug at work in downtown Hamilton. Overnight someone
set fire to a shed on Birge Street by lighting a gasoline trail
from a fence to the shed. damage is estimated at about 5-thousand
dollars. 
<HR>

<H3>Cuba Crisis </H3>

<P>
A U.S. government decision to ban executives of a Toronto mining
company with dealing in Cuba has some golden horseshoe businesses
nervous. Sherritt International says it will stay in Cuba and
foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy says he wouldn't be surprised
if Canadians boycott the U.S. over its anti-Cuba measures. Ian
Dovey reports. 
<P>
<I>With the blacklisting of Sherritt International Corporation,
Canadian companies doing business in Cuba are looking over their
shoulders. </I>
<P>
<I>Ron Foxcroft of Fluke Transport and the manufacturer of the
Fox 40 whistle does business with the Cubans. Following up on
a threat Washington has impose sanctions on the executives, shareholders
and families of Sherritt International of Toronto, for mining
confiscated American property in Cuba. </I>
<P>
<I>Ottawa says the U.S. action is outrageous. </I>
<P>
<I>Hotz Recycling of Hamilton deals directly with the Cubans.
For five years Hotz has been selling recycled paints to Havana.
Despite the Helms Burton Act and harassing calls from Miami based
anti Castro groups, a Hotz executive says it will live up to its
contract with the Cubans. </I>
<P>
<I>Foxcroft, on the other hand doesn't want to upset uncle Sam,
but at the same time fears Canadian retaliatory action. What action,
if any the Canadian government takes remains to be seen. But what
is known is that the Helms-Burton legislation is far reaching,
beyond trade. Case in point, last month's Hamilton international
airshow. One week before the event, the Americans pulled 13 exhibits
because of Canada's trade relations with Fidel Castro.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Carters Honeymoon </H3>

<P>
Niagara Falls has always served as a magnet for romantics. And
it appears former U.S. presidents are not immune to its attraction.

<P>
One-time U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn decided
to celebrate their fiftieth wedding anniversary in the honeymoon
capital. While there, they did what most tourist do. They took
a ride on the maid of the mist, ventured into the rock tunnels
behind the falls, and visited nearby Niagara-on-the-Lake. 
<P>
The city of Niagara Falls even issued the Carters an official
honeymoon certificate. No word on whether there was a heart-shaped
tub in their hotel suite. 
<HR>

<H3>Sesqui Super Home </H3>

<P>
And finally it's being built as part of Hamilton's 150th birthday
celebrations, and it's guaranteed to remain a modern marvel even
by the time the city turns 200. Today, business and community
leaders signed the cornerstone of Hamilton's sesquicentennial
super home on Upper Paradise Road, near Rymal. 
<P>
More than eighty Hamilton-area businesses have co-operated in
the construction of a state-of-the-art home, that will be raffled
off in a lottery later this summer. The Sesqui Super Home Lottery
will benefit numerous charities, including Hamilton's four hospitals.

<H3>Bernardo - Campbell Report</H3>

<P>
The long awaited Campbell report will be released tomorrow ..
it is the government's examination of the handling of the Paul
Bernardo murder investigation... and it is touted to be a document
that will name names and change the way murder investigations
are conducted all across North America. We will have extensive
coverage of the story throughout the day tomorrow.
<HR>

<H3>Rolider Petition</H3>

<P>
A new development tonight in the story we brought you yesterday
about allegations of abuse of brain injured patients at Chedoke
- McMaster Hospital. The call for a public inquiry over a so-called
aversive therapy program gained momentum today, as parents of
these patients brought their plea forward, to the public. 
<P>
John and Diana Martin claim their son, Robby Thompson, was abused
by Amos Rolider; the man who headed the Chedoke - McMaster program
from 1989, to 1991. They went public with their case because they
say; they couldn't get satisfaction from the hospital. Scot Urquhart
has more: 
<P>
<I>John Martin was stoic... as his son Robby Thompson, screamed
in pain. Robby's mother couldn't bear it. Robby received this
treatment as a patient of the Chedoke - McMaster brain injury
program in 1991. The Martins are taking aim at the hospital, with
a definite agenda in mind.</I>
<P>
<I>Former crown attorney Tony Skarica is now a Tory MPP.  But
John Martin has no faith left, in the hospital, or the system.
</I>
<P>
<I>A provincially appointed body known as PABIAC and headed by
Chedoke - McMaster staffers ... is currently working on a package
of standards for the province. At the moment, they are leaning
toward a system of voluntary compliance, voluntary reporting,
and voluntary inspections.</I> 
<P>
And, in the last hour, Chedoke McMaster Hospital announced that
it will initiate an independent third party review of all patient
records from the behavioral brain injury program, from 1989 to
1993. The hospital says it will announce the independent body
appointed to conduct the review; within the next few days. 
<P>
Hospital spokesperson Cynthia Janzen says the hospital believes
that it has been open and accountable all the way along, and they
intend to share the results of the review with the public, when
they become available. 
<HR>

<H3>Cop Charged </H3>

<P>
A metro Toronto police officer was arrested this morning over
a domestic dispute in Burlington last month. The 30-year-old man
whose name is not being released to protect the identity of the
victim was released but is due to appear in court July 31st. 
<HR>

<H3>Lottery Fraud </H3>

<P>
Dreams of winning the big one have netted a Dunnville man with
a fraud charge. Police say over the period of a week, the suspect
purchased 85-thousand dollars worth of &quot;Keno&quot; and &quot;Lotto
649&quot; tickets with NSF cheques. 
<P>
All of the purchases were made at a Target Food store on Hamilton
mountain. 33 year old John Horton of Dunnville is charged with
fraud over five-thousand dollars. 
<HR>

<H3>Skinny Robber</H3>

<P>
A tall, skinny bandit with long blond hair has had a busy week
so far in Hamilton. Last night within an hour police believe the
same suspect robbed a 2-for-1 Pizzeria on Hamilton mountain and
the Journey's Inn in Stoney Creek. 
<P>
On Monday night, it's believed the same guy hit a variety store
in downtown Hamilton. In all three cases, he produced a handgun
and made off with a small amount of cash. 
<HR>

<H3>Canine-Marine </H3>

<P>
They've had an informal agreement for years to help each other
out. But now officers from both Halton and Hamilton Wentworth
regions are on the same team. The police services have announced
a formal amalgamation effective immediately. Annette Hamm tells
us what that means for residents in both regions. 
<P>
<I>Halton region's lone police canine unit is about to get some
neighbourhood backup. Hamilton Wentworth's four canine teams will
join forces with Halton as part of a formal amalgamation. The
dog deal means Halton will have more units on duty, and Hamilton
Wentworth will save on the cost of training a new dog. </I>
<P>
<I>There are also savings on board for both police services marine
units. Halton Regional Police will also add their polygraph services
to sweeten the pot. Up until this deal, Hamilton Wentworth has
had to borrow a lie detector. </I>
<P>
<I>Both police services will record the costs of all three joint
programs, and split them at the end of the year. Although a savings
is expected, there's no firm figure attached yet. </I>
<P>
<I>Halton and Hamilton Wentworth are also looking at joining their
emergency response units, bomb squads and major crime units.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Niagara Safety </H3>

<P>
Niagara Region Police are appealing to motorists, cyclists and
pedestrians to be more careful. At this time last year the number
of traffic fatalities in the region was eight. So far this year
13 people have died on Niagara's roads. 
<P>
Police Chief Grant Waddell says lack of judgment, excessive speed
and alcohol have all been contributing factors. 
<HR>

<H3>Food Banks </H3>

<P>
Effects of last October's Harris government spending cuts are
now being analyzed. And in Hamilton- Wentworth it meant more people
turned to the food banks. 
<P>
Jackie Gordon of the Housing Help Centre says the number of families
in Hamilton- Wentworth relying on emergency food programs jumped
more than 37 per cent from September to November of last year.

<HR>

<H3>Casting Jobs </H3>

<P>
Things could be looking up now though: at least one local company
is actually creating jobs. Booming auto-parts sales are driving
Amcan Castings to generate up to 50 jobs in the Hamilton- Burlington
area. 
<P>
The Burlington-based subsidiary of Tritech Precision of Toronto
has been hiring over the past two years and vice president Kris
Nowers says it will continue to do so to catch up on a 500-million
dollar backlog. 
<HR>

<H3>Kwiklynx </H3>

<P>
And from car parts to computer parts, the latest Internet technology
came to Hamilton this afternoon. Weslink Datalink, through a consortium
of Hamilton cable companies, unveiled it's new Kwiklynx to patrons
at the Bean Bar restaurant. 
<P>
With speeds 100 times faster than current modems, Kwiklynx will
make full motion, like Channel 11 News updates and animation,
like Disney movie previews, feasible on the Internet. 
<P>
Kwiklynx is currently being tested in field trials with selected
homes, businesses and libraries. 
<HR>

<H3>Wine Shortage </H3>

<P>
A grape shortage in Ontario's Niagara region may leave European
wine connoisseurs with few opportunities to sample the province's
vintages. Four consecutive wet and cool springs have produced
below-average grape harvests. 
<P>
Wine makers are scrambling to find enough grapes to meet the growing
demand for and meanwhile Niagara strawberry growers continue to
cash in on the American berry scare.

<H3>Rolider Update</H3>

<P>
We begin tonight with an update on a disturbing story that we
first brought you 16 months ago. It is a story of pain, and denial.

<P>
The pain, was inflicted upon brain injured patients at Chedoke
McMaster Hospital, between 1989 ... and 1993 ... in the name of
treatment. 
<P>
The denial; comes from hospital officials who refuse to acknowledge
any impropriety. Scot Urquhart has the latest on this story and
we warn you that the pictures you are about to see may bother
sensitive viewers. 
<P>
<I>What exactly happened here between 1989, and 1993? That is
the question posed by a petition, calling for a public inquiry
into the operation of the Centre for Behavioral Rehabilitation
during the tenure of Amos Rolider. </I>
<P>
<I>Wentworth North MPP Tony Skarica says, he will take the petition
to Queen's Park and promises to get to the bottom of things.</I>
<P>
<I>So just what are these disturbing allegations? Families of
former patients say, their brain-injured children were abused
by Rolider and his staff.</I>
<P>
<I>The young man in the chair is Robby Thompson ... a patient
with a brain injury. He was in Rolider's care back in 1991. The
procedure is called aversive therapy and was supported by the
hospital at the time. Although the techniques are not used in
the brain injury program now, Chedoke-McMaster has never made
any apologies concerning their prior practices. In fact they have
been so reluctant to do so, a Hamilton alderman quoted in stories
by Christine Hahn of the Hamilton Mountain News ... has accused
them of covering up the abuse.</I>
<P>
<I>But is the hospital responsible? Yes; according to doctor Allan
Hopewell ... an internationally renowned expert, on brain injury
treatment.  In fact, Doctor Hopewell says that Rolider was grossly
underqualified for the position he held, as head of the rehab
clinic.  Hopewell says the infliction of pain does nothing to
help; but simply terrorizes patients into compliance.  </I>
<P>
<I>None of these allegations are new. Channel Eleven broke the
story 16 months ago. What is new, is the call for a public inquiry.
What do Chedoke officials say now? Councilor D'amico says, he
too will support a call for a public inquiry; and he is also calling
on former patients and their families to come forward.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Breast Cancer Clinic </H3>

<P>
Hamilton will become home to Canada's second one-stop breast health
centre. A facility where women suffering breast cancer will find
all of expertise and support they need. As Lauran Sabourin reports
this facility will become a reality in part because of a million
dollar fundraising effort by the Junior League of Hamilton Burlington.

<P>
<I>The centre will provide everything from surgery to support
groups for women diagnosed with breast cancer. All of the necessary
services under one roof. </I>
<P>
<I>The Junior League is making a commitment to raise more than
a million dollars for cancer detection equipment. And for what
cancer specialists call a healing garden. A place where medicinal
herbs will be grown. A hospital garden where cancer patients can
go to have peace of mind. To feel better. </I>
<P>
<I>Adele Chetec knows the anguish of being diagnosed with cancer.
Two months ago Adele was told that she had breast cancer. Weeks
of chemotherapy has temporary robbed Adele of her hair. </I>
<P>
<I>A naturally optimistic person Adele finds solace in positive
attitude visual therapy. In talking to other women who are going
through the same thing. And she's hopeful that support groups
that will be more readily available at Hamilton's Breast Health
Centre will help other breast cancer victims through this traumatic
time.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Youth Charged </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton youth has been charged with lighting up a school. Police
say an incendiary device was thrown through a window at Cardinal
Heights School on Bobolink Road July 1st. The resulting fire caused
100-thousand dollars in damage. 
<HR>

<H3>Seniors Sick </H3>

<P>
A mysterious respiratory illness has struck a nursing home in
Welland. The 23 residents at Sunset Haven have been moved into
the gym while the seniors home is given a thorough cleaning. The
virus may be linked to birds nesting in the attic. 
<P>
An official of the region's seniors department says the move is
a precautionary measure. 
<HR>

<H3>Housing Starts </H3>

<P>
More signs of consumer confidence showing up in the latest figures
from Canada Mortgage and Housing. 
<P>
Housing starts in Hamilton were up in June with 272 housing starts
compared to only 102 starts in June of 95. 
<P>
Year to year housing construction figures remain virtually the
same. However a CMHC spokesperson says with constant mortgage
rates predicted throughout the summer, home construction should
remain strong over the coming months. 
<HR>

<H3>No Smoking Response </H3>

<P>
The air is clearing. The first domino has now fallen in Waterloo
Region's race to ban butts from bars and restaurants. Waterloo
city councilors have the become the first to approve the region's
new smoking bylaw, which would prohibit smoking in food courts
and malls, then restaurants and bars by the year 2-thousand. 
<P>
In light of this decision, and the uproar over Toronto's smoking
ban still burning, Hamilton Wentworth is taking a slower approach.
Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>It was an experiment that could turn into a lifestyle change.
Seventeen restaurants in Hamilton Wentworth voluntarily banned
smoking for one day in June. The region's Public Health Department
says 70 per cent of those volunteers report no negative economic
impact. </I>
<P>
<I>The owner of this &quot;Just Desserts&quot; franchise in west
Hamilton didn't lose money that day because she only imposed the
ban until 6 PM, when the majority of her customers are non smoking
anyway. A permanent ban she says could slice profits by 25 per
cent. </I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Chagall's&quot; restaurant at the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel
also imposed the smoking ban until 6 PM during the experiment,
but the food and beverage manager feels a permanent ban shouldn't
be a government decision.</I>

<H3>Greyhound Launch </H3>

<P>
Canada's airline industry has officially gone to the dogs. A new
experiment in integrated travel began this morning ads the country's
newest airline, Greyhound Air, took wing. 
<P>
Greyhound plans to base its eastern operations right here at Hamilton's
Mt. Hope Airport. Its inaugural flight takes off for Winnipeg
and Vancouver at 7:20 tonight. 
<HR>

<H3>Traffic Lights </H3>

<P>
Back on the ground, what does it take to stop traffic? Just ask
a group of residents on Hamilton mountain. They've successfully
lobbied Hamilton Wentworth councilors to change their mind over
the placement of a traffic light, at a cost of several thousand
dollars. Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>Traffic engineers tell us they work a fine balance between
what's best for pedestrians and what's best for drivers. This
time, the scale tipped to favour pedestrians. </I>
<P>
<I>Joan McGraw had some weight behind making the change here on
Hamilton mountain's Fennell Avenue. Gathering names in her neighbourhood,
she's convinced Hamilton Wentworth's Transportation Services Committee
to move a light one block east to accommodate school kids. The
move comes with a hefty price tag. </I>
<P>
<I>While a new traffic light may pacify some pedestrians, many
drivers we spoke with wonder if it's really necessary. </I>
<P>
<I>Traffic engineers say new signs or lights usually stem from
complaints. But they don't want to stop traffic at every block,
for fear of sending angry drivers away from main arteries and
onto secondary streets. </I>
<P>
<I>If Hamilton Wentworth council approves changing the light at
the centre of this dispute, it could take a couple of weeks before
the move is officially made.</I> 
<P>
Hamilton Wentworth regional council will vote on moving the Fennell
avenue traffic light on July 16th. 
<HR>

<H3>Wheelchair Busses </H3>

<P>
Come September, people in wheelchairs may become free passengers
aboard the Hamilton Street Railway. The HSR has introduced one
of 25 new accessible low floor buses into its fleet. 
<P>
The &quot;Alf&quot; buses are designed to supplement, not replace
the current disabled and aged regional transport system. Starting
September first, every other bus on the city's four busiest routes
... the King, Barton, Upper Wentworth and Upper Wellington, will
be wheelchair accessible. 
<P>
In a proposal to Hamilton city council, the HSR is recommending
wheelchair passengers and their escorts board the buses for free.
The HSR will be introducing 25 such busses each year for the next
three years. 
<HR>

<H3>Victoria Crash </H3>

<P>
Three people are in hospital tonight, after a two vehicle crash
in downtown Hamilton. A man standing at the corner of King William
and Victoria was hit after two cars collided in the intersection.
He and both female drivers of the cars are being treated for non-life
threatening injuries. One of the drivers has been charged with
failing to stop for a red light. 
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Fall </H3>

<P>
A 13-year-old Niagara Falls girl is in hospital with broken bones
after falling from a third-floor balcony. 
<P>
Police say Amanda Lawrence was trying to climb from one balcony
to another yesterday morning when she slipped and fell about eight
metres to the ground. The teen suffered two broken wrists and
minor facial and leg abrasions. Lawrence had successfully made
the dangerous climb several times in the past. 
<HR>

<H3>Mtn. Heroes </H3>

<P>
Two men with a keen eye on their Hamilton mountain neighbourhood
are being commended by police for their actions this weekend.

<P>
On Saturday, they spotted three suspects trying to break into
a house on their block... a house the pair knew was empty because
the owners were on holidays. They managed to tackle one of the
suspects, and held him until police arrived. 
<P>
19 year old Michael Belmont of Hamilton is charged with attempted
break and enter. 
<HR>

<H3>Most Wanted </H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police are asking the public to help
them find a man wanted on a string of charges, including criminal
harassment, forcible confinement, making death threats, and assault
causing bodily harm. 
<P>
34-year-old Harry James Staats is this month's most wanted man.
He is white, five-foot-eleven, weighs 173 pounds, and has green
eyes, a moustache and shoulder-length brown hair. Staats wears
an earring, and has a tattoo of skulls on his upper right arm.

<P>
The charges stem from an incident in March, when a woman on James
Street North in Hamilton was choked, threatened and forcibly confined.
Anyone with information on Staat's whereabouts is urged to call
Crime Stoppers at 522-8477. 
<HR>

<H3>Hydrofoil Launch </H3>

<P>
Finally tonight, the &quot;Sunrise Six&quot; is headed south.
The refurbished hydrofoil was officially launched in St. Catharines
today after spending the last three years in dry-dock and will
make its new home along the Detroit river. 
<P>
Its operator, the Mississauga based Jackpot Express Lines is hoping
the gamble will pay off . The 20-tonne, 68-passenger vessel along
with its sister ship will ferry people between Windsor and Detroit
in hopes of cashing in on customers of the Windsor casino.

<H3>Hamilton Poverty </H3>

<P>
Montreal is home to a lot of poor people. A national survey indicates
that 22 percent of Montreal's population lives below the poverty
line. Hamilton was about half way down the list of 25 cities surveyed
with 15 percent of the population considered poor. As Dwight Ryan
reports, the outlook for the future of the poor isn't very bright.

<P>
<I>Kathy Bass is considered poor. The mother of three receives
nearly $1600 a month in government cheques, but rent and utilities
consume nearly 1200 of that. She's not alone. </I>
<P>
<I>The Canadian Council on Social Development says 15 percent
of the Hamilton population lives below the poverty line. Kathy
Bass fears for her daughter Casey's future. </I>
<P>
<I>At Family Services of Hamilton Wentworth, counselor Mary Mills
says the nation's poor need to be educated. With fewer government
dollars available, agencies like the Northend Children's Centre
find it more and more difficult to help those in need. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Medical Reform </H3>

<P>
Promised reforms to Ontario's medical system have been put on
hold, again. Health minister Jim Wilson says, the long awaited
package has been held up, while the government makes a decision
on new fees for proposed pilot projects. 
<P>
The reform package was supposed to be unveiled in April ... but
the announcement has now been put off until the middle of July.

<P>
Although no definite details of the plan have yet been released;
at least one group is already taking shots at the package. The
medical reform group says the government plan is little more than
window dressing; designed to appease the OMA. 
<HR>

<H3>Butt Out </H3>

<P>
The city of Hamilton has decided not to pursue an apology from
the Toronto Sun over a cartoon depicting east Hamiltonians as
&quot;buttheads.&quot; 
<P>
The cartoon appeared in last Wednesday's edition, two days after
constituents in the east Hamilton riding re-elected Sheila Copps
to parliament. The cartoonist responsible, Andy Donato says it
was a comment on those who voted for Sheila Copps in a recent
by-election. Ian Dovey reports. 
<P>
<I>Councilor Chad Collins brought the motion forward demanding
an apology from the Toronto Sun for this cartoon portraying residents
of east Hamilton as butt heads. But not many heeded call. A bummed
out Chad Collins sat and listened. </I>
<P>
<I>Geraldine Copps whose daughter Sheila prompted the cartoon
opted to sit this one out. Taking it all in was a Toronto Sun
reporter. </I>
<P>
<I>Council defeated the motion demanding an apology and or an
investigation by the Ontario Press Council. Collins says he just
wanted to stand up to the Toronto media for its Hamilton bashing.
</I>
<P>
<I>In the end city council voted to butt out, turn the other cheek
if you will perhaps avoiding bigger stink. </I>
<HR>

<H3>QEW Crash </H3>

<P>
It was a spectacular accident, but the OPP say, the driver of
the car that rolled over on the QEW near Burlington Street this
morning, was not seriously injured. 
<P>
Police are still investigating the cause of the single car crash;
and have not made a decision about possible charges in the case.
While injuries and damages may have been minor ... the accident
caused major headaches, for morning drivers. 
<HR>

<H3>Blind Disposal </H3>

<P>
In response to Health Canada's warning regarding plastic PVC mini
blinds and the possible dangers associated with exposure to the
lead content, the region of Hamilton Wentworth is recommending
the blinds be taken back to the place of purchase or; take them
to one of three regional transfer stations beginning no later
than July first. 
<P>
The region's solid waste stations are open from eight in the morning
to 6 p-m Monday to Saturday. Residents of Hamilton Wentworth are
being asked not to dispose of polyvinyl chloride mini blinds with
their regular household garbage. 
<P>
Health Canada has set up a toll-free hotline for those concerned
with disposal or questions about the blinds. The number is 1-800-693-3131.

<HR>

<H3>Mother Mourns </H3>

<P>
The mother of four children who died in a fire in their Kitchener
home blames herself for not being able to rescue them. 
<P>
Leanne Dombroskie says &quot;I hate myself when I think about
it because I'm their mother. I'm supposed to protect them.&quot;

<P>
Eight-year-old Angela Dombroskie, four-year-old David Dombroskie,
four-year-old Jamie Burns and two-year-old Devin Burns died June
11th. Leanne Dombroskie says her fatal mistake was misjudging
the ferocity of the fire and how quickly it would spread.
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Strike </H3>

<P>
A strike by 146 members of the United Steelworkers' local 4151
against Washington Mills Electro Minerals has started after rejection
of the company's offer of a 3.5-per-cent wage-and-benefit increase
over two years. 
<P>
The union, representing both production and office-and-technical
employees, says the overwhelming rejection was also based on proposed
changes in the company's hiring practice and over-use of temporary
help. 
<P>
The company makes crude abrasives for use on sand paper, grinding
wheels and other applications. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
A renewed fear that interest rates might rise soon, contributed
to a selloff of stocks in New York and Toronto today. 
<P>
Interest yields on Canadian government bonds edged lower. 
<P>
Economists at Scotiabank are forecasting higher interest rates
later this year.

<H3>Hamilton Teachers</H3>

<P>
The Hamilton Board of Education is faced with trimming millions
from its 1996 budget. Much of the money will have to come from
contract talks with eleven bargaining units. 
<P>
Elementary teachers will go back to the bargaining table tomorrow,
but high school talks remain at an impasse. Dwight Ryan reports
tonight that the province has appointed a fact-finder in an attempt
to get those negotiations underway. 
<P>
<I>For school boards across Ontario, times are tough. Transfer
payments from Queen's Park have been slashed since the Tories
took power a year ago. </I>
<P>
<I>In Hamilton, board of education trustees have come up with
a budget that includes more than 11 million dollars in reductions.
And they say five million will come from contract negotiations.
A plan to chop 72 jobs from elementary schools has been put aside..
at least for the time being. Library services, design and technology,
guidance and family studies programs would be trimmed and the
jobs would be lost. But both sides will return to the bargaining
table Wednesday. </I>
<P>
<I>Board trustee and negotiator Ray Mulholland says the high school
teachers must realize that the pie is now much smaller. That the
amount of money available is smaller. The high school teachers
meanwhile, have charged the board with bad faith bargaining. </I>
<P>
<I>Ray Mulholland says the teachers and the board together are
like a family.. and that right now the family is in dispute. He's
optimistic the dispute will be resolved before school returns
in September. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Tobacco Control </H3>

<P>
The use of tobacco by adults is declining, but young people are
picking up the habit in increasing numbers. Attempting to put
the brakes on the problem, alarmed Hamilton Wentworth public health
officials today unveiled a tobacco prevention program. Alex Reynolds
reports. 
<P>
<I>The campaign is aimed at retailers who defy the tobacco control
act and continue to sell smokes to minors. A concentrated five
week blitz, beginning July 1st, includes bus ads, print, radio
and television announcements. </I>
<P>
<I>However, the good news has turned to bad. Regional public health
department staff conduct compliance surveys in which an adult
chaperone and a visibly underage minor visit random retail establishments
that sell tobacco. We tagged along as 15-year-old Nicole shopped
for cigarettes. The clerk claimed Nicole looked over 19, while
the manager told us store policy forbids sales to minors. Across
the street, Nicole was questioned about her age. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Missing Dad </H3>

<P>
Hamilton police are asking for the public's help in finding a
missing east end resident. Police say 33 year old Stephen Kelly
dropped his children off at school yesterday morning and failed
to show up for work. His car was found locked at the Centre Mall.

<P>
Police say Kelly was depressed over personal problems. Anyone
with information should call detectives at 546-2957. 
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Body ID </H3>

<P>
Police have identified a body found in the Niagara River near
Fort Erie as that of 35-year-old Jose Defrias Junior. 
<P>
Defrias had been missing since June 17th when he decided to go
for a swim while fishing with family and friends. He dove off
a nearby bridge and never resurfaced. His body was discovered
yesterday afternoon by a fisherman. 
<HR>

<H3>Hire A Student </H3>

<P>
It was a party atmosphere this noon hour at Burlington's Civic
Square. The Canada Employment Centre for Students held a free
barbecue for Burlington business people to draw attention to the
services they provide during hire a student week. 
<P>
Unemployed students also provided a fashion show hoping to grab
the attention of potential employers. And the Student Employment
Centre will provide a free car wash tomorrow at the Canadian Tire
store at Fairview and Cumberland in Burlington. 
<HR>

<H3>Macdonald Westcom </H3>

<P>
News from the executive offices here at CHCH. Channel 11 President
and C.E.O., Jim Macdonald has been named President of Westcom
TV Group - the entire television division of our parent company
WIC Western International Communications. 
<P>
Jim takes over for Donald Smith who is retiring after 45 years
of outstanding service in broadcasting. Jim will also stay on
here at CHCH. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Not much change in stock prices today but the interest yield on
Canadian government bonds moved lower again. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened to its highest level in two months.

<P>
Dofasco's joint-venture mini mill in Kentucky is facing pollution
charges.

<H3>Fruit Fatal </H3>

<P>
A freak farm accident has claimed the life of a young Greensville
boy. At about two thirty this afternoon a three year old boy was
crushed when a table fell on top him. The table was located inside
a roadside fruit stand on a family farm at the intersection of
Sydenham and Fallsview roads. 
<P>
According to the police the young lad was playing around the table
and accidentally pulled it over on top of himself. The boy was
taken to Chedoke-McMaster hospitals were he was pronounced dead.

<H3>Ham. East Follow</H3>

<P>
Sheila Copps is on her way back to Ottawa tonight after kicking
butt in Hamilton East. The reborn MP for Hamilton East has been
invited to attend the weekly Liberal caucus meeting tomorrow where
she could be re-appointed to the Jean Chretien cabinet. 
<P>
Copps, who has represented Hamilton East riding for 12 years,
took more than 12-thousand votes in last night's by-election.
That's nearly twice the number of her nearest rival, NDP candidate
Wayne Marston. The Reform Party came in fourth after the Tories.
Scot Urquhart reports. 
<P>
<I>It was over in a hurry: less than 40 minutes after the polls
closed; Sheila Copps knew she was going back to Ottawa. </I>
<P>
<I>In her victory speech, the master politician knew exactly what
to do... accused of breaking promises; she sounded properly chastised:
she hit all the right notes: and she allowed herself to gloat,
just a little.</I>
<P>
<I>Even though she won by a two to one margin ... Copps majority
was considerably reduced from the last general election. NDP candidate
Wayne Marston for example got nearly four times the number of
votes, and NDP leader Alexa Mcdonough says, that should give Jean
Chretien pause to think.</I>
<P>
<I>But according to Copps, that is exactly what it means: and
with a phone call from the prime minister only moments after the
polls closed; it is likely that Copps will be leading the harmonization
fight; from cabinet.</I>
<P>
<I>Copps took the biggest gamble a politician can take ... and
won handily: but having survived this, Copps cachet in Ottawa
will be virtually, unmatched. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Two Year Old Drowns </H3>

The mother of a murdered two year old St. Catharines boy has broken
her silence. Last month, Timothy Jackson's lifeless body was found
inside the home he shared with his father. His mother Laura Jackson
had given custody of Timothy to his father two months before.

<P>
Paul Dunn is still behind bars charged with the baby's murder.
As Lauran Sabourin reports Laura Jackson wants to answer accusations
that she didn't care about her baby's welfare. 
<P>
<I>The evening of May 24th. Police and paramedics were called
to 18 Oakdale Avenue where the saw the lifeless body of two year
old Timothy Jackson. Laura Jackson is Timothy's mother. </I>
<P>
<I>She had given temporary custody of timothy to his father. Two
and half months later the child was dead. Those who saw him say
they were shocked. He had cigarette burns on his body. Razor marks
across his chest. Chunks of his hair were pulled out. He was beaten
and bruised. So many people are asking why his mother wasn't around.
</I>
<P>
<I>Laura has two other children who live with her parents. She
said she left Timothy with his dad because she believed the child
would be cared for. Since Timothy's death his mother has created
a shrine in his memory. His stuffed toys. Pieces of clothing.
His running shoes hang on the wall. </I>
<HR>

<H3>School Guard </H3>

<P>
Parents in a northend Hamilton neighbourhood are calling it a
recipe for disaster. Students of Robert Land School will have

North. 
<P>
The veteran crossing guard is being moved to another street, but
parents say she should stay where she is. And they're petitioning
city hall to keep her there. the story tonight from Dwight Ryan.

<P>
<I>For twelve years, Diane Smith has been helping kids cross Wentworth
Street North outside Robert Land School. Morning, noon and after
school, Diane has been there to make sure the youngsters safely
get to the other side of the busy northend roadway. </I>
<P>
<I>But a traffic light will soon replace her. Diane won't lose
her job, she'll go to a less busy street at the back of the school.
On Wentworth Street, the kids will learn to push a button and
then cross on their own. </I>
<P>
<I>Youngsters have been hit before at the corner, and school principal
Wanda Lane says the guard should stay. </I>
<P>
<I>Area residents have started a petition demanding that City
Hall leave Diane Smith at her post. Otherwise, the kids will be
on their own come September. </I>

<H3>Votes - First </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton name dominates the national political landscape once
again. Will the Copps name regain its luster after the polls close

<P>
Ms. Copps, who says she is keeping her fingers crossed, took a
stroll with her husband this morning. She'll be casting her ballot

11 News they'd voted NDP. As voters headed for the polls, all
13 candidates remained optimistic. 
<HR>

<H3>Ammonia Leak </H3>

<P>
Some tense moments this morning on Hamilton mountain. Fire fighters
were called out to contain an ammonia leak at a poultry processing
plant. The gas leak prompted the fire department to deploy its
decontamination unit, and forced firefighters to stay on the scene

<P>
Lauran Sabourin reports, the team comprised of members of Halton
Peel and Waterloo Regional Police officers will wind down at he
end of the month. 
<P>
<I>Police know they are looking for the same attacker in all three
incidents because they are linked by the suspects DNA. </I>
<P>
<I>The first incident occurred in August of 1992 at a Kitchener
park. And eight year old boy was lured into a heavily wooded area
and raped. Two years later a 10 year old boy was attacked in broad
daylight in a park in Brampton. And then last august a 15 year
old girl was dragged into Burlington's Wildewood Park at gunpoint.
She was viscously raped over a three hour period. </I>
<P>
<I>Since the task force began it's probe they've investigated
over one thousand tips. They've investigated and have eliminated
over 700 suspects.</I>

<H3>Air Show - Traffic</H3>

<P>
It's Friday. It's been a long cold winter in the golden horseshoe
but today the sun is shining for tens of thousands of visitors.

<P>
The Hamilton area is in the international spotlight for the air
show at Mount Hope, the Seniors PGA in Ancaster and the Burlington
Sound of Music Festival. Now, to reporter Dwight Ryan standing
by live at Mt. Hope with the air show. What's happening now? 
<P>
<I>It was a mini air show for volunteers and officials setting
up for the 1996 Hamilton International Air Show. Warbirds sat
majestically on the runways, part of the statis display for the
weekend event. Overhead, the thunderous roar of jet fighters practicing
for one of Canada's premiere events. </I>
<P>
<I>Gigantic military planes arriving including the stealth bomber..
a crowd pleaser that makes few Canadian appearances. </I>
<P>
<I>This year, the air show is a three day event with a nighttime
show tonight lighting up the sky. An fm radio station at 99.1
on the dial will provide visitors to the show with up to date
traffic information. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Ham. East Campaign </H3>

<P>
Never say never. Those words have taken on new meaning, in the
riding of Hamilton East. Despite polls to the contrary; there
are signs that not all is well for former deputy prime minister
Sheila Copps. And the riding once thought to be the safest Liberal
seat in Canada; has suddenly become very dangerous. Scot Urquhart
reports: 
<P>
<I>You are seeing something that is extremely rare ... the wife
of the prime minister on the campaign trail: and it may be a signal
that what was unthinkable seven weeks ago, is now suddenly possible.
</I>
<P>
<I>Sheila Copps could be, in trouble. Wayne Marston isn't talking
like someone who is running nearly 36 points behind in the polls.
Conservative candidate Angie Tomasic is convinced that Sheila
can be beaten; and despite the polls in the morning paper that
predict a landslide ... even Sheila Copps concedes, that the by-election
portrayed as a walk, has suddenly become a race.</I>
<P>
<I>Could the impossible happen? the voters of Hamilton East, have
two days, to decide. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Civics - Grievances </H3>

<P>
The union that represents nearly fourteen-hundred support staff
at the Hamilton Civic Hospitals filed 250 grievances today, to
protest layoff notices issued last week. 134 members of local
7-9-4 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees received the layoff
notices. As Deborah Walker reports, that represents nearly ten
per cent of the union's membership. 
<P>
<I>At the headquarters of CUPE local 7-9-4, they're counting up
the grievances. Another 250, bringing the total number of grievances
filed since the layoff notification procedure began to nearly
four-hundred. </I>
<P>
<I>The Civic Hospitals were close to eliminating a 20-million
dollar shortfall, when the province announced its was cutting
four-million dollars more than the administration expected. </I>
<P>
<I>Back at the CUPE office, Walters says the only positive thing
about the layoffs is that registered practical nurses, who are
represented by his union, are finally getting the recognition
they deserve. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Hill Park Fight </H3>

<P>
Another incidence of violence in a Hamilton high school. Charges
are pending against a 16 year old boy after another 16 year old
had his head stepped on during a fight inside Hill Park High School
on the mountain. 
<P>
The boy was taken to hospital, but his injuries are not serious.

<HR>

<H3>Edgar Stabbing </H3>

<P>
A fight at a house party near Centre Mall in Hamilton early this
morning has left two men injured and one charged. Police were
called to the home to find one man slashed in the arm, another
stabbed in the back, and yet another man hiding outside the house.
Both injured men have been treated in hospital. 
<P>
The third man, 26 year old Jose Chavez of no fixed address faces
two counts of aggravated assault and a count each of obstructing
police and failing to comply.
<HR>

<H3>Skyway Crash </H3>

<P>
A Niagara Falls man is sure to be counting his lucky stars tonight.
30 year old Brian Regle escaped, unharmed, even though a tractor
trailer flipped onto his car. The back of the car was completely
crushed. 
<P>
The tractor trailer, carrying auto parts, flipped as its driver,
38 year old Margaret Anderson of Burlington, was turning onto
the QEW from Burlington Street in east Hamilton. Police are still
investigating the crash, which closed at least one Toronto bound
lane of the QEW for six hours. 
<HR>

<H3>Stelco Update </H3>

<P>
Stelco's Hilton Works is back in business, and its employees are
back on the job today. On Tuesday evening, the Hamilton steel
plant shut down all production, after a power interruption caused
a malfunction in the system that provides air, steam and cooling
water. 
<P>
Some of the plant's units are already back in action, while its
two blast furnaces are gradually returning to full production.
The plant's general manager says the procedures employees followed
to safely idle the plant Tuesday evening have resulted in no permanent
damage to the facilities. 
<HR>

<H3>Wesley Project </H3>

<P>
It's been nine years in the making, but Wesley Urban Ministries
feels their new home in downtown Hamilton is worth the wait. Today,
they unveiled their new facilities to the public. 
<P>
The project was started when a need developed for affordable housing
in the downtown core. Wesley has closed its old drop in centre
and moved a few blocks over to a site where they can house singles
and families, and still supply hot meals in a beautiful new setting.

<HR>

<H3>Attempt Murder </H3>

<P>
Things not so safe this morning in another of Wesley's locations.
A man walked into the Kirkendall Strathcona neighbourhood house
with a semi automatic handgun, and tried to fire two shots at
a Wesley employee. Both times the gun wouldn't fire, and the worker
managed to jump the gunman and keep him under control until police
arrived. 
<P>
45 year old Horacio Alexandre of Hamilton faces several charges,
including attempted murder.

<H3>McMaster Reactor</H3>

<P>
As government funding dwindles, or disappears, public institutions
like Hamilton's McMaster University, are being forced to reassess
the way they do business. And business is exactly what will turn
a one-time McMaster University liability, into a potential money-maker.

<P>
McMaster announced today that instead of decommissioning its research
nuclear reactor, it will keep the reactor operating, and operating
at a profit. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>One year ago, McMaster University decided to decommission its
nuclear reactor, because the million-dollar cost of running it
outweighed its research and educational value. But after reviewing
the reactor's sales potential in the private sector, McMaster
has developed a four-year business plan that will allow the reactor
to pay its own way. </I>
<P>
<I>McMaster projects the reactor can generate revenues of two-million
dollars a year, largely through sales of radioisotopes like iodine
125. The reactor is also valuable in measuring trace elements,
for instance in samples being assessed by the mining industry.
</I>
<P>
<I>Faced with cutbacks in government funding, McMaster University
will be looking at other areas of its operation to see if they,
like the reactor, can be turned into money-makers. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Stelco Update </H3>

<P>
Stelco still hopes to have full production restored at Hilton
Works by noon tomorrow. On Tuesday evening, the Hamilton steel
plant's central boiler station failed because of a power interruption,
and one of the boilers burst. As a result, the plant was unable
to provide steam for power, and water for cooling purposes. 
<P>
While repairs are underway, Stelco is trying to keep as many employees
as possible on the job by reassigning them to shipping and maintenance
work. Those who are not required have the option of taking a vacation
day, or a day off without pay. 
<HR>

<H3>St. Joe's/Civics </H3>

<P>
Another partnership day for Hamilton Civic Hospitals. Late yesterday,
more details of the merger between the Civics and Chedoke McMaster
hospitals were announced. 
<P>
Today, the Hamilton General and Henderson Hospitals have signed
a collaboration agreement with St. Joseph's Hospital. Annette
Hamm tells us what that deal will mean for patients. 
<P>
<I>It may be a few months before patients see the side effects
of this collaboration deal between St. Joseph's and Hamilton Civic
Hospitals. But both sides agree the effects will be healthy. That
means looking at both the support and clinical structures at all
three hospitals involved. </I>
<P>
<I>Examining housekeeping, and purchasing as well as medical specialties
before deciding which areas may move from one hospital to another.
No layoffs are expected because of the collaboration, but that
doesn't mean staff won't be cut from the Henderson, General and
St. Joseph's Hospitals. They still have to deal with provincial
cuts, but with the collaboration, any layoffs will be made across
the board, not just at one facility. </I>
<P>
<I>It's expected patients may see the effects of this latest partnership
next spring. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Stabbing Arrests </H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police interrupted a basketball game
last night, and arrested four teenagers in connection with the
stabbing of a Hamilton high school student earlier this week.

<P>
Nineteen-year- old Long Dang is recovering from a punctured lung
in hospital. He was beaten with a table leg and stabbed after
being lured out of Sir John A. Macdonald High School Monday afternoon.

<P>
Last night, police surrounded a basketball court near Bay and
Cannon Streets where about thirty people were playing. They arrested
20-year-old Binh Quoc Pham, 18-year-old Dinh Khal Vuu, 18-year-old
Dung Quoc Huynh, and a 17-year-old young offender. All four have
been charged with aggravated assault. 
<HR>

<H3>Robbery Roundup </H3>

<P>
And police are now investigating another case of youth violence
in Hamilton. A teenager was assaulted and robbed of his ghetto
blaster while walking on King Street near Wellington around seven-thirty
last night. 
<P>
The robber is described as a white male in his late teens, with
shoulder-length black hair. 
<P>
About ninety minutes later, police were called to another robbery
scene. Someone tried to hold up Caesar's two-for-one pizza on
Upper Wellington Street just before ten o'clock. But the bandit
left empty-handed when the clerk failed to immediately hand over
cash from the till. 
<P>
The suspect was a black male, five-foot-seven, and in his mid-twenties.
He was wearing a green track suit with white stripes, a baseball
cap, and used a black scarf to cover his face. 
<HR>

<H3>Citizens Arrest </H3>

<P>
Some Burlington residents witnessing a break and enter in progress
last night called police and helped nab two would-be thieves.
Police say the pair had gained entry into garden city motors on
plains road intending to steal over a hundred thousand dollars
worth of computers and tools. 
<P>
Two Hamilton men are charged: 30 year-old Michael Sakins and 31
year-old Robert Uruski. 
<HR>

<H3>Most Wanted </H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth Regional Police are looking for a man accused
of trashing a Hamilton home. Late last month, a suspect damaged
the house and its furnishings while demanding to know the whereabouts
of a woman. 
<P>
42-year-old Peter Miles Stargratt is Crime Stoppers most wanted
man this month. He is five-foot-ten, weighs two-hundred pounds,
and has short brown hair, blue eyes, and a tattoo of a wolf on
his right arm. Police believe Stargratt, who's wanted on break-and-enter
and mischief charges, is staying in the Hamilton-Toronto area.
Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to call Crime
Stoppers at 522-TIPS. 
<HR>

<H3>Palleta Cleared </H3>

<P>
Four employees of a Burlington based food company have had criminal
charges against them thrown out of court. Pat Palleta, president
of Qualico Foods, his son Paul and nephew Vince Palleta and Daniel
Mullins were all discharged yesterday of 50 counts of conspiracy
during a preliminary hearing. 
<P>
The men were charged last year following a joint investigation
into complaints that Qualico was fraudulently exporting Australian
beef to the United States as a Canadian product to avoid high
tariffs. 
<HR>

<H3>Austin Fired </H3>

<P>
Hamilton Spectator editor Rob Austin has been fired. Publisher
Pat Collins says the firing is not a change in direction of the
newspaper, it's a change in the leadership of the newsroom. 
<P>
The 52-year-old Austin became editor in 1991. Managing editor
John Gibson will be acting editor until Austin's replacement is
found.

<HR>

<H3>Tsubouchi</H3>

<P>
Workfare has landed. It came to 20 Ontario communities today,
including Hamilton Wentworth. Social Services minister David Tsubouchi
made it official in Niagara Falls this morning and organized labour
was there to voice their displeasure about the controversial government
scheme to require able-bodied welfare recipients to work for their
money. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Workfare </H3>

<P>
There is no middle ground. Workfare is a love or hate it proposition.
And, as Scot Urquhart reports, reviews are mixed, before the program
even starts: 
<P>
<I>When Workfare landed in Hamilton Wentworth, the welcome was
less than warm. A group of demonstrators distributed pamphlets
outside the region's Joblink Resource Center ... panning Workfare
as something just short of forced labour. </I>
<P>
<I>So what's wrong with Workfare? Susan West knows a lot about
Workfare. She's writing a study for the Social Planning and Research
Council of Hamilton Wentworth. And rather than saving taxpayers
money ... Susan believes; we'll pay more in the end ... even though
the region attached a list of conditions to its Workfare agreement,
with the province.</I>
<P>
<I>But Alf Spencer swears, that the region will be keeping a sharp
eye on the bottom line. And the director of Direct Services says
the region will ensure that Workfare jobs supply meaningful experience,
without taking work away, from those who already have it.</I>
<P>
<I>The truth is that no one knows just how this great social experiment
will pan out ... but even if fails ... in social terms the Tory
government will succeed, in keeping a campaign promise.</I> 
<P>
About 85-hundred welfare recipients in Hamilton Wentworth are
potentially eligible for Workfare. It is anticipated that only
a few hundred at a time will be actively participating in the
scheme; due to a shortage of qualified placements.
<HR>

<H3>Hospital Mergers </H3>

<P>
At this hour, board members with both Chedoke McMaster and Hamilton
Civic Hospitals are pouring over recommendations for their merger.

<P>
They received the recommendation package late this afternoon on
how the new hospital, one of the largest in Canada, will be governed.
Annette Hamm reports. 
<P>
<I>In this closed door meeting, board members from both Chedoke
McMaster and Hamilton Civic Hospitals received the blueprint for
their future. The hospitals are merging into one hospital with
one board and one chief executive officer. </I>
<P>
<I>The Transition Committee overseeing the merger sought public
input in March. That input is included in the recommendations
presented to both boards. Staffing and budget levels won't be
decided by the transition committee, but rather by the new hospital's
chief executive officer. The committee is still interviewing for
that position, and should have an announcement later in the summer.
</I>
<P>
<I>The hospital merger is expected to be complete by December.
On Thursday, Hamilton Civic Hospitals will sign a collaboration
agreement with St. Joseph's Hospital. It's not another merger,
more a partnership to cut down on duplication of services and
improve on patient care.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Board Layoffs </H3>

<P>
And the financial juggling act continues at the school boards.
A Hamilton Board of Education committee has voted to eliminate
the equivalent of another seventy-three full-time elementary teaching
jobs. All the teaching positions are in non-mandated programs...
family studies, design and technology, guidance and the library
program. 
<P>
The decision was taken in light of the board's failure so far
to achieve five-million dollars in savings through negotiations
with its various employee groups. 
<P>
On a more positive note, another board committee, which is meeting
tonight, is expected to recall 134 of the more than two-hundred
elementary teachers who received layoff notices earlier this year.

<HR>

<H3>Youth Beating </H3>

<P>
An eyewitness to the murder of a Hamilton teenager was beaten
in the weight room of a Hamilton high school this week. 
<P>
The eighteen year - old, who attends Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary
School, was approached by a group of six or seven Asian students
from another high school Monday afternoon. They asked him if he
had seen the attack on 18-year-old Roberto Oliviera, who died
two weeks ago after he was beaten with a baseball bat at Lime
Ridge Mall. When the student confirmed he was a witness, he was
punched, kicked and hit over the head with a garbage can. The
victim broke free and ran for help, but teachers were unable to
catch his assailants. 
<P>
About an hour later, another student at Sir John A. Macdonald
was beaten and stabbed near the school, but police don't believe
there's any connection between the two assaults. 
<HR>

<H3>Young Stalker </H3>

<P>
A Hamilton elementary school student, who showered one of his
teachers with flowers and love notes, has been charged with criminal
harassment and threatening death. 
<P>
Police say the fourteen-year-old was infatuated with the 36-year-old
teacher, and left notes on her car, sent roses to her home, and
telephoned her repeatedly. His unwanted attentions came to an
end when he wrote her a lengthy letter, professing his love, and
threatening to kill another female teacher at the same school.
The youngster was arrested and charged yesterday. 
<HR>

<H3>Stelco Update </H3>

<P>
It will take up to two days to fix a problem that has brought
steel production at Stelco's Hilton Works to a standstill. 
<P>
Last night, the steel plant's boilers failed because of a power
interruption. That in turn caused a malfunction of the system
that draws water from Hamilton Harbour to cool production equipment.
More than 15-hundred steelworkers were on the job when all major
production units were forced to shut down. No one was hurt. 
<P>
Stelco says it will take twenty-four to forty-eight hours to restore
full operations. 
<HR>

<H3>Tire Fire </H3>

<P>
Five years later, the ashes are about to be buried after 1990
Hagersville tire fire. The New Credit Native Band will get a 450-thousand
dollar trust fund in return for letting Haldimand-Norfolk region
dump the waste in a landfill site next door to their reserve.
The band will also gain access to the region's water supply system.

<P>
For years, reserve residents have had to use bottled water or
poor quality water from wells. The fire, fed by a mountain of
14-million used tires broke out at Straza's Tyre King. It burned
for 17 days, spewing toxic chemicals and fouling the water. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
New economic data from the United States shows prices and inflation
edging higher. That contributes to widespread expectations that
interest rates might rise. Those conditions sent interest yields
on Canadian bonds higher today while stock prices dropped for
the eighth day in a row. 
<HR>

<H3>Charest-Hamilton </H3>

<P>
Federal Conservative leader Jean Charest is in Hamilton today
on by-election business. He's campaigning for Angie Tomasic, running
for the Tories in Monday's Hamilton east by-election. 
<P>
Tonight, Charest will meet with Hamilton high school students
who want tougher punishment for young offenders. He will also
campaign with Tomasic in Sam Manson park.

<H3>Kitchener Fire </H3>

<P>
Tragedy in Kitchener. Four children -- who may have been playing
with a lighter -- died in a house fire early this morning, while
their frantic mother watched in helpless horror. The children
-- all under the age of 10 -- were trapped in the semi-detached
home about 7:30. 
<P>
The dead children have been identified as nine-year-old Angela
Dumbroskie, four-year-old David Dumbroskie, three-year-old Jamie
Burns, and two-year-old Devin Burns. Their mother, 27-year-old
Leanne Dumbroskie, had to be restrained by neighbors from going
back into the house. She was taken to hospital suffering from
first-degree burns to her face, smoke inhalation and shock. 
<P>
A firefighter was also taken to hospital, after he fell through
a burned out floor. 
<HR>

<H3>Apt. Fire - Baby </H3>

<P>
And, in Hamilton just before the noon hour, firefighters were
called to a small kitchen fire on Sanford North. An unattended
pot on a stove filled an apartment unit with smoke. 
<P>
An infant was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. Damage
from the grease fire was minimal.
<HR>

<H3>Electrocution </H3>

<P>
And tragedy struck in Welland when a 25-year-old man electrocuted
himself while doing some home repairs. 
<P>
Police say Michael Stewart Levinski was installing an electrical
plug in his kitchen last night. He was found unconscious and rushed
to hospital where he was pronounced dead less than an hour later.
<HR>

<H3>Stabbing Follow </H3>

<P>
Police are still looking for four oriental male suspects after
an attack on two Sir John A. Macdonald High School students yesterday.
One was stabbed, the other was beaten with a table leg. 
<P>
As Ian Dovey reports the police are looking a motive and four
suspects. 
<P>
<I>Police have recovered the knife and the wooden table leg used
in the parking lot attack of two Sir John A. Macdonald High School
students. The victims in their late teens were ambushed after
school by four individuals. The police have no suspects...and
are not ruling out if this incident is related to another call
they received earlier in the day. </I>
<P>
<I>This incident is certainly disturbing, but some student we
spoke to say they're not surprised by the attack, saying violence
is almost a daily occurrence here. </I>
<P>
<I>The attack on these two young men occurred within hours of
a noisy student demonstration calling for tougher penalties against
young violent offenders. Students in Hamilton have been protesting
and circulating petitions since a 15 year old was charged with
murder after a teen was beaten to death with a baseball bat at
Limeridge Mall two weeks ago.</I>
<P>
<I>The victims of the Sir John A. Macdonald attack were taken
to the General Hospital. Police their injuries are not life threatening.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Hospital Cuts </H3>

<P>
Two hundred, twenty jobs are being eliminated at the St. Catharines
General Hospital. That's 20 percent of the General's workforce.
As Lauran Sabourin reports 100 people are taking early retirement,
120 employees will be laid off. 
<P>
<I>The layoffs will be phased in over the next 12 months. Every
group of employees from cleaning staff to hospital administrators
will be affected. Eighteen managers have lost their jobs. The
unions are still sorting out the numbers. </I>
<P>
<I>The General needed to cut 12 million dollars from it's budget.
The hospital had to look for ways to lower its costs. At the same
time it's urging the public to lower its expectations. The hospital
insists the quality of patient care wont' be compromised. But
the extras will be gone. As they put it's not a hotel.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Workfare-Hamilton </H3>

<P>
Details of the Ontario government's long-awaited Workfare program
will be unveiled at a news conference in Niagara Falls tomorrow
morning. At the same time, Hamilton- Wentworth region will find
out if it is one of the Ontario communities chosen as a test site
for the first phase of Workfare. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Billed as &quot;Ontario Works&quot;, the Tories' Workfare program
will require single, able-bodied welfare recipients to work for
their benefits. If Hamilton- Wentworth is chosen as one of the
first communities to institute Workfare, the region will begin
by consolidating existing services that help people find work.
After four months, recipients who have not found work on their
own, will have to take part in community projects or volunteer
work, or risk losing their benefits. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton- Wentworth will also work with the private and non-profit
sector to find jobs for welfare recipients.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<H3>Welland Storm Damage </H3>

<P>
Parts of Niagara are still cleaning up after a series of powerful
thunderstorms rolled through the peninsula last night. In rural
areas of Welland and Wainfleet strong winds uprooted trees. Tree
limbs snapped, and power lines were downed. 
<P>
In St. Catharines power was out in sections of the city after
Hydro lines were downed there.

<H3>Region - Options </H3>

<P>
Now that they've staked out positions on opposite sides of the
municipal government reform debate, the City of Hamilton and its
suburbs are willing to explore the possibility of finding some
middle ground. 
<P>
Today, city and suburban councilors faced each other for the first
time since Hamilton council proposed annexing its neighbours.
But instead of being confrontational, the atmosphere in the council
chamber was decidedly conciliatory. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Technically, there are now four options for municipal government
reform on Hamilton- Wentworth regional council's table. Every
one realizes the status quo is no longer acceptable, because of
provincial pressure for change. And there's little political support
for the constituent assembly's recommended model for a one-tier
regional government. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton proposes the creation of a super city, while the suburbs
want a modified two-tier system. In the interests of presenting
a unified front to the province, councilors have agreed to meet
in July to try to find a compromise between Hamilton and its suburbs.
</I>
<P>
<I>Even though all six local councils have rejected the constituent
assembly's recommendations, the group's co-chairman considers
its efforts worthwhile, if only because politicians were forced
to confront the need for change.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton East Campaign</H3>

<P>
And the politics of change will leave its mark on the federal
riding of Hamilton East one week from today. As the race heads
down to the wire, Dwight Ryan reports, at least one candidate
feels its a race between just two of the thirteen candidates.

<P>
<I>Sheila Copps is in the political race of her life. Running
for the seat in the commons that she resigned after the liberals
failed to can the GST. Liberal polling indicated she'd easily
retain the seat ..even though by-elections cost about half a million
dollars. </I>
<P>
<I>Even though there are thirteen candidates running in Hamilton
East, New Democrat Wayne Marston says only two are in the race.
</I>
<P>
<I>Heavy hitters from the Progressive Conservative party gathered
for breakfast at a downtown hotel in support of Angie Tomasic.
The guest speaker.. former prime minister Joe Clark. </I>
<P>
<I>Reform candidate Andy Sweck says the weekend endorsement of
Preston Manning shows the internal party turmoil is over. With
a week to go until voting day, he's confident. Copps meanwhile
says outside taxpayer groups won't be successful in their bid
to discredit her.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Students-Demo </H3>

<P>
Earlier today Hamilton high school students staged another noisy
demonstration downtown Hamilton to support their demands for changes
to the Young Offenders Act. 
<P>
The placard-carrying students rallied in front of Hamilton City
Hall, then marched to Gore Park, urging passing motorists to honk
in support.

<H3>Sesqui Celebrations</H3>

<P>
The final plans have been put into place for the biggest birthday
party Hamilton has ever seen. The city celebrates its Sesquicentennial
this weekend but it comes at a time when the future of the city
and its suburban neighbours has once again become shrouded in
controversy. 
<HR>

<H3>Supercity Reaction</H3>

<P>
Hamilton- Wentworth's suburban mayors are not about to sit idly
by and watch the city of Hamilton swallow up their communities.

<P>
Yesterday, Hamilton city council rejected the local government
reforms recommended by the constituent assembly, and voted instead
to disband Hamilton- Wentworth region, and annex Hamilton's five
suburban neighbours. As Deborah Walker reports, suburban mayors
plan to fight what they consider Hamilton's self-serving proposal.

<P>
<I>The mayor of Flamborough finds it ironic that what started
as an exercise to improve local government in Hamilton- Wentworth,
has ended with the city of Hamilton trying to take over its neighbours.
</I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton councilors may outnumber suburban councilors, but
any regional council vote requires the presence of at least two
communities other than Hamilton. Without them, council business
grinds to a halt. </I>
<P>
<I>Both mayors believe it's better to compromise, perhaps by allowing
Hamilton to take over regional services, and sell them back to
the suburbs.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton GO </H3>

<P>
It was a no go for residents of the region trying to commute eastward
this morning and the disruption will likely last through the weekend.

<P>
All GO transit service west of Port Credit was canceled after
a train derailment just before five this morning. It involved
four cars of a CN freight train at an overpass in on Mississauga
Rd. The cars weren't carrying any hazardous material, and no was
one hurt but passengers at several stations, including Oakville,
Burlington, Hamilton and Aldershot had to find other ways to get
to work. 
<P>
It happened while engineers were trying to slow the train down
after a detector indicated there was a piece of equipment dragging.

<HR>

<H3>Smoking Survey </H3>

<P>
A survey on smoking trends shows smoking is becoming more unacceptable
in Hamilton Wentworth. The public opinion poll of just over a
thousand people was commissioned by the region and found that
71 and 72 percent of adult respondents respectively support stricter
bylaws to ban smoking in all enclosed public places and in the
workplace. 
<P>
And to the region's surprise the survey found that a majority
of smokers and non smokers would visit public places as often
or more if they became smoke free.
<HR>

<H3>CIBC Diversity </H3>

<P>
The CIBC in Hamilton has tied its employee diversity celebrations
into the city's sesquicentennial. The bank and its guests, including
the Sesqui mascot, shared a huge cake over the noon hour. It was
decorated with the flags of the 26 countries of origin of the
bank's employees. 
<P>
The bank says today's event shows its commitment to the diversity
of the bank and the community.

<H3>Ham. - Assembly </H3>

<P>
Hamilton city council drew a line in the sand today... a line
that encircles all of Hamilton- Wentworth, and eliminates the
region, and its five suburbs. 
<P>
Confronted with conflicting recommendations on municipal government
reform from the suburbs and the constituent assembly, Hamilton
city council came out swinging today. At a special meeting, council
voted unanimously to disband Hamilton- Wentworth region, and to
swallow up Stoney Creek, Glanbrook, Flamborough, Ancaster and
Dundas. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>For more than twenty years, the City of Hamilton has paid seventy
per cent of the cost of running Hamilton- Wentworth Region. After
a day-long session, Hamilton city council decided the buck stops
here. Council voted unanimously to eliminate Hamilton- Wentworth
region, to absorb all regional staff, and to take over all regional
services. </I>
<P>
<I>By the year two-thousand, the city wants to expand its borders
to encompass the entire region, with one city council, one councilor
for each twenty-thousand people, and an amalgamated tax base.
</I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton city council's position is at odds with its suburbs,
who are willing to keep the region on a probationary basis. And
Hamilton city council rejected the report of the constituent assembly,
after a consultant told aldermen many of the report's assumptions
have no basis in fact.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Promotion Fraud? </H3>

<P>
It's not illegal. But it lives in the house next door, to that
neighbourhood. It's a telemarketing promotion that preys on the
good will of average citizens; and takes advantage of legitimate
charities. Scot Urquhart has the story: 
<P>
<I>They are out there, and they want your money. Regional police
are looking in to a number of questionable fund-raising schemes
... currently being used to part you ... from your cash. </I>
<P>
<I>One involves a so-called charity baseball tournament ... where
companies and individuals are asked to buy advertising space in
a program. Although Hamilton is listed on the flyer... Sgt. Bob
Wright says the regional police force is not involved.</I>
<P>
<I>A similar sort of promotion ... involves so-called newspapers
promoting ... fire safety, drug awareness ... or some other worthwhile
cause. Individuals are asked for donations, and sponsors again
are asked to buy advertising; the papers are delivered ... but
most of the money; is pocketed.</I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton Firefighters ... are among the organizations that
feel they've been burned by questionable fund-raisers... they
say they have nothing to do, with the fire safety newspaper. </I>
<P>
<I>Legitimate organizations say the telemarketers are taking advantage
of the good will of average people ... Rick Entwistle of Bowling
for the Disabled says it's tough enough trying to raise money
without phony fund-raisers taking scarce dollars out of the fundraising
kitty.</I>
<P>
<I>Sgt. Bob Wright says do some research, before you write the
cheque.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Apt. Fire </H3>

<P>
Careless smoking is the culprit in an afternoon fire that gutted
an apartment in a west Hamilton building. Tenants were evacuated
as firefighters wrestled with the problem of clearing smoke from
the structure's hallways and stairwells. 
<P>
The tenant in the affected apartment was treated at hospital for
smoke inhalation. Damage is estimated at 20- thousand dollars.

<HR>

<H3>Halton - Choice </H3>

<P>
Members of the Lost Souls motor cycle club in Milton have flipped
colours and joined the province-wide Satan's Choice gang. 
<P>
Halton Regional Police say the new club members have rented this
fortified clubhouse in a Milton industrial mall. Security cameras
keep an eye on the secure doors of the clubhouse. Police say the
club is frequented regularly by other club members and that they
too are watching what's going on. 
<HR>

<H3>Cemetery Costs </H3>

<P>
They've finally tallied up the damage at the Drummond Hill Cemetery
in Niagara Falls. Two hundred and eight historical monuments were
damaged or destroyed by vandals earlier this week. The damage
estimate is about 32 thousand dollars but will likely rise once
restoration work begins. 
<P>
Two fourteen year old boys are facing mischief charges in connection
with the vandalism spree. 
<HR>

<H3>Child Found </H3>

<P>
A 10 year old Hamilton boy missing since late yesterday afternoon
is back home tonight. Bradley McLean apparently left his fathers
home with plans of going to his mother's home in Windsor. He was
found unharmed but unhappy by a woman on Delaware Street, crying
as he pushed a box of clothing along the sidewalk. 
<HR>

<H3>Nurses Jobs </H3>

<P>
More than 100 registered nurses at the Hamilton Civil Hospitals
are receiving layoff notices this week. Connie Ross is head of
the union local representing nurses from both Hamilton General
and Henderson hospitals. She says patient care will suffer as
a result of the layoffs. 
<HR>

<H3>Jackman Quits </H3>

<P>
Dr. Jennifer Jackman, who made headlines as the top paid public
sector executive in Hamilton, has bowed out of the race for super
C.E.O. of a merged Hamilton Civic and Chedoke - McMaster Hospitals.

<P>
The Chedoke - McMaster C.E.O. since 1991 says her decision is
based on a lifestyle change. The merger plans were announced last
December and the decision on a new chief executive officer will
be made this summer. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Falling gold prices continued to trigger more selling of Canadian
gold mining shares today. That pulled the overall value of the
Toronto Stock Exchange lower for the fourth day in a row. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened. 
<P>
Interest yields on Canadian bonds edged lower. 
<P>
Trimark expanded its ownership of Dofasco shares to 12 per cent.

<HR>

<H3>Learned Societies </H3>

<P>
For the last two weeks Brock University in St. Catharines has
been hosting the 1996 Learned Societies Congress. 
<P>
Seven thousand professors have gathered at the campus to present
the latest research in their field. The Learned Societies event
is significant because it puts Brock University on the academic
map.

<H3>Waxman - Region </H3>

<P>
The co-chairmen of the Constituent Assembly charged with re-shaping
municipal government in Hamilton- Wentworth, lashed out today
at the political response to their recommendations. 
<P>
In separate speeches, Don Granger and Chester Waxman accused the
region's six municipal councils of essentially dismissing the
constituent assembly's final report, which recommended the creation
of a single, stream-lined level of government. And both men say
the local councils seem more inclined to listen to consultants,
than to the citizens who elected them. Deborah Walker reports.

<P>
<I>Constituent Assembly co-chairman Chester Waxman told the Metropolitan
Hamilton Real Estate Board any talk of reforming government evokes
a strong emotional response. And he warns elected politicians
are not above inciting those emotions to protect their own turf.
</I>
<P>
<I>Waxman points out the Constituent Assembly spent a year talking
with citizens, before tabling its recommendations. In response,
he says the city of Hamilton and five suburban councils chose
to hire consultants, at taxpayers' expense. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Halton Middle School </H3>

<P>
And a restructuring is underway at the Halton School Board. In
an attempt to save millions of dollars, schools will be closed
and staff will be layed off. Included in the renewal plan is an
option to scrap middle schools. As Dwight Ryan reports, not everyone
is in favour. 
<P>
<I>Students in Miss Brook's high school music class. But they're
only in grades seven and eight. Its an idea trustees with the
Halton School Board are giving considerable thought to. </I>
<P>
<I>Skip the middle school, go from grade six in elementary school
to grade seven in high school. The Halton board has to save at
least 40 million over the next few years. </I>
<P>
<I>And it works according to Central High School principal Greg
Macpherson. </I>
<P>
<I>Bob Williams hopes trustees will approve the concept before
the end of June. If they do, middle schools will be a thing of
the past in Halton. </I>
<P>
<I>Teacher rep Erica Andrew says its a big mistake. If Williams
has his way, school closures can begin this fall. And students
in grade seven and eight will be in high school. Trustees promise
though, that those opposed to the concept will be heard.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Kid Crime </H3>

<P>
Canadian schools are not the dangerous hellholes that many people
believe they've become. That according to Dr. Rod Dolmage a youth
crime expert from the University of Regina. 
<P>
As Lauran Sabourin reports Dr. Dolmage believes that reports of
youth violence are exaggerated and he has the evidence to prove
it. 
<P>
<I>If there is evidence that points to an increase in crime committed
by teenagers, it's not that more youth are breaking the law. It's
that the activities of young lawbreakers are being reported to
the police more often. </I>
<P>
<I>Take a look at the newspapers and almost daily you'll see something
on youth violence. Even if the public accepts that teenagers involved
in violent crime are the minority, that most are generally good
kids, there is still the perception that teenagers just have no
respect for authority.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Cemetery Arrests </H3>

<P>
Police in Niagara Falls have arrested two teenagers and charged
them in connection with the rampage in Drummond Hill Cemetery.

<P>
More than 100 headstones at the 1812 historical site were knocked
over or destroyed. The graveyard was the site of the battle of
Lundy's Lane. American and British soldiers are buried at this
cemetery. 
<P>
The two teens are charged with mischief over five thousand dollars.
They will appear for a bail hearing in St. Catharines court tomorrow.

<HR>

<H3>Bank Hit </H3>

<P>
Two armed bandits robbed a west Hamilton bank branch today ...
the T.D at Aberdeen and Dundurn. Police say they wielded hand-guns
and ordered an elderly customer and staff members to the floor.
One of the robbers held a gun, while the other scooped the tills.
The pair fled with an undisclosed amount of cash in a stolen vehicle
which was recovered a short distance away. 
<P>
They were seen getting into a blue car. The men are described
as white, 30-to-35, five-eight. One has black hair... the other
has brown. If you have any information that could help, call police.

<HR>

<H3>Hydro Pole Down </H3>

<P>
Police in St. Catharines are searching for a hit and run driver
after a Hydro pole was knocked down this morning. A car skidded
out of control and rammed the pole which then fell across the
residential street. 
<P>
Hydro crews were on the scene and quickly removed the obstruction.

<HR>

<H3>All Candidates </H3>

<P>
It was a warmer reception for former deputy prime minister Sheila
Copps last night. After jeers and boos at an all candidates meeting
on Monday night, Copps was greeted with applause at a Beach Boulevard
debate last night. 
<P>
Candidates parachuted in from other cities were given a rough
ride, though, by some of the Hamilton east citizens. Many of them
say they don't want a stranger representing them in the house
of commons. 
<P>
13 candidates are running in the federal by-election, called when
Copps resigned over a GST promise. Hamilton east residents will
vote June 17th. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Gold prices fell sharply for the second day in a row. That caused
another steep drop in the value of shares on the Toronto stock
exchange. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened while interest yields on Canadian
government bonds remained stable.

<H3>Cemetery Vandalism</H3>

<P>
Laura Secord is buried there and so are a number of military leaders
from the war of 1812. But the historic Lundy's Lane Cemetery in
Niagara Falls has been trashed by vandals. 
<P>
More than a hundred tombstones at the site of the battle of Lundy's
Lane were destroyed in a vandalism spree overnight. Lauran Sabourin
has more. 
<P>
<I>They were just beginning to assess the extent of damage this
morning. This graveyard was the site of the battle of Lundy's
Lane. Scores of American and British soldiers died here. The remains
of Laura Secord are buried in this cemetery. </I>
<P>
<I>The monument to Laura Secord was spared. But others around
her were destroyed. Granite stones pushed off their base. Tipped
over. Stones broken in pieces. </I>
<P>
<I>The police believe this was the work of vandals. Punks who
had nothing better to do. But the question people are asking now
how do you protect a public historical site.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Tolton Robbery </H3>

<P>
Police in Hamilton are looking for a 20 year old after a robbery
at the Tolton Food Market this afternoon. 
<P>
The suspect, believed to have had a gun stuffed in his pants,
demanded money from a female employee before putting the woman

<H3>Regional Reform</H3>

<P>
It's a new month and time is now running out for regional government.
The Harris government is determined to reform the regional government
system in Ontario. 
<P>
In Hamilton Wentworth, the constituent assembly recommended scrapping
local governments and going ahead with a leaner super region.
Surrounding municipalities were outraged and formed a common front.

<P>
Hamilton councilors have yet to formally respond and the deadline
is looming. Dwight Ryan has more. 
<P>
<I>It was two months ago that the constituent assembly presented
its final report on regional reform. A leaner super government
without duplication of services was their answer. Not unexpectedly,
surrounding municipalities were aghast. </I>
<P>
<I>What would happen to the identity of Ancaster, Stoney creek,
Dundas Flamborough and Glanbrook. They presented a common front.
Keep the local in local government said their response. Unofficially,
stay out of our back yard. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Burn Victim </H3>

<P>
A 13-year old Hamilton boy died this morning from injuries suffered
during a backyard weekend camp-out on Hamilton's east mountain.

<P>
Police say Steven Pardiac and three friends were trying to set
fire to some items when lighter fluid splashed on him. The flames
got out of control ... fully engulfing the boy. A neighbour used
a sleeping bag to try to smother the fire but not before he sustained
2nd and 3rd degree burns to more than 80-per cent of his body.

<HR>

<H3>Dover Fatal </H3>

<P>
Police in Port Dover began the week with an investigation into
the cause of a car crash that killed a Dunnville woman and injured
her 8 year-old-son. 
<P>
33 year-old- Margaret Bush died last night when her car went off
the road and hit a Hydro pole, just east of port Dover 8 year
old Dylan Bush is expected to recover from his injuries. 
<HR>

<H3>Outlaws Arrest </H3>

<P>
In a continuing crackdown on motorcycle gangs Niagara police have
laid additional charges against an outlaws gang member. 
<P>
Thirty eight year old Claude Longval is facing two prostitution
related charges. Longval was arrested last month during a police
sweep of biker hangouts. 
<HR>

<H3>Falls Rescue </H3>

<P>
A mystery man can thank rescue workers for saving his life after
he changed his mind about taking his own. A helicopter lifted
a man off a tiny island at the brink of the falls where he apparently
had planned to commit suicide. A passerby called police after
spotting the him stranded on gull island, about 100 metres from
the Canadian shore. 
<P>
Police won't reveal his identity other than to say he is a Canadian
citizen. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Stock prices in the US and Canada moved lower today. 
<P>
Analysts say investors are nervous that a strengthening American
economy might force interest rates higher. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar rose slightly. Canadian interest rates remained
stable. 
<HR>

<H3>Aspiring Model </H3>

<P>
Appearances can be deceiving. In a business where cosmetics, and
glamour are everything; there is a shooting star, with her feet
planted firmly on the ground. Scot Urquhart discovered her in
Burlington, today: 
<P>
<I>Walking through the halls of Burlington Nelson High School,
you might not notice anything unusual about Samantha Martin ...
other than she tends to stand a little bit above the crowd ...
but if you think that basketball is the passion of this six foot
one, grade nine student ... you'd be wrong ... modeling, is the
game that turns Samantha's head. </I>
<P>
<I>Samantha is doing more than passingly well, at the game ...
she is one of ten finalists ... picked from more than 10-thousand
new faces from across North America; in a talent search sponsored
by Cover Girl Cosmetics, and y/m magazine.</I>
<P>
<I>For someone with such a bright future, in such a glamorous
business ... she is amazingly down to earth: and those friends
quite obviously look up to her, in more ways than one</I>
<P>
<I>Although she's excited about the June 16th competition ...
Samantha martin is keeping things in perspective; and says she
won't be disappointed, if she doesn't win. For now, in many ways
she's just a typical teenager. But for Samantha Martin, the future
may soon be anything but typical.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Hike for Health</H3>

<P>
Hamilton hospitals say, it's an emergency ... health care is on
the critical list, and you can do something about it. 
<P>
Four regional hospitals: Chedoke McMaster, Hamilton Civics, St.
Joe's and St. Peter's have teamed up once again... to raise money
for regional hospitals with the annual Hike for Health. 
<P>
The hike takes place June 9th; on Hamilton's official sesquicentennial
birthday, and will actually cover four different routes; each
of varying length and difficulty. All routes will converge on
Macassa Park ... for a special Sesqui picnic:
<HR>

<H3>Model T - Shriners </H3>

<P>
There were wheels turning for charity today. Jack Harvey and Rod
Mizener set off from Hamilton City Hall this morning in a 66-year-old
model A Ford Roadster, for a 35-hundred mile round trip to Halifax.
Along the way, the motoring duo will raise money for the Shriners
Hospital for crippled and burned children. 
<HR>

<H3>Big Bike </H3>

<P>
And finally, it took a little longer to get this set of wheels
in motion. A bicycle built for, well 30, one of the biggest in
Canada. And the people pedaling it around Hamilton's Westdale
neighbourhood today, have some pretty big hearts. 
<P>
Seven teams of thirty people rode to raise money for Ontario's
Heart and Stroke Foundation. A team from the Hamilton- Wentworth
Regional Police force kicked off the first circuit. 
<P>
So far, over five-hundred teams in Ontario have taken a spin on
the bike, raising more than a million dollars for stroke research.

<H3>Students - YOA</H3>

<P>
It was the sound of anger... it was the sound of fear... it was
an out-pouring of frustration. A rally by Hamilton high school
students who say they are sick of violence; and want changes to
the Young Offenders Act ... rattled the downtown core throughout
the noon-hour. 
<P>
The hastily planned demonstration was sparked by the brutal murder
of 18 year old Roberto Oliviera ..and the charges laid against
a 15 year old suspect, under the Young Offender's Act. Scot Urquhart
has that story: 
<P>
<I>They were determined to be heard ... the murder of Roberto
Oliviera has galvanized the anger of hundreds of Hamilton students
... and the object of their wrath is the Young Offender's Act.</I>
<P>
<I>The students called for Mayor Bob Morrow, to address them,
and get involved. He did. Promising to help organize a meeting
with federal and provincial politicians, to discuss the issue.
But the students didn't stop there ... they took their message
to the streets of Hamilton ... and staged another demonstration,
at Gore Park.</I>
<P>
<I>Clearly, these kids were angry about what they see as a rising
tide of violence in society ... and they say, lenient penalties
are to blame. But when pressed on the deeper issues, of what spurs
violence in the first place; there were no real answers.</I>
<P>
<I>If the rally was intended to draw attention ... it did ...
bordering at times on bedlam; drivers honked in agreement as the
students chanted, and pedestrians on the street voiced support,
with few exceptions. </I>
<P>
<I>The students plan another rally June 10th ... they are hoping
that demonstration against violence will be larger, and will involve
people of all ages... who oppose violence in society.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Bikers Crackdown </H3>

<P>
Police across Canada are preparing for war against outlaw motorcycle
gangs this summer. Niagara police have already begun a crackdown
on bikers with the arrests last month of several Outlaws members.
And now the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has developed
a campaign with other forces and the Criminal Intelligence Service
of Canada to curtail the illegal activities of biker gangs. 
<P>
Association president Tom O'Grady says the law enforcement community
is united in serving notice that public safety will not be compromised
by ruthless gangs intent on profiting from illegal activities.

<HR>

<H3>Copps Barbecue</H3>

<P>
In Hamilton- Wentworth, police hope the community-based approach
will help prevent crime, especially among young people, by developing
good relationships with the cops on the beat. Police are targeting
high-crime neighborhoods specifically, like the Lansdale - Stinson
neighbourhood. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Clean </H3>

<P>
There were few surprises today as members of the Keep Hamilton
Clean Committee embarked on their annual tour of the city's worst
litter spots. 
<P>
This mess belongs to the back yard of an abandoned home on West
Avenue North. Committee members could only say 'wow' as they first
laid eyes on the trash. 
<P>
Committee chair Ron Volterman says the annual tour draws attention
to homeowners and companies that don't clean up. He adds they
usually do after they're approached by City Hall. 
<HR>

<H3>HSR Hike </H3>

<P>
Hamilton transit riders will be paying a nickel more to ride the
bus. Starting tomorrow the cash fare for adults, seniors and students
will be a dollar, seventy five. The cash fare for children will
be a dollar, five. Monthly passes increase one dollar to 56 dollars
for adults and 41 dollars for seniors, students and children.

<P>
This is the first fare increase in more than two years. 
<HR>

<H3>Milton Jobs </H3>

<P>
There's still enough people buying cars to create some new jobs
in Milton. 
<P>
Johnson Controls has decided to build a new automobile seat manufacturing
plant in the town. The 10-and-a-half million-dollar facility will
be supplying seats for Corolla cars at the Toyota plant in Cambridge.

<P>
The new plant will mean the creation of 120 jobs in Milton. 
<HR>

<H3>Business - First </H3>

<P>
Canadian stocks rose to their 30th record high today. 
<P>
Rising prices for Canadian gold mining companies helped the rally.

<P>
The Canadian dollar also strengthened. 
<P>
New data released today shows Canada's economy continues to crawl
foreword at a slow pace. 
<HR>

<H3>Team Mohawk </H3>

<P>
After months of painstaking preparations, six pretty excited Mohawk
College students are on their way to Marshall, Michigan to race
in an event known as the Mileage Car Competition. This is a race
where distance determines the winner. 
<P>
Reporter Ian Dovey caught up with the pit crew before their departure.

<P>
<I>She rolls like a charm, but is the Tomahawk Five, a sixty pound
super mileage car, good enough to win the Society of Automotive
Engineers Competition?</I>
<P>
<I>Since January a garage on Hamilton's west mountain has been
the design and workshop of the Tomahawk Five, the brainchild of
six Mohawk College students. </I>
<P>
<I>The aluminum cockpit, and super modified Briggs and Stratton
engine are surrounded by a fibreglass shell. </I>
<P>
<I>Last year this group of industrial and mechanical students
placed 6th in north America, but the key to this year success
may lie in the rubber, wheelchair racing wheels. </I>
<P>
<I>The Tomahawk Five will go as fast as fifty miles per hour,
but speed is not important - it's the distance. The winners will
receive a thousand dollars.</I>

<H3>Youth Crime Follow</H3>

<P>
Two shocking cases of kids, killing kids have rocked the region
over the last week; and many parents are wondering whether youth
crime is out of control. 
<P>
There is even greater concern, when rumored plans for retaliatory
crimes circulate through area high schools. Scot Urquhart checked
into those rumours today; and reports that according to the authorities,
reports of runaway youth crime, are greatly exaggerated: 
<P>
<I>The fallout from the tragic beating death of 18 year old Roberto
Oliviera ... continues to unsettle the students of St. Jean de
Brebeuf High School.... according to principal Chris Fox. He says,
kids are wondering whether it's safe anymore, to go to the mall
... or come to school. ... his job, he says, is to assure both
the students, and their parents, that it is.</I>
<P>
<I>Despite rumours of an escalating feud between students of Brebeuf,
and nearby Barton Secondary School ... rumours so extreme... that
even a drive-by shooting has been suggested ... youth branch co-ordinator
Jorge Lasso says, there is no need to panic.</I>
<P>
<I>And do the police believe that kids are more violent than ever?
And doctor Clint Davis agrees .... he is the staff psychologist
for the Hamilton Wentworth Roman Catholic Separate School Board:
and part of the reason it rarely occurs in schools ... is due
to the intense focus on the issue; and the success of anti-violence
programs throughout the system. Programs where the message about
retaliatory violence; is made perfectly clear.</I>
<HR>

<H3>Oliviera Fund </H3>

<P>
The Portuguese Information Centre in Hamilton has opened a bank
account to help the Oliviera family with some financial difficulties.
They're welcoming donations from the community at the James and
Barton branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Account
number 45-00814 
<HR>

<H3>Extortion Plea </H3>

<P>
Last week we told you about two teen aged girls from Simcoe charged
with extortion. The 16-year-old has now pleaded guilty to extortion.

<P>
Police say the pair threatened men by saying they'd claim to have
been sexually assaulted unless they handed over money. She'll
be sentenced next Wednesday. 
<P>
The other girl charged with extortion in the case, a 13-year-old,
has been released on bail. She'll be back in court June 12th.
<HR>

<H3>Bain - Bernardo </H3>

<P>
Convicted murderer Paul Bernardo's in the news again. A Toronto
man who has spent five years in prison for a murder he says he
didn't commit, is now pointing a finger at Bernardo. 
<P>
Papers filed with the Ontario Court of Appeal include fresh evidence
in the case of Robert Baltovich who was convicted of second-degree
murder in the presumed death of his girlfriend. 
<P>
Elizabeth Bain vanished in 1990 and her body was never found.
The new evidence submitted last week does not name Bernardo, who
was convicted of killing two Niagara-area teens. But it makes
reference to evidence presented at a trial concerning the Scarborough
rapist. 
<P>
Bernardo has admitted to a string of assaults blamed on the Scarborough
rapist -- the last, about the time Bain vanished. 
<HR>

<H3>Simcoe Fatals </H3>

<P>
A two car collision south of Simcoe claimed the lives to two people
today. The names of the occupants have not been released pending
notification of next of kin. 
<P>
Ontario Provincial Police say the accident happened before the
noon hour on east quarter line road south of Highway 24. 
<HR>

<H3>Mcdonough - Hamilton </H3>

<P>
There is a by-election in the federal riding of Hamilton east
because of Sheila Copps' stand on the GST. She admits her government
hasn't done anything about scrapping the tax and has put her career
and reputation on the line seeking a new mandate from voters.
But New Democrats say a vote for Sheila is a another vote for
the hated tax. 
<P>
And today, federal leader Alexa Mcdonough joined candidate Wayne
Marston in unveiling the New Democrats' view of taxation. Mcdonough
says the Copps name is not enough to ensure electoral victory
in Hamilton east. 
<HR>

<H3>Anti-Copps Signs </H3>

<P>
Here's the latest in the anti-Sheila equals anti-government sign
war. This billboard by the National Citizens Coalition is just
one of many that have popped up over the last few days in east
Hamilton. 
<P>
The coalition has launched a 20-thousand dollar campaign against
the former deputy p.m. The campaign includes radio spots along
with the billboard suggesting Copps lied to voters about scrapping
the GST when she ran for election in 1993. 
<P>
Copps resigned last month to keep a promise to quit if the GST
was not scrapped. 
<HR>

<H3>Business-First </H3>

<P>
Stock prices and the Canadian dollar strengthened today as interest
yields in bond markets edged lower. 
<P>
Toronto Dominion Bank reported a big increase in its latest financial
results. Many of Canada's leading financial advisors have contributed
their advice to a money planning guide. 
<HR>

<H3>Skilled Labor </H3>

<P>
The dawning of a new century may turn out to be the beginning
of a skilled labour crisis in Hamilton Wentworth. A new report
warns that as baby boomers begin to retire the area's employment
scene will face a shortage of skilled laborers ...Jamie West reports...

<P>
<I>A regular breakfast meeting at the Hamilton and District Chamber
of Commerce was the place to unveil Skillscape 96 a report produced
by local training broker TranSkills. </I>
<P>
<I>The report says that businesses have been too slow to ensure
they employ the type of multifaceted and flexible workers required
in today's marketplace. The report says government and the education
system have only paid lip service to training students in the
skill they need to compete.</I>
<P>
<I>Ron Wallace helps teach business operators and entrepreneurs
to adapt to the new world... simply put, in a world where the
technological innovation cycle has shrunk from five years a decade
ago to six months today, the workforce wants people who are skilled
at acquiring skills ... </I>
<HR>

<H3>Experience Canada </H3>

<P>
An employment outlook survey for this summer says jobs will be
hard to find in Hamilton. The Manpower Temporary Services report
says none of the area employers interviewed plans to hire any
workers over the next few months. 
<P>
But at least 500 unemployed or underemployed Canadians will get
a chance to learn some job skills and see another part of the
country under a new federal program. <I>Experience Canada </I>is
a joint venture of the Liberal government and the Council of Canadian
Unity. Participants from all parts of the country will take part
in a 10 month program aimed at helping them launch their careers.

<H3>Murder Update</H3>

<P>
We begin tonight with the question why? Why did a young Hamilton
man end up dead after a school yard spat? 
<P>
Yesterday we told you about the 15-year-old charged with second-degree
murder after 18-year-old Roberto Oliveira was beaten to death
with a baseball bat. Tonight why and how could this happen. Lauran
Sabourin reports that the violence that killed young Roberto earlier
this week is frighteningly more common than any of us would like
to think. 
<P>
<I>A crowd of students were gathered outside St. Jean Brebeuf
High School this morning. The only topic of conversation was the
battle that ended with the death of one friend. The incarceration
of another. </I>
<P>
<I>One teen who didn't want to be identified witnessed the fight
at Limeridge Monday night. Killed was 18 year old Roberto Oliveira.
A 15 year old has been charged with his murder. </I>
<P>
<I>These students say that solving disputes with weapons is more
common than you think. Students use weapons as tools of intimidation.
</I>
<P>
<I>The school board has sent crisis counselors to the school.
Counselors who are seeing tensions spilling over into violence
more often.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Manning-Hamilton </H3>

<P>
At Scott Park Secondary School, students are advocating a get-tough
approach to teen-aged criminals. Reform party leader Preston Manning
made a stop there today while campaigning for local candidate
Andy Sweck, who's running in the Hamilton east by-election. Anthony
Pooley reports. 
<P>
<I>The one thing that Reform party leader Preston Manning likes
to point out when he's talking about youth crime is that the victims
of teen-aged criminals are usually teenagers themselves. This
assembly at Scott Park Secondary School is a good case in point...
the vast majority of these kids support the notion of a Young
Offenders Act that's much tougher on teen-aged criminals. </I>
<P>
<I>Earlier, he took a giant step onto traditionally Liberal turf...
as he met with polish business leaders at a Barton Street restaurant.
At both venues, he said that the by-election is about jobs, crime,
and most importantly, political accountability. He also said that
there is virtually no possibility of Reformers and Tories formally
uniting... but he told reporters later that he'll give consideration
to the situation in Brant, where the two parties have decided
to nominate a single candidate. </I>
<P>
<I>This is Manning's second trip thus far in this by-election
campaign.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Niagara Teachers </H3>

<P>
Last-ditch talks continue in a bid to avoid a strike by separate
school teachers in Lincoln County. More than 500 teachers are
poised to walk off the job Saturday. 
<P>
Board spokesman Pat Pacecca says if there is a strike they would
be forced to close all of the board's schools because they couldn't
guarantee the safety of the students. Pacecca also says letters
are being prepared for parents explaining what will happen with
final exams, marks and graduation exercises if the teachers do
walk out. 
<P>
A strike would affect 91-hundred students. 
<P>
Meanwhile, teachers at the Lincoln County Public School Board
have ratified a new contract that calls for a continued salary
freeze. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Stock prices moved lower again today after interest yields on
government bonds moved higher. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened. 
<P>
Royal Bank became the third big Canadian bank to report another
strong quarter of improving profits. 
<P>
And the wireless communications industry in Canada is booming
with a shortage of engineers to fill existing job openings. 
<HR>

<H3>Smoke Free </H3>

<P>
You may find it a little bit harder to light up at lunch time
on Friday. Sixteen Hamilton restaurants are set to go smoke free
for the whole day or part of the day. 
<P>
As Jamie west reports...health services officials and restauranteurs
are viewing the exercise as an experiment... 
<P>
<I>The Regional Health Department may be fanning the flames of
the always smoldering smoke versus non smoke debate...but sixteen
Hamilton restaurants are ready to take part. Health officials
say breathing for one hour in a smoky room can equal as much as
smoking 35 cigarettes. </I>
<P>
<I>At the Portable Feast cafe on Queen Street... owner Misty Ingrahm
thinks her restaurant might go completely non smoking in a few
years... six of her best customers get together here once a month
to ash out the issues of the day ...they're all close cousins,
but sit miles apart on the smoking issue.</I>
<P>
<I>Some restaurants that have traditionally catered to smokers
have butt completely out ...with little pain to their owners pocketbooks.
Lee McBrides in Westdale ...will also take part &quot;in world
no-tobacco day&quot; and the owners say they'd go non smoking
completely if they were confident the patrons would fill the restaurant...
but for now smokers are welcome...</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Council-Beer</H3>

<P>
You may not be able to smoke in restaurants in Hamilton forever,
but you will be able to drink on the links. Last night city council
voted to allow beer and liquor sales on its municipal golf courses.
Ian Dovey reports. 
<P>
<I>Whether it's in celebration or despair golfers at Chedoke and
Kings Forest courses can enjoy a cold beer out in the open and
that pleases some golfers. Council approved a motion to allow
for the sales of beer and alcohol at its city owned courses but
by the narrowest of margins 9 to 8. </I>
<P>
<I>But there are limitations. Sales and consumption of alcoholic
beverages will only be allowed between the ninth and tenth holes,
which is about one hundred feet from the club house. Still, dissenters
say it's too risky.</I>

<HR>

<H3>Health Council</H3>

<P>
The 79 recommendations that comprise the Health Action Task Force
studying the future of Hamilton hospitals went to the vote this
afternoon, it's been a long drawn out process that hasn't ended
yet. 
<HR>

<H3>St. Kitts Strike </H3>

<P>
And the numbers game continues on the education front tonight.
Catholic teachers in Lincoln have scheduled a new round of contract
talks with the board for Thursday, with a strike deadline set
for Saturday. 
<P>
The 550 elementary and secondary teachers agreed to strike after
the board imposed an almost five per cent pay cut. The Ontario
English Catholic Teachers Association says recent board decisions
will result in the loss of seniority rights and the possibility
of layoffs. The teachers have been without a contract since last
August. 
<HR>

<H3>Dead Teacher </H3>

<P>
A memorial service has been held at the Oakville school which
employed a teacher found dead in Quebec last Friday. 
<P>
After searching for the better part of a month, the body of Diane
Cross was found on the balcony of a chalet in the Laurentian Mountains,
north of Montreal. Police do not suspect foul play. 
<P>
She disappeared May first and her family thinks she may have died
of exposure while in a diabetic coma. It's near a summer camp
where she once worked as a counselor and contracted the virus
that led to her diabetic condition. Autopsy results could be released
tomorrow. 
<HR>

<H3>Dunn - Court </H3>

<P>
26-year-old William Paul Dunn of St. Catharines was remanded in
custody until June 14th for a bail hearing when he appeared in
court today. 
<P>
He is accused of second-degree murder in the beating death of
two-year-old Timothy Jackson. The toddler was rushed to hospital
late Friday night after a 9-1-1 call said he had drowned in a
bathtub. An autopsy revealed the boy had suffered severe head
injuries. Dunn was the boy's official guardian. 
<HR>

<H3>Regal Death </H3>

<P>
The name of a man found dead outside the Regal Hotel in downtown
Hamilton early yesterday has been released. 
<P>
Police say 25-year-old Christopher Paquet was laying on the sidewalk
below a window to his third floor room. Foul play is not suspect.
The police, however, are trying to determine Paquet's whereabouts
prior to his death. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First</H3>

<P>
It was a quiet day on Canadian financial markets because banks,
government offices, and markets in the United States were closed
for Memorial Day. 
<P>
Canadian share prices and our dollar strengthened slightly. 
<P>
More and more investors are getting their stock picks from the
Internet, but experts warn it might not be very reliable. 
<HR>

<H3>Truck Inspections </H3>

<P>
Transportation minister Al Palladini is cracking down on unsafe
trucks. Truck drivers and owners will face hefty fines and demerit
points for operating defective rigs. As Lauran Sabourin reports
inspection teams are out on the highways pulling over suspect
transports. 
<P>
<I>For the next two days truckers driving the QEW through Niagara
may be pulled over for a random inspection. Lights that don't
work. Tires that don't have enough tread. Defective brake lines.
Inspectors are looking for anything that may impair the operation
of vehicle. </I>
<P>
<I>At the spot check in Vineland this morning, thirty percent
of the trucks stopped had defects. At another check up the road
60 percent of trucks failed inspection. </I>
<P>
<I>OPP officers were ordering suspect transports in for inspection.
Everything was being looked at. Chains that weren't secure. Logs
that don't' add up. Truckers are being targeted for inspections
because of a series of fatal mishaps two years ago. It's hoped
that these random spot-checks will encourage truckers to more
diligent about safety.</I>

<H3>Allergy Season </H3>

<P>
Now that we've chalked up one of the longest winters in history,
get ready for one of the worst allergy seasons ever. 
<P>
Golden horseshoe allergists are warning hay fever sufferers to
shut their doors and windows and run for the medicine cabinet.
So if your eyes are watering and itchy, and your nose running,
and the sneezing is driving you crazy, it could be the trees and
plants playing catch up. They're releasing twice the normal amount
of pollen into the air while they do it. Jamie West reports. 
<P>
<I>For most of us the on-set of spring is a walk in the park yet
for others it can be blooming miserable. This year's allergy season
promises to be a bad one. </I>
<P>
<I>Allergic rhinitis or hay fever is a more prevalent chronic
disease, outranking even heart disease. And it appears that allergies
are on the rise, increasing 25 percent each decade. </I>
<P>
<I>Research shows that hay fever is responsible for half a million
lost work days in Canada and an equal number of missed school
days. And the use of over the counter nasal sprays for long periods
of time can do more harm than good. </I>
<P>
<I>And look on the bright side, the first frost is only about
5 months away.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton East </H3>

<P>
For the first time in two and a half years, Canadians appear to
be losing their confidence in prime minister Chretien. The PM's
approval rating has dropped to 47 percent, compared to 36 percent
who disapprove. Seventeen percent had no feeling one way or the
other. But, as Dwight Ryan reports, the true test of the liberals'
popularity comes on June 17th. 
<P>
<I>Prime minister Chretien says he doesn't work around polls,
he just does his job. He adds his government is doing reasonably
well. Still its the first time since 1993 that Chretien's approval
rating has fallen below fifty percent. </I>
<P>
<I>Sheila Copps gave up her post as deputy prime minister saying
she'd broken her promise on the GST. The Gallup poll results don't
phase her and many believe her return to parliament will be a
cake walk. </I>
<P>
<I>12 candidates will face Copps in the June vote. New democrat
Wayne Marston has lost to Copps before. This time he says its
a horse race. Hamilton East voters will determine who wins the
battle June 17th.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Youth Threats </H3>

<P>
Just yesterday we told you about a 14-year-old Oakville teen who
stands accused of murdering another 14-year-old and comes amid
reports of a general increase in crime among the young. Now word
that a 17-year-old Oakville youth has been convicted of phoning
bomb threats to the Atlantic City International Airport. 
<P>
The teen and a 16-year-old accomplice were charged after calls
to the busy New Jersey Airport were traced to pay phones in Oakville
last May. The calls were made just after the bombing of the federal
building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. One flight was
canceled because of the threats. 
<P>
The 16-year-old pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to
four months in prison. The 17-year-old is to be sentenced July
13th. 
<HR>

<H3>Teen Extortion </H3>

<P>
In Simcoe two teenage girls are facing extortion charges. Haldimand-Norfolk
Region police say two victims were told that if they didn't give
the girls money, the teens would go to police and tell them they
had been sexually assaulted. 
<P>
The girls are aged 13 and 16. Police say one of the victims had
already made several payments. The accused, who can't be identified
because of their ages, go before a judge today for a bail hearing.

<HR>

<H3>Stalker Charged </H3>

<P>
And a 30-year-old Burlington man will appear in court next Wednesday,
after children were stalked on their way home from school. 
<P>
Halton Regional Police say they were followed by a man in a green
car last month. There were no attempts to abduct or harm the students.
Steven Andrew Dikens has been charged with five counts of criminal
harassment. 
<HR>

<H3>St. Kitts Police </H3>

<P>
A crackdown on biker gangs and five murder investigations have
eaten up the entire overtime budget for the Niagara region police
force. The force set aside only 188-thousand dollars for overtime
this year -- about half of last year's total. 
<P>
The biker raids and subsequent investigations used up 70-thousand
dollars of the overtime kitty. The murder cases burned up the
rest. There was only one killing in Niagara last year. 
<HR>

<H3>Hamilton Rescue </H3>

<P>
It was an unusual rescue operation for some Hamilton firefighters.
An eight-year-old boy, stuck in a washing machine. 
<P>
Captain Wayne Hammond says the boy climbed into the machine last
night while his mother was doing laundry in their apartment building
and wrapped himself in a circle around the agitator. 
<P>
Hammond says it took a few minutes to get him out by &quot;helping
him bend the proper way.&quot; The boy was unhurt. 
<HR>

<H3>High School Hooky </H3>

<P>
And about 500 Hamilton high school students had a little explaining
to do. Half the students at Sir Allan MacNab High School played
hooky yesterday, skipping a day-long conference on multiculturalism
and anti-racism. 
<P>
Principal Trish Fulton says parents will be asked to explain the
students' absence. She says a number of parents did call to say
they didn't want their children attending a mandatory multicultural
conference. Fulton says it seems there's a backlash against racial
equity. 
<HR>

<H3>Commission Closes </H3>

<P>
Ontario's Human Rights Commission is closing five offices across
the province, including one in St. Catharines. The commission
also intends to freeze hiring and set up four 1-800 numbers across
Ontario to handle all complaints about discrimination and racism.

<P>
Offices will also be closing in Kitchener, Kenora, Sault Ste.
Marie and Toronto all to make up for a 700 thousand dollar funding
cut from the Tory government. 
<HR>

<H3>Scout Parade </H3>

<P>
If you're planning a trip to downtown Hamilton tomorrow be prepared
for gridlock around Main Street. About eight thousand boy and
girl scouts will flood the downtown for their 58th annual parade.

<P>
The group assembles at Victoria Park at 8:45 a.m., travels south
on Locke to Main and then past the reviewing stand at Hamilton
City Hall. 
<P>
Scouts Canada expects a record number of bands and floats. All
participants donate items to the good turn food drive.

<H3>Foreman Verdict 2 </H3>

<P>
Every day for the past month, they have driven from the tiny village
of Clifford, Ontario, to Hamilton, to hear testimony at the trial
of the man accused of killing one of their own. And today, the
friends and family of Joan Heimbecker wept and embraced each other,
as 25-year-old Rory Foreman was found guilty of first-degree murder.

<P>
Foreman himself showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict.
But he apologized to everyone in the courtroom for taking Joan's
life, and for the ordeal he put her friends and family through.
Deborah Walker reports.
<P>
<I>25-year-old Joan Heimbecker, a bright and beautiful McMaster
University graduate student, died of multiple gunshot wounds in
her university residence two years ago. Her ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old
Rory Foreman, remained impassive as the jury foreman rose and
pronounced him guilty of first-degree murder. </I>
<P>
<I>Before he was sentenced, Foreman apologized to Joan's parents
and sister. He told the court: &quot;it was a selfish, cruel and
cowardly act ... and I'm sorry for what I've done.&quot; &quot;I
guess it's true... you only hurt the ones you love.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Outside the court, Joan's room-mate, Nicki Hodges, said she
was relieved at the verdict, but unmoved by Foreman's apology.
During the trial, Nicki delivered a harrowing eyewitness account
of the night she watched Rory Foreman pump six shotgun blasts
at Joan Heimbecker. </I>
<P>
<I>It took the jury twelve hours to reach a verdict, although
many had expected a much quicker decision. Lawyers on both side
believe jurors struggled with the question of whether Foreman
really intended to kill Joan. Foreman's lawyer remains convinced
his client is not as evil as the deed he executed, and that Foreman
did not intend to kill Joan Heimbecker.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Burloak Murder Follow</H3>

<P>
And in Burlington today a 14 year old has been charged with the
first degree murder of another 14 year old. 
<P>
Police say it appears Lee Doherty was beaten to death with a blunt
object. His body was found yesterday in a wooded section of a
Burlington park. Kathy Renwald reports. 
<P>
<I>Friends of 14 year old Lee Doherty of Burlington made a tearful
visit looking for the place he was murdered. At the same time
at the Milton Courthouse another 14 year old Burlington boy faced
first degree murder charges in Doherty's death. </I>
<P>
<I>The shocking crime was the talk of the housing complex where
Lee Doherty lived. The park where Lee Doherty's body was found
is well known to kids in the housing complex. </I>
<P>
<I>16 year old Skip Tuck was a friend of Lee Doherty's.  He led
us to the place where kids party by the fire pit ..a few steps
away from where Doherty's beaten body was found in a cement culvert.
</I>
<P>
<I>Across from where the victim and his father lived.. neighbours
gathered. </I>
<P>
<I>The 14 year old charged with first degree murder was remanded
until May 29th.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Most Wanted </H3>

<P>
Crime Stoppers in Hamilton- Wentworth is looking for a man wanted
for breaching conditions of his parole. 
<P>
27-year-old David Gillan was serving time for 24 counts of break
and enter charges and was released in December. Gillan is 6-feet
tall, weighs about 200 pounds, with short brown hair, hazel eyes
and a pale complexion. 
<P>
If you have any information or have seen this man, you are asked
to call police or Crime Stoppers. 
<HR>

<H3>Camper Burns </H3>

<P>
Residents of a St. Catharines neighbourhood fled their homes last
night as police tried to negotiate with a man who wanted to set
fire to a camper trailer, parked beside a house. 
<P>
At one point, the man turned on a propane cylinder, filling the
camper with gas. It exploded, throwing him out of the trailer.
He's being treated in Hamilton for serious burns to his arms and
legs. 
<P>
The Ontario fire Marshall's office is investigating the incident.

<HR>

<H3>Triplex Fire </H3>

<P>
And another St. Catharines man is in the burn unit at Hamilton
General Hospital after fire broke out in a triplex early this
morning. 
<P>
23 year old Ted Marks suffered serious burns to much of his body,
and cuts after smashing through a back window to safety. His 21
year old roommate managed to escape without injury. 
<P>
Niagara Regional Police were called in after firefighters found
80 marijuana plants in an upper apartment. Investigators are still
trying to figure out what sparked the fire, which caused 57-thousand
dollars in damage.

<H3>RPN's / Generics </H3>

<P>
Unregulated assistive personnel,... clinical associates,... patient
care &quot;partners...&quot; they all mean the same thing. ...generic
health care workers that will replace some skilled registered
nurses in hospitals all over Hamilton Wentworth. they're coming
to save money, but not everyone welcomes them, as we hear from
Jamie West... 
<P>
<I>That's how many nurses feel about being teamed up with unskilled
underlings, who will be paid about a third of what nurses earn.
</I>
<P>
<I>Generic workers will be trained intensively for about 8 weeks,
in very specific duties... nurses complain that having to manage
generics will take them away from the bedside too often and could
cause them to miss the subtle signs of a patient who may be close
to crisis. </I>
<P>
<I>Hospital managers think the opposite will happen.. another
sore spot with RN's is the fear of being laid off and then being
hired back as a generic worker for a lot less money.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
The Canadian dollar lost a bit of value today along with stocks
as Canadian government bonds fell.

Some retail analysts say toy prices could drop because of a US

<H3>Foreman Verdict? </H3>

<P>
Did he intend to kill Joan Heimbecker or was it unplanned and
in the heat of passion? The jury is still out in the Rory Foreman
murder trial. they retired to reach a verdict late this morning.

<HR>

<H3>Hospitals Update </H3>

<P>
Hamilton's future health care system is also on trial right now.

<P>
Forget the Health Action Task Force report and adopt the Academic
Health Care Network report ... that sentiment is growing in Hamilton
less than a week before the District Health Council sends its
final recommendations for healthcare reform to Queen's Park. 
<P>
Doctor's and CEO's have been lobbying council members and as Jamie
West reports...., now the business community is jumping on board
as well... 
<P>
<I>A full page add appearing in the first section of the Hamilton
Spectator boldly shouts out ...Hamilton Wentworth deserves better.
It's referring to healthcare reform. and is signed by over 150
business and community leaders. While one section over an ad appears
seeking a C.E.O. for a merged Hamilton Civics and Chedoke McMaster
hospital. </I>
<P>
<I>Healthcare reform has been a hot topic for months but now the
community led by well known philanthropist Morgan Firestone is
stepping forward...they say the only report worth considering
is the one drafted by the Academic Health Care Network, one that
keeps all of Hamilton's hospitals open while still meeting the
fiscal goals of a reduced provincial healthcare budget. </I>
<P>
<I>The Health Action Task Force reports calls for the closure
of one unspecified acute care hospital. That move would leave
Hamilton with 16 percent less acute care funding than Toronto...14
percent less than London... even though Hamiltonians would be
taxed just as much. </I>
<P>
<I>Hamilton Wentworth regional council last night passed a resolution
to endorse the C.E.O.' s report and it's amendments to keep the
Henderson's ER open and provide adequate beds for cancer patients.
</I>
<P>
<I>The District Health Council will vote Monday on whether to
accept the Health Action Task Force recommendations, the Academic
Health Care Network report or a combination of both.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Highway Six Stats </H3>

<P>
Forget about calling highway six the killer highway. An OPP officer
says it's no more dangerous than any other highway. 
<P>
Instead, constable Glenn Bell says driver error is to blame for
nearly all of the crashes on highway 6. His comment comes after
another fatal crash, the sixth death this year, on the stretch
between highways 401 and 403. 
<HR>

<H3>Grand Flooding </H3>

<P>
Police and conservation officials say no fishing no canoeing...in
fact don't go near the grand river or its waterways right now.

<P>
A flood warning remains in effect for areas along the river, from
Kitchener right through to Lake Erie. Recent storms have elevated
water levels. Some flooding is expected in some of the low-lying
areas near the river which is expected to crest in and around
Caledonia tonight, Dunnville tomorrow. 
<HR>

<H3>Tornado Update </H3>

<P>
Power is still out in parts of Nanticoke after Monday's severe
storm. The worst hit area is an industrial park. Ontario Hydro
says it may be Friday before power is restored to all the plants
in the area. 
<P>
Meanwhile, Environment Canada officials are still trying to determine
whether it was a tornado that touched down in east Hamilton Monday
night. Officials say the damage may have been caused by a downburst
of strong winds which descend from a thunderstorm and spread across
an area. 
<P>
Dumpsters by the dozens are being filled as cleanup and repairs
continue to a number of homes and businesses struck by the Victoria
Day storm. 
<HR>

<H3>Bedtime Birdies </H3>

<P>
Even inside every storm cloud there's a silver lining...at least
for a pair of baby birds in Dundas. Their whose home was blown
from a backyard birch tree and they appeared to be abandoned and
destined for certain death, from starvation. But a quick thinking
good Samaritan moved their nest ...next to that of another robin
in the neighbourhood. Her maternal instincts took over and now
her newly adopted babies, are doing fine. 
<HR>

<H3>Kitchen Garden </H3>

<P>
By now, most of us have been out dabbling in the dirt, trying
to create a piece of garden magic. But imagine trying to recreate
a piece of history. That's what members of the Garden Club of
Hamilton are doing at Dundurn Castle. Annette Hamm explains. 
<P>
<I>Now that the outside of Hamilton's Dundurn Castle is restored,
work has started to put the former home of Sir Allan MacNab in
a proper setting. Two ornamental gardens on the north lawn of
the castle mimic what might have grown there decades ago. MacNab
was a garden enthusiast; one of the first people he hired upon
building the home was a master gardener from Scotland. </I>
<P>
<I>Now volunteers from the Garden Club of Hamilton carry on the
work, under the guidance of Dr. Leslie Laking, a former director
of the Royal Botanical Gardens. He drew up the plans for the ornamental
beds and for this miniature version of MacNab's kitchen garden.
The original filled an acre and a half ... this one will supply
the castle with dried flowers for winter arrangements, and vegetables
for their kitchen program. </I>
<P>
<I>The plants were started back in February at the Gage Park greenhouses,
from historical seeds purchased in Pennsylvania. Eventually, the
grounds will feature more of the plants enjoyed during a gardening
boom one hundred and 40 years ago. </I>
<P>
<I>The gardens will be weeded and watered over the summer by junior
volunteers at Dundurn Castle.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Shaw - Niagara </H3>

<P>
Tonight is the grand opening of the Shaw Festival's 1996 season.
Every summer the Shaw brings about 300 thousand theatre goers
to historic Niagara-on-the -Lake. And as Lauran Sabourin reports
they leave about 70 million dollars behind after the final curtain.

<P>
<I>Some last minute housecleaning in the old town before the grand
opening. Local hotels are booked. Lunch hour at the Prince of
Wales greenhouse dining room was busy. </I>
<P>
<I>There are three theatres at Shaw. . combined they put on 733
performances each year. The Shaw not only lures tourists who want
to spend money, it's also the largest single employer in the town.
</I>
<HR>

<H3>Trike a Thon </H3>

<P>
And finally tonight we bet there are a lot of tired little ones
from St. Marks pre-school in Dundas. This after they spent the
day wheeling their way around their pre school to raise money
for Ronald McDonald House. 
<P>
This is the sixth year for their trike-a-thon, and with a rough
estimate including today's total they've raised about 85-hundred
dollars to date. The money will be used to provide a comfortable
place to stay for families of sick children.

<H3>Tornado Follow</H3>

<P>
Was it or wasn't it.... a tornado that is. Which ever the case...
mother nature's fury has left a path of destruction and debris
spread across a wide area of southern Ontario. And she even included
a touch of irony when those watching the movie &quot;Twister&quot;
at a drive-in watched in disbelief as the screen was sucked away
before their very eyes. 
<P>
The violent storms that whipped through the region in less than
an hour last night, left many unprepared and today those who were
hit with the blast were calculating the cost of damage, counting
their blessings and cleaning up.. Jamie West reports... 
<P>
<I>City cleanup crews from Hamilton down through Niagara spent
the day restoring the aesthetics of normally quiet neighborhoods.
Evidence of a tornado...maybe, or maybe not. </I>
<P>
<I>Environment Canada says storms like this one can generate winds
just as damaging as a tornado...in this case, officials say winds
easily topped 115 kilometres an hour, and ironically ripped apart
a drive in movie screen in Thorold that was due to show the hit
movie &quot;Twister&quot;. </I>
<P>
<I>Charles Harbon was shocked to see three of his maple trees
topple over into his young neighbor's yard ...he's grateful no
one was hurt. His neighbors are assessing the damage. </I>
<P>
<I>According to Environment Canada, Hamilton sits right on the
edge of a southwestern Ontario tornado belt that has about 25
twister sightings every year. The average is about 85 sightings
across Canada. </I>
<P>
<I>Shelly Dugas's car window blew apart as she drove right into
the storm. South of Hamilton in rural areas... barn's selected
by the storm looked like they'd been bombed. This chicken farm
in Grassie is salvaging live birds after nearly 8000 perished
in the fury.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Foreman Summations </H3>

<P>
The defence calls it a crime of passion, unintentional, unplanned,
and committed while the accused was in a blind rage. But prosecutors
say Rory Foreman was concentrating, and counting when he pumped
six shotgun blasts at his ex-girlfriend, a McMaster University
graduate student. 
<P>
At the outset of his trial in Hamilton, Foreman pleaded guilty
to manslaughter. But the crown insists he's guilty of first-degree
murder. Today, jurors heard closing arguments from both sides.
and tomorrow, they'll begin deliberating their verdict. Deborah
Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Defence lawyer Peter Bawden approached the jury with a warning.
He said: &quot;However distasteful you may find Rory Foreman,
and however much you may hate him... it cannot be proven that
he intended to kill Joan Heimbecker.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Bawden says at some point, everybody has felt a rage so great
that they lost control of themselves, and said or did something
they never intended to do. Bawden says that's what happened to
Rory Foreman the night of March 30th, 1994, when Joan Heimbecker
rebuffed his attempts at a reconciliation. Bawden says for Foreman,
it was a crisis of confidence, as he lost not just a girlfriend,
but a way of life he aspired to. </I>
<P>
<I>Bawden says Foreman never intended, or planned to kill Joan.
He asked the jury: &quot;If you were stupid enough to plan to
kill someone in their own apartment with witnesses present, do
you suppose you'd waste ten to fifteen minutes terrorizing her
when you could just get the job done and get out?&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>But assistant crown attorney Alexandra Paparella insists Foreman
did have a plan when he packed two duffel bags, gifts for Joan,
and a loaded shotgun in the rented car he drove to McMaster University.
Paparella says the plan was a simple one. &quot;She was going
to take him back, or die.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>And Paparella says the very fact Joan's room-mate watched Foreman
fire six shotgun blasts at her friend, is proof he knew what he
was doing. Paparella says Foreman... &quot;chose not to shoot
Nicki Hodges. The reason he did not is that he was in control,
concentrating his actions on Joan Heimbecker.... his every movement
was deliberate and calculated...&quot; requiring fifteen separate
actions to fire five more rounds after the first shot missed.
</I>
<P>
<I>Defence lawyer Peter Bawden suggested if someone intends to
kill, they must have a reason to kill. Bawden says Foreman didn't
attain a single thing by killing Joan Heimbecker. But Alexandra
Paparella told the jury Foreman's objective was simple. She said:
&quot;Joan Heimbecker was a beautiful, attractive, very intelligent,
outgoing woman with lots of friends. She was as close to perfect
as Rory Foreman was going to get. On the other hand, Rory Foreman
was a possessive, controlling man. And if he couldn't have her,
no one would.&quot;</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Stabbing </H3>

<P>
Hamilton police have laid charges against a 30 year old man after
a 36 year old woman was stabbed in a Wellington Street North apartment
building elevator. She was taken to hospital for treatment. her
wounds are not serious.
<HR>

<H3>Kempling Obit </H3>

<P>
The man who represented Burlington in the house of commons for
21 years died yesterday. Bill Kempling was 76. 
<P>
He was first elected as a Progressive Conservative in 1972, leaving
politics in 1993. 
<P>
Bill Kempling is resting at Dodsworth and Brown Funeral Home in
Burlington. Funeral services will be conducted at St. Paul's United
Church in Dundas Friday afternoon. 
<HR>

<H3>Taro-Council </H3>

<P>
Four members of Stoney Creek city council have stated their opposition
to the proposed Taro landfill site. 
<P>
Councilors Georgina Beattie, Doug Conley, Paul Miller and deputy
mayor Grant Shaw have requested the environment minister refer
the east quarry plan to the Environmental Assessment Board for
a full hearing. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Canadian stock prices soared to new record highs again today.
However the dollar weakened, falling below 73 cents US. 
<P>
These latest developments stem from today's policy committee meeting
of the American Central Bank which decided not to change US interest
rates. That is leading to speculation that Canadian interest rates
could drop further. 
<HR>

<H3>Debit Card </H3>

<P>
New statistics show the popularity of debit cards is skyrocketing
in Canada. As more consumers use them, more merchants are offering
the direct payment service. 
<P>
The use of Interac direct payment almost doubled in the first
quarter of 1996 to 130 million transactions. 
<HR>

<H3>Waterdown Fireworks </H3>

<P>
Bad weather put a damper on Victoria Day celebrations in Waterdown
last night. So the Optimist Club of Waterdown has rescheduled
their fireworks display for this evening. 
<P>
The show begins at dusk at Memorial Park in Waterdown. The Optimist
Club tells us the carnival will also be set up again tonight.

<HR>

<H3>Red Cross Appeal </H3>

<P>
Well after the long weekend, blood banks are getting dangerously
low. 
<P>
Aside from the permanent clinic on King Street, the Hamilton Red
Cross has scheduled two mobile clinics tomorrow at the Grimsby
Senior Citizen's Centre from 1:30 to 8 PM and Thursday at the
Dundas Community Centre from 2 to 8. 
<P>
They're especially low in &quot;o rh+&quot;, &quot;o rh-&quot;
and &quot;b rh-&quot;.

<H3>Victoria Day </H3>

<P>
A day once simply known as &quot;firecracker day&quot;. May 24th
is the birthday of the long-reigning Queen Victoria ...a monarch
who became identified with an era. 
<P>
For convenience, the holiday has been moved to the third Monday
in May, and as Alex Reynolds reports, we are involved in a wide
variety of activities. 
<P>
<I>It isn't necessarily a do-nothing day. As the first long-weekend
of the young summer, people were very active....cottage opening
time ....planting the garden...opening the swimming pool ...yard
cleanup ...and purchasing fireworks. </I>
<P>
<I>As well as stores, the tightly regulated pyro materials were
on sale in large trailers favored by service clubs. </I>
<P>
<I>The area's major organized fireworks display was postponed.
Scheduled for Dundas Driving Park, officials feared the soggy
ground would have turned into a muddy quagmire with the thousands
expected to attend. Canada Day or the Cactus Festival is an alternative
consideration. Weather permitting, a pyrotechnics display was
listed for Memorial Park in Waterdown. </I>
<P>
<I>Gardening and sprucing up the property is top-of-the-agenda
on Victoria Day weekend, particularly this year. </I>
<P>
<I>For refreshment, most had stocked up, as government outlets
are closed, but one suds store was doing business on this holiday.
</I>
<P>
<I>It's been a full weekend, good and bad weather, much to do...but
as always, Victoria Day signals the start of &quot;the good ol'
summertime.&quot;</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Fireworks Fire </H3>

<P>
Fireworks sparked a fire in a Hamilton apartment building last
night. 
<P>
Two girls, aged 13 and 16, had ignited sparklers in the Oxford
Street apartment. Assuming they were fully extinguished, the youngsters
went out to the balcony, later to discover a major blaze had started
inside. 
<P>
Damage is estimated at sixty thousand dollars. There were no injuries.

<HR>

<H3>St. Kitts Storm </H3>

<P>
Mother Nature provided her own fireworks on this Victoria Day
holiday. Violent thunderstorms rolled across the province this
weekend. Lighting strikes knocked power in St. Catharines this
morning. Lauran Sabourin has more. 
<P>
<I>St. Catharines Hydro crews were working overtime today. Just
after seven this morning lighting struck a power line on Glendale
Avenue and knocked out electricity to the south end of the city.</I>
<P>
<I>Fortunately this was a holiday: traffic signals weren't functioning.
Crews had the power restored to the neighborhoods within four
hours.</I> 
<P>
Meanwhile, residents in east Hamilton were coping with sporadic
power outages this morning as well. Lightning from the storm hit
transformers around the Mount Albion Road area and power was off
for about two hours.
<HR>

<H3>York/403 Mishap</H3>

<P>
Believe it or not, no one was seriously injured this afternoon
when a car spun out of control and flipped on Highway 403 near
York Boulevard in Hamilton. 
<P>
The car landed on its roof... and two occupants were rushed to
hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Provincial police
are investigating. No word on why the driver may have lost control.

<HR>

<H3>Gypsy Arrest </H3>

<P>
Last week we told you about how tourists are being targeted by
professional pickpockets in Niagara Falls. This afternoon police
arrested two women and a man believed to be involved in a pick-pocketing
ring. 
<P>
The suspects were apprehended near the Brock Hotel. Police say
professional thieves are so good at what they do they can steal
a wallet out of a bag before the tourist is even aware that they've
been victimized. 
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Banks, government offices, and financial markets were closed in
Canada for Victoria Day. 
<P>
In New York, the value of stocks roared to new record highs as
American interest rates look like they are not increasing right
now. 
<P>
Iraq and the United Nations signed a deal to allow Iraq to sell
oil to the rest of the world again. 
<HR>

<H3>Turmel Runs </H3>

<P>
A couple of parachute fringe candidates in the Hamilton East federal
by- election filed nomination papers today. 
<P>
One of them is John &quot;the engineer&quot; Turmel ... a man
who has made a second career out of running for public office.
This will be his forty-first independent candidacy... and he's
seeking his place in the Guinness Book of World Records for that
milestone. 
<P>
The other is Charles Olito... a Woodville man contesting the race
on behalf of the Canada Party. Both candidates advocate different
brands of monetary and fiscal reform.

<H3>Foreman Legal</H3>

<P>
A jury is expected to begin deliberating the fate of 25-year-old
Rory Foreman next Wednesday. Foreman is on trial in Hamilton for
the first-degree murder of his ex-girlfriend, a McMaster University
graduate student. 
<P>
Today, the judge informed the jury lawyers have now finished presenting
their evidence. And as Deborah Walker reports, the judge also
gave jurors a warning about testimony they heard yesterday. 
<P>
<I>At the outset of his trial, Rory Foreman pleaded guilty to
manslaughter, admitting he killed Joan Heimbecker by shooting
her repeatedly with a shotgun in her McMaster University residence.
But the crown rejected the plea, and the defence claim that the
shooting was unintentional. </I>
<P>
<I>Instead, prosecutors elected to proceed with a first-degree
murder case against Rory Foreman. The seven-man, five-woman jury
heard three weeks of testimony, including an eyewitness account
from Joan Heimbecker's room-mate, who watched Foreman fire six
shotgun blasts at her friend. Four of them hit Joan. Jurors also
watched graphic autopsy photographs projected onto a large screen,
and listened to Foreman himself for a day-and-a-half, as he took
the witness stand in his own defence. </I>
<P>
<I>This morning, mister justice Paul Philip called jurors into
the courtroom to issue a warning about a defence witness who testified
yesterday. During cross-examination by assistant crown attorney
Alexandra Paparella, the witness said his friend Foreman could
not obtain a firearms acquisition certificate, because he would
need a clean record. Today, justice Philip told the jury Rory
Foreman pleaded guilty to a minor criminal offense in 1993, and
was granted a conditional discharge, which is not the same as
a criminal conviction, and does not result in a criminal record.
</I>
<P>
<I>The judge warned the jury: &quot;this is the only occasion
mister Foreman has been before the courts prior to this case,
and you must ignore the comment made by the witness during your
deliberations.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>Before sending them home for the long weekend, justice Philip
told the jurors all the evidence is now in. They will hear closing
arguments from defence and crown lawyers on Tuesday, followed
by legal instructions from the judge. And sometime on Wednesday,
the jurors will retire to consider their verdict.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Bar Fight </H3>

<P>
Two men have been treated in hospital after an early morning bar-room
brawl at the Embassy Club in downtown Hamilton. 
<P>
One needed 10 stitches on his face, the other suffered bruises
to his face and upper body. The pair say they were assaulted by
four or five other men who punched, kicked and hit them with beer
bottles. Police are still investigating. 
<HR>

<H3>Donut Fight </H3>

<P>
Police also looking for a suspect after a slashing in a donut
shop parking lot. A patrol sergeant noticed two men fighting at
a downtown Hamilton Tim Horton's, then saw one of them take off
in a white van. The other man needed 16 stitches to his forehead
from a knife wound. 
<HR>

<H3>Stolen Van </H3>

<P>
A rough ride for two suspects after police tried to pull them
over early this morning in Hamilton for erratic driving. They
sped away, and ended up snapping the front axle of their van when
they tried to turn a corner too quickly. 
<P>
An 18 year old passenger was found hiding in the parking garage
at St. Joseph's Hospital. He's been charged with breach of probation.
The 17 year old driver, found hiding behind a nearby house, faces
charges of dangerous driving and theft over 5-thousand dollars.

<HR>

<H3>School Theft </H3>

<P>
A 15 year old has been charged after a break in at Lincoln Alexander
School on Hamilton mountain. 
<P>
After an alarm, police arrived to find a window smashed and teenager
running from the building. They found him hiding behind a nearby
car with some audio visual equipment. the teen has been charged
with break, enter and theft. 
<HR>

<H3>Heat on Crime </H3>

<P>
Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police together with community partners
are putting the heat on crime. 
<P>
A new initiative was unveiled today to deal with the ever-growing
problem of youth crime and crimes identified with diminishing
the community's quality of life. Things like auto theft, property
theft, vandalism and abuse of the elderly. 
<P>
Three teams of eight officers have been deployed as &quot;divisional
action teams.&quot; Those teams will target specific problems
identified as priorities by the local community. Early results
already show a decrease in car thefts by more than forty percent....

<HR>

<H3>Reform Taro </H3>

<P>
Today is the deadline for public review into the hotly debated
proposal for a Stoney Creek landfill site. It's now up to Ontario
environment minister Brenda Elliot to determine whether or not
a hearing should be called. 
<P>
Taro, owned by Philip Environmental, wants to open a landfill
for non-hazardous industrial waste. The Hamilton Region Conservation
Authority and two citizens groups have requested a hearing under
the Environmental Assessment Act. 
<P>
The Taro proposal has also become a political issue in Ottawa.
It was brought up in the House of Commons this afternoon. 
<HR>

<H3>Academic Health </H3>

<P>
The latest... and maybe the last... volume in the ever- expanding
series on the future of health care in Hamilton was unveiled today.
It breathes new life into Henderson hospital while staying within
tough new provincial spending guidelines. Anthony Pooley reports.

<P>
<I>This is not something one sees every day... or any day for
that matter. Politicians of all stripes gathering at the same
table... and actually agreeing on a plan of action... tight fisted
Tories and free spending socialists of the same mind. </I>
<P>
<I>And on those minds is a plan to keep all of Hamilton's hospitals
open and functioning, within tight fiscal guidelines' with a proposal
hammered out this morning that would see Henderson Hospital operate
a full-fledged emergency facility and 163 acute care beds. </I>
<P>
<I>All here... and some who aren't... are pushing the amended
plan of the Academic Health Care Network... a collaboration among
all of Hamilton's hospitals as well as Mac Health Sciences and
the Victorian Order of Nurses. </I>
<P>
<I>And they're hoping all of that goes a long way toward convincing
the District Health Council to accept the plan. All of this is
understandably confusing... there seems to be a new vision of
the future of health care in Hamilton almost every week. But if
this latest chapter in what is becoming a very large book is accepted,
all of Hamilton's hospitals will remain open and functioning...
with Henderson and St. Joe's off the critical list. </I>
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Prospects of lower Canadian interest rates injected another dose
of confidence into financial markets today. 
<P>
Stocks in Toronto rose to new record highs for the 27th time this
year. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar is stable while interest rates in bond markets
moved lower.

<H3>Foreman Cross </H3>

<P>
An assistant crown attorney today ridiculed Rory Foreman's claim
that he did not intend to kill his ex-girlfriend, even though
he pumped four shotgun blasts into her body. 
<P>
25-year-old Joan Heimbecker, a McMaster University graduate student,
died March 30th, 1994 in her university residence. 
<P>
Foreman, who's now twenty-five, is on trial in Hamilton for first-degree
murder. Deborah Walker reports. 
<P>
<I>Rory Foreman testified yesterday that the first shot he fired
missed Joan Heimbecker, and after that, he lost control and kept
firing, but never intended to kill his ex-girlfriend. </I>
<P>
<I>But under cross- examination, assistant crown attorney Alexandra
Papparella reminded Foreman of what was physically required for
him to fire five more shots. Paparella said: &quot;eject, load,
fire. eject, load, fire. Fifteen movements. Fifteen deliberate
actions to fire off five more rounds. Do you agree to that?&quot;
&quot;Yes I do&quot; answered Foreman. </I>
<P>
<I>Paparella also wanted to know how Foreman could remember what
position Joan Heimbecker was in when he shot her, if he didn't
intend shoot her. Foreman answered: &quot;there was no intent.
I was caught up...out of control...I snapped...I kept firing...
I can just see it in my mind that's all. Everybody's been angry.
It happens.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>When Foreman repeated he was just out of control, Paparella
retorted: &quot;not so out of control sir that you didn't know
when you had fired the last shot.&quot; Because the sixth shell
was never ejected from the shotgun, Paparella suggested: &quot;you
knew you had six rounds. You fired off six rounds, and there was
no reason to eject the sixth shell because you knew you were out
of ammunition.&quot; </I>
<P>
<I>During the afternoon, the defence called Foreman's friends,
who said he lived in poverty in the slums of Kitchener. His first
girlfriend, testified Foreman threatened to kill himself when
she ended their relationship. </I>
<P>
<I>An acquaintance says Foreman called her twice in the hours
before Joan Heimbecker died. She was under the impression he wanted
to go out with her that evening.</I> 
<HR>

<H3>Attempt Murder - Biker </H3>

<P>
An Outlaws motorcycle gang member in St. Catharines has been charged
with attempt murder. 
<P>
Thirty nine year old Thomas Rae Culliton was arrested yesterday
morning as he was exiting a car wash in Welland. 
<P>
The charges relate to an incident last January where a 24 year
old woman was shot in the neck at the home of another Outlaws
gang member Jay Deming. Deming's house was torched two weeks ago,
a day after police announced their crackdown on bikers in the
peninsula. 
<HR>

<H3>Thief Nabbed </H3>

<P>
An elderly couple surprised an intruder in their Hamilton mountain
home yesterday afternoon when they returned to find a man in their
hallway. They tried to nab the man, but he ran out of the house,
carrying a bag. 
<P>
Police caught up with suspect, and recovered a jewelry box belonging
to the couple. Investigators are trying to see if this break and
enter is connected to two similar entries in the area just moments
before. 
<P>
22 year old Louis Joseph Roy of no fixed address is charged with
break and enter, and theft. 
<HR>

<H3>Home Invasion </H3>

<P>
And police are still investigating a home intrusion last night,
in east Hamilton. 
<P>
A man says he was knocked to ground and kicked repeatedly after
opening his apartment door to three masked suspects. A number
of electronic and clothing items were reported stolen. 
<HR>

<H3>Riel Leg Irons </H3>

<P>
A piece of Canadian history is back in the hands of Hamilton Wentworth
Regional Police. 
<P>
Last October at the Rockton Fair, these leg irons, which Louis
Riel wore to the gallows back in the 1880's, were stolen from
a police museum trailer. And yesterday, detectives found them
were they were least expecting them. 
<P>
The historic leg irons are just a small part of the haul police
took in from that raid yesterday. They seized several weapons
from a shed in Hamilton's east end, and from the house in Ancaster
where the irons were found. 15-hundred marijuana plants were also
seized from a hydroponic lab in Flamborough. 
<P>
49 year old Paul Gravelle of Ancaster and 52 year old Stan Jones
of Hamilton face several drug and weapons charges. 67 year old
Donald Hartin of Flamborough also faces drug charges. 
<HR>

<H3>Youth Crime </H3>

<P>
Meanwhile, critics of the Young Offenders Act have more ammunition
to press for changes. 
<P>
A police report says more than four of every 10 people charged
with robbery in metro Toronto last year were between 12 and 17
years old. The Globe and Mail says the statistics will be published
in a report next month. It says that's a big reversal from 1985,
when juveniles accounted for just 21 per cent of robbery suspects.

<P>
And the police figures show it's not a blip. They show a steady
shift toward younger perpetrators of certain types of crime, especially
theft with violence or a threat of violence. The report says the
figures are worrisome because they buck a trend toward lower overall
crime rates.
<HR>

<H3>Business First </H3>

<P>
Rising Canadian stock prices took a breath today, falling in value
for the first time in six days. 
<P>
The Canadian dollar and interest rates remained stable. 
<P>
Inflation in Canada during April was unchanged from March. 
<HR>

<H3>Lions Market </H3>

<P>
A new farmers market has cropped up in Stoney Creek. 
<P>
The town's Lions Club has renovated Stoney Creek's old post office
building to make way for fresh produce and other products. Vendors
are also set up in outdoor stalls in the municipal parking lot
beside the building. 
<P>
The Stoney Creek Lions Farmers Market officially opened today
and will be open for business every Thursday and Saturday from
8 am to 5 PM.
