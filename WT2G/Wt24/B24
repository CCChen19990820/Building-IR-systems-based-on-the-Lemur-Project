 06 Aug 1996 ... from our UK correspondent
<P>
This document states:
<PRE>
-   mammalian input to fish food IS banned
-   The 1988 measures for slaughterhouses were not enforced until 1995, when 50% failed
-   Mammalian input is still permitted for cat and dog food</PRE>

Also, the eradication programme assumed negligible vertical transmission impact and no 
re-infection from contaminated environments.
Here is the voluntary scheme Lacey mentioned. This is an attempt to
bypass the 30 month cull agreed with the EU. Most beef farmers could
effectively opt out of the cull as beef herds have a far lower incidence
of BSE than dairy. However, this may be due to the fact that beef cattle
are usually slaughtered at 3 years and the vast majority of cattle going
down with BSE are 4 to 5 years.

<P>


3 May 1996   ...   The Government announced that proposals have been
issued for consultation for a voluntary scheme under which cattle from
herds that can be identified as low risk on the basis of strict
eligibility criteria may be slaughtered for human consumption over the
age of 30 months . The Mature Beef Assurance Scheme is intended to allow
high quality meat, from specialist, grass-fed herds whose animals mature
later than 30 months, onto the UK market.<P>


Strange that enforcement measures
should suddenly be implemented after 7 years! Possibly they had advance
warning of the BSE to CJD link announced in March 96.  SEAC is totally
controlled by MAFF.

Although the UK Government BSE eradication plan for the EU indicated
that mammalian content for fish feed was banned, none of the other
government documentation does.
<P>
The NFU (National Farmers Union) is
fragmenting, with the beef farmers coming out for stronger measures
against dairy to strengthen  beef prices. This is quite significant
politically as the farming lobby is very influential, its power may
weaken if it splits.

<H3><CENTER>Germany <A NAME="threatens">threatens</A> tougher ban on beef</CENTER></H3>

by Charles Reiss and Flora Hunter<P>

The Evening Standard    ...   Monday, 5 August, 1996<P>

GERMANY tightened the screw over the beef crisis today as ministers met in Bonn to agree a tougher line to counter the new threat of BSE transfer from mother to calf. The new infection route, acknowledged by London last week, has already brought loud calls from Germany for a wider slaughter programme and a stricter ban on the sales of British beef. Today, the Bonn government was poised to confirm the tougher line, spelling an end to John Major's stated aim to have most of the sales ban lifted by November.<P>

In Whitehall, officials denied weekend reports that milk is under new scrutiny as a possible carrier of mad cow disease. The Ministry of Agriculture said that claims that new tests were being done to see if milk could be infected were "rubbish". Such tests, said the ministry, had already been carried out for years and the Government saw no reason to change earlier advice that milk is safe to drink.<P>

There was some consolation for Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg, and for farmers, as the supermarket chains reported that the latest scare did not seem to be deterring shoppers in any large numbers.<P>

Sainsbury's said that, after initial concern, beef sales had gone back up and a Safeway spokesman said: "I think customers tend to believe what scientists tell them rather than what they read in newspaper headlines."<P>

A handful of members of the German parliament and regional politicians called for the sales ban to be extended to cover milk, cheese and yoghurt.<P>

Baerbel Hoehn, minister in North Rhine-Westphalia state, told German radio the European Union had already erred by relaxing its ban on British beef products and should now consider restoring or even tightening its original restrictions.<P>

"We should seriously consider restoring the stricter import ban that used to apply, or possibly extending it to milk products," said the minister, a member of the Green party that is in opposition in Bonn.<P>

Ministers in London hoped and believed, however, that neither the German government nor the EU would take such a hard line. Downing Street said that it would take "some weeks" before a revised slaughter plan, including calves now deemed to be at risk, could be sorted out. There were no plans for any direct contact with the German government in the meantime. Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said that farmers would continue to suffer as long as information emerged through leaks and the crisis was handled through "government by bungle".<P>

Although the link between BSE and dairy products has been dismissed by the Ministry of Agriculture, other scientists have not ruled out the possibility. If milk did become suspect, it could turn a crisis into a catastrophe with huge losses to the dairy industry.

<H3><CENTER>50,000 more cows face <A NAME="slaughter">slaughter</A></CENTER></H3>


 <P>

The Evening Standard    ...   Monday, 5 August, 1996<P>

THE PROSPECT of culling calves, following last week's revelations about BSE, will add to the already widespread disarray in the Government's existing slaughter policy, writes Victor Sebestyen. The admission that BSE can be passed from cow to calf has forced a review of plans to eradicate the disease. As many as 50,000 more cows will need to be killed, according to some estimates, in a complicated procedure involving checking calves' birthdates. Changing the culling rules yet again could force a crisis in an overburdened system.<P>

Four months since it became obvious that thousands of cows would have to be killed, slaughterhouses and incinerators are still not geared up to deal with the job effectively. And farmers are furious with the Ministry of Agriculture for chopping and changing its policies and for leaving it unclear how much compensation is available for culled cows. Many farmers are co-operating only half-heartedly or not at all in the slaughter policy.<P>

The BSE eradication plan, agreed with the EU six weeks ago, falls into two parts. First, cows over 30 months old, those thought to be most at risk of getting BSE, have to be killed. The programme, to cull 750,000 beasts this year, began early in May. So far about 250,000 cows have been killed and burned.

A UK Corespondent    ...   6 Aug 96<P>

Despite the ongoing BSE crisis, the UK Government persists in prioritising commercial interests above eliminating BSE. Potentially contaminated feed is still legally manufactured for carnivores provided that agricultural feed is not produced in the same mill: presumably for the cat and dog feed industry. Additionally, it seems that as late as 2 qtr 1996 cross contamination of feed in mills was still taking place. This information is derived from an extract from the UK Government BSE eradication programme for the EU:<P>

EXTRACT FROM UK BSE ERADICATION PROGRAMME:<P>

6.9.5.  From 29 March 1996 the sale or supply of mammalian meat and bone meal for feeding or for incorporation into feed for any farmed livestock, fish or equine animal was prohibited, as was the incorporation of mammalian meat-and-bone meal into any carnivore diet if livestock feed is produced on the same premises. In addition to the set schedule and in order to ensure compliance with the new legislation, all 160 mills were visited on 29 or 30 March to discuss the implementation of the new legislation and all were visited again between 4 and 30 April to collect samples. Contamination of poultry meat and bone meal with apparent mammalian material was suspected on one premises, samples taken at the time and since have proven to be positive. Investigations into this mill and the supplier of the meat and bone meal are in progress; a prosecution may follow.

<H3><CENTER>Beef farmers call for <A NAME="cull">cull</A> of all herds with
BSE</CENTER></H3>

 by Michael Hornsby, Agriculture Correspondent<P>

The Times (UK)    ...    August 6 1996<P>

BEEF farmers have called for a wide extension of the cattle cull,
including the option of slaughtering entire herds that have had even one
case of "mad cow" disease.<P>

In the first serious rift within the cattle industry, a breakaway group
of beef farmers said that the cull should certainly include the
slaughter of all calves born to cows that have died of BSE. Dairy
farmers are strongly opposed to any wholesale slaughter of herds and
question the need for killing the progeny of BSE cows, despite evidence
that some calves may have caught the disease from their dams.<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture is understood to be considering culling only
the last calves born to cows with BSE, which could involve killing
30,000 more animals than the 147,000 identified as being at special risk
of developing the disease.<P>

The rebel alliance, called Farming Collaboration, yesterday accused the
mainstream National Farmers' Union and the Government of pampering dairy
farmers and ignoring the interests of the beef sector. Fraser MacLeod,
who heads Farming Collaboration, which was set up earlier this year to
represent 20,000 beef farmers in Scotland and the hill regions of
Britain, said: "The single-industry policy adopted by the Government has
worked against our interests. We have tried to lobby through the
National Farmers' Union on behalf of our members. Now we feel we must
put our own case."<P>

Mr MacLeod, who is also director of the Scottish Crofters' Union, added:
"In herds that have had a case of BSE in animals born on the farm, the
option of slaughtering the whole herd should be carefully
considered."<P>

Support for a cull of all offspring of cows with BSE came from John
Corrie, a Tory Euro-MP, who yesterday showed an invited party of 33
German farmers over his family's beef and sheep farm at Auldgirth in
Dumfries and Galloway. One of his visitors, Ole Grubbe, who farms in
Lower Saxony, said they had been impressed by the Gallo way cattle: "The
German public are getting wrong information about BSE and they do not
listen to the good news that beef is safe to eat."<P>

Many beef farmers feel they have been asked to carry the can for dairy
farmers, whom they see as mainly responsible for creating the BSE
problem by the intensive feeding of meat and bonemeal. This practice,
now banned, is thought to have transmitted scrapie, a similar disease in
sheep, to cattle.<P>

Dairy farmers, whose herds have had more than 90 per cent of BSE cases,
have escaped relatively unscathed because they have been able to
continue selling milk and have been compensated for the destruction of
cows older than 30 months which used to go into the food chain.

Specialist beef farmers, 85 per cent of whom have had no BSE cases, have
seen cattle prices drop by up to a third and feel that they have
received inadequate help from the Government and the European Union.<P>

Alastair Davy, who keeps a herd of 85 Limousin beef cows in Swaledale,
North Yorkshire, and is a member of the breakaway alliance, said:
"Farmers are desperately worried about what will happen in the autumn
sales. Many of us have been holding animals back in the hope that prices
would improve. I have never had a case of BSE, but I am looking at
prices of 115p a kg liveweight, compared with 160p last year, when I
need at least 120p to break even. We have got to have a stricter cull
policy and clear this disease out of the national herd if we are to
restore the market."<P>

Last month the Government announced a (UK pounds) 112 million aid
package for beef farmers, partly funded by the EU. This included (UK
pounds) 29 million to offset lower prices, but will cover only cattle
sold before June 30 and amount to no more than (UK pounds) 60 an
animal.<P>

Beef farmers, who say their losses have averaged closer to (UK pounds)
200 an animal, are demanding more aid and want it to continue throughout
the autumn because prices are showing little sign of recovery.<P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="fury">Britain blamed in German fury</A></CENTER></H3>

from Peter Bild in Bonn<BR>

The Times (UK)    ...   August 6 1996<P>

GERMANY has announced still tighter controls on British cattle, amid
fears of a collapse in consumer confidence in milk and milk products.<P>

Anti-British feeling has spread among German farmers since a wave of
flag-burning was sparked by Britain's latest admission last Friday that
BSE can be transmitted from cows to calves. Now the new controls mean
that the farmers may not slaughter or sell the last-born offspring of
cows from British herds for which the British authorities cannot provide
a BSE-free guarantee.<P>

German farmers will have to register these cows, which will be monitored
by the authorities. Bonn ministry experts also want the existing
selective cull agreed by Britain to be extended to the last-born
offspring of all cattle from herds where there has been one case of
BSE.<P>

Two states are applying the same rules to all calves from herds without
a BSE-free certificate. Jochen Borchert, the Agriculture Minister, went
out of his way to reassure consumers that milk, cheese and chocolate
were safe. He advised Germans who wanted to be really sure to buy only
German milk products.<P>

The latest admission by Britain was simply the last straw for many
Germans. Jann Dircks, a cattle farmer in Schleswig-Holstein, near the
Danish border, was a speaker at a protest meeting when the Union Jack
was burnt and calls were made for Britain to be thrown out of the
European Union. He has a herd of 180 pure German-bred red whites, but
the price he is getting at slaughter has fallen as sales of beef slumped
20 per cent.<P>

"The British Government is to blame," he said. "They have failed to get
a grip on the problem. Through their inattention and sloppy pursuit of
selfish economic interests, they have ignored the fears of consumers. I
accuse Britain of being selfish, but we have to solve the problem
together in Europe. Chucking the British out isn't the answer."<P>

Anti-British feeling has deep roots in the farming community. "They grab
advantages for themselves and deny them to us," he said. Last year
Britain vetoed financial measures agreed by all other countries to
compensate German farmers for the devaluation of the pound and the
revaluation of the mark, he added.<P>

That anti-British resentment is heightened, he feels, because British
farmers who have their animals culled get 75 per cent of the
compensation out of EU funds.<P>

Thomas Graue, chief reporter of a local newspaper, said that he had
never seen such tension in Schleswig-Holstein, where people are known
for their placid ways: "The basic feeling is that the British have
dumped a huge cowpat on our doorstep."<P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Union">Germans burn Union flag in beef protest</A></CENTER></H3>

By Andrew Gimson in Bonn and David Brown, Agriculture Editor<P>

The Daily Telegraph (UK)    ...   Tuesday August 6 1996<P>

GERMAN farmers, furious at the damage caused to their livelihood by the
beef crisis, have burned the Union flag and some have demanded that
Britain leave the European Union.<P>

As protests grew, with demands for greater cash aid for farmers hit by a
collapse in beef consumption, the German agriculture minister called for
a review of the EU's decision partially to loosen the European ban on
British beef products. Another German politician demanded a Europe-wide
export ban on British milk and dairy products.<P>

Beef consumption in Germany is about 20 per cent down, roughly double
the drop in sales in Britain. "I've never experienced anything like it,"
said Peter Harry Carstensen, the chairman of the German parliament's
agriculture committee, who witnessed the flag-burning demonstration in
his constituency in Schleswig-Holstein. "The atmosphere was really
threatening."<P>

The farmers concerned blame Britain for driving them to the brink of
ruin through the BSE crisis. The prices their calves fetch have
plummeted and the European Union gives them only (UK pounds) 6.30 in
compensation per animal. This is a derisory amount compared with losses
on the sale of 100 calves of between (UK pounds) 9,000 and (UK pounds)
13,000.<P>

Rainer Bruderle, the agriculture minister in Rhineland-Palatinate, said
that there must be more EU money for German farmers, who were "suffering
innocently". He said: "I know these farmers in Schleswig-Holstein and
they say that British farmers get more money for cows with BSE than they
do for beef that is fit to eat.<P>

"These are small family businesses and they feel they're being sent to
the wall by a problem they never caused themselves, and which Britain
isn't taking seriously enough.

'I would never burn a flag myself, but I can see a certain justice in
their case'.

"They feel Britain tried to blackmail Europe by vetoing EU business and
now they want Britain blackmailed back, and told it will be thrown out
of the EU unless it gets serious about dealing with BSE.

"I would never burn a flag myself, but I can see a certain justice in
their case. I know we over-reacted in Germany, but I can't help that.
This is a question of the stomach, not of logic."<P>

Barbel Hohn, the agriculture minister in North-Rhine/Westphalia, called
for a total export ban on British milk and milk products. She said it
could not be ruled out that BSE could be caught through milk.

Jochen Borchert, Germany's agriculture minister, said after a meeting in
Bonn with scientists and representatives of the Lander, "or provinces,
that there must be no lifting of the export ban until all doubts had
been settled.<P>

He said EU scientists must urgently study the new British findings about
the tranmissibility of BSE from cows to calves, and must also establish
whether BSE could be transmitted through milk and milk products. At the
moment, he conceded, there is no evidence that it can be.

Removing all doubts about BSE, as Mr Borchert requires the EU's
scientists to do, is a process that could take years, completely
derailing the timetable for raising the ban that John Major obtained in
Florence.<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture in London insisted that the Government's
emergency controls were working and denied reports that a new
investigation was being carried out into the safety of milk.

Meanwhile, a party of German cattle breeders on a fact-finding mission
to Scotland claimed yesterday that political activists rather than
farmers were behind the flag-burning. They also claimed that demand was
increasing for beef produced in Germany from British breeds.<P>

<CENTER><H4>Listserve Comments on the  <A NAME="maternal">maternal</A> transmission study</H4>
</CENTER>
7 Aug 1996
<P>
1. The study has not "demonstrated that maternal transmission occurs". It
has demonstrated an association between BSE in calves and BSE in
their dams, but it has not demonstrated the cause of that association. There
is an increased risk of BSE in calves born of dams which developed BSE after
calving (odds ratio about 2.9:1, statistically highly significant) which
could be explained by maternal transmission. It could also be explained by
other factors, particularly inherited genetic susceptibility to BSE combined
with exposure.<P>

 
2. The figures of (approx.) 15% BSE in calves of BSE dams and 5% in control
calves cannot be combined arithmetically to produce 15% - 5% = 10% maternal
transmission - other possibilities include a) some cases of BSE in the dams
of control calves, and the information about their ages at death is not
available to estimate a rate; this would raise the "maternal transmission
rate" and b) a possible synergistic effect between maternal BSE and
subsequent calf exposure (eg: to feed) which would require a geometric
rather than arithmetic model; ie: maternal BSE increases the risk of BSE in
subsequently exposed calves, by a factor of three, but does not necessarily
cause disease. This would reduce the estimated transmission rate.<P>
 
3. The absence of large numbers of (reported) cases of BSE in exported
cattle suggests that "maternal transmission" alone is not sufficient for a
10% transmission rate. Continuing exposure, of some form, is a necessary
condition for disease.<P>
 
4. Paternal status is not declared (presumably unknown) and the results may
reflect some "paternal transmission" in both groups and a high level of
"maternal transmission" in the calves of BSE dams. An excellent discussion
of the transmission of scrapie is given in RM Ridley and HF Baker "The myth
of maternal transmission of spongiform encephalopathy" (British Medical
Journal 1995; 311 (7024): 1071-1075, but also on the BMJ web site at
http://www.bmj.com/bmj/bse/myth.htm). BSE in cattle is not scrapie in sheep,
but the largely genetic maternal and paternal effect in sheep scrapie
produces similar results to those of the current study if it is assumed that
approximately 20% of cows and bulls are BSE genotypes and both case and
control calves were exposed to feed - unfortunately, there are no unexposed
calves born to BSE dams in the study.<P>
 
5. The reduction of 10% to a "1% field rate" is a best case scenario based
on two untenable postulates. a) transmission is zero either side of a six
month risk period preceding the onset of BSE in the dam (there is scant data
to support it, and zero is improbable!); b) cows produce calves at a uniform
rate for 60 months before developing BSE, with no risk in the first 54
months (they do not, they mature first without calving: the correct
reduction factor is the ratio of calves born in the first 54 months to
calves born in the final 6 months. This ratio is smaller than 10:1).<P>
 
6. The possibility of maternal transmission has not been embraced in the
control measures or literature. It has been grudgingly accepted as an
improbable, remote possibility. The control measures designed to enhance
consumer confidence were not wholly based on science and will now suffer as
a consequence of the perceived volte face in the latest announcement - as
demonstrated by the possible reversal of the export framework in the EU. One
only has to search for citations of Richard Lacey's publications (eg: "The
BSE epidemic is being maintained by horizontal and vertical transmission")
to see that discussion of vertical transmission has been rejected, often
with considerable vitriol and hostility (also my own experience).<P>
 
7. I also note that identified genotypes conferring susceptibility to CJD,
which has been more extensively sequenced than BSE, account for only 3-4% of
familial cases of the disease. These same genotypes also account for a
similar number of cases of apparently sporadic CJD. The genetic influence in
BSE is, at best, much more hazy. Some relevant research is:<P>
 
Hunter et al [1] and Brown et al [2] found uniformity in the alleles they
selected for study and Grobet et al [3] reported no correlation with BSE
susceptibility. However, Neibergs et al [4] report highly significant
differences between BSE cases, relatives of BSE cases and unaffected cattle
indicative of genetic control. Most significantly, Wijeratne and Curnow [5]
report an abundance of relatedness amongst BSE cases, suggestive of
autosomal recessive inheritance.<P>
 
In addition, non-uniform susceptibility is the best explanation for the
apparent limit (circa 20%) on within-herd rates of BSE cases and for the
exceptionally low rates of BSE in cattle over the age of 7 years. I
personally would put the susceptible proportion of cattle at something like
12-18% of affected herds.<P>
 
The 1995 progress report additionally provides a graph suggesting an
odds-ratio of 1.9:1 for offspring of cattle affected by BSE - given the
numbers involved, I cannot believe this is non-significant. The
non-significant odds ratio of about 1.3:1 in the study of risk factors
[Hoinville et al, Veterinary Record 1995;136(13):312-318] gave no
confidence that the observation was chance. There may be maternal
transmission, which the current study should elucidate when fully analysed,
but I hope the effect is the result of heritable susceptibility. An elevated
odds-ratio in the siblings of affected cattle might be good news in this
respect, as per [4] - at a guess, how about an excess risk of 2:1 in the
offspring of affected cattle and and an excess of 1.25:1 in the siblings of
affected cattle, irrespective of maternal status?<P>

<PRE>The groups compared were

a. calves born from dams in the late stages of disease
   (the majority was born within 5 months of onset of disease
    in dams)
b. calves born from dams  over 6 years old in which no onset of disease
   had been observed.
Group a and b were taken from the same herds.
 
SEAC has reported preliminary findings with a difference in
frequency of confirmed BSE in the two groups
(15.3 % in group a and 4.8 % in group b)
The difference in frequency is 10.5 %
This is a significant difference, so the first important result is:
Transmission from dam to calf occurs.
 
If it is assumed that all BSE cases in group b has been caused
by _something else_ than transmission from the dam, the 10.5 %
can be taken as an estimate of the maternal transmission rate, i.e. under
the conditions of the test, 10.5 % of the BSE dams transmitted
the disease to their calves.
 
This is the background for  SEACs figure 10%
(with an estimated confidence interval 5-15 %)
 But can we trust the assumption that none of the cases
in group b has been caused by transmission cow to calf?
 
This assumption seems to me to  be equivalent to the assumption,
that a cow which has not shown onset of disease by the age of 6 years
is not carrying the disease.</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>The 1 % maternal
transmission figure given as an estimate -- under 'in the field'
conditions. IMO it cannot be based on this study alone without becoming
quite speculative, a fact which also SEAC points out.

The great majority of the calves in group a were born less than 5 months,
and none more than 13 months after clinical onset of BSE in the dams.
There is simply no data in this study on calves born by dams
in the earlier stages of disease.
 
If I understand SEAC correctly, a comparison between transmission rate in
the under 5 month subgroup and the 5-13month subgroup gives a weak
indication that transmission is less frequent in the latter subgroup.
But as this group must be small, the indication must necessarily be weak.
 
And SEAC indeed says nothing more than: *IF* it can be assumed that
maternal transmission does _only_ occur to a significant degree
in the very latest stages of disease *THEN* the overall risk of transmission
to a calf could be appr. 1 %
 
To be a little provocative this is very similar to saying that
if it can be assumed that the overall probability of maternal
transmission is low, then the overall probability of maternal
transmission is low. </PRE>
 <HR>
<PRE>The above assumes that "within" means "after". Again, this is not clear
in the information in the SEAC report.  SEAC does not say "5 months
after onset" but "within 5 months of onset". However in its para 3, it
states
 
"Thus the study does not provide a good estimate of the risk to
animals born more than 6 months before the onset of BSE in the dam.
However, the findings provide some, albeit limited, evidence that
there is an enhanced risk of maternal transmission in the last 6
months of the BSE incubation".
 
This might suggest that all or some of the calves in group (a) were
selected for the study, whose dams had shown onset of BSE up to 6
months _after_ giving birth. And what about the 13 months? Does
"within" mean "before" in all or some of the calves?  That seems to be
implied without saying so.
 
That led me to query the matter with CVL this morning, and they
confirm that all but three of the calves in group (a) were born either
up to 5 months _before_ or 6-13 months _before_ their dams' onset of
BSE.

It becomes apparent that SEAC were
in effect trying to extrapolate backwards through the whole duration
of an assumed 60 month incubation, from  results in  the last two
periods at the end of the incubation period.   Attempting to extend a
graph when you have only two points plotted is unsound.
 
Even taking account of the large case control study [Hoinville L J et
al (1995)  "An investigation of risk factors for cases of BSE born
after the introduction of the feed ban", Veterinary Record, Vol 136,
312-318]., which did not reveal significant risk of maternal
transmission, the grounds  for  SEAC's 1% estimate are inadequate.
 
While some reduction from the 10%  found in
the trial may be warranted in terms of "in the field", the 1% figure
estimated in the SEAC report is inadequately substantiated
speculation.

17 June 96:<P>

 In England
especially, clusters of CJD were already known before there was BSE
(Matthews, 1975). The 14 CJD deseases in India after a vaccination
against rabies based on serum of sheep (in the Himalyan foothills, with
scrapie in many flocks) are a clear indication of an infection. <P>

In the USA,
some CJD deseases were put down to the eating of brains of wild goats with
scrapie. The 3 conjugal cases of CJD, described in the scientific literature,
obviously argue in favour of an infection. Where from, before BSE?<P>


Consider the fact that:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>up to now, and with every single animal species, we don't know any other
  cause of TSE than an infection (so why not with human beings?).<P>

<LI>sqirrels, having TSE, were blamed for being the cause of CJD.<P>
 
<LI>scrapie and CJD, for instance, cause equal clinical signs in the goat, with
  different pathological-anatomical patterns of lesions.<P>
 
<LI>brain lesions of BSE infected monkeys and men with V-CJD look strikingly
  similar.<P>
 </BLOCKQUOTE>
In fact, most cases of CJD  so  far were possibly causedby
scrapie (notational suggestion: S-CJD by scrapie and B-CJD by BSE).<P>
 
On top of this, the unofficial numbers of 1500 - 9000 dead of CJD per annum
in G.B. would correspond well with the high infection with scrapie.
Considering moreover the U.S. spot check results, according to which about 5%
of the Alzheimer diagnosises were misjudged CJD, the numbers of CJD worldwide
probably look completely different. In my opinion, the number of 1 dead of
CJD per million inhabitant has purely and simply never been checked.<P>
 
As a whole, there are many indications of the infectiosity of scrapie in humans,
but none speaking against. It's the same situation as with BSE until 19
March 1996.

<CENTER><H3>Scientist shows scrapie <A NAME="survives">survives</A> rendering process</H3></CENTER>


<P>    RIVERDALE, Md. (May 13, 1996 9:48 p.m. EDT) - A British scientist said in Maryland on Monday he had proven that a common method of making animal feed was ineffective in destroying the agent that caused scrapie, a sheep disease similar to so-called mad cow disease.<P>


    Researcher David Taylor of Edinburgh University said he took brain matter from scrapie-infected sheep, subjected it to a rendering process and injected it into the brains of mice. Many of the mice then contracted a similar disease, he said.<P>

    Scientists say waste sheep parts that were cooked in a process known as rendering and used in animal feed were probably responsible for starting the mad cow epidemic in Britain in the 1980s.<P>

    Cattle parts were also rendered and used in feeds, contributing to the spread of the disease in cattle, scientists have said.<P>

    Taylor, principal research scientist at Edinburgh's neuropathogenesis unit, told a public meeting here on mad cow disease, formally known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), that he reproduced several different rendering processes in his laboratory trials. None of the processes stopped the infectivity completely, he said.<P>

    Taylor said he would publish them soon. He and other researchers published similar results in December from an experiment using brains from cattle infected with BSE.<P>

    The practice of feeding ruminant, or cud-chewing animals such as sheep and cattle, with protein meal made from other ruminants was banned in Britain in 1988, eventually leading to a sharp decline in the number of BSE cases there.<P>

    This year, the British government extended the ban to exclude ruminant protein from feed intended for all animals. The additional safeguard was introduced after the government said there was a possible link between BSE and some recent cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease in people.<P>

   The only link with BSE between species ever discovered is in animal feed made from ground-up sheep. This feed is blamed for Britain's BSE epidemic in cows - and even for several dozen deaths of house cats.<P>
 
   What about using sheep to make animal feed? <P>

   Britain has banned the practice, but <B>sheep still make up about two-tenths of a percent of the animals ``rendered'' into U.S. feed</B>, said Don Franco of the National Renderers Association.

   But no more than 50 cases of scrapie a year are found in the nation's 8.9 million sheep, meaning it's unlikely that U.S. animal feed could be tainted, Detwiler said.

<CENTER><H3>Fact <A NAME="Sheet">Sheet</A>: Scrapie    USDA-APHIS   Veterinary Services         June 1993</H3>
</CENTER> 

Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the

central nervous system of sheep and goats.  Scrapie has had a

significant impact on the sheep industry and has caused financial

loss to sheep producers across the country.<P>

This infectious disease is thought to be most commonly

spread from ewe to offspring and to other lambs in contemporary

lambing groups through contact with placental fluids.  Signs or

effects of the disease do not usually appear until 2 to 5 years

after the animal is infected.  Once an animal becomes infected,

death is inevitable.  There is no test to detect scrapie in a

live animal.<P>

In the United States, scrapie has primarily been reported in

the Suffolk breed.  It also has been diagnosed in Cheviots,

Corriedales, Dorsets, Hampshires, Finn sheep, Merinos,

Montadales, Southdowns, a Cotswold, a Rambouillet, and a number

of crossbreeds.  As of January 1993, four cases of scrapie in

goats raised in contact with sheep have been reported.

First recognized as a disease of sheep in Great Britain and other

countries of Western Europe more than 250 years ago, scrapie has

been reported throughout the world.  The only two countries

recognized as being free of scrapie are Australia and New

Zealand.<P>

The first case of scrapie in the United States was diagnosed

in a Michigan flock in 1947.  These sheep were of British origin,

imported from Canada over a period of several years.  Through

September 1992, scrapie had been diagnosed in at least 652 flocks

in the United States.<P>


Over the years, scrapie has been officially reported in 42

States.  As of September 1992, States with no reported cases were

Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Florida, Hawaii,

Montana, and North Dakota.<P>

Without a screening test for sheep, the incidence of scrapie

cannot be accurately determined.  Reporting the disease usually

requires knowledge about scrapie and its signs and the

willingness to make known a problem.  Since 1947, from 1 to 54

flocks have been reported as newly infected every year.<P>

Researchers have been studying scrapie for many years to

identify the specific agent that causes it.  The agent is smaller

than the smallest known virus and has not been identified to

date.  To complicate matters further, this disease agent is

extremely resistant to heat and ultraviolent irradiation as well

as to various disinfectants--the common means of destroying

pathogens.  In its host, the agent elicits no inflammatory or

specific immune response.<P>
Genetic variations among different breeds and the strain of

scrapie may play a role in whether a sheep will become infected

and how quickly clinical signs of scrapie may appear.  One gene

that controls the length of incubation of clinical scrapie has

been identified in Cheviot and Swaledale sheep.  Those

individuals with "short" incubation alleles (alternative forms of

a gene) develop the clinical signs, usually between 2 and 5 years

of age.  These sheep die from what appear to be natural causes

before the incubation period is complete.  Because the length of

incubation can be as long as 8 years, it is not known to what

extent or under what conditions sheep with the "long" incubation

alleles might be able to infect other sheep.  The strain of

scrapie also appears to affect the development of clinical signs

and the length of the incubation period.<P>

Scrapie signs vary widely among individual animals and

develop very slowly.  Early signs include subtle changes in

behavior or temperament, which may be followed by scratching and

rubbing against fixed objects--apparently to relieve itching. 

Other signs are loss of coordination, weight loss despite

retention of appetite, biting of feet and limbs, lip smacking,

and gait abnormalities--including high-stepping of the forelegs,

hopping like a rabbit, and swaying of the back end.<P>
 
An infected animal may appear normal if left undisturbed at

rest.  However, when stimulated by a sudden noise, excessive

movement, or the stress of handling, the animal may tremble or

fall down in a convulsive-like state.  Every infected animal may

not show every sign.  Sheep may live from 1 to 6 months or longer

after the onset of clinical signs.<P>

Several other problems can cause scrapie-like signs in

sheep, including the diseases ovine progressive pneumonia,

listeriosis, and rabies; the presence of external parasites (lice

and mites); pregnancy toxemia; and toxins.<P>

Some diseases related to scrapie affect other species as

well.  Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affect humans;

transmissible mink encephalopathy affects mink; feline spongiform

encephalopathy affects cats; chronic wasting disease affects mule

deer and elk; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) affects

cattle. In the laboratory, scrapie has been transmitted to hamsters,

mice, rats, gerbils, mink, and some species of monkeys.<P>

In the field, veterinarians diagnose scrapie based on the

appearance of its signs combined with knowledge of the animal's

history.  At present, scrapie can be confirmed only by

microscopic examination of brain tissue at necropsy.  There is no

officially recognized test for the presence of scrapie in live

animals.  Currently, researchers at the APHIS National Veterinary

Services Laboratories are working to develop a more efficient and

definitive postmortem test using immunoblotting and

immunohistochemistry.<P>

Other research efforts are presently focused on

developing a practical, live-animal test to diagnose infected

sheep before they show signs; transmissibility of the disease;

identifying the scrapie agent and its different strains;

identifying genes that control incubation length; and examining

the role of artificial insemination and embryo transfer in the

transmissibility of scrapie.<P>

In 1952, the Secretary of Agriculture declared a state of

the emergency in an attempt to eradicate scrapie in the United

States.  This order was rescinded in 1953, and USDA put a total

flock depopulation program into effect.  In 1957, the program was

expanded to include total depopulation of source flocks.  USDA's

scrapie and bloodline indemnification and surveillance program

was implemented on April 8, 1983.<P>

The bloodline indemnification program was discontinued on

January 8, 1993, and was replaced by a one-time-only indemnity

payment for qualifying producers with infected or source flocks

reported to USDA by July 7, 1993.  The Voluntary Scrapie Flock

Certification program began on October 1, 1992.  The voluntary

program is a cooperative effort between producers, allied

industry representatives, accredited veterinarians, State animal

health officials, and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection

Service (APHIS).<P>


The intent of the voluntary program is to monitor flocks

over a period of 5 years or more and to identify flocks that are

free of scrapie.  The program provides participating producers

with the opportunity not only to protect their sheep from scrapie

but also to enhance the marketability of their animals.  Flock

owners may apply for membership in the program by sending a

written request to their State's Scrapie Certification Board.

It will require cooperation among producer organizations, allied

industries, and government regulatory agencies to operate an

effective program to deal with this insidious disease.<P>

Hamsters developed scrapie 100-160 days after eating either scrapie-
infected hamsters or infected brain. The clinical signs and
neuropathology of scrapie transmitted by cannibalism were identical to
those observed after intracerebral or intraperitoneal inoculation of the
agent. Oral transmission of scrapie appears to be extremely inefficient.
Cannibalism requires a dose of the scrapie agent about 10^9 times
greater than that needed to produce the disease by intracerebral
injection for comparable periods of incubation.<HR>

<H4>Prion protein in many non-neuronal

 <P>

A cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) is thought to be a
substrate for an abnormal isoform of th eprion protein (PrPSc) in
scrapie. PrPC is abundant in tissues of the central nervous system, but
little is known about the distribution of PrPC in non-neuronal tissues
of sheep, the natural host of scrapie. This study investigated the
tissue distribution of PrPC in sheep. Although PrPC was abundant in
neuronal tissues, it was detected in non-neuronal tissues such as
spleen, lymph node, lung, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, uterus,
adrenal gland, parotid gland, intestine, proventriculus, abomasum and
mammary gland. Neither PrPC nor PrP mRNA was detected in the liver. The
tissue distribution of PrPC appears to be inconsistent with the tissues
which possess scrapie infectivity, suggesting that factor(s) specific to
certain cell types may be required to support multiplication of the
scrapie agent.<P>

<H4>Ovine scrapie</H4>


Chatelain, J.; Dautheville-Guibal, C<BR>
European Journal of Epidemiology 1989 5 1 113-116 <P>


The authors studied ten years of the records of a sheep flock in which scrapie was endemic. Each year, 50% had been sold for meat and 30% for breeding. Scrapie had appeared in 20% of the sheep retained on the farm. The aim of the study was to discover if eating meat from scrapie sheep produced Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, but the work threw no light on this.<P>

<H4>Prevalence of scrapie in sheep in Britain</H4>

Morgan, K. L.; Nicholas, K.; Glover, M. J.; Hall, A. P. Veterinary Record 1990 127 15 373-376 UK 

 An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used in two independent surveys to try to determine the prevalence of scrapie in the national sheep flock. The disease was recorded in 35 counties in England and Wales. About a third (26.5 and 37.3%) of respondents owning 100 or more sheep indicated that they had seen sheep with scrapie in their flocks. The incidences of clinical cases recorded in affected flocks in the two surveys were 0.5 and 1.1 cases/100 ewes/year. At present there is no control over the disposal of these animals. The authors suggest that because of the possible link between an increase in the prevalence of scrapie and the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy measures should be introduced to monitor the prevalence and incidence of scrapie and to control the disposal of clinical cases.
<HR><H4>Clinical signs in natural scrapie  in Japan</H4>

Onodera, T.; Hayashi, T.  JARQ, Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly 1994 28 1 59-61 Japan

During the period 1988 to 1991, postmortem brain tissues were examined in 5 cases of pathologically confirmed ovine scrapie in Japan. Although most of the tissues were collected from sheep in Hokkaido, some brain tissues originated from sheep in other areas. All these sheep, which had been transferred from a farm in Hokkaido with a past history of scrapie in Suffolk sheep, died for no obvious reasons. All the cases during the period 1988 to 1991 occurred in Corriedale sheep. It is likely that sheep-to-sheep transmission has taken place in Hokkaido, and that a new type of scrapie disease has been spreading in Japan.

Supernatant fluid from a scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenate was mixed with soil, packed into perforated petri dishes that were then embedded within soil-containing pots, and buried in a garden, in the Washington DC area, for 3 years. Between 2 and 3 log units of the input infectivity of nearly 5 log units survived this exposure, with little leaching of virus into deeper soil layers. These results have implications for environmental contamination by scrapie and by similar agents, including those of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

<A HREF="http://aphisweb.aphis.usda.gov/oa/scrafana.html">VETNEWS </A>08/31/1994<P>
 In the
August 29, 1994, Federal Register, FDA proposed a rule to prohibit specified offal from adult (more than 12
months of age) sheep and goats for use in ruminant feed. FDA is proposing this action because the specified offal may
contain the agent that causes scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of sheep and goats. In the
United Kingdom, scrapie has been epidemiologically associated with the occurrence of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), another TSE.

In the April 8, 1994 Portland Oregonian , reporter Margie Boule described the case of Elie Faure, a 53 year old
Oregon man who died in 1989 of diagnosed Creutzfeld-Jacob Syndrome later confirmed at autopsy. U.S. authorities
had claimed that no one under the age of 60 had died of CJD and that mad cow disease was absent from this country.<P>

Faure did not eat beef but frequently ate lamb. Scrapie has been present in Willamette Valley sheep flocks; recently,
an entire flock of 140 animals was voluntarily destroyed by its owner. Fauve's widow was familiar with CJD
because the mother of a man in her office had also died from it.

laboratory in rural Scotland during the 1950s was followed up around 1980

"In both scrapie epsiodes in New Zealand, one in the fifties
and the other in 1974, the sheep never make it to the mainland.  New Zealand
has a quarantine island off the coast and when the scrapie was identified,
all the sheep were eradicated before they ever set foot off the island.
That's why we can say with confidence, New Zealand does not have scrapie.<p>

New Zealand, as a
result of its physical isolation, is free of prion disease.  It is vital that serum products will be beyond question.  Most
people don't realize their vaccines have been cultured on bovine serum
products and therefore the potential for exposure to BSE, or pestivirus
(BVD) is far greater than the current thinking of ingestion being the only
way in which to acquired disease.<p>

Also related:  Icelandic sheep pasture being rested for 3 years,
scrapie-free herd introduced and getting it. Sheep contracting scrapie in Iceland after 3 years of rested pasture was no surprise after the repeat episode with CWD in the game parks. How long
prion infectious agent can persist was always the question. Fleas is an interesting
one.  As you are aware, the research in Iceland identified the scrapie prion
in the bodies of sheep mites.  The situation would be identical for fleas."

<BLOCKQUOTE>Inflation in the level of compensation seemed to have to most effect on the number of sheep
reported with scrapie. This was clearly seen when the indemnity was raised to $300 in 1977. In the 8 years after this the scrapie numbers went up 10 fold and, as the level of indemnity inflated downwards, the numbers reported gradually fell. The numbers were not as individual sheep but rather in the number of flocks reported, which hit an annual peak of around 50 flocks per annum.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="#Theories">Spiroplasma proposed as cause of Mad Cow Disease</A><H3><CENTER><A NAME="Theories">Theories</A> of Mad Cow Disease</CENTER></H3>
<PRE>
JAMA  August 14, 1996
DC Capital Conference spring 1996</PRE>

A dissenting view on the cause of mad cow disease came from Frank O. Bastian, MD, profesor of pathology at

the University of South Alabama College of Medicine, Mobile, who

outlined his theory that mad cow disease is caused by a conventional

microorganism, a spiroplasma. Bastian spoke at a symposium held by the

National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

<P>
Bastian regards the prion theory as a red

herring. The cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs),

he says, is a conventional microorganism--a mollicute or, more

specifically, a spiroplasma. "The infection-related protein is

produced by the host in response to the infection," he says.


He bases his conclusion on 3 premises: 


<P>1. Twenty years of his research indicates a role for spiroplasma.

The evidence includes the following: spiroplasma-like inclusions

were seen in brain biopsies from patients with CJD (<I>Arch Pathol

Lab Med.</I> 1979;103:665-669); spiroplasma internal fibril proteins

are identical morphologically to those seen in TSEs; the spiroplasma

proteins show immunological cross reactivity with the TSE proteins

(<I>J Clin Biol.</I> 1987;25:2430-2431); and spiroplasma, when

inoculated into rodents, produces a similar neuropathology (<I>Amer J

Pathol.</I> 1984;114:496-514).



<P>Spiroplasmas, discovered in 1976, do not have a cell wall; they blend

with the host's cell membranes. A labeling marker would help identify

them, but developing one is difficult because spiroplasmas are hard to

cultivate. No more than half the known strains are culturable, says

Bastian. 


<P>2. The <I>PrP </I>in these TSEs is a product of the infection.

"It is a modified host protein and may play a role in the

pathogenesis of the disease, but it is not the agent because there are

numerous reports that the protein can be separated from infectivity.

Also, it is found in inclusion body myositis, a condition unrelated to

CJD," says Bastian.



<P>3. The immune system is involved. The gene for the host

protein is located on the chromosome in the region of the major

histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the mouse. "Occasionally, you see

elevation of immunoglobulins; there are morphological alterations of

the leukocytes; there is leukopenia," Bastian explains, "and

autoantibodies are characteristically seen in the late stages of both

experimental and naturally occurring infection. There is partial MHC

restriction in both human and animal disease."



<P>The immune reaction seen in these spongiform diseases can be explained

by superantigen activity, Bastian says. He notes that, normally, an

antigen is presented to the cell surface in the MHC and interacts with

the T-cell receptor--the antigen lying in a groove in the T-cell-MHC

sets in motion the standard reaction. A superantigen, on the other

hand, binds outside the groove of the T-cell and interacts with the

MHC. This results in some immunoglobulin production, but only

transiently. The major effect is clonal deletion of T cells, resulting

in a state of immune tolerance. Autoantibodies can also form.



<P>Bastian proposes that, in spongiform diseases, <I>PrP </I>presumably

acts as a superantigen. The question, he says, is what is producing the

superantigen. He proposes that it is a bacterium. He says he is

especially excited by the fact that the mollicutes cause superantigen

production, adding that it is noteworthy that <B>inclusion body myositis,

a condition in which prions are seen</B>, is an established superantigen

disease.



<P>Bastian is concerned because of recent reports that disease has been

transmitted to macaques given BSE-containing contaminated material

(<I>Nature.</I> 1996;381:743-744). The pathology in the monkeys is

identical to that seen in the recent human cases of CJD in Great

Britain and appears to confirm that these cases were the result of

transmission to humans of BSE, Bastian says.



<P>He also notes that investigators have just reported transmitting

scrapie to mice from hay mites gathered from farms in Iceland where

scrapie is endemic (<I>Lancet.</I> 1996;347:1114). Bastian says he is

<B>virtually certain that these hay mites contain spiroplasma</B>, noting that

the investigators have not so far found <I>PrP </I>in the mites.



<P>"Clearly, the agent has become so virulent that it can easily jump

species barriers. This makes it very dangerous," says Bastian, "and

shows the need to intensify research in this area."



<P>To control CJD, Bastian said the first step is to stop feeding offal to

cattle and second, "we must develop a preclinical method of

detecting the causative agent."



<P>The key to accomplishing this is looking for a conventional invasive

organism, rather than a host protein, in these infected tissues,

Bastian said. "Once we have developed a method of detecting the

organism, we will be in a position to do surveillance studies, find out

where the disease is, and deal with any potential problems that might

arise." He added, "Perhaps success in this area will also allow us

to eradicate scrapie, which we've known about for 200 years."

 Sir--A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) has
 been recently described.<SUP>1,2</SUP> CJD has been reported in recipients
 of cadaveric human dura mater grafts.<SUP>3</SUP> We report a case which
 may be related to both conditions. <P>

 A 52-year-old woman from Savoie was referred to a neurology
 department in March, 1995, with progressively evolving
 impairment of walking. She had a left sylvian artery aneurism
 operated on in 1984. Dura mater was used. We have no further
 information about the dural graft. She had left amaurosis since
 infancy, chronic hypertension, chronic alcohol and
 benzodiazepine intoxication, and episodes of paranoid delusion.
 Examination showed cerebellar ataxia, a normal
 electroencephalogram (EEG), a normal computed tomographic
 (CT) scan, and probable ischaemic lacunae in the pons and
 centrum semi-ovale on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <P>

 2 months later she was unable to remain standing without aid
 and was confused. She had a static and kinetic cerebellar
 syndrome, brisk deep tendon reflexes, temporospatial
 disorientation, incoherent speech, 0.67 g/L protein in
 cerebrospinal fluid, diffuse flattening of EEG, and seriously
 disturbed liver function tests. After 3 months, laboratory
 investigations were normal, except for elevated bismuth
 concentration in serum. EEG and MRI were unchanged. A
 prefrontal cerebral biopsy was done. There were moderate
 spongiform changes, discrete foci of astrocytosis, and a few
 plaques. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of
 proteinase K-1-resistant pathological prion protein. PrNP
 genotyping revealed Met-Met homozygosity at codon 129. No
 pathogenic mutation was found in the coding sequence. After 5
 months of deteriorating symptoms without myoclonia and
 without characteristic EEG changes, the patient died. No
 necropsy was done. <P>
 Reviewing  the case, we  saw that the  plaques were  surrounded  by a zone of  spongiform  change,  giving them a  florid  appearance  (figure).  Immunocytochemistry  with 3F4  antiPrP  antibody 
 showed strong staining of the plaques. These observations raised
 the question of possible nvCJD. In favour of this hypothesis are
 the onset with cerebellar signs without dementia, the absence of
 characteristic EEG changes, florid plaques, the absence of
 mutation and Met-Met homozygosity. Conversely age was
 older--although a recent case of nvCJD has been described at
 age 51 (Ironside, personal communication). Clinical course
 was shorter than in the published cases of nvCJD. The
 possibility of a link with dura mater is also possible; although
 11 years separate the onset from the graft, which is longer
 than cases reported.<SUP>3</SUP> <P>

 It is impossible at present to give a definite diagnosis. However,
 florid plaques seem to be the most striking histological finding
 in this patient as in nvCJD and in macaques after bovine
 spongiform encephalopathy brain inoculation.<SUP>4 </SUP><P>

</FONT>A victim of the brain disease <B>CJD</FONT></B>

<BR>
Maurice Callaghan, a 30-year-old mechanical engineer, died of the new variant
of <B>CJD</FONT></B> last November after a nine-month
illness.<BR>
<BR>
Coroner John Leckey told the Belfast inquest that while he could not go
any further than putting the cause of death down to <B>CJD</FONT></B>,
he agreed with experts' views that the disease was linked to exposure to
BSE, &quot;<B>mad cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It may be that there really are no other viable candidates and <B>BSE
is the front runner</FONT></B>. But I believe it would be wrong for me
to state that as a fact when the experts did not.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The inquest heard from Professor James Ironside, one of the authors of
the new research linking <B>CJD</FONT></B> to BSE.
He said that <B>in all probability Mr Callaghan's
death was linked to exposure to BSE</FONT></B>, but there was as yet no
direct evidence to confirm this.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We researchers are fairly confident that BSE is at the root of the
new variant. In the light of new evidence it is most likely that it is
linked to exposure to BSE before the offal ban was introduced in 1989,&quot;
he said.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Callaghan's widow, Clare, told the inquest how the keen sportsman deteriorated
into a helpless invalid. She said that in the last stages of his illness
her husband was unable to speak, had no idea what was happening around
him, and needed round-the-clock care.<BR>
<BR>
He had been a fit and healthy man and keen basketball player and had eaten
red meat two or three times a week, she added. After the inquest the family
welcomed the findings of Prof Ironside and the coroner.<BR>
<BR>
Mrs Callaghan said: &quot;We are very satisfied. In coded words he has
said it was likely that Maurice died due to exposure to BSE.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a family we need to discuss where we will take this from here.
We need to take stock and discuss it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inquest proceedings in Northern Ireland do not end in a verdict as in the
rest of the UK. The coroner gives a summary of the circumstances and most
likely cause of death.

 Sir--Several cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have
 been reported in dairy farmers exposed to bovine spongiform
 encephalopathy (BSE).<SUP>1</SUP> We report CJD in a patient who had
 handled animal feed. <P>

 A 66-year-old man presented with marked cognitive
 impairment including disturbances of memory, orientation, and
 concentration. First signs of intellectual deterioration had been
 noted 5 months before admission. There were visual
 disturbances including visual hallucinations as well as
 myoclonus and increased muscle tone of the limbs.
 Transplantations, previous neurosurgical procedures, or a
 family history of dementia were not known to the relatives. The
 patient had been trading professionally for many years in
 foodstuffs mainly for birds, but also for other animals such as
 pigs, until he fell ill. According to family members, he had
 occasionally tasted samples of the feed to check the quality of the
 ingredients. The components used to mix the feed are not known.
 In addition, family members reported that the patient used to
 prepare for personal consumption a gelatinous material from
 bovine bones and bone marrow almost daily for several years. <P>

 At later stages of the disease, there were pathological grasping
 reflexes, oral automatism, and progressive mental
 deterioration leading to akinetic mutism. The patient died from
 pulmonary embolism. Necropsy revealed severe typical
 spongiform changes of the cerebral cortex associated with
 gliosis and neuronal loss. Immunohistochemistry with a
 polyclonal prion protein (PrP) antiserum (MP-WB 138)
 showed diffuse neocortical deposits of PrP, but no plaques. No
 disease-associated mutation was detected by single-strand
 conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct
 sequencing of the coding region of the PrP gene (PrNP). On one
 allele of PrNP, a variation at codon 124 (GGC*GGG) was found
 that is silent in the aminoacid. This variant allele has been
 described only in conjunction with the disease-associated
 Q217R mutation in a Swedish family with
 Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker disease,<SUP>2</SUP> but it is most
 likely a rare and biologically silent polymorphism. At codon
 129 the patient was homozygous for methionine. Homozygosity
 for methionine at this position is more frequent in CJD patients
 than in the normal population and was found in all patients
 analysed showing the new CJD variant (nvCJD) in the UK.<SUP>3</SUP> <P>

 The present case is by no means proof of an occupational risk of
 CJD for people who handle animal feed. No differential increase
 in the risk of CJD to farmers in the UK was found by the
 European Community surveillance project group.<SUP>4</SUP> <P>

The risk of contracting v-CJD should be

its cause may have been avoidable. These two factors always invoke anger and

 Since last week, when Prof John Collinge (London, UK)
 announced the most direct evidence to date for a link between
 bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and new variant
 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD), his results have been
 discussed widely in the scientific community and the media. But
 the reaction has been more measured than in March when the
 first nvCJD cases were reported. As Prof Tony Minson
 (Cambridge, UK) says, "Although many scientists were
 wishfully hoping that a direct link between the diseases would
 not be shown, I doubt if many of us were really that
 surprised". In common with other commentators, he stresses
 that the new results are not absolute proof that nvCJD and BSE
 are linked. "The identification of nvCJD in the UK earlier this
 year was circumstantial evidence of BSE infection in man", he
 says, "but the new data make us more confident of a link
 between the two diseases". <P>

 The molecular test devised by Collinge et al (Nature 1996;
 383: 68590) looks at different glycoforms of abnormal,
 protease-resistant prion protein on western blots. The pattern
 of the different forms depends on the origin of the prion. The important result highlighted by Collinge is that
 human brain extracts from patients with nvCJD behave like
 extracts from BSE-infected cows. Collinge has also
 demonstrated that when brain extracts from patients with CJD
 or from cows with BSE are injected into mice, the pattern of
 glycoforms in mouse brain extract is the same as in the source
 material. <P>

 Collinge's  group  has  injected  brain  material  from  CJD  and  nvCJD  patients  into  transgenic  mice  carrying  the 
 human prion protein. Mice injected with CJD material develop
 clinical disease within 200 days but, as yet, the mice injected
 with nvCJD have not, even though they were injected up to 500
 days ago. James Ironside (Edinburgh, UK) says that the reason
 for this difference is not clear but may be because the human
 gene put into the transgenic mice is homozygous for valine at
 codon 129 whereas, so far, all confirmed cases of nvCJD have
 been homozygous for methionine here. "The codon 129
 polymorphism may affect disease incubation time", says
 Ironside. <P>

 Collinge's team is now investigating the possibility of detecting
 abnormal prion proteins in tissues other than brain. In
 scrapie-infected sheep, prion protein can be detected in lymph
 nodes and tonsils. The combination of clinical screening,
 pathology, and biochemistry may allow clinicians to diagnose
 nvCJD more easily in the future, suggests Ironside. <P>

 14 cases of nvCJD have now been confirmed and Ironside says
 that the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh is currently
 investigating a few more potential cases. In common with
 Collinge and Minson, Ironside says the timing of the BSE
 epidemic in cattle and the probable long incubation period of
 nvCJD, mean that any potential nvCJD epidemic is unlikely to
 happen for 23 years, but he concludes that "We must make
 looking at therapeutic options a priority now".

 Sir--In a report to the European Union Commission, Prof C Weissmann of Zurich University has recommended
 that experiments be set up to investigate oral transmission of BSE to primates to see whether human beings are
 at risk from eating beef products.<SUP>1</SUP> Bovine spongiform encepholopathy (BSE) has already been transmitted to
 primates by intracerebral injection of infected brain tissue homogenate<SUP>2</SUP> so the "species barrier" between cattle
 and primates is not absolute. BSE has also been transmitted by feeding infected brain to mice<SUP>3</SUP> so clearly
 transmission of this agent by the oral route is possible. During the BSE epidemic not only were cattle fed on
 contaminated, rendered material, but large numbers of other species in zoos, farms, and domestic ownership
 were also fed on pelleted food containing rendered material. A few animals of several species of antelope and cat<SUP>4</SUP>
 but not monkeys<SUP>5</SUP> became affected despite these monkeys being fed for many years on pellets which contained up
 to four times the amount of the implicated, rendered meat and bone meal that was included in cattle pellets. Thus
 a "species barrier" of some sort exists between cattle and primates. But will Weissmann be able to quantify this
 in a way which will have public health implications? <P>

 In 10 years' time he may be able to determine the smallest amount of raw cow brain necessary to cause disease if
 fed to perhaps a few dozen monkeys. But what will this tell us about the maximum quantity of bovine-derived
 material (from which specified offals have been removed) which can be consumed without causing illness when
 the sample size could be up to 50 million people in the UK? As every drug company knows, extensive tests in
 clinical trials in large numbers of people cannot ensure that a new drug, when available on general prescription,
 will not cause serious illness in a handful of patients such that the drug has to be withdrawn. At best
 Weissmann's experiments will be irrelevant; at worse they will provide a degree of reassurance which is
 unwarranted. There is nothing that can be done to reduce any risk to which people have been exposed in the past,
 and there is now no alternative but to do the best we can to eliminate BSE entirely.

<P>

 Sir--Although human and animal prion diseases have been experimentally
 transmitted to various monkey species, spontaneous occurrence of a
 spongiform encephalopathy in non-human primates has not been reported. We
 describe the development of a spongiform encephalopathy without known cause
 in a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). <P>

 The monkey was born in 1982 and was acquired from Ravensden zoo, Rushend,
 Northants, UK, in October, 1986, by the zoological park in Montpelier, France
 where it was housed in the primate colony. In Montpelier, the monkey was fed
 standard monkey feed including Singe 107 (UAR, Paris, France) which
 contains meat products declared fit for human consumption. In summer, 1991,
 aged 9, the previously healthy monkey became lethargic and developed mood
 changes, in particular, aggressiveness. The monkey became isolated from its
 companions and hid itself away. In June, 1992, the monkey was anaesthetised
 with pentobarbital and perfused intracardially with saline followed by 4%
 paraformaldehyde. <P>

 The brain was dissected into 5 mm coronal blocks, which were embedded in
 paraplast. 6 m serial sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and
 thioflavine S for amyloid, or immunolabelled with antibodies: monoclonal
 antibody to a synthetic peptide homologous to residues 106126 of human
 prion protein (PrP), supernatant 1:2 dilution; polyclonal antibody to a
 synthetic peptide homologous to residues 140 of the  protein (R1280,
 provided by Dr D Selkoe), 1:1000 dilution; and antiserum to glial fibrillary
 acidic protein (GFAP, Dako, Denmark), 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactions
 were revealed by the avidin-biotin method. The sections were treated with
 formic acid before immunostaining, and were counterstained with Harris'
 haematoxylin. Negative control sections were incubated with normal mouse or
 rabbit sera as primary antibody. There were conspicuous spongiform changes
 and gliosis in the grey matter, particularly in the cerebral cortex where the
 deep layers were mostly involved. A number of neurons in the affected areas
 contained large vacuoles; these were single or multiple and distended the soma
 to produced ballooned cells with a marrow rim of cytoplasm.<P>
 Immunohistochemistry showed that vacuolated neurons and distended
 nerve-cell processes were surrounded by PrP-immunoreactive material
 (figure). The severe vacuolation of neurons observed in this rhesus monkey is
 similar to the vacuolation seen in squirrel monkeys after inoculation with
 brain material of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).<SUP>1</SUP>
 Immunological labelling of neurons in this monkey also resembled those seen
 in the brains of patients with CJD.<SUP>2</SUP> Immunostaining showed anti- protein
 immunoreactive deposits in the neuropil of the cerebral cortex. <P>

 As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case of spontaneously
 developed spongiform encephalopathy in a monkey. The feeding of this monkey
 with animal protein raises the possibility of cross-species transmission of the
 disease through contaminated foodstuff, similar to that suggested for bovine
 spongiform encephalopathy.

 Failure to transmit bovine spongiform
 encephalopathy to marmosets with
 ruminant-derived meal 

 Sir--We have kept a large breeding colony of common marmosets (Callithrix
 jacchus) for use in neuropsychological research for almost 20 years. This
 primate species develops spongiform encephalopathy with an incubation period
 of 35 or 4 years after intracerebral injection of scrapie-affected or bovine
 spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-affected brain homogenate.1 The majority
 of marmosets in the colony are used for experimental purposes and are killed
 when under 3 years of age, but the breeding animals are aged 310 years and a
 small number of animals have been kept for up to 15 years in an investigation
 of ageing.2 All animals are fed a daily diet of egg sandwiches, fruit, and a
 proprietary brand of UK-produced New World monkey pellets. According to the
 manufacturers these pellets contained a 20% inclusion of ruminant-derived
 meat-meal protein until April 1996 (cattle-feed supplements before 1988
 contained about 4% of meat and bone meal). From 1985 onwards,
 ruminant-derived feed probably contained increasing amounts of BSE agent
 from affected cattle and although the Ruminant Feed Ban of 1988 prohibited
 the feeding of this material to ruminants, its use in other animal feeds was
 legal until April 1996. 

 We estimate that more than 100 marmosets born in our colony between 1980
 and 1990 lived for more than 5 years and were exposed to ruminant-derived
 protein in their diet for their entire life. Each adult marmoset (weight 350 g)
 was fed about 2 g meat meal per day. It seems likely, therefore, that the
 mature monkeys in our colony were exposed to significant amounts of infective
 agent for more than 5 years and in some cases for up to 10 years. With the
 exception of those animals which were injected intracerebrally with infected
 brain in our primary transmission studies, no animal in our colony has ever
 developed spongiform encephalopathy. As part of general husbandry all animals
 are monitored daily for signs of ill-health and any with severe illness or
 persistent poor condition are killed. Unexpected deaths are rare in adult
 animals in our colony and necropsy examination has usually shown a cause of
 death. Since our main focus of research has been concerned with the study of
 neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, staff are experienced in the
 assessment of subtle neurological signs in marmosets including those of
 spongiform encephalopathy. After death, the brains of all animals are examined
 histologically either because the animals were in an experiment or because
 brains provide valuable control material. The brains of older animals are
 examined with particular care for signs of neurodegenerative change. 

 It is most unlikely that a case of spongiform encephalopathy would have been
 missed in our colony. Although the quantitative level of contamination in
 ruminant-derived meat meal has not been established experimentally, it is
 known that the infectious agent of BSE can be detected in meat and bone meal
 produced in industrial pilot-scale versions of the rendering processes used in
 Europe.3 Our observation serves as a reminder that the oral route is probably
 an inefficient mode of infection for spongiform encephalopathy across the
 species barrier. R M Ridley, H F Baker, C P Windle

 On Oct 23, Prof John Collinge announced new results that
 provide further supportive evidence for a link between bovine
 spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant
 Creuztfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). <P>

 Collinge's team, based at Imperial College School of Medicine
 (St Mary's, London, UK), report that different prion strains
 show characteristic patterns of abnormal prion protein
 glycoforms on western blots (Nature 1996; 383: 68590).
 Most notably, the pattern of glycoforms seen in prion protein
 purified from brain extracts from patients with vCJD is
 similar to that seen in cows and other species with BSE but
 differs markedly from the pattern seen in brain extracts from
 sporadic or iatrogenic CJD. Collinge stressed that his group's
 results were "entirely consistent with the hypothesis but did
 not constitute formal proof" that BSE is the cause of vCJD. <P>

 With the new molecular test, Collinge's team will be looking to
 see whether other forms of CJD in human beings are in fact
 vCJD--for example, vCJD in elderly people may not have the
 same characteristics as vCJD in young people, he said. <P>

 Speaking of the public health implications of the new findings,
 Collinge said that sufficient protective measures were
 probably in place already and added that it was still too soon to
 judge the eventual scale of a potential vCJD epidemic. He called
 for more work to be done on the molecular nature of prion
 diseases so that therapeutic options could be developed in
 advance of an epidemic. Collinge's group also hope to develop
 the test for use on material other than brain extracts.

 "Sheila Gore, of the Medical Research Council's biostatistics unit, called
yesterday for the CJD unit to issue more information about the number of
suspected 'new-strain' cases referred to it, rather than issuing figures
only for confirmed cases. 'Though only a certain proportion are confirmed,
we need to know what proportion that is,' said Dr Gore. 'Once we know that,
we can work back from the number of confirmed cases at any stage to how
many suspect cases there are which will be confirmed.'<P>
 
 The Department of Health intends to publish its latest quarterly report on
CJD cases later this month, covering the three months to the end of
September. However, there are no plans at present to include suspected
cases in those under 40.<P>
 
 Dr Gore said, 'It would be useful if they did, because if it turned out
that eventually 90 per cent of those suspected cases are confirmed as the
new strain, we would have something to work with. If it was only 10 per
cent, at least we would be able to decide not to take much notice'.

In Orava, a sheep-rearing region of the Slovakian republic, which has seen a
remarkably high incidence of CJD since 1976. Studies have shown that the
victims share a common gene, which has led most scientists to conclude that
these CJD clusters are genetic rather than infectious in origin. (The
scrapie-like diseases are unique in that they can be either infectious or
genetic.) On the other hand, Eva Mitrova (accent on the "a"), an
epidemiologist at the Research Institute for Preventive Medicine in
Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, is still unsatisfied with this conclusion. She's
the main researcher on the ground looking at the Slovakian cases, and has
published some papers that you can look up to see her thinking on the
subject. As far as I know, no one has ruled out the possibility that the CJD
cluster in Slovakia is actually the result of an intersection of (1) high
exposure to infected sheep and (2) rare genetic SUSCEPTIBILITY. If this is
the case, scrapie may be transmissible to humans under rare circumstances. In
sum, though, it seems clear that sheep scrapie presents negligible direct
risk to the human population.

<P>
1. With regard to declaring oneself on probabilities.. at a summer
meeting at the House of Commons, Sheila Gore (a statistician) asked the
people there (mixture of MPs and scientists) to write, anonymously, their
feeling on whether v-CJD was caused by CJD. 0 = definitely not, 10 =
certain, and values in between to indicate degrees of uncertainty.
<P>
For the record, I put 9. But I asked her later: she said that there
tends to be a mixture, with peaks at either end (8/9s and 1/2s), with few
5s. Ralph B would seem to be in a minority (hi Ralph). I expect it's
because uncertainty is a difficult thing to build a system of thought
around.
<P>
        I would suspect that many of the MPs there - many of whom had
farming interests in their consituencies - put low numbers. But they also
demonstrated a rather desperate wish not to listen to the science, I
thought.
<HR WIDTH="30%">
2. I should say that I am a 9+ on 1-10 scale if this means I think that more caution is needed (and overdue) in view of the downside public health risk.  However, I don't think there will be a good handle on the magnitude of the epidemic until an earlier more sensitive ante-mortem test is found than the 14-3-3 test, which so far is only a synchronous diagnostic adjunct.  [The tonsil test sounded promising because it gave earlier results and is more practical for screening purposes than a spinal tap. Note it is considered ethically problematic to screen and inform individuals about an untreatable condition.]<P>

That is, I don't think that the extent can be reliable deduced from the numbers coming in during the earlier years because of the vast range and form of doses and ambient genetic and somatic backgrounds.<P>

I would definitely go with cumulative dose, as expressed by the integral over incubation time of an infectious titre growth function, modulated by saturation considerations.<P>

I would go with (UK alone) tens of millions seriously exposed and already at various stages of the disease, with  deaths over the next twenty years in the low millions, unless more is put into research -- the sooner the better. Treament may well mitigate the toll, with early therapies delaying onset of full-blown illness past the normal life span.  Rather like with prostrate cancer, quite a few could then die with it but not from it. Billions are spent on the cull, whereas only tuppence seems available for research, which could be characterized as locking the barn door after the horse is gone, and more denial, respectively.  <P>

At this point, we are all just reading the tea leaves.<HR WIDTH="30%">
3. In my opinio, nearly the whole British population
and more than half of the other Europeans have been exposed to the infectious
agent. This does not mean, that most of them have to die because of an BSE-
infection. The comparison with the long lasting exposition to scrapie-infecti-
fity in UK and the relativly long period between the first cases of BSE and the
first cases of vCJD in UK shows, that in most cases, at least outside the UK,
the infections will be not lethal. This is a consquence of the species barrier
and different genetic susceptibilities.

<center><h3>Five new <a NAME="young">young</a> victims of 'mad cow' disease</h3></center>

<p>   (Jun 3, 1996) -- Scientists have identified five more suspected cases in Britain of the new strain of Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease which has been linked to "mad cow" disease.<p>
 All five patients are young and still alive, but are suffering symptoms typical of the new variant, which was revealed two months ago by the British government and which prompted the worldwide ban on British beef.<p>

   They have been discovered by the official team of scientists who are monitoring CJD. They would have to be confirmed by analysis of brain tissue at autopsies, so the team has categorised them as "probable" CJD.<p>

   So far there have been only 12 confirmed cases of the new CJD variant in the world, 11 in Britain and one in France. The extra five cases were found after exhaustive investigations of dozens of possible victims by the scientists at the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh.<p>

The five cases are believed to fit the clinical description of the new CJD strain -- with patients suffering anxiety, depression, unsteadiness and unusual brain wave patterns. All the patients are under 42 years old. Pattison said the Department of Health was to set up a new system of announcing each month's confirmed cases.<p>

   Rob Will, head of the CJD Surveillance Unit, was unavailable for comment Saturday, but said earlier in May that it could take many more months before meaningful predictions could be made about the possible course of the new CJD outbreak.

   He said that whatever the origin of the new CJD variant, whether it was BSE in cattle or another unknown cause, more cases were expected in the coming year.<p>

   Professor John Pattison, chairman of the government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), gave a warning in March that the number of new cases emerging over coming months would be critical because a sudden rise could indicate an eventual epidemic involving tens of thousands of people.<p>

   "I could have envisaged statistics that are a lot more worrying than at the moment," he said. "As a doctor it is difficult to say that any more cases provide a reassuring statistic, because every single case in itself is a tragedy."<p>

<h4>5 MORE CASES SHOW SIGNS OF "MAD COW'</h4>

Fresno Bee ... June 3, 1996<p>

LONDON -- Five more people are thought to be suffering from a new strain of
the  fatal  brain-wasting  illness linked to ''mad cow'' disease in cattle,
The Sunday Times reported.<p>

   The patients have been identified by scientists at the
Creuzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh as showing symptoms
of  the  disease.  The  symptoms  include anxiety, unsteadiness and unusual
brain wave patterns.<hr>

<h3>Scottish `Mad Cow' Case Attributed to Burgers.</h3>

The Washington Post, April 28, 1996<P>


LONDON  -   A  claim  by  a  leading  neurologist  that  a 15-year-old girl
contracted  "mad cow disease" by eating hamburgers threatened renewed panic
in  Britain  yesterday,  despite  attempts to play down fears of a possible
epidemic.<P>

Peter Behan said the teenager was seriously ill in a Scottish hospital with
the   human   equivalent   of   the   cattle   disease   bovine  spongiform
encephalopathy, which rots the brain and leads to death.   Countries  around  the  world  slapped  a ban on British beef last month
after the government acknowledged there could be a link between the disease
in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.<P>

   The  girl,  who  has not been identified, is believed to be the youngest
victim  of Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Hospital authorities in southern England said
earlier  that  they  had identified another three possible new cases of the
disease.<P>

   The  Scottish  hospital  said  only  a  post-mortem  would  provide firm
diagnosis  of Creutzfeldt-Jakob. But Behan said he had used a new U.S. test
and blamed the girl's fondness for eating hamburgers.<hr>


<b>Listserve 11 June 96</b><p>
There is a report circulating (BBC Radio 4?) that the Glasgow case of a 
fifteen year old girl with CJD has recovered substantially   and is now out of intensive care and fully ambulent. This is the case which Professor Behan (her neurologist) said was "definitely the BSE 
form of CJD" and was caused by her "addiction to hamburgers".  If true, it is unlikely to have been CJD.
The Times: Britain: 2 May 1996.<p>

The Centre rejected as "too premature" the claims by a neurologist in Glasgow that a 15-year-old girl, known to have a penchant for hamburgers, was also suffering from V-CJD. The neurologist had used a diagnostic test carried out in California which has not yet been recognized in the UK. If the girl were proved to have CJD she would be the youngest known case. <hr>

<h4> OFFICIALS FIND NEW CLUSTER OF MAD COW DISEASE</h3>

Chicago Tribune (CT) - SUNDAY, April 28, 1996<BR>
Richard Bashor<P>


LONDON, BRITAIN - Doctors are treating three suspected cases of the human
brain-wasting disease, which is similar to the mad cow disease afflicting
British herds. All three patients live near the same town.<P>

   Britain announced last month that 10 cases of a new strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease might have been linked to a similar disease in
cattle--bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known as mad cow disease.
   Officials said Saturday that the cluster of new suspected cases was in
the Ashford area of Kent county in southeast England. The patients, being
treated by doctors at Guy's Hospital in London, are a 59-year-old woman, a
29-year-old man and a 36-year-old man.<P>

   Dr. Anne Farebrother, a public health specialist with the East Kent
Health Authority, said Friday that one of the three suspected cases from
Ashford had undergone a brain biopsy that proved negative.
   But she said that was not conclusive evidence he did not have the
disease.

<h3>Philadelphia Deaths</h3>

Arizona Republic (AR) - Sunday, March 31, 1996<BR>
By: Philadelphia Daily News<P>

PHILADELPHIA  -  She  was  discharged from Hahnemann University Hospital 12
days ago, her brain function so deteriorated that she was sent to a nursing
home to await death from what the British are calling mad-cow disease.<P>

   "She  is  a  blue-collar  woman,"  her friend said. "She's never been to
England. She's never eaten English food."   In  the  United  States, the rare human disease is called by its medical
name, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.<P>
   She  was  hospitalized  at  Hahnemann for a month. Initially, her family
thought  she  was  suffering  from  Alzheimer's,  but  Hahnemann physicians
diagnosed her with Creutzfeldt-Jakob.<P>

   "There  was no reason for a brain biopsy, because there is no treatment,
and  there's an increased risk of transmission," a hospital spokesman said.
"She  was  discharged  to  a  nursing home because her deterioration was so
rapid that her family couldn't care for her."<P>

 Recent  Philadelphia  cases  include  that  of  a  44-year-old woman who
rapidly lost her ability to work, a 75-year-old man who came into Jefferson
with  an  incorrect diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and the "blue-collar"
patient.
<HR>
<h3>Human version of Mad Cow disease?</h3>


   Lawrence Schonberger of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta says the cluster of cases is "absolutely extraordinary." In the United
States, he says, "the incidence of cases in people younger than 30 would total
five per billion per year." Typically, classic CJD strikes 250 people in the
United States each year.<p>
     He and other CDC officials were sufficiently intrigued-and concerned-by
the recent British report to implement routine surveillance for the disease in
California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Oregon as part of an ongoing effort to
identify emerging infections.
     This brain-destroying illness was first identified in the 1940s in goats
and sheep. It was named scrapie, for the afflicted animals' tendency to rub themselves.<p>

A <a NAME="man">man</a> in his 50s who died recently at Rochdale, is the latest victim of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, health chiefs said yesterday.
<hr>
<b> London Times 7 June 96</b><p>

A man aged 31 from Glenrothes, Fife, has died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human equivalent of "mad cow" disease. Andrew Haig, a process engineer with Hughes Micro-electronics, showed symptoms of the degenerative illness five months ago and died on May 25. His condition was diagnosed a week before the health scare that led to the worldwide ban on British beef and was one of the initial 11 cases that alerted scientists to the new strain of CJD. <p>

A case of CJD in a 29-year-old man in Kent, England, was believed to be the 11th known case of V-CJD. The CJD Surveillance Centre
accepted that this was the case on the basis of a biopsy although the findings had not been independently confirmed. <hr>

<h3>Frenchman, 27, dies of British CJD after all</h3>
London Times  ...  15 April 1996<p>

 FRENCH health authorities have acknowledged that the case of a 27-year-old man from Lyons who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in January was "absolutely identical" to the ten cases in Britain that were linked to a new strain of the disease.<p>

When doubts about the Lyons case were first raised three weeks ago, health officials flatly denied any link with the suspected new strain of CJD and insisted the case was not abnormal. However brain surgeons at the Lyons hospital authority carried out post-mortem tests and, after consulting with British experts on the disease, they have concluded that the case is identical to those in Britain.<p>

Doctors say they do not know how the disease was transmitted but "examinations carried out on the young man's brain showed lesions similar in every way to those of the British patients".<p>

The French Government has launched a vigorous campaign to convince the public that there have been only 16 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in French cattle and that consumption of French beef poses no health threat. An average of 50 cases of CJD are diagnosed annually in France.
<p>

The victim, an engineer at a textile factory, who has been identified only as Henri, first began to exhibit symptoms of the disease in 1994. He died on January 7. He had never travelled to Britain and there is no history of the disease in his family.

<h5>WOMAN  <a NAME="TYPE">FELL ILL</a>  OF  MAD  COW DISEASE  AFTER FAMILY RECEIVED BRITISH BEEF</h5>
Record  (Northern New Jersey) ...  April 30, 1996<p>

MACEDON,  N.Y.  - At age 19, Stephanie Breitkopf was a student at Cazenovia College  on  a tennis scholarship. Five years later, she is on life-support
equipment, having lost both her mental and physical health.
    Her  doctor  thinks  the illness that led to Breitkopf's decline may be
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease.<p>

   "I've  never seen a case like Stephanie's," Dr. Louis Ghertner told the
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle in an article published Sunday.
    "I  don't  think  anyone  around  here  has  ever  seen  anything  like
Stephanie.  No  neurologist has been able to verify what she has," he said. "But  I  think  this  [Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease]  diagnosis  is  the most
tenable."<p>

 The woman's parents, Stan and Lona Breitkopf, told the paper that their
daughter  began  behaving  strangely  in  the  <b>summer  of 1991</b>. She laughed
uncontrollably for no reason and then lost the ability to do things such as
drive a car or even point out the United States on a globe.<p>

    "She  would  go  for  a  walk  around  the  neighborhood and wind up in
somebody's   house   going   through   their  refrigerator,  just  laughing
uproariously and telling strangers the most intimate things about herself,"
Lona Breitkopf said.<p>

 As  Stephanie's condition rapidly worsened, the Breitkopfs sent her for
psychological  help,  followed  by  a  battery  of  physical tests. Doctors
thought  she  might have multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease, but the
symptoms never fit conclusively.
    In January, Ghertner told the Breitkopfs that Stephanie's symptoms were
consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They had never heard of it.<p>

    The  incurable illness became the focus of worldwide attention in March
when  the  British government revealed that 10 people in the United Kingdom
might  have  contracted  the  disease after eating beef tainted with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, a brain-wasting cattle ailment.
    British  beef has since been banned in more than 20 countries, although
scientists  in  the United States have cautioned that they aren't convinced
of  a  link  between  bad  beef and the disease. The mysterious illness was
already known to afflict about one in a million people.

<h3<center>>Lamb-eater, 53, dies in <a NAME="Oregon">Oregon</a> from Scrapie-CJD?</center></h3>

In the April 8, 1994 Portland <i>Oregonian  </i>, reporter <a HREF="mailto:marboule@aol.com">Margie Boule</a> described the case of Elie Faure, a 53 year old Oregon man who died in 1989 of diagnosed Creutzfeld-Jacob Syndrome later confirmed at autopsy.  U.S. authorities had claimed that no one under the age of 60 had died of CJD  and that mad cow disease was absent from this country.<p>
Faure did not eat beef but frequently ate lamb.  Scrapie has been present in Willamette Valley sheep flocks; recently, an entire flock of 140 animals was voluntarily destroyed by its owner.  Fauve's widow was familiar with CJD because the mother of a man in her office had also died from it.<p>
Boule states correctly that "the truth is, CJD, as the doctors call it, is not reported to any health organization in this country, so nobody knows exactly how many people have died of it, of what their ages were. <hr>

<h3>Brain <a NAME="extract">extract</a> gave children CJD disease</h3></CENTER>
Nando and Reuters<p>
  LONDON (Apr 14, 1996 9:35 p.m. EDT) - Every time Paul Andrews forgets something, he wonders whether his brain is slowly turning into a sponge.It is a real fear. Andrews believes he is at risk of developing the brain-rotting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) after treatment to help him reach a normal height as a teenager.<p>


   "You have the fear every day," said Andrews, a 30-year-old student teacher. "The initial symptoms that you get are exactly like everybody gets when they are tired -- you get dizzy, you forget things.
I'm always forgetting things, all the bloody time."
    He is one of 1,900 Britons given Human Growth Hormone (HGH) to boost their stunted height as children. The hormone was taken from the pituitary glands of corpses.<p>


    Sixteen British children given the treatment between 1958 and 1985 have died of CJD and one is suffering from it. A lawsuit opening in London's High Court on Tuesday alleges they contracted CJD as a result of the treatment. Eight families are suing the Health Department and the government-funded Medical Research Council (MRC) in a case sure to attract attention in the midst of a scare over mad cow disease.<p>

    CJD was an extremely rare and obscure disease and probably still would be -- it affects one in a million people -- if it hadn't been for mad cow disease. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is the version of CJD seen in cattle. Just as in humans, they lose coordination and start to behave oddly before dying. Autopsies show their brains have literally turned spongelike, riddled with holes.<p>

 BSE reached epidemic proportions in British herds in the 1980s and is still a major problem. Officials believe the cows got BSE from being fed the ground-up remains of sheep, which commonly get scrapie, a related disease. Doctors said last month there was a chance people could get CJD from eating infected beef -- launching a worldwide scare and a global ban on British beef.<p>

    Andrews says the scare, while not related to the lawsuit, has given it more prominence.
 "Nobody knew what CJD was when we started campaigning. And it's such a horrible death. You've just got to say Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease and people are pricking their ears up." From the ages of 11 to 17, he was given three hormone injections a week. For him it did work -- he grew a foot (a third of a metre) to five feet five inches .<p>

    But in 1985 two people in the United States and one in Britain died of CJD. All three were on HGH regimes. It is accepted that the hormone injections caused the CJD. Children are now given a synthetic form. "It isn't disputed that the disease arose in any other fashion," said lawyer David Body of Irwin Mitchell, a Sheffield firm that is representing the eight lead plaintiffs in the case. "This is a grim business. I don't think anyone can think of a worse way to die than CJD."<p>

    The lawsuit, which will be binding for the 17 families whose children got CJD, seeks to discover what the government and the MRC knew and when -- and whether anything could have been done to protect the children. The Health Department has said it will fight the case, but a spokeswoman declined to go into details. "We are neither claiming responsibility or denying it," said an MRC spokesman. "The whole thing is a sorry affair and we have the greatest sympathy for the families. But...it's for the courts to decide."<p>

    Parents of the dead children say they were never told the HGH was being taken from corpses. They say more precautions should have been taken over a transplant of human material. "The risk involved was pointed out to the Medical Research Council by agricultural scientists who had an interest in scrapie and who told them there was a risk," Body said.<p>

    Although the parents are seeking compensation, Body, a specialist in medical claims, says they really just want to know what happened and why. "There's an anger to it. There's considerable anger that no form of inquiry was forthcoming," he said. "In Australia, the reaction of the government, faced with similar problems, was to set up an inquiry, which reported within 11 months...We have asked for an inquiry but none has been forthcoming."<hr>

Two cases of what appears to be the same variant of CJD found in Britain
are reported in Germany by news services [April 1, 1996].<p>

The first case, a woman, 36,  who came into contact with beef brain in her restaurant job, was in Munich.  The second case was a woman in her early 30s who, according to a spokesman at Tuebingen hospital, showed a similar pattern to the 10 cases in Britain but was a vegetarian and had never visited Britain.<p>
<p>
On Monday, a Munich clinic said it was treating a patient suspected to have a new strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) which the British government said last week may be linked to"mad cow" disease. The woman workedfor years in a restaurant kitchen, coming into contact with beef regularly, and hospital doctors saida link to the disease could not be ruled out.  In Munich, meanwhile, a doctor said a German woman suffering from an illness similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob often handled beef brains in the restaurant where she worked.
The 36-year-old woman has symptoms closely resembling those seen in the 10 British patients, but doctors won't be able to confirm that she had the disease until after her death, said neurologist Bastian Conrad. The woman, who fell ill more than nine months ago, has lost consciousness and is dying, he said.<p>

<h3>Farmer Dies of Mad Cow Disease</h3>

   LONDON (AP) -- A third British dairy farmer has died of the human
form of a virulent cattle disease, raising concern about a possible
connection to the "mad cow" malady that has swept British herds. 
Scientists say they have no proof that the farmer contracted
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, the human form of the cattle disease,
from farm animals.
<p>
   The 54-year-old man worked on a farm where three cows died of
mad cow disease, according to a letter published in this week's
edition of The Lancet, a medical journal.
<p>
   "I think that it's obviously a matter of concern if there is a
third case in a farmer," said Dr. Robert Will, a neuroscientist at
Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.
   The other two farmers died within the past five years.
<p>
   Will contributed to a second letter in The Lancet that reported
the incidence of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in Britain is similar to
other countries that have not suffered the cattle disease.
   The survey reported by Will found no other cases of
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease among other workers exposed to mad cows,
such as veterinarians or butchers.

   It also said British farmers are no more likely to get the
disease than farmers in other European countries who have not dealt
with sick cows.
<p>

   Afflicted cows stagger and drool. Humans suffer mental
deterioration, slurred speech and difficulty walking that gets
progressively worse until they die.
   Since 1986, 153,215 cattle have been destroyed in Britain after
showing symptoms of the disease.<p>

<H4>BALTIMORE MAN'S  WIFE
DIED  IN  1992</H4>

BALTIMORE MORNING SUN - Saturday March 23, 1996<BR>
By: Frank D. Roylance SUN STAFF<P>


Retired  Baltimore  pharmacist  Harry  Gendason  never  knew  how  his wife
contracted  Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, the degenerative brain disorder that
killed  her  in  just  five  weeks  in  1992. Now he wonders whether it was
something she ate while touring in England in 1984.<P>

   Mr.  Gendason  began  wondering after he read about "mad cow disease" in
England,   and   rampant   public   fears   there   that   a  new  form  of
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) may be transmitted by exposure to meat from
cattle infected with a related bovine disease.<P>
   But  Dr.  Lawrence  Schonberger, assistant director for public health at
the  National  Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said
that Mr. Gendason's worries, and those of other Americans who have traveled
to Britain, are unwarranted.
   "Probably  Americans  [in  Britain]  are more at risk of getting hurt in
traffic  by  looking  the wrong way when they step off the curb than eating
meat," he said.<P>
    But  Harry  Gendason  couldn't  help  wondering about the meat his wife,
Annette,  ate in England in 1979 and 1984. And worrying. "Whatever she ate,
I ate," he said.
   It was in 1992, about six months after their 50th anniversary, that Mrs.
Gendason began to notice that her handwriting was getting very small. Soon,
she had trouble moving her right arm.<P>
   Visits  to  her internist and a neurologist failed to find the cause. An
electroencephalogram  did  appear  abnormal,  Mr.  Gendason said. "But they
still couldn't diagnose the thing."
   Soon her steps grew wobbly, and her speech became slurred. Hospitalized,
her sight began to fail, and she could no longer recognize her family. "She
wasn't  in  pain.  No  pain at all. She was just lying there," Mr. Gendason
said.<P>
   Two  weeks  after  entering  the  hospital,  and  barely six weeks after
becoming ill, Mrs. Gendason died. She was 73.
   Doctors  finally diagnosed her illness as Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, and
Mr. Gendason has been trying ever since to learn more about it.


<h4>BRAIN-DESTROYING DISEASE CLAIMS STOCKTON WOMAN</h3>

Daily News of Los Angeles (LA) - TUESDAY, April 9, 1996

     A  58-year-old  Stockton  woman has died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
the  brain-destroying illness some doctors say could be linked to ``mad cow
disease.''
     But public health officials said the disease is extremely rare and has
not  conclusively  been  traced  to infected cows, despite fears that eight
Britons who died recently of CJ caught it from eating beef.<P>

      Carol Marie Vanetti died Friday of CJ disease at St. Joseph's Medical
Center  in  Stockton, a month after being diagnosed with the fatal illness,
said Jim Shebl, a hospital spokesman.<P>
     Vanetti  did not know she had CJ until last month when she went to see
a  doctor  at  the  University of California, San Francisco Medical Center,
about injuries she sustained in a fall.
     She  was  brain  dead  within weeks. Her brother, Ralph Sanguinetti of
Stockton,  told  The  Stockton Record that the family does not know when or
how Vanetti contracted the disease.<P>
   .
     People  become  infected  by eating the brains of diseased animals or by
coming  into  contact with an infected person's brain or nerve tissue, said
Bob Howard, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<P>
     Humans   also   can  contract  the  disease  through  infected  cornea
transplants,   contaminated   surgical   instruments  and  infected  growth
hormones, he said.

<h3>U.S. woman, 58 dies of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease<hr></h3>
Nando.net and Reuters<p>

<p>    SAN FRANCISCO (Apr 13, 1996 01:18  a.m. EDT) - A California woman has died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, but there is no reason to suspect a link to "mad cow" disease which has caused a scare in Britain, officials said on Tuesday.


    Carol Vanetti, 58, died of CJD last Friday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Stockton, California, said hospital spokesman Jim Shebl. Doctors diagnosed the incurable, brain-destroying illness after Vanetti was admitted to the hospital last month following a fall, he said.<p>

    Doctors do not know how Vanetti, a Stockton resident, contracted the disease, which victims can carry for up to 30 years before showing symptoms.

    He said there was no reason to think it was linked to so-called mad cow disease, a brain-destroying disease that has affected cattle in Britain. Britain has been swept by mad cow hysteria since the government said last month there could be a link between CJD and mad cow disease, whose scientific name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The announcement prompted the European Union to impose a worldwide ban on British beef and beef product exports. No cattle in the United States have been diagnosed with mad cow disease.<p>

    Shebl said that worldwide, statistics show between 0.5 and one death per million of population each year from CJD. In the Stockton area, there had been three cases since 1979, he said. There are at least four strains of the disease, which leaves brain tissue riddled with holes, he said. Most cases have been reported in people aged between 65 and 79, he said.    In Britain there have been a number of cases of people under 42 contracting CJD.<hr>

     Peter  Hall  first  showed  signs of depression around Christmas 1994.
Within  five  months  he was in a wheelchair. In the final stages, thin and
suffering  from  dementia,  he  contracted a series of chest infections. He
died in February at age 20.<p>
      "The  most frightening thing was the similarity between his condition
and  disease we have seen cows suffering from," said his father, Derek. "In
12  months, we saw him deteriorate into someone who could not walk, talk or
do anything for himself."<p>
      It  was  only  last  week  that  pathologists confirmed that Hall, of
Chester-le-Street in northern England, had been killed by Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease, a degenerative illness that eats holes in the brain.<p>
     
      While  scientists  remain  unsure  of how the disease is transmitted,
Hall's  parents say they believe he contracted the disease from eating meat
before he was 17, when he became a vegetarian.<p>

      The family of Ann Richardson thinks she was sickened in the same way.
Richardson,  of  Liverpool,  died in January at 41 -- two years after being
diagnosed as suffering from depression.
      Her family says she gradually lost coordination and became bedridden.
An autopsy confirmed that she had CJD.<p>
      "If  the  government  had been up-front, we would have stopped eating
beef,"  said  her  husband, Ronny. "They kept it under wraps to protect the
beef industry."<p>
      Jean Wake, a meat pie maker, died of CJD in November at 38.
      Her  mother,  Nora  Greenhalgh,  wrote  to  Prime Minister John Major
asking about the disease. His private secretary replied that the government
was satisfied there was no link with beef.<hr>

A farmer who committed suicide in April was said to have been facing financial ruin because of the BSE crisis. He had been unable to sell any
of his 200 cattle. The family of a beef farmer who killed himself in May blamed his death on the BSE crisis. He was faced with having to destroy his cattle which were over 30-months old.<hr>


<h3>CJD killed woman who lived for sport</h3>

The Times: Britain: May 29, 1006<p>

A WOMAN has died after contracting the human equivalent of BSE, an inquest in Wales has been told.

Alison Williams, 30, a keen sportswoman, died in February from pneumonia, to which she is thought to have succumbed because she was already suffering from the fatal brain condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Most victims of CJD die in their sixties, but in recent years a number of much younger people have developed the disease.<p>

It was the disclosure by the Government on March 20 of a possible link between BSE and a new strain of CJD in ten people under 42, some of them teenagers, which triggered the current beef crisis.
There is no evidence yet that Miss Williams was suffering from this new form of CJD. James Ironside, a leading expert on the disease, told the inquest in Bangor, Gwynedd: "There is still no evidence that humans can develop CJD by being exposed to the BSE agent."<p>

Miss Williams's father, John, 67, described how the illness took hold of his active daughter. "Alison was an outdoor girl who loved skiing, walking and sailing. She used to race up the mountains before any of the other ramblers. But when she began suffering from the disease she could not walk straight. She lost her memory and was blind before she died."<p>

Independent scientists have issued a warning that it could take up to eight years to establish for certain whether BSE can be transferred to people. Charles Weissman, a Swiss scientist, who has been asked by the European Commission to lead an independent investigation into the relationship between BSE and CJD, has ruled out any prospect of an early resolution to the central question.

<h3><center><a NAME="V-CJD surveillance">V-CJD surveillance</a></center></h3>

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is to conduct surveillance for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (V-CJD) using
surveillance programmes created in 4 states for the detection of emerging diseases. Neurologists and neuropathologists provided with details
of the V-CJD cases will search for previously undetected cases and clusters.<hr>

<h3>Four States on lookout for brain disorder</h3>

By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN ... April 9, 1996 .. NY Time<p>   

WASHINGTON  --  Federal health officials said on Monday that they would step up surveillance for a human version of mad-cow disease by focusing initially on four states and then expanding their
efforts elsewhere if necessary.<p> 

  The decision to focus on California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and
Oregon was announced after a meeting of representatives of the
Department of Agriculture, the Defense Department, and the
Department of Health and Human Services. It was the officials'
first meeting since March 20, when the British government reported
10 cases of a new variant of a fatal brain disease in young people
and said they might be linked to mad cow disease. The meeting on
Monday, which was closed to the public, was held at the Federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

<p>   Dr. Brian Mahy, an official of the disease centers, said in an interview after the meeting that his agency would adapt a program
it created recently to detect new and emerging diseases to search
for possible cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare human brain
disorder that is thought to be a human version of mad cow disease.
Health officials have been monitoring for cases of hanta virus,
ehrlichiosis, and other newly detected infections in the four
states.
<p>   Federal officials said they remained confident that no cases of mad-cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, had ever occurred in this country. But they said
intensified surveillance was needed as a cautionary move.<p>  

 One reason for concern is a new analysis made at Monday's
meeting of data concerning the 10 cases, all under the age of 42,
that British experts have reported in the current issue of The
Lancet, a medical journal published in London.
<p>   A graph constructed from the data suggests that the cases might represent the earliest phase of an outbreak, said Mahy and another official of the disease-control agency, Dr. Lawrence B. Schonberger. A graph of the dates of death shows one in May 1995, two in November, two in January 1996, and three in February. Two patients are alive.<p>   

"It is actually more worrying when you plot the cases because
it looks like the beginning of a rise, even though there are only
10," Mahy said. "Time will tell whether it is an epidemic that is beginning
over there," he said. "If it is genuinely the start of an epidemic, then we can expect to see a number of new cases in the next three months."<p>   

Among the unknowns is why younger people should be at greater
risk than their elders for the disease if it is related to mad-cow
disease. Among the possibilities is that British scientists have
detected a new disease that is not related to mad-cow disease.
<p>  
 In this country, health officials have monitored Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease passively, by checking death certificates. The latest data are from 1993 and show no change from
the consistent rate of one case per million people reported in
recent years, Mahy said. The overwhelming majority are in people in
their 50s and older.
<p> 
 In the intensified program, health officials will actively monitor for the disease. For example, officials will contact doctors specializing in diseases of the nervous system, like
neurologists, brain surgeons, pathologists, and psychiatrists, as
well as hospitals and nursing homes, asking them to immediately
report suspect cases, Mahy said. Health officials are also working
to develop a definition of a case of the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
<p>  
 An effort will be made to increase the number of autopsies of
patients who die of possible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The
percentage is now low, about 6 percent, for a number of reasons, including the reluctance of pathologists to perform post-mortem examinations on such patients.<hr>

<h5>MAD COW DISEASE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM IN MINNESOTA </h5>

St. Paul Pioneer Press (ST) - April 10, 1996<br>
By: Tom Majeski<p>

Although  Minnesota  is  now  checking for mad cow disease, don't panic and
toss the beef from your freezer.
   Upon  recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, the Minnesota Health Department has established a precautionary
surveillance program to quickly identify any outbreaks of the human form of
mad cow disease currently causing hysteria in Britain.<p>

   But  state epidemiologist Michael Osterholm emphasizes there's no reason
for   Minnesotans   to   be   concerned   because   the  variation  of  the
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease  that  occurs  in the United States is different
than the one that is infecting people in Britain.<p>

   Unlike   the  new  cases  discovered  in  Britain,  most  incidences  of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease diagnosed in the United States have a hereditary
component.
   ``We're  not  at  risk  for  the disease,'' said state Health Department
spokesman Buddy Ferguson.<p>

   Minnesota's program is part of a national network established early last
year  to  identify and control a host of emerging infectious diseases, such
as  TB  and  cholera, that are causing major outbreaks in the United States
and elsewhere.
   ``We  were  picked  (for mad cow surveillance) because of our expertise,
not  because  of any risk,'' Osterholm said Tuesday. ``We want to make sure
we don't have it.''
   The  network was established by the CDC, and Osterholm heads Minnesota's
program.<p>

   Because  tabulating the incidence of the rare illness, which leaves
people's  brains  full  of  holes,  will  ensure that U.S. doctors spot any
disturbing trends, the CDC decided to begin the tracking project.<p>

   Britain  started  an  intensive  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease surveillance
program  in  1990.  That effort allowed scientists to detect the new strain
last month.
   Now  British  scientists want other countries to search for new patients
as carefully as they did.

   The tracking also will help Britain determine if its new strain truly is
linked  to  infected  cattle,  a question that should be settled within the
year, said Dr. Lawrence Schonberger, CDC's expert on the brain illness.<p>

   Minnesota  and  the  three  other  states  will ask neuropathologists to
search  their  records  for unusual Creutzfeldt-Jakob deaths and report any
concerns immediately to the CDC for investigation.
   Finding the new strain here, where no cattle are believed to be infected
with  mad  cow disease, would be evidence that the Britons weren't sickened
by  beef,  Schonberger  said. And if tainted beef did somehow sicken the 10
British victims, Britain should produce more patients soon, he said.<p>

   Osterholm  said  Health  Department  researchers  currently are checking
death records from 1991 to the present as a way to establish a norm.
   ``We  want  to  make  sure we summarize what's happened in the last five
years and then watch to see if anything changes,'' he said.
   ``The cases in England are very different from what we normally see with
the disease,'' he said. ``The question is: What is the real source?''<p>

   Osterholm  said  the cluster may represent the beginning of an outbreak,
with  many  more cases to come. And although no cattle in the United States
have been diagnosed with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, <b>no one knows for
sure that no U.S. cattle are infected</b>.

   Meantime,  Osterholm  said  he sees no reason for anyone in Minnesota to
change their eating habits.

<h3><a NAME="50">50</a> additional new human CJD deaths in the last 5 years</h3></center>

4.16.96 -- PORTLAND, OREGON  ...  Margie Boule, columnist for the Portland Oregonian, reported today that 50 additional new human CJD deaths in the last 5 years were reported to her by families who read her column about the Fauve family ten days ago.<p>

The new data is not consistent with reassurances from state epidemiologist Dr. David Fleming. who stated that the rate of CJD is the same as it has always been, about one per million per year.  The population of Oregon is about 2,500,000, whcih would yield 2.5 cases per year, or 12.5 cases in five years.  The 52  cases called into  Boule could only represent a fraction of those that actually occured in the state -- even so, it is 400% of the rate cited by the epidemiologist. <p>

Fleming claimed that "the disease is reported as a cause of death on the death certtificate, so it is fairly straighforward to see how many have been reported."  Also, the state health division is in contact with neurologists:  "Neurologists can walk in a room and determine whether it is CJD pretty easily."<p>
<p>
<i>[Sir Kenneth Calman, the Chief Medical Officer for the British Ministry of Health, said on 4.12.96 in Britain that "there is currently no clinical test for the disease."    The cause of death is frequently left off of death certificates in the U.S., particularly in cases of dementia,  so the claim that an accurate incidence rate  or rate constancy could be measured this way is nonsensical.  Few neurolgists would have ever encountered the disease at the 1 per million rate.  - webmaster]   </i>
<p>
Boule quoted earlier from the contrarian opinion of Dr. Thomas Pringle, a retired biocchemical geneticist in Eugene, Oregon:<p>
<p>
<blockquote>"I would not be a bit surprised to find that the BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy] agent has been present sporadically at high titre for the last ten years in the United States food supply and that there has been considerable human exposure to it, through beef, cosmetics, and dietary supplements [all three subjects of recent FDA voluntary bans]. <p>

 I find it very unfortunate that public health is taking a back seat in the U.S. to economic interests, in view of the very large numbers of people potentially exposed, the lack of practical tests for the infectious agent, the long incubation period of the disease, the difficulties in its diagnosis, and the total lack of treatment prospects."</blockquote><hr>

12-15 `MAD COW' VICTIMS A YEAR IN <A NAME="AREA">AREA</A></center></h3>

<blockquote>Philadelphia Daily News (DN) - Tuesday, March 26, 1996<br>
By: Mary Flannery<p>

She  was  discharged  from  Hahnemann  University Hospital 12 days ago, her
brain function so deteriorated that she was sent to a nursing home to await
death from what the British are calling mad cow disease.
   ``She  is  a blue-collar woman,'' her friend said. ``She's never been to
England. She's never eaten English food.''<P>

   Still,  she  contracted  the  fatal  brain  disease  that is terrorizing
England. The British call it mad cow disease, the term used for the illness
found in cattle.
   Here,   the   rare   human  disease  is  called  by  its  medical  name,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.<P>

   U.S.  authorities  say there's little chance of getting the disease from
either coming in contact with an infected patient or eating American beef.
   Approximately  200 Americans develop and quickly die from CJD each year,
according  to  the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, which
examined death certificates from 1979-1990.<P>


   They've  also  tracked person-to-person transmission - at least 80 cases
of  prion-related  brain  disease  are  known to have been acquired through
infected   cornea   transplants,   contaminated  surgical  instruments  and
injection of growth hormone derived from infected human pituitaries.

<h3><center>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in <a NAME="Canada">Canada</a></center></h3>
E Stratton et al, Canada Communicable Disease Report, 1996, 22(8), 57-61<p>

Between 1979 and 1993 there were 334 deaths attributed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Canada (before 1979 CJD was not listed as a
cause of death and it has not been a notifiable disease in Canada), ranging from 14 to 34 a year, with a 1.1:1.0 female-to-male ratio.<p>

Consistent with the population density of the country most deaths occurred in Ontario and Quebec (64%) and there was no evidence of
clustering by province or territory (although figures for smaller geographical areas were unavailable). Some 50% of deaths occurred over
the age of 60 years, the peak age for onset of sporadic-type CJD. Of 6 documented cases, 2 came from Czechoslovakia where there is a high
incidence of familial-type CJD. It is believed that most cases in Canada are sporadic.<p>
 A<b> trend of increasing mortality</b> was noted, in
age-adjusted mortality rate from 1.1 deaths per million population in 1979 to 1.7 million in 1993, with a marked increase since 1986,
possibly related to increased case recognition but also to an actual increase in incidence (the absolute numbers however were very small).<p>

The unadjusted annual rates remained between 0.6 and 1.1 cases per million population, consistent with estimates of incidence worldwide
(0.5-1.0 per million). In order to determine the risk of CJD transmission through blood transfusion or organ transplant the Laboratory
Centre for Disease Control has proposed investigative studies, including review of death certificates, active CJD surveillance and CJD
occurrence among haemophiliacs. <hr>

<h4><center><a NAME="FOUNDATION">FOUNDATION</a> IS LEGACY OF MAD COW DISEASE</center></h4>

Miami Herald (MH) - MON April 22, 1996<br>
By: STEPHEN SMITH Herald Staff Writer<p>

You  know it by a name that rings funny: mad cow disease, a deadly but rare
ailment, found far away in England.
Mayra Lichter knows it far more personally.
     Her  father  was  stricken  with  the human variation, a little-known,
little-understood condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. It killed him
in four months, stunning his family, inspiring them to establish a national
foundation in Miami devoted to understanding the disease and offering clues
to families watching relatives slip into an abyss of dementia.<p>

         "I  can't  cure  it,  I  can't give them hope, but I can give them
someone to talk to," says Lichter, a former federal prosecutor. "This isn't
the  kind  of  disease  where  we're  going to have a telethon and a poster
person and go around with cans soliciting donations.
      "But  I  couldn't walk away from this disease. It was too mysterious,
it was too devastating."<p>

          Doctors  at  Jackson  Memorial  Hospital  tracked  cases for nine
years.  From  1984  to  1989, there was an average of one case a year. That
climbed to 4.75 a year from 1990 to 1993.
         Writing  in  the  journal  Neurology,  researchers  concluded that
Creutzfeldt-Jakob "may be increasing in incidence in our community." One of
the  foremost  experts  on the disease, Dr. Joseph Berger, cautions against
drawing too many conclusions from the study he directed.

         "You  have  such a small pool of cases," says Berger, now chairman
of  the  University  of  Kentucky's  neurology  department,  "it could be a
statistical quirk."<p>
         A  teenager  named  Joseph  Sardo  helped  the  experts  in  their
sleuthing. The disease claimed his father in 1989.
      "I  told my son, we've got to take a negative and make a positive out
of it," says Cecile Sardo, who lives in South Dade.
      Her  husband  Joseph,  56,  worked  for Metro-Dade government for two
dozen years, a meticulous administrator in data processing. "My husband was
the  kind of person, whenever they had a big problem at work they said, let
Joe handle it."
      There  was one thing he couldn't handle, a disease that began to play
tricks  with  his  mind.  On  a cruise to the Caribbean, Joe Sardo, once so
gregarious, withdrew, making excuses about why he wasn't casting his lot at
the blackjack table.<p>
      Visits  to  neurologists  and cardiologists ensued. Maybe, they said,
it's  a  stroke.  Maybe,  they  offered,  it's early Alzheimer's. They took
pictures of his brain and heart, but everything ended up negative.
      Still,  the  bizarre  episodes  persisted.  There was the time in the
hospital  when  the  nurse  told  Joe  he  needed  to remain in bed after a
procedure  and,  just  minutes later, Cecile walked into the room and found
her husband standing in the bathroom.<p>
         "It  was bizarre, like being in the twilight zone -- in your life,
you  can't  imagine  this," says Cecile Sardo. "I know when you're handed a
diagnosis,  it's  horrible, but at least you know what you're dealing with.
When you don't know what you're dealing with, it's worse."<p>
       
         Berger  compares  the  healthy  proteins to sugar kept liquid in a
warm  bath: "Imagine a beaker filled with supersaturated sugar, and there's
no problem as long as it's warm," he says. "But if you allow it to cool and
you  stick  in  a  piece  of  string  as the catalyst, you end up with rock
candy."
         There's  a  similar  process churning away in the bodies of people
with   Creutzfeldt-Jakob   Disease,  proteins  converting  to  crystal-like
formations that burrow into the brain.<p>

         Lichter's  family became immersed in the mystery of the disease in
November  1992,  when  the symptoms first started stalking her father Felix
Reyler, a pioneer in international banking.
         "I remember the last time my father said anything, it was Feb. 14,
and  he  wished  my mother a happy Valentine's Day," says Lichter, of North
Miami.
      Reyler,  74,  died  March  3, four months after his wife and children
first  detected  symptoms.  There  was  the  onslaught  of  usual emotions:
depression, anger.<p>
      There  was  this, too: a desire to ease the pain of other families by
imparting information and wisdom.
      "It made me feel better to do something," Lichter says, "to find some
meaning  in my father's death. And in the back of my mind, I always thought
it  would  take  something  like  this  panic  in  Britain  to  focus  more
attention."<p>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Guards">Guards</A> officer died of  CJD after growth jabs</CENTER></H3>

By Maurice Weaver ... 28 September 1996 .. ET
<P>

HUMAN growth hormone prescribed for an under-sized boy gave him the stature to become a Guards officer but resulted in his death from Creutzfeld Jakob Disease at the age of 27, an inquest was told yesterday.
 The coroner, David Halpern, found that 2nd Lieut James Bettinson of the Welsh Guards, died two years ago by misadventure "in circumstances where there has been a finding of medical negligence". <p>

 It was the first inquest into a CJD death resulting from the use of pituitary extracts taken from dead people since a High Court ruling that any such treatment given after July 1, 1977 was negligent and irresponsible. By that date the medical establishment was aware of serious risks. But a breakdown in communications at the Medical Research Council meant this had not been conveyed to many "front line" doctors.<p>

 Dr Raymond Rayner, senior lecturer in paediatric and child health at Birmingham University, who prescribed the hormone for James Bettinson in 1977, told the inquest in Hereford that he did not know of the dangers. Lieut Bettinson, from Worcester, was one of 16 individuals to have died after receiving the treatment.<p>

 Three more have been diagnosed as having CJD and <B>a further 1,908 who had the injections are considered at risk</B>
 After hearing of Lieut Bettinson's decline and his struggle to keep up while in training at Sandhurst, the coroner decribed his case as "the most distressing and disturbing" ever to come before him.
 The dead man's father, Anthony Bettinson, a company director, said he and his wife, Sue, were concerned when James, their first-born, failed to grow physically. His younger sister overtook him and he was bullied at school.<p>

 After prolonged tests, Dr Rayner suggested the hormone treatment. This involved three injections daily of an extract taken from the pituitary glands of mortuary cadavers. The treatment continued until the boy was 17.
 " The treatment was a last resort as James was failing to grow," said Mr Bettinson. "We were not told there were any risks. We might have been told that the source was from cadavers but I do not recall being told so."<p>

The "misadventure" verdict made it clear that a third party had played a part in the death, albeit unintentionally
 After school James Bettinson, a strong and active young man who grew to more than 6ft, went to Australia and spent four years as a fisherman. He then opted for an Army commission and did well at Sandhurst. The first signs that something was wrong were a loss of balance. He found it increasingly hard to walk in a straight line and had to watch his own passing out parade from the stand.<p>

 A progressive decline set in affecting reflexes, walking, swallowing and eye movements. By November, 1994 Lieut Bettinson had to be tube fed, could not communicate and all four limbs were paralysed and spastic. Doctors confirmed CJD and told the family it was untreatable. The young officer died in a hospice from bronchial pneumonia linked to CJD on Sept 24, 1995.<p>

 Prior to the introduction of hormone growth treatment, CJD cases were sporadic, averaging one in a million people. The coroner emphasised that the case, and others like it, had no link to the current "mad cow" debate even though the disease was similar.
 It was clear, however, that the case was one of those where the estate of the deceased is able to make a claim against the Secretary of State for Health. The "misadventure" verdict made it clear that a third party had played a part in the death, albeit unintentionally.<p>

 Lawyers representing individuals who used the human growth hormone, or their bereaved families, are to attend a private hearing in London on Monday before Mr Justice Morland, the High Court judge who delivered the negligence ruling. They are pressing the Department of Health to make an out-of-court compensation settlement.

<H3>Two new v-CJD cases <A NAME="confirmed">confirmed</A></H3>

Two new cases of V-CJD have been confirmed by the CJD Surveillance Unit at
the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. (Electronic Telegraph, 28
September 1996)
 
J. Ralph Blanchfield has just got confirmation from CJDSU's James Ironside
that there are now 14 definite cases, and that the two new cases came from
the group of five previously diagnosed as "suspected V-CJD cases" by CJDSU.
 
A third victim, from the same group of five, have also just died.  We'll
soon know if she is V-CJD case number 15, or not.

   <H3><CENTER>Cows' blood is <A NAME="tested">tested</A> on humans</CENTER></H3>
The Sunday Times September 29 1996
<P>


HUMAN TRIALS of a blood substitute derived from cows are beginning in America and could
soon take place in Europe. 

BioPure, the American company developing the substitute, claims it is free of BSE
                                   and other contamination, but one big pharmaceuticals company working
on a rival product has warned that there may be problems with using animal products. It says
the safety of blood taken from cows can never fully guaranteed. <P>


Baxter Healthcare is working on a similar product, but made from out-of-date human blood. It
says: "Viruses present in animal blood are not as well characterised and are therefore more
difficult to detect than those in human blood. Animal-sourced products also must be subject to
rigorous purification procedures since contamination with animal-derived proteins can cause
allergic reactions."  <P>

Researchers point out, too, that there is no foolproof test for detecting
                                BSE.  <P>

BioPure, which uses haemoglobin processed from cows' blood, is carrying out trials in
America. Other studies are planned for Europe. 

A spokesman says: "We are very aware of the BSE
issue and we have a very significant herd-management programme that really prevents that
from being a problem. We also have a proprietary process that we believe would take it out
even if it was in there. To date BSE has not been detected in America." 

BioPure is testing one of two bovine blood products that use haemoglobin taken from cows. A
big attraction is that animal haemoglobin is in almost limitless supply and is cheap.  <P>

The BioPure product is one of the first-generation blood substitutes in development that are
based on haemoglobin from various biological sources, including human and cows' blood, or
are entirely synthetic, made from a solution of petrofluorocarbons. The substitutes, which
have a limited life, offer two distinct advantages.  <P>In operations, much transfused blood is lost
and these substitutes can be used instead of blood during surgery. Second, in trauma cases the
synthetic blood can be administered immediately without losing precious time blood-typing
and cross-matching as is required with real blood. And unlike real blood, which keeps for only
six weeks, the new haemoglobin materials can be stored for six months to a year and
stockpiled for disaster relief.  <P>

The substitutes may also reduce the risk of viral transmissions and may be more beneficial
for a range of patients, including victims of strokes and heart attacks, because they get oxygen
to areas that blood alone cannot reach and protect the functioning of vital organs.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Uncertainty continues over BSE/CJD
link</H3>
By Victoria Macdonald<BR>
<BR>
Sunday Telegraph ... Sunday 22 September 1996<BR>
<BR>
Six months ago, on March 20, the nation received an apocalyptic
message: there was a probable link between bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD).<BR>
<BR>
Later that same day, Professor John Pattison, chairman of the Government's
spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (SEAC), was asked about one
scientist's claim that there could be up to half
a million cases of CJD in Britain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He is quite correct that, at its extreme, it could be a very large
epidemic indeed,&quot; said Prof Pattison. Asked if it could be on the
same scale as the Aids epidemic, he said yes.<BR>
<BR>
The following weekend the members of SEAC hid themselves away at a civil
service college in Berkshire to consider the implications of the news.
A statement was later made saying that a &quot;precise measurement&quot;
of absolute risk in relation to BSE was impossible to make because of a
&quot;number of interacting uncertainties&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
SEAC had also been asked to advise on the risk to children and concluded
that &quot;if human infection with the BSE agent occurs, infants and children
are not likely to be more susceptible to that infection than are adults&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Hundreds of schools responded by taking beef off the menu. A worldwide
ban was placed on British beef, domestic sales plummeted and farmers got
very angry.<BR>
<BR>
'If we see a dramatic rise over the next six months that would become
more and more worrying'By that stage there had been 10 cases of the new variant of CJD (NVCJD)
and two more suspected cases. Those two cases have subsequently been confirmed.<BR>
<BR>
Six months ago Prof Pattison said, this time on BBC1's Panorama: &quot;It
is possible there will be no more. It is possible there will be one or
two.&quot; He added: &quot;If we see a dramatic rise over the next six
months that would become more and more worrying.&quot;
So here we are, six months later and there have still been only 12 confirmed
cases of NVCJD. What does the obvious lack of a dramatic rise tell us?<BR>
<BR>
Prof Pattison told The Sunday Telegraph on Friday: &quot;The news so far
has not been as bad as it might. Many epidemics have to run a significant
part of their course before you can get a feeling of what their shape and
size is going to be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He also said the comparison with Aids was unfortunate and misleading. &quot;Aids
is emotive and that is why the question was asked. Most people believe
that the scale of the Aids epidemic is greater than it really is. At the
moment all we can say is that it is still possible we have just seen those
few cases of CJD with a very short incubation period and that actually
the majority of cases which have a much longer incubation period are still
to come: we have no inkling of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The scientists, therefore, are no nearer to being able to reassure or even
prepare the public about an epidemic.<BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;Every six months that passes gives us more information and we
will be able to make some predictions in due course, but it is impossible
to be more definite,&quot; Prof Pattison said.<BR>
<BR>
</B>'We are on track for a fairly serious epidemic. When you get one case
it does not mean anything but as the numbers go up it is a major worry'<BR>
<BR>

Richard <A NAME="Lacey">Lacey</A>, professor of microbiology at Leeds University, who made
the initial 500,000 estimate, said he believes there are currently 25 suspected
cases of NVCJD - an estimate based on contact with relatives.<BR>
<BR>

On Thursday the Government put the beef cull on hold following scientific
evidence that BSE will have virtually run its course by the year 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Prof Lacey, whose ideas have been controversial, says that the evidence
from epidemiologists at Oxford is flawed because they have not taken into
account that BSE can spread from mother to calf and, he believes, can be
transmitted horizontally through the environment. &quot;There has been
a subjugation of scientific discussion to political argument,&quot; Prof
Lacey said. &quot;It was quite clear by the end of March that there was
a public health hazard. Yet the Government knowingly proposed an unworkable
slaughter programme.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Prof Pattison believes, however, that the Government has been correct in
rethinking the accelerated cull of all cattle over the age of 30 months.
The belief was that these were the animals most likely to have contracted
BSE before the feed ban was introduced.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The logical thing to do is think very carefully before you have any
form of accelerated cull,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you look at the epidemiological
analysis of what is predicted to happen, you cannot have a major impact
on that without slaughtering millions of animals. I do not think anyone
wants that. You take a step back and ask what would be the reason for culling
and should we do it at all and if so how many.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>It is notable that the public is returning to eating beef - at least
prime cuts<BR>
<BR>
</B>Prof Pattison also believes nothing could or should have been done
differently in the handling of the announcement of the probable link between
BSE and CJD.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence presented at the afternoon press conference in March and earlier
in the day in Parliament was that there had been 10 cases of NVCJD, identified
by the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh. The victims had an average age
of 27.5 years and were all aged under 42. The average age of CJD victims
until then had been 63.<BR>
<BR>
CJD has an incubation period of between 10 and
50 years and before the new incidents were revealed there were
an average of 50 cases a year. There is no evidence yet that that figure
will increase this year.<BR>
<BR>
It is notable, as Prof Pattison points out, that the public is returning
to eating beef - at least prime cuts. The Meat and Livestock Commission
said two weeks ago that sales were at 90 per cent of the pre-March levels.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from the Oxford announcement of the epidemiology of BSE, there have
been the studies on maternal transmission - showing it can be transmitted
from cow to calf, but with an infection rate of 10 per cent or less.<BR>
<BR>
There is now a ban on specified bovine materials - organs, spinal material
and the brains and heads - entering the food chain.<BR>
<BR>
Spot inspections are made of slaughterhouses and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food has commissioned a study of foodstuffs which might have
been infected before the ban.
'We cannot yet exclude the possibility that there will be large numbers.
It is frightening'
But there has been little in the way of reassuring news about CJD. Nobody
knows if it is possible for BSE to cross species - and this
is the crux of the matter.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We would not alter our wording from 'probable',&quot; said Prof Pattison.
&quot;Since the March announcement and the publication of the findings
in the Lancet, nobody has come along and said 'You guys were wrong'. Nobody
has challenged the concept that something new has been defined in CJD.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It suddenly emerged in the 1990s and, apart from one French case,
all of the cases are in the UK. We cannot think of a more probable cause
than exposure to BSE,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
What is now needed is the results of strain typing - working out if there
is a similarity between the BSE strain and the CJD strain.
&quot;We may show that there is not a link between BSE and NVCJD, in which
case we have a cluster of cases to explain with no hypothesis for it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Like the nation at large, Prof Pattison admits to a frustration. The early
cross-species experiments took a minimum of two years. It will be at least
that again before anything becomes half-way certain.
In the meantime, there is the wait for the epidemic to occur - or not.
&quot;


The <A NAME="truth">truth</A> is going to lie somewhere between two more cases and 500,000,&quot;
Prof Pattison said. &quot;We cannot yet exclude the possibility that there
will be large numbers. It is frightening.&quot;
And of very little reassurance at all.<BR>

<A NAME="spinal">American</A> scientists will announce this week that they have developed
a possible test for BSE that could eliminate the need for a
cull. It detects the presence of a protein in the spinal fluid of cattle,
but scientists do not know if it can diagnose BSE before symptoms develop.<BR>
<BR>

Clarence <A NAME="Gibbs">Gibbs</A>, of the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke near Washington, said he has asked the agriculture ministry
to supply bovine spinal fluid specimens to help him determine whether animals
incubating BSE can be detected.<BR>

<blockquote>
"I've been going through some newspaper articles trying to collate information
about the vCJD cases that were the basis for the government's statement on
March 20. (I assume everyone recalls that date.) The reports I've seen show
some inconsistencies and don't add up to 10 names. They include:
<pre> 
Vicky Rimmer, 18, North Wales
Stephen Churchill, 19, Wiltshire
an anonymous 16-year-old girl of Turkish-Cypriot extraction
Michelle Bowen, 29, Manchester
Jean Wake, 38
Fonnie Van Es, 44, Banbury
Christine Hay, 46, Australia
Maurice Callaghan, 30, Belfast, Ireland
Anna Pearson, 29, Kent
Ann Richardson, 41
Ken Sharpe, 42, Liverpool
David Tipping, Wiltshire
Ann Harness, Suffolk
Gwendoline Lawrence, 64, Clwyd
Kevin Morrison, 25, Aberdeenshire
Peter Hall, 20</pre>

 
This adds up to 16 names. They were all mentioned in newspaper reports about
vCJD in the days after March 20. However, other newspaper reports indicate
that David Tipping actually contracted his case of CJD from treatments of
human growth hormone, and Fonnie Van Es is apparently considered a normal
"spontaneous CJD" case rather than a case of vCJD. After eliminating them,
that still leaves 14 names. 
<p>
Can anyone comment <a HREF="mailto:Mongovenal@AOL.COM">to me</a> on this list? Which of the
names listed don't belong among "the 10"? Which ones have been confirmed as
vCJD by the government? Also, what's the current status of Vicky Rimmer? The
last report I've seen indicated that she was still alive. Is this still the
case? Finally, are there other confirmed or suspected vCJD cases not on this
list, or not among "the 10"?"</blockquote>

CJD families win court battle

In the UK families of people who died of CJD after receiving growth-hormone treatment as
children won their 6-year battle against the Department of Health. The High Court judge ruled
that the Department of Health should have acted on warning of CJD being contracted and
stopped using the treatment after July 1977, when it took over responsibility for it from the
Medical Research Council (MRC). The judge ruled that the Department had not been negligent
between 1958 and 1977 and cleared the MRC of any blame. Of 2000 children who received
growth hormone treatment a total of 16 have died and 3 are known to have the disease. Another
200 actions are pending, some of which claim mental injury because of fear of the disease. A
damages claim was mounted for those treated after 1977 and a campaign was launched for
ex-gratia payments form public funds for those treated before 1977.

Science Editor, The Independent for 30 Aug 1996 [not used]
<P>
<I>I think that the most interesting point in the latest Nature was a
throwaway line in David Skegg's article: saying that the mouse bioassay is
not sensitive enough. This is self-evident, he says, because it can't
determine which tissue is the cause of maternal infection. But maternal
infection happens. Therefore the mouse is not a sufficient indicator of
tissues' infectivity. </I>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>People generally look to science to offer an unequivocal answer to
questions. How inconvenient, then, to have to say that in the matter of the
culling of cattle aged over 30 months, science can offer powerful arguments
both for and against halting the scheme right now.<P>
        The arguments in favour appear in the careful calculations of the
team of Oxford scientists, who yesterday reported that the BSE epidemic
will die out in 2001 if there is no cull; and at virtually the same time if
there is. For every case of BSE averted by the cull, they reckon, 45 cows
will die needlessly. The government estimates that the cost of the scheme
will be 600 million in the first year, and 500 million in each subsequent
year.<P>
        But some disturbing data has also emerged in the past month. BSE
can be transmitted from cow to calf. How? We don't know. This, says David
Skegg, of the University of Otago in New Zealand, pushes us towards some
uncomfortable facts. <B>None of the tissues that might carry the disease from
the mother cause BSE when injected into mice. But some must carry it;
otherwise the calf could not catch it.</B><P>
        Therefore, injecting cow tissues into mice is not a sensitive
enough way of finding out whether the BSE agent is present. <B>However, all
the government's assurances about the safety of beef and other tissues such
as liver and lungs - yesterday's latest putative BSE-carrying villain - are
based around the assumption that mice are just like humans</B> in their
sensitivity to BSE. Other experiments with monkeys imply they are not. The
scientists advising the government have tried to make this point
repeatedly, but the politicians don't want to hear them. "It's true," says
Jeff Almond, of the Spongiform Encepalopathy Advisory Committee. "If al the
tissues are genuinely BSE-negative, then you couldn't have maternal
transmission." But you do: up to 10 per cent of calves born to BSE-infected
mothers develop the disease.<P>
        We can hear the wind of logic blowing through this house of cards.
Beef might not be "safe" after all - though the rapid drop in the incidence
of the disease means that at least fewer cows harbouring the disease are
reaching our dinner plates. And if there is one measurement in all this
which is even harder to fathom than the risk posed by BSE to humans, it is
the extent to which British consumers - ostensibly the object of all these
policies - are really worried.<P>
        In all of this, my sympathies lie with the farmers. They have often
been depicted as the creators of the BSE epidemic, who somehow "fed cows to
cows" - as if they hung the carcasses up in their farmyards to be consumed
by the herd, like a fox before hounds. Quite untrue; many are people vainly
trying to make a living from this 10,000-year-old profession, who are beset
by the pressures of the modern world with its insistence on economy,
efficiency and productivity. Nobody could blame the farmers for taking the
cheap option of using the protein cakes from the meat and bone meal
manufacturers. Those are the companies to blame, if blame has to be laid.
They too will feel the pinch if the cull goes ahead.
<P>


The number of infected cows consumed, by the way, averages out to about 1
in every 50 over the past ten years in Britain. Before the SBO ban, it was
slightly higher - about 3 per cent.
<P>

Dealler's figure, from p.295 of his book, for the years 1985-1995 of
"cattle eaten that were incubating BSE at the time of slaughter", totals to
1.71 million. In the average year, a total of 3.2 million cows are
slaughtered, so multiply by 10 to get your decade total of slaughtered
cows.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<H3><CENTER>French <A NAME="villagers">villagers</A> cheer farmers on mad cow march</CENTER></H3>
THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS<BR>
FROM BEN MACINTYRE IN PARIS ... August 28 1996

<P>

A HERD of French cows, flanked by police motorcycle outriders, plodded along the slow lane of a busy highway towards Paris yesterday in the latest, and maddest, protest at the dire effects of mad cow disease on the French beef industry.



The cattle and their owners set off from the south of Poitiers on August 11 to draw attention to plunging beef prices and, as they approach the end of their 220-mile odyssey, they have caught the imagination of the public and brought new pressure to bear on the French Government.

<P>

"We want to see President Chirac, and we will," declared Jacques Tourenne as he rounded up his cows on a football field near Rambouillet, 30 miles south of Paris, for the morning cattle-drive.



The herd and herdsmen, originating in one of the poorest agricultural regions of France, will arrive in the capital on Saturday when the animals will be assembled on the Champ de Mars, which has not seen grazing cattle since the siege of Paris in 1870.

<P>

What began as a quixotic protest by a handful of farmers from the Vienne region has gradually swollen to 36 cows and more than 80 people.



Teams of six cows at a time take it in turn to amble along the tarmac, behind a tractor with a placard reading: "We are marching to avoid annihilation", while the rest of the herd follows in trailers.

<P>

Passing through small towns and villages along the way, they are greeted by the ringing of church bells and spontaneous offers of food and money from sympathetic locals.



Beef consumption in France has dropped by a third since the start of the mad cow crisis in March, and the protesters say they face financial ruin unless the Government and the European Union steps in with massively increased compensation and a fixed price for beef.

<P>

The protest now occupies a regular slot on the evening news and the progress of the "Mad Cow March" is relayed daily by national newspapers. Politically and otherwise, a prolonged occupation of the Champ de Mars, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, could prove extremely messy.



Jacques Chirac has often emphasised his roots in the cattle-producing region of the Corr&egrave;ze and one senior Elys&eacute;e official said President Chirac would probably agree to meet a delegation of the marchers at the weekend.

<P>

The troop headed north along the four-lane N10 highway yesterday at a steady 2mph, causing huge tailbacks but prompting honks of support from lorries passing in the opposite direction.

<P>

Roland Fontaneau said he did not regret giving up his summer holiday to walk to Paris. "This was the best way we could think of to show how serious things have got," he said.



Like many French farmers, he holds Britain to blame for the health scare that has undermined his livelihood, but he also suspects a more sinister conspiracy. "I think the United States put pressure on Britain to destabilise the European beef market so that American suppliers could monopolise the market," he said.

<P>

At night the walkers sleep on straw in the cattle trailers or accept whatever local hospitality is offered. "It's amazing how much help we've had," M Fontaneau remarked, as he whacked the ample rump of Marguerite, a Limousin heifer and the self-appointed herd-leader. The walkers say that Marguerite has become wholly committed to the protest, often refusing to get back into the trailer at the end of her stint on the road.



Herding cows on a dual carriageway is technically illegal, yet the police have not only allowed the march to continue but have provided a motorcycle escort. They have warned the herdsmen, however, that as traffic becomes heavier on the approach to the capital, the cows will have to travel on the trailers for some stretches and avoid rushhours.

<P>

After their strenuous efforts, the cows will not end up at the Rungis foodmarket outside Paris, but will be returned to the Vienne, leaner and a good deal fitter. "Sometimes we bathe their feet because the road makes them hot," said Jean Grolleau, owner of Marguerite, but otherwise the cows appeared to be enjoying their forced march.

BY BEN MACINTYRE<BR>THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS: August 31 1996
<P>
 A HERD of more than 30 cows grazed nonchalantly alongside the Eiffel Tower yesterday as President Chirac met their owners and promised to support cattle farmers after the BSE crisis.



The protesters, bovine and human, left Charroux in central France on August 11 to walk 220 miles to Paris, and were cheered by Parisians as they plodded on to the grassy Champ de Mars yesterday.

<P>

The day after farm unions mounted a huge operation to intercept lorries suspected of importing beef from Britain and outside the European Union, M Chirac welcomed a delegation of demonstrators, who entered the Elys&eacute;e Palace clad in farming clothes and carrying staffs. "The farmers must know that we support cattle breeding and that we will not let them down," the President said after the meeting.



M Chirac's power base is in the cattle-producing Corr&egrave;ze region and the former Agriculture Minister spent an hour and a half listening to the grievances of the farmers, who have seen beef consumption drop by up to a third since March.

"He talks like a farmer," Pierre Grolleau said, adding: "The President told us he would not let us down, but he had no magic wand."

<H3><CENTER>French <A NAME="send">send</A> calves to British abattoirs for EU handout</CENTER></H3>
The Times: Britain   August 31 1996<BR>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT
<P>


NEWBORN French calves are being shipped to Britain in their hundreds to be slaughtered under a subsidy scheme intended to compensate British dairy farmers for income losses caused by "mad cow" disease.

<P>

The Labour Party and animal welfare groups said they were appalled by the trade and called on the Government to stop it. The Ministry of Agriculture is raising this matter with the European Commission. But a spokesman said there was nothing illegal about the imports under the free-trade rules of the single market.

<P>

Several hundred French calves have arrived through Dover over the past few weeks in a reversal of the trade in British veal calves to the Continent which last year brought thousands of protesters on to the streets. But the French calves are not for rearing or eating. They are taken straight to an abattoir to be slaughtered.

<P>

The carcasses are rendered and incinerated. Provided the animals are less than 20 days old, they qualify for an EU subsidy of &#163;103 a head. The subsidy was introduced in April after British beef exports were banned in response to the Government's disclosure of a possible link between Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and eating beef contaminated by BSE. Before the ban, dairy farmers had been exporting up to 450,000 calves a year to the Continent for veal production, a trade worth about &#163;45 million.

<P>

The animals were mainly surplus male calves for which there is no market here. British farmers, with the export market closed, have sent some 151,000 calves to slaughter under the Calf Processing Scheme to claim the subsidy, which is shared with the abattoir operator.

<P>

The man behind the import of French calves is David Muir, a leading livestock dealer based near Oxford. He says he is merely trying to save a business virtually destroyed overnight by the beef ban.


"Some people are trying to portray me as an unscrupulous cattle dealer, but I have to make living," he said. "Since the ban I have had to lay off the 18 people I had working for me and get rid of seven of my ten lorries. I desperately need the work."

<P>

Mr Muir said that he got &#163;5 of the &#163;103 subsidy per animal as commission. About &#163;80 went to the French farmer and the rest to the abattoir. He began shipping calves several weeks ago and his latest consignment of 200 arrived at Dover from Dunkirk yesterday. "The French have just as much need of this subsidy as the British," he said. "French cattle prices have been driven down by the BSE scare and &#163;80 is a better price than they can get on their local markets."

<P>

Elliot Morley, Labour's spokesman on rural affairs and animal welfare, said the Goverment must act to stop the trade. Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming, which led last year's protests against the veal trade, said he was "appalled at this slaughter of the innocents".

<P>

Mr Morley said: "The subsidy was put in place to help British farmers. It is being funded very largely by British taxpayers and it is not designed to line the pockets of people dragging calves over here from mainland Europe."

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture said the subsidy came out of the EU budget and would be mostly paid for by taxpayers in other states.<HR>
<A NAME="Retailers balk at BSE-free beef plan"></A><BR>
<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#00BF00">Retailers balk at BSE-free beef plan</FONT></CENTER></H3>
By Alison Maitland<BR><BR>
The Financial Times    ...   Wednesday August 28 1996<BR><BR>
The government yesterday came under pressure to ease the strict conditions for its BSE-free beef scheme after Marks and Spencer found that none of the 500 Scottish farms which supply it could meet the criteria.<BR><BR>
The food retailer said many of the farms had had no cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy - or <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease - but failed to meet other anti-BSE criteria set by the agriculture ministry for the beef assurance scheme. These cover the type of feed used, and its storage, and outlaw the common practice of adding dairy cows to beef herds.<BR><BR>
Mr Edward Goodman, an M&S food technologist, said the retailer had sent its findings to the ministry in the hope it would change the criteria. "We were very disappointed," he said.<BR><BR>
The scheme is designed to provide an outlet for specialist, late maturing breeds aged up to 42 months, mainly from Scotland and Northern Ireland. Beef from cattle over 30 months has been banned from the food chain since March.<BR><BR>
The government hopes the scheme, launched last week, will be a "foot in the door" to an eventual lifting of the European Union export ban on British beef. It expects 2,500 to 3,000 herds to be involved in the scheme, which cost (UK pounds) 700,000 to establish.<BR><BR>
But most supermarket groups are shunning the scheme. Tesco is one of the few that has not ruled out joining. "We need to review whether the claims will stand up as far as the customer is concerned," said Mr Andrew Batty, meat trading director.<BR><BR>
J. Sainsbury said it had no plans to change its policy of stocking meat only from cattle under 30 months. Waitrose said: "There are so few farms taking part in it that we won't necessarily be able to get the standard and quantity we need." Somerfield said the scheme was "of no interest to us at all".<BR><BR>
Even independent butchers, whom the government sees as the most likely initial outlet, are unsure the scheme will work.<BR><BR>
Mr Roger Kelsey, president of the National Federation of Meat and Food Traders, which represents about 10,000 high street butchers, said: "The problem is whether there's enough supply to satisfy the demand and whether distribution is going to be up to scratch."<BR>

Michael Jacobs<BR>
The Guardian    ...   Wednesday, July 24, 1996<BR><BR>
THE announcement yesterday that it may be possible for BSE to be transmitted through sheep as well as cattle deals a further body blow to Europe's agricultural industry, still reeling from the original BSE crisis.<BR><BR>
The sheep and cattle cases differ in vital respects. The precautionary measures to be announced today to remove the potentially infected parts of sheep from the food chain contrast markedly with the slothful reaction of the authorities to the incidence of BSE in cattle in the 1980s. We may be grateful that at least something has been learned. But the underlying issues are the same.<BR><BR>
Not that you would understand this from listening to the reactions of the politicians. Once again, the deeper character of an environmental problem seems to escape comprehension.<BR><BR>
Take "risk". We shall no doubt be told today that we are more likely to be run over on our way to the supermarket than to catch <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> from the lamb we buy there. Risk, say the experts, is a question of probability; and the probability of being infected by beef (let alone lamb) is minuscule. Given that people take hundreds of other risks every day that are statistically far larger (such as smoking and driving), it is irrational for consumers to stop buying meat. But this fails to see the problem from the consumer's perspective. As an individual lay person, none of us has any idea what the statistical probability is of catching CJD (or indeed of many other risks we take). We are not scientists conducting experiments or compiling statistics. All we have to go on is what the experts tell us. So to the consumer, risk is not actually about probabilities at all. It's about the trustworthiness of the institutions which are telling us what the risk is. Do we believe them?<BR><BR>
Unfortunately, that doesn't leave the Government in a very strong position because, frankly, people don't trust it. They particularely don't trust the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has a long record of supporting the agricultural industry whatever harms it proposes to inflict on the consumer. In these circumstances it is perfectly rational to stop eating meat; since they've got it wrong before, there is every chance they'll have it wrong this time. Better be safe than sorry.<BR><BR>
Underlying this consumer concern is actually a much deeper anxiety. The Government will no doubt tell us this week that the fall-off in sales of lamb will not last long. A temporary panic, they will say, whipped up by the media scare.<BR><BR>
Look at beef sales, now back to within 80 and 90 per cent of their pre-BSE levels after falling through the floor in March. This shows how fickle public concerns are about environmental issues: certainly there is no call here, they will say, for a deeper reappraisal of the agricultural industry.<BR><BR>
But this mistakes symptoms for causes. There is no question that expressed public concern about individual environmental issues rises and falls in reaction to media exposure. But the underlying anxieties remain even when the particular topical issue has passed.<BR><BR>
This is clear from public attitude research. In qualitative surveys, the most common reaction of members of the lay public to the revelation that herbivorous cattle have been fed with sheep meat - and now, we learn, that sheep have likewise been eating dead cattle -is that it is "unnatural". Others describe the practice as "perverted". These phrases capture a form of moral disgust which in turn manifests a far more profound anxiety about the nature of industrial society than the political system is wont to recognise.<BR><BR>
RECENT studies confirm a deep concern amongst people in all social groups about "the environment" and what is being done to it. But this anxiety is not of the kind with which politicians (and indeed pressure groups) are very comfortable. It's not a specific concern about particular issues. It's a more general common feeling that the riches of industrial society have been bought at a price; and the costs are now "coming home to roost," (a phrase frequently used by respondents to survey interviews and in discussion groups). Fear that one's children will experience much worse environmental problems in the future is particularly widespread.<BR><BR>
These general feelings attach themselves to whatever environmental subjects emerge into the news. Specific issues - BSE, veal calves, Brent Spar - simply act as vehicles propelling a more amorphous environmental anxiety to the surface of public life.<BR><BR>
The problem is that, once they get there, there is nothing to hang on to to ensure that they stay in public debate. British politics lacks an ideological framework through which environmental issues like the BSE crisis can be given proper political expression. It is clear that modern conservatism cannot do this. The conservative party's traditional ties to the farming lobby now comes attached to an anti-regulatory, free market zeal; a combination which makes it impossible for the problems of the agricultural industry to be properly addressed.<BR><BR>
The Labour Party has quite rightly highlighted the responsibility of the Govenrment's de-regulation policies for allowing the BSE problem to develop. Environmental issues are questions of regulations and dealing with them almost always requires state intervention in markets for the public good. Labour is well placed to frame the issues ideologically in this way. But the deeper question of the kind of agricultural industry which such intervention should seek to promote seems to be beyond it.<BR><BR>
This is not just because Labour's electoral tactics dictate that the European beef ban must not become a solely Tory campaign. It is becaue the answer relates to the more fundamental issue of the relationship between inudustrial society and the natural environment.<BR><BR>
Like other spheres of economic life, the present methods of the agricultural industry are fundamentally unsustainable. The environmental costs that have now become apparent - not just BSE, but pesticide residues on vegetables, nitrate pollution of water supplies, loss of natural habitats, greenhouse gas emissions from vast transport distances - arise from the very structure of the industry. These are not problems which can be dealt with simply by add-on regulatory measures; as we discovered again yesterday, as soon as one appears to be "solved" another emerges. They can only be dealt with at a fundamental level, by changing the basic processes of the industry towards less intensive, and less chemicalised methods.<BR><BR>
Such a re-structuring will not be easy; there will be substantial transitional costs in doing so, and food prices are certain to rise. Public anxiety about the environmental effects of present agricultural methods offers a base of public support on which such a programme might be built. But so long as the issues continue to be framed within conventional political categories, it is hard to see where the momentum for reform might come.<BR><BR>
The absence of a properly politicised green movement in the UK is keenly felt here. Agricultural policy reform is an issue which clearly presents the green case; where the language of political ecology-in particular, the concept of "environmental sustainability" finds its natural resonance. The environmental pressure groups do their best. But their focus is on policy, when the real need is to articulate the issues at an ideological level, framing the issues in terms of the fundamental environmental imbalance of the present system. If this could be done, there is a significant wellspring of public concern waiting to be tapped.<BR><BR>

<H3><CENTER>Farmers in <A NAME="France">France</A> stage night raids to block British beef</CENTER></H3>

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS  August 30 1996<BR>
FROM BEN MACINTYRE IN PARIS
<P>

THOUSANDS of angry French farmers erected barricades and intercepted lorries suspected of carrying beef from Britain or countries outside the European Union in an all-night protest over the dire effects of "mad cow" disease.



The display of muscle by farm unions, organised in strictest secrecy and carried out with military-style precision, helped to push the franc yesterday to its lowest level for five months.

<P>

Using portable telephones and faxes, union leaders mobilised more than 15,000 demonstrators to block main roads, frontier posts and toll gates from late Wednesday night, while squads of farmers carried out spot-checks on lorries carrying meat into France. Simultaneous protests were held in several French towns and cities.


Unions said the "nocturnal operation" was intended to reassure French consumers that no British beef was being smuggled into France in defiance of the import ban, and to ensure that all imported meat conformed to health safety standards. But the protest was also aimed at cheap meat from East Europe, which French farmers say has helped to force down prices after the BSE crisis. Beef consumption in France has dropped by a third since March.

<P>

More than 2,000 lorries were intercepted illegally before the barricades were dismantled yesterday morning. The unions said at least 15 lorries were found to be carrying "suspect" cargo.

<P>

More than 40 British lorries were stopped on arrival at the Channel ports of Dieppe and Le Havre between 10pm and 4am. Four of these, carrying British poultry and lamb, were searched thoroughly and then allowed to continue.



"We know it's illegal, we have no right to intercept vehicles, but we felt it was important for the sake of French consumers," Arnold Puech-Dalissac, an official of the National Centre of Young Farmers in Normandy, said.



"The British lorry drivers always look frightened when they see a hundred French farmers waiting for them on the dock, but we treated them correctly."



The police made no attempt to restrain the farmers. But union officials said police had diverted some lorries away from the roadblocks.

<P>

The demonstration, on the eve of an EU meeting to discuss the BSE crisis, was jointly organised by France's two largest agricultural unions, the FNSEA and the young farmers' union, which have long threatened an "explosive" end to the summer. Farmers are demanding increased compensation to counter the collapse of the beef market. "There will be more union operations in the next few days if our calls for help are not heard," a statement said.


Luc Guyau, head of the FNSEA, said: "We will be inflexible." He added that the aim of the protest was not to close borders, but to ensure that "both producers and consumers benefit from complete openness on the origin of meat". The operation was carried out in secrecy in order to intercept "rogue importers from outside the EU".

In other protests, farmers dumped veal on the streets of Laval, invaded local government offices in the Creuse region and occupied an abattoir near Grenoble. A Dutch lorry driver on the Belgian border who refused to allow an inspection had his tyres slashed and his cargo handed over to customs officials.

<P>

 Philippe Vasseur, the Agriculture Minister, insisted last night that he had not been warned in advance of the unions' demonstration, but avoided criticising the farmers. "We will do what we have to do to ensure the farmers are compensated for their losses and to safeguard their future." President Chirac has agreed to meet a delegation of farmers from the Vienne region today. The group, driving a herd of more than 30 cows ahead of them, are due to arrive on the Champ de Mars in central Paris this morning, a day ahead of schedule.


"We have some simple truths to tell him, particularly about the effects of BSE disease," a spokesman for the group said.

(Extracted from Animal Pharm No 349, 24 May, 1996 
<P>

The German ban on imports of Swiss beef and beef products must remain in place until the BSE
problem is cleared, Agriculture Minister Jochum Bochert has stressed. To date Switzerland
has had 211 cases of BSE. Speaking at a meeting of the German central agricultural marketing
board (CMA) last month, the minister sought to reassure consumers by stressing that German
beef comes only from animals slaughtered in Germany and veterinarian checked. However,
compared with its European neighbours, the German reaction to BSE has been out of
proportion to its incidence. <P>


To date there have been 4 cases of BSE reported in Germany. All were imported breeding stock
from the UK and held to have been "infected" prior to entering Germany. There is no definite
proof however of when and how that "infection" took place, notes Arzte Zeitung. Moreover, all
four were of breeds usually grassfed and reared extensively. Perhaps as few as 200 of the
160000 British BSE cases have stemmed from cattle reared in this manner, believes Dr Gotz
Anhalt, a veterinarian with the Agriculture Ministry of Lower Saxony. <P>


The 4 cattle were sold at about 2 years old to German cattle traders. It is assumed that they
were fed up before export to enhance weight gain and make them more attractive to dealers.
Their ages, 3 were born in 1988 and 1 in 1986, would indicate that that any such feeding
with meat and bone meal would have occurred after the UK's July 1988 ban on mammalian
feed, thus illegally. Arzte Zeitung has thus speculated on the possibility that they became
infected within Germany. The animals were sold through cattle traders in Lower Saxony and
elsewhere. There is a dispute for at least one as to the herd of origin. A veterinarian claimed
that for the index case in February 1992, UK documentation showed clearly that the animal
came from a herd that until then had been BSE-free. Another veterinarian also involved in the
diagnosis claims that the precise origin was far from clear and possibly through "dubious
channels". 
<P>
The issue of BSE and its effects in Germany have incensed the national farmers'
union (DBV) whose president has lambasted the UK for its "scandalous negligence" in past BSE
control efforts. He asserts that German farmers are innocent victims and have suffered a very
severe backlash - surveys show that German beef consumption is lagging at under half
pre-crisis levels. The DBV is adamant that mammalian feed has never been fed to German

A survey of 50 physicians was conducted in Leeds, England, to evaluate their awareness of the
national surveillance system for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Of the 38 physicians who
responded 4 neurologists were aware of the system (3 of whom had seen cases), no neurologist
responded who was unaware of the system; 3 psychiatrists were aware but 7 were not aware
of the system; 5 specialists in geriatrics were aware and 2 were not; 8 other medical
specialists were aware but 9 were not. Cases of variant-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, who may
not initially present with obvious neurological symptoms, may at first be referred to
psychiatrists, a group that appears to be less aware of the surveillance system. The
researchers call for the existence of the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh to be made more
widely known and for working case definitions for provisional, possible and confirmed cases to
be available.

An immunohistological study of the spinal cord in 20 cases of sporadic and 4 iatrogenic (growth hormone) cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) diseasepatients was performed to detect the presence of disease specific prion protein using a number of different antisera. Prion protein was present in all thegrowth hormone recipients and in 11 of the 20 sporadic CJD cases. Plaque-like deposits of prion protein were found in all the growth hormone cases andthree of the sporadic cases. This is the first demonstration of the topographic immunolocalisation of prion protein in the spinal cord of CJD patients, afeature which could help elucidate some important aspects of the pathogenesis of CJD.

Despite many sensational and intimidating reports in the mass media, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion disease) are not contagious in theusual sense. Successful transmission requires both specific material (an affected individual's tissue, from or adjacent to CNS) and specific modes (mainlypenetrating contact with the recipient). Nevertheless, specific safety precautions are mandatory to avoid accidental transmission and to decontaminate anyinfectivity. Autopsy is essential for definite diagnosis of these disorders. Recommendations are given here for performance of the autopsy, forneuropathology service and appropriate decontamination; they are based on the current literature and on precautions taken in most laboratories withexperience in handling tissue from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In particular, special care must be taken to avoid penetrating wounds,possible contamination should be kept to a minimum, and potential infectious material must be adequately decontaminated by specific means.

A great deal of controversy and concern exists over potential transmission of central nervous system diseases by corneal transplant. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the available data relative to this question, pertaining especially to transmission of infectious dementia. From these data,
determination of conveyance risks are possible, and rational policies for donor inclusion criteria can be constructed. Retrospective analysis of available
published data regarding transmission of infectious dementias was performed. Risk of disease transmission was calculated from population data. Of the
various forms of dementia, only rabies, hepatitis B, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been transmitted by corneal transplantation. Transmission
of the first two viruses is preventable by serologic testing. Prevention of CJD transmission relies on clinical history. Despite the possibility of
transmission and the lack of available testing, slow virus disease (CJD) has been transmitted only once. That this case represents an extremely rare event
is supported by a lack of successful transmission via corneal transplant in monkeys; lower levels of infectious agent in cornea than in brain; lack of
successful transmission of similar human dementias, including Alzheimer's disease to primates; the apparent requirement for homozygosity at codon 129
of chromosome 20 for transmission; lack of transmission in 5-10% of CJD cases even after brain inoculation; and low numerical risk of transmission
based on population data. Only 0.5-4 CJD infected donors per year would be expected. Current Eye Bank Association of America criteria for donor
exclusion based on suspicious history are adequate to protect against accidental conveyance of transmissible dementia.

August 20 1996 ... London Times... BY PAUL WILKINSON
<P>

THE parents of a student who died from a new strain of the brain disease CJD welcomed a <B>coroner's verdict yesterday that their son was probably killed by eating beefburgers contaminated with BSE</B>.

Peter Hall began suffering memory loss as an A-level student but won a place to read mathematics at Newcastle University before the disease reduced him, over three years, to a shambling wreck. <B>He died in February, aged 20</B>.

<P>

At an inquest in Durham yesterday, the Coroner, Geoffrey Burt, recorded a verdict of misadventure. He said: "I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Peter contracted this disease prior to 1990 <B>through eating some form of contaminated beef product, such as a beefburger.</B>

"It cannot be proved scientifically that there is a link between CJD and BSE. We base our decisions on the level of proof and the basis of probabilities. I cannot see any reasonable explanation for a young man contracting CJD.

"Like many people his age, he had a liking for snack food and beefburgers.<STRONG> It is well known that not all beefburgers are made from the finest quality beef.</STRONG>"

<P>

Mr Hall's mother, Frances, said: "We are very pleased at the outcome of the case. We will carry on our fight because someone is to blame. The Government has known there has been a problem for a lot of years but they kept it quiet." His father, Derek, said: "It provides more ammunition for us to get things moving towards a public inquiry."

The couple, from Chester-le-Street, Co Durham, who have <B>another son, John, 25, filmed the latter stages of their son's illness to illustrate the effects of the disease.</B>

<P>

The inquest was the first to be held in Britain into a variant of CJD called kuru, found originally among the cannibalistic Fore tribe of South-East Asia. Only 11 other cases have been diagnosed in Britain in the past three years. At first, neurologists refused to consider it was CJD because the illness normally affects much older people.
Mr Hall told the inquest that his son became a vegetarian four years ago. "Before that <B>he liked beefburgers as a snack. He liked brisket</B> too. We would have that more often than not on a Sunday."

<P>

The illness first manifested itself through memory loss. He dropped out out of Newcastle University after three months. The following year he started an environmental studies course at Sunderland.

He lost weight and started suffering problems with his balance. He was eventually admitted to Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. David Burn, a consultant neurologist, said tests had shown that Mr Hall had two rogue genes, a "statistical improbability", which made him susceptible to CJD.

<P>

<B>Robert Perry, a consultant neuropathologist</B> at Newcastle General Hospital, questioned by Jonathan Glasson for the Hall family, said: "My personal view is that <B>BSE might be passed on by eating meat with offal in it which is infected. I am sure BSE can be transferred to man</B> but it depends how. Most neurologists would link CJD to the BSE epidemic but would probably not say so in public."

<P>

The Department of Health said: "Our position remains unaltered. There is no scientific proof that human beings can contract CJD from beef."<HR>

The Daily Telegraph    ...   Tuesday 20 August 1996<P>


A CORONER decided that a student died from the human equivalent of mad
cow disease probably through eating contaminated beefburgers in his
youth.<P>

Peter Hall had been a vegetarian for almost four years up to his death,
having watched a television documentary on animal cruelty. He died in
February, nine days before his 21st birthday, while suffering from a
degenerative illness. Tests revealed that he had a rare form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Only 11 other cases have been known in the
UK in the last three years.<P>

Geoffrey Burt, the North Durham coroner, set a <B>legal precedent by
recording a verdict of misadventure</B>. He told a Durham inquest:
"Investigations have been carried out by the surveillance unit in
Edinburgh to see if there is a link between this type of CJD and BSE. The conclusions
are that it cannot be proved to the extent required for scientific
proof. This is a court of law and the level of proof required is on the
balance of probabilities. I am satisfied it is more likely than not that
he contracted this disease prior to 1990 by eating some form of
contaminated beef product, probably a product such as a beefburger."<P>

The hearing was told that during his early schooldays Peter, of Chester
le Street, Co Durham, had enjoyed eating beefburgers. While sitting
three A-levels he developed signs of memory loss. He passed two and was
accepted on a degree course at Newcastle University, but he left after
three months because he had difficulty concentratiing.<P>

<H3><CENTER>Cows for slaughter may be <A NAME="shipped">shipped</A> out</CENTER></H3>

By David Brown, Agriculture Editor<P>

The Daily Telegraph    ...   Tuesday 20 August 1996<P>

MINISTERS plan to ship thousands of cattle from Northern Ireland to
mainland Britain for slaughter if abattoirs in the province refuse to
lift their boycott of the Government's <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BSE</FONT> cattle culling programme to restore
confidence in beef.<P>

Abattoirs in Ulster withdrew last Friday from taking part in the cull of
beef cattle more than 30 months of age after the Intervention Board for
Agricultural Produce - the Reading-based Government agency which
administers the scheme - proposed cutting money the abattoirs receive
for killing the animals by at least half. No cattle were killed
yesterday under the scheme in Northern Ireland, where up to 90,000 await
slaughter. Farmers receive no compensation under the Government for
their losses until the animals are killed.<P>

Talks were going on late yesterday in London between officials of the
Intervention Board and representatives of the Ulster Abattoir Operators.
George Trevelyan, chief executive of the Intervention Board, said: "We
have not ruled out shipping the cattle across. But we have to study the
costs."<P>

Since May abattoirs in Northern Ireland, in common with others in the
United Kingdom, have received (UK pounds) 87.50 an animal for cattle
more than 30 months old. It emerged yesterday that they are now being
offered less than (UK pounds) 40. Some abattoirs in England have said
that they could do the job for only (UK pounds) 27.50 a head.<P>

<H3><CENTER>BSE-free beef scheme <A NAME="launched">launched</A></CENTER></H3>

By Deborah Hargreaves<P>

The Financial Times    ...   Monday August 19 1996<P>

The government launches its specialist beef assurance scheme today to
enable producers to sell older beef from herds which are certified to be
free from bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

But farmers believe it will have limited appeal to producers because of
the restrictions it imposes and the extra burden of form-filling.<P>

"It is a whole new set of regulations to comply with, and then it only
gives you permission to market your older cattle, it doesn't guarantee
you a buyer," said Mr Ian Gardner, policy director at the National
Farmers' Union.<P>

The scheme will apply to herds where farmers can prove they have never
had a case of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><STRONG>BSE</STRONG></STRONG
></FONT> and also that their animals have not been fed on meat and
bonemeal for seven years. This will largely cover hill farmers where
cattle are kept on grassland and where farmers breed their own
replacement animals rather than buying in - so-called closed herds - and
organic cattle.<P>

Farmers who sign up for the scheme will be able to sell cattle up to the
age of 42 months in the UK market. Cattle over the age of 30 months
currently have to be destroyed because they are more at risk of
contracting BSE.<P>

For example, farms involved in the scheme are not allowed to keep
bought-in feed on the same farm as the assured herd and their herds are
not allowed to be involved in dairying. Herds must also have been
established for at least four years.

"We think it will only be beneficial for a very small proportion of
herds in Scotland - maybe around 1,000 - it imposes very tight
controls," said Mr Alastair McIver, chairman of the Scottish Crofters'
Union.<P>

Neurology 44: 291-3 (1994)[94142910] 

P. Brown, et al.. 

We tested DNA from 15 centrally infected cases of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) (dura mater or corneal homografts and
stereotactic EEG electrodes), 11 peripherally infected cases (native human growth hormone or gonadotrophin), and 110 control individuals
for the presence of mutations in the chromosome 20 amyloid gene.<P>

 No patient or control had any of the known pathogenic point or insert
mutations found in familial disease, but allelic homozygosity at polymorphic codon 129 was present in all but two (92%) of the 26
patients, compared with 54 (50%) of the 110 controls.<P>

  Pooled data from all identified and tested cases of iatrogenic disease
yielded a worldwide total of 56 patients, of whom all but four were homozygous at codon 129. These findings support the thesis that homozygosity at codon 129 enhances susceptibility to iatrogenic infections of both central and peripheral origin, with evident implications for the population of dura mater homograft and pituitary hormone recipients whose lives have been complicated by the
possibility of exposure to the infectious agent of CJD.

<h3>Notice to Physicians</h1>

<h4>Please Help Locate Patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

 who may have been blood donors</h4>

<hr>

The transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by dura mater, growth hormone, gonadotrophin and cornea has been documented, but the possibility of its transmission by blood transfusion remains controversial. However, a number of manufacturers and blood programs, including the Canadian Red Cross, have taken precautionary measures to prevent the theoretical risk of blood-borne transmission.

<p>The Canadian Red Cross seeks physicians' cooperation to identify, with their consent, patients who have been diagnosed with CJD and who have donated blood. We will then be able to find and remove blood components and products that were derived from blood donated by these patients.

<p>We would also like to know if any such patients received blood transfusions. This information will help us further study the relationship of CJD with transfusion. Your cooperation will be most appreciated.

<p>The blood supply in Canada is safe, and with your help we will be able to make it even safer.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Lawsuit">Lawsuit</A> alleges cadaver hormone gave children CJD</CENTER></H3>

<P>    LONDON (Apr 14, 1996 9:35 p.m. EDT) - Every time Paul Andrews forgets something, he wonders whether his brain is slowly turning into a sponge.

    It is a real fear. Andrews believes he is at risk of developing the brain-rotting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) after treatment to help him reach a normal height as a teenager.

    "You have the fear every day," said Andrews, a 30-year-old student teacher. "The initial symptoms that you get are exactly like everybody gets when they are tired -- you get dizzy, you forget things. I'm always forgetting things, all the bloody time."
<P>


    He is one of 1,900 Britons given Human Growth Hormone (HGH) to boost their stunted height as children. The hormone was taken from the pituitary glands of corpses.

    Sixteen British children given the treatment between 1958 and 1985 have died of CJD and one is suffering from it.<P>

    A lawsuit opening in London's High Court on Tuesday alleges they contracted CJD as a result of the treatment.

    Eight families are suing the Health Department and the government-funded Medical Research Council (MRC) in a case sure to attract attention in the midst of a scare over mad cow disease.<P>

    CJD was an extremely rare and obscure disease and probably still would be -- it affects one in a million people -- if it hadn't been for mad cow disease.

    Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is the version of CJD seen in cattle. Just as in humans, they lose coordination and start to behave oddly before dying. Autopsies show their brains have literally turned spongelike, riddled with holes.

    Research indicates both are caused by a mutation of a brain protein known as a prion. The latest findings indicate prions are vital to the health of brain cells, which die when the prions change.<P>

    BSE reached epidemic proportions in British herds in the 1980s and is still a major problem. Officials believe the cows got BSE from being fed the ground-up remains of sheep, which commonly get scrapie, a related disease.

    Doctors said last month there was a chance people could get CJD from eating infected beef -- launching a worldwide scare and a global ban on British beef.<P>

    Andrews says the scare, while not related to the lawsuit, has given it more prominence.

    "Nobody knew what CJD was when we started campaigning. And it's such a horrible death. You've just got to say Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease and people are pricking their ears up."

    From the ages of 11 to 17, he was given three hormone injections a week. For him it did work -- he grew a foot (a third of a metre) to five feet five inches (165 cm).<P>

    But in 1985 two people in the United States and one in Britain died of CJD. All three were on HGH regimes.

    It is accepted that the hormone injections caused the CJD. Children are now given a synthetic form.

    "It isn't disputed that the disease arose in any other fashion," said lawyer David Body of Irwin Mitchell, a Sheffield firm that is representing the eight lead plaintiffs in the case.<P>

    "This is a grim business. I don't think anyone can think of a worse way to die than CJD."

    The lawsuit, which will be binding for the 17 families whose children got CJD, seeks to discover what the government and the MRC knew and when -- and whether anything could have been done to protect the children.

    If Body's group wins, the others, including Andrews, may also have cause to sue.

    "The case rests upon whether the processing of the product was appropriate and whether it took into account the dangerous transmission of a slow virus or prion diseases," said Body.<P>

    The Health Department has said it will fight the case, but a spokeswoman declined to go into details.

    "We are neither claiming responsibility or denying it," said an MRC spokesman. "The whole thing is a sorry affair and we have the greatest sympathy for the families. But...it's for the courts to decide."<P>

    Parents of the dead children say they were never told the HGH was being taken from corpses. They say more precautions should have been taken over a transplant of human material.

    "The risk involved was pointed out to the Medical Research Council by agricultural scientists who had an interest in scrapie and who told them there was a risk," Body said.

    Although the parents are seeking compensation, Body, a specialist in medical claims, says they really just want to know what happened and why.

    "There's an anger to it. There's considerable anger that no form of inquiry was forthcoming," he said.

    "In Australia, the reaction of the government, faced with similar problems, was to set up an inquiry, which reported within 11 months...We have asked for an inquiry but none has been forthcoming."<HR>

<H3><CENTER>CJD from Human <A NAME="Growth">Growth</A> Hormones</CENTER></H3>


LONDON (Apr 16, 1996 4:00 p.m. EDT) -- Human growth hormone prepared at a single British laboratory was probably responsible for infecting 17 children with the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, lawyers told a London court on Tuesday.


    The government and the Medical Research Council (MRC) should have known the children, being treated for their unusually short height, were at risk, lawyers acting for relatives said.<P>

    Eight British families are suing the Department of Health and the MRC for what they say is a lack of care in treating their children, who died aged between 20 and 34. The results of the case will be binding on another nine families.

    "This dreadful tragedy could and should have been avoided," lawyer Robert Owen said in opening arguments at the High Court trial, expected to last six weeks.<BR>


    CJD is the human equivalent of mad cow disease, which has swept through British cattle herds. Since the government admitted people might be able to catch it from eating infected beef last month, British beef has been banned worldwide.<P>


    Children who had hormone deficiencies that made them unusually short were treated with injections of human growth hormone between 1959 and 1985. The programme was stopped after three patients, two of them in the United States, died of CJD -- usually a very rare disease of the elderly.<P>

    At issue is whether scientists took enough care in making sure no infectious agent adulterated the injections.

    Owen said there had been "compelling evidence" that CJD could be transferred by injection between people.

    "We say it was necessary and would have been common sense to set criteria...so as to exclude or minimise the risk of infection."

    There was plenty of information about diseases like CJD, Owen added. "It could and should have been discerned by those who should have looked for it," he told the court.

    "They definitely knew or should have known CJD was transmissible to humans by at least 1968."<P>

    Human growth hormone, taken from the pituitary glands of corpses until 1985, was processed using four methods in Britain, Owen said. But it seemed the infected hormone came from the laboratory run by Anne Stockell-Hartree, who had led the project for 20 years from Cambridge University.<P>

    "The sad fact of it is that Dr Hartree did not set for herself the objective of purity of product," Owen said.

    Owen said he would present evidence from British scientists saying any responsible laboratory would have made sure the hormone was pure. He would also present evidence from scientists in Sweden and Norway, where a similar programme has resulted in no CJD infections.<P>

    The case could also affect nearly 1,900 other children treated with the HGH who have shown no sign of CJD. Owen said they had to live under the "dark shadow of this dread disease."

    The effect on the parents was also an important issue, he said.  "It is difficult to convey the anguish of the parents who watched their children die of this disease...It is literally a dismantling of the brain before their very eyes."<P>

    The MRC and the Department of Health deny negligence or that they had any legal duty of care towards those injected.<P>

<CENTER><H3>CJD from <A NAME="Cadaveric">Cadaveric</A> Dura Mater Graft --- Spain, 1985--1992</H3></CENTER>
In 1987, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated a case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in a 28-year-old woman in the United States; the patient had onset of CJD 19 months after an operation in which she received an imported, commercially prepared, cadaveric dura mater graft (LYODURA  , processed by B. Braun Melsungen AG of the Federal Republic of Germany). The report of this investigation alerted medical personnel and the public about a possible increased risk for CJD in recipients of these human tissue grafts. Recently, CDC was notified of four patients with CJD who had undergone dura mater repair with the aid of LYODURA  .  All four patients had neurosurgery at a regional hospital in Spain during April 1983--January 1984.  This report describes these four cases.

</CENTER>
<HR><I>listserve exchange  of early May 1996: </I>
<HR>

* Supposedly 2-3 pathologists in the US have died recently of CJD and
this has soured colleagues on brain autopsies on dementias, which has the
potential of throwing off the new CDC incidence study which relies heavily
on death certificate and autopsy  data.  How many pathologists are out
there doing this kind of work, ie, what are the rough odds of this
assuming [I don't] 1 per 1,000,000 incidence.<HR>


** If this information is correct, the rate would be inordinately high. 
There are roughly 10,000 pathologists in the US.  Most of us do brain
examinations at one time or another, and those who trained prior to CAT
scans did a lot more than my generation did.  As of the last time I read
about the age distribution in our field, there was some weighting toward
the older end of the age spectrum.<P>

The neuropathologist who taught us was not overly concerned about the
risk of doing CJD cases.  His rationale was that there would be an
association of CJD with pathologists, particularly neuropathologists,
and he wasn't aware of any such association nor of any CJD deaths among
neuropathologists.    I did one known case of a spongiform
encephalopathy as a resident 15 years ago (a GSSD case).
<HR>
* I saw it up on the Web: the context was some gov't epidemiologist pooh-pooing the statistic and saying 2-3 pathaolgists with CJD was the same rate seen in the general population.  But it is sounding to me like closer to 25x the rate if there are only 10,000 of them with a 10 year cumulative.<P>
Without knowing even the basics about the pathology profession and not wishing to ask a question in poor taste,  I am still wondering if special consideration is given to occupational hazard in the profession and whether there might be better information available as to overall health at time of death than on the general population.  That is, would fluorescent antibody test for neurological prion plaque be commonly done? This would detect incipient CJD even if not the cause of death.  And this might give some measure as to exposure to this particular risk.
<P><HR>
**  If any  other pathologists reading out there have more information
about  recent CJD cases in pathologists,
I'd like to know about it.  I can't say that I've seen anything about
that in either "CAP Today" or the "AMA News", and that's the sort of
association I'd expect to see in a headline rather than in a reprint of
a  journal abstract.<P>
It would be an inordinately high rate on the surface, but I'd really
need to have all the basic information about the cases and exact number
of pathologists, over what period of time the data was gathered,
extenuating circumstances, etc. before knowing the significance of the
statistic.<P>

I usually do a little extra on specimens from other physicians and board
member.  Immunoperixidase staining is very expensive so only large hospitals
perform it on site.  Many of the antigens are rarely used, such as the
one for PrP, and so would only be available at an institution doing high
volumes of that type of work.  I am not aware of pathologists, or
physicians in general having a higher autopsy rate than the general
public, in fact, I'd suspect the opposite.  I routinely do silver
staining on brains of the elderly with dementia looking for plaques of
Alzheimers disease, but don't do this on the brains of young people. 
Immunostaining for PrP is not available on site at our hospital.

<BLOCKQUOTE>I have been trying to waken the interest in the dental community and
certainly in our small group re the dangers of CJD.  This has met with

I have an interest from the point of view that I see dentistry s a potntial
disaster area for the spread of the disease.I have also a personal interest because a close friend of mine is a recipient of Hph.  To date none of the women in Australia have been told
which batches of the hormone have been issued to whom.  It is only throiugh
the work of this friend and another lady in melbourne that the govt. even
started to acknowledge that a problem existed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Listserve Response:</STRONG>Your concerns are valid. Older people, at higher risk of disease, may be disproportionately dental patients.  There has been a substantial amount of CJD transfer from surgical tools in the US.  Usually going from on patient to the next with brain recording tools.  The efficacy of autoclaving is controversial.<P>

We have a divided medical community here as well.  Some are worried over liability for corneal transplants and pgh, others are worried about unfounded public panic and a deluge of worried well, others about the public health.  It looks to me, from statistics, that the  the blood supply in Canada is infectious. I personally have grave concerns over the wisdom of continuing unnecessary exposure of still more millions of people and feel it is better to err on the side of caution.<HR>

<A NAME="Professional">Professional</A> drivers form a disproportionate percentage of new CJD cases.
This includes truck
drivers of all kinds, van drivers, bus drivers, train drivers, postal
drivers, taxi drivers, racing drivers and anyone else who drives for a
living.  Cattle truck drivers are
only the tiniest proportion.<P>

Truck drivers in general are believed to have
notoriously poor diets.  But in combination with all
the other circumstantial evidence it is interesting that an
occupation with the which is notorious (rightly or wrongly) for
eating a lot of burgers and sausages appears to have become
susceptible to CJD.

<CENTER><A NAME="CJD">CJD</A> in pituitary growth hormone recipients in the
  US.</CENTER></H4</CENTER>>


 Fradkin JE. et al., JAMA 265(7):880-4, 1991
<P>

  To assess the magnitude of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurrence
  among recipients of pituitary-derived human growth hormone (HGH), we
  conducted an epidemiologic follow-up of 6284 recipients of HGH distributed
  through the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. <P>
Seven
  neuropathologically confirmed cases of CJD have occurred in this
  population to date: six patients with clinical CJD presented with ataxia
  and imbalance, rather than with altered mentation, which is the most
  common initial manifestation in sporadic CJD, and one patient died in the
  preclinical incubation state of the disease. All seven cases occurred
  among the nearly 700 HGH recipients who started therapy before 1970.<P>
 
  Since only 10% of the cohort has been followed up for the 15-year average
  incubation interval from midpoint of HGH treatment to onset of symptoms,
  the great majority of potentially exposed patients have not yet attained
  the requisite incubation period for expression of CJD.<P>
 The median duration
  of HGH therapy of 100 months in the CJD cases was significantly longer
  than 41 months for all patients starting treatment before 1970; thus, the
  duration of pituitary HGH therapy is a major risk factor for CJD.<HR>

<H3>Dust exposure of <A NAME="abattoir">abattoir</A> workers</H3>

 Listserve item 6.1.96<P>

Consider the figures. Suppose there are  10,000 abattoir workers (roughly 1/1000th of the
working population). At a total incidence of V-VJD of 1 per 10
million, the chance of having one case in a normal sample of this
size would be about 1 in 1000. Even if the dust exposure
increased the risk by 1000 times, you might well still not see a
single case.<P>
 
Then again, there is the genetic susceptibility argument. If only
1 in 10,000 of the human population was susceptible to V-CJD,
which would not be incompatible with the observed incidence so
far, there would be a fair chance that there would not be a
single susceptible individual in a sample of 10,000 and the level
of exposure would be immaterial.

<H3><CENTER>U.S. Pulls British Beef out of <A NAME="Commissaries">Commissaries</A></CENTER></H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, <FONT SIZE=-1>The Reuters World Service via Individual Inc. :</FONT> The U.S. military

ordered all British beef to be pulled off its shelves in military commissaries

in Europe on Tuesday due to the current ``mad cow disease'' crisis.
It will eventually replace the meat with U.S. beef.<P>

Officials in Washington and Europe said nine large commissaries in the

Mediterranean region that normally sell 200,000 pounds of British beef per month

were affected by the order, plus one small operation in Scotland whose

domestically-grown meat was also pulled as a result of the ban on British beef.</P>

For the near term, a German meat company -- Corets in Neuenkirchen in northern

Germany -- will provide fresh beef to the commissaries until arrangements are

worked out for increased purchases of U.S. beef, a military official said.
``Starting the second of April, we have a contract with Corets that will deliver

to the Mediterranean, and we've placed our first order for about 44,000 pounds

of fresh beef with them,'' said Gerri Young, public affairs officer for the

Defence Commissary Agency of the European Region.<P>

Young stressed, however, that plans are in works to replace all the beef with

American beef.
Young said that IBP Inc. in Nebraska is likely to get the bulk, if not all, of

the business.

<P>
There are 65 U.S. military commissaries in Europe serving hundreds of thousands

of soldiers and their dependents. The stores sell 800,000 to 900,000 pounds of

beef a month -- 200,000 of that British beef and the rest U.S. beef.</P>
<P>
Non-commissary, troop feeding of U.S. soldiers in Europe is handled by a

different branch of the Defence Department, and agency officials said only U.S.

beef is fed to American troops.</P>
<P>
The military purchases about 4.2 million pounds of beef per year to feed to U.S.

soldiers in Europe.</P>
<P>
Europe has been rocked since last week by reports from Britain of possible

linkage between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- commonly known as

``mad cow'' disease -- and a new variant of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, a fatal

human neural disease.</P>
<P>
The European Union has placed a ban on exports of beef from Britain, where the

disease has appeared, and the United States said it is increasing its

inspections of beef, even though the diseases has never shown up in America.</P>

<CENTER><H3>BSE in the US: 8,929 cow brains examined</H3></CENTER>

The following was extracted from a recent document written by
Dr. Gary Pearl (no email account), President-Director Technical Services, Fats and
Proteins Research Foundation, 309-829-7744, fax 309-829-5147.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"October 1996

In an independent survey of the State Veterinarians and State 
Diagnostic Laboratories (G.G. Pearl, FPRF, June 1996), 
twenty-three states responded.  The responding states had 
submitted a total of 888 specimens to NVSL for BSE 
confirmation.  However, during that same time period (1990 
through June 1996), these certified accredited diagnostic 
laboratories received 8,929 animals exhibiting signs of CNS 
disorders.  Definitive diagnoses were established for other 
existing CNS diseases or conditions for all of the animals with 
the exception of the 888.  There were no laboratory submissions 
suggestive of BSE reported.  The 888 animals were subsequently 
determined to be free of BSE.  It, therefore, can be determined 
that the diagnostic laboratory structure in the United States 
allows for enhanced surveillance of approximately tenfold being 
reported as actual brain submissions to NVSL.  USDA has 
likewise republished BSE Implications for the US in April 1996 
which describes the many components existing in the 
surveillance program for BSE in the US."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

Listserve posted questions for Dr. Pearl:
<PRE>Q1.  What was the breakdown to specific CNS disorders  for the 8929
animals, ie rabies etc., and what they did they end up with for definite
diagnoses for the 888, if not BSE?

Q2.  What was the exact source of the prion antibody used to perform the
BSE screen (or was it just slides)?

Q3. Were neuromuscular disorders and miscellaneous "downers" considered in
with CNS disorders?

Q4. How big a pool of healthy animals did  the 8929 come out of?  That is,
is there an incidence rate here for CNS disorders?

Q5. Is the full document available online -- sounds like there could be a
broad need to refer to it.</PRE>

I would recommend caution in interpretion of Dr. Pearl's report.  BSE is a particular _strain_ of
bovine TSE only known from England.  If only that particular strain was
sought to the exclusion of other bovine TSEs, then the study addresses
mainly whether the US herd has picked up the British strain, not the levels
of endigenous US strains (if any) of bovine TSE.  There would have been
roughly only 50-80 imported cows and later calves seriously incubating
British BSE in the US, assuming no amplification, based on import dates and
infection levels, as adjusted for under-reporting.
<P>

More specifically, the big new Collinge study, 24 Oct 1996  Nature 382,
685-690 (1996), extends and confirms work of Bessen and Marsh on two US
strains of TME.   If one assumes [repeat, if one assumes] the mink got
these from downer dairy cows, then there were at least two very different
strains of bovine TSEs possibly prevalent in the US in the late 1980's.
TSEs exhibit a tremendous variability in presentation (often not spongiform
nor plaque-forming, sometimes affecting blood vessels or lymphoreticular
tissue or neuromuscular junctions), so a pathologist trained on imported
BSE brain slides might only be ruling out that particular strain in similar
breeds.<P>

Note there has been no strain testing yet of US victims of "sporadic" CJD
but this can be expected imminently.  Strain typing has the potential for
definitively identifying the original source of the infection, even if it
occurred decades ago.  In one scenario, some (presumbably non-mink eating)
victims would type out the same as a TME.<P>

There is an opportunity for confusing the public, not to mention media,
with language issues: does "mad cow disease" mean bovine TSEs collectively
or mean exclusively the British strain BSE?  I favor bovine TSE;  if BSE is
used then the British strain should be further delineated, so ukBSE or some
such.  Similarly dyTME and hyTME for mink, nvCJD for new variant etc.

Holman RC, Khan AS, Belay ED, Schonberger LB.  1996 Oct 17. 
<P>
After a cluster of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases among unusually young patients was reported recently from the United Kingdom, we examined trends and the current incidence of CJD in the United States. We found that the age-adjusted CJD death rate in the United States is similar to published estimates of the crude incidence of CJD worldwide and has continued to be stable from 1979 through 1994. The number of CJD deaths in persons &lt;45 years of age remained stable during this period. We found no evidence of the variant form of CJD.</td></tr></table></center>

<P> Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are rare forms of progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals <a href="#ref1">(1)</a>. They are distinguished by long incubation periods, characteristic spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss, and a failure to induce inflammatory response <a href="#ref2">(2)</a>. The prototype TSE in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), occurs sporadically (approximately 90% of cases), through iatrogenic transmission of the infective agent (&lt;1% of cases), or as an autosomal dominant inheritance (approximately 10% of cases) <a href="#ref3">(3,4)</a>. CJD is a rapidly fatal dementing illness that occurs worldwide, with an estimated incidence of approximately one case per million persons. Unconventional agents termed prion proteins (PrPs), which are encoded by genes on chromosome 20, are considered the etiologic agent of CJD. The pathologic properties of these proteins lie in their three-dimensional configuration and their ability to recruit and influence normal PrPs to undergo similar conformational changes. The transmissibility of CJD has been verified with reports of iatrogenic transmission from a corneal transplant, electroencephalographic depth electrodes, neurosurgical procedures, cadaveric dura mater grafts, and pituitary hormone administration <a href="#ref5">(5-11)</a>.

<P> A cluster of CJD cases with a unique neuropathologic picture among unusually young patients in the United Kingdom <a href="#ref12">(12)</a>, which was reported during a widespread epizootic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has alerted many countries, including the United States, to update their surveillance for CJD and look for similar cases <a href="#ref13">(13)</a>. This increased attention, and the fact that CJD is rapidly and invariably fatal <a href="#ref14">(14)</a>, prompted us to analyze the most current CJD deaths and update our analysis of national trends of CJD mortality in the United States. Because of concerns about the theoretical risk for transmission of CJD by blood transfusion, we also examined the mortality records for evidence of diseases associated with increased exposure to blood or blood products.

<P> Multiple cause-of-death data for the United States from 1979 through 1994 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="#ref15">(15)</a>, with 1994 data reported as provisional. Cause-of-death classifications were based on the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) <a href="#ref16">(16-18)</a>. CJD deaths were defined as those for which ICD-9 code 046.1 appeared as an entity-axis code. The alternative CJD ICD-9 code 331.5 is not valid in the United States <a href="#ref17">(17,19,20)</a>. The case of a 3-year-old child with spongiform degeneration of infancy (ICD-9 code 046.1) was included in the study. We excluded the case of a 5-year-old child with Kawasaki disease (ICD-9 code 446.1) because CJD was not listed on the death certificate and the case of a 17-year-old patient who had had diffuse T-cell proliferative disease. 

<P> Annual CJD death rates were calculated as the number of CJD deaths per million persons, on the basis of U.S. resident population estimates, and standardized by the direct method, using the 1990 census population <a href="#ref21">(21)</a>. Age-adjusted annual death rates were calculated by sex and race and for the United States overall; age-, sex-, and race-adjusted annual death rates were calculated by standard region <a href="#ref21">(22)</a>. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by Poisson regression analysis <a href="#ref23">(23)</a>. Deaths were examined according to whether autopsy was indicated on the death certificate, as available from 1979 through 1993. We also examined other causes of death listed and  searched the records for several diseases associated with increased exposure to blood or blood products, specifically hemophilia A (ICD-9 code 286.0), hemophilia B (ICD-9 code 286.1), thalassemia (ICD-9 code 282.4), and sickle cell disease (ICD-9 code 282.6).

<P> 

<P><A ID="I1" NAME="I1"></A> From 1979 through 1994, CJD was recorded as a cause of 3,642 deaths in the United States; 83.4% of these deaths had CJD recorded as the underlying cause. The average annual age-adjusted death rate during the study period was 0.95 deaths per million persons, from 0.78 in 1980 to 1.11 in 1987 <a href="#fig1">(Figure 1)</a>. The mean age of death was 67 years (median age = 68 years). Approximately 98% of the deaths were among persons  45 years of age. The age-specific death rates were highest for persons in their 70s <a href="#fig2">(Figure 2)</a>.

<P> Although 52.9% of the deaths were in female patients, the age-adjusted death rate of male patients was slightly higher than that of female patients (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09-1.24; <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). In contrast to the death rate in age groups &lt;60 years, the CJD death rate in age groups &gt;= 60 years was higher in men than in women <a href="#tab2">(Table 2)</a>. Most (95.2%) deaths were among whites. The age-adjusted death rate of whites was higher than that of blacks (RR = 2.66, 95% CI = 2.22-3.18) <a href="#tab1">(Table 1)</a>. Other races accounted for only 1.4% of the CJD deaths, with an age-adjusted rate intermediate to that of blacks and whites. The death rate of blacks was lower than that of whites in each age group. Geographically, the age-sex-race-adjusted rate of the South was lower than that of each of the other regions. The previously noted differences by sex and race remained consistent for each region.

<P> Approximately 80% of the CJD deaths were among persons &gt;= 60 years of age. The average annual death rate during the study period of this age group was 4.58 per million persons (3.71 per million in 1983 to 5.52 per million persons in 1987) <a href="#fig1">(Figure 1)</a>. Among persons 45 through 59 years of age, the average annual death rate was 1.15 per million persons (0.87 to 1.45 per million). Among persons &lt;45 years of age, the annual death rate was consistently at or below 0.05 per million persons; the number of deaths among such young persons was zero in 1984 and eight in 1981 and 1993. Only five persons who died of CJD during the study period were younger than 30 years of age, and in any single year, there was no more than one such death. In the most recent 5-year period, 1990-1994, the only person with CJD in this young age group had received pituitary-derived human growth hormone. 

<P> None of the persons who died of CJD had hemophilia A, hemophilia B, thalassemia, or sickle cell disease mentioned on the death record. During 1979 through 1993, autopsies were performed on 907 persons who died of CJD-related causes (29.7% of those whose autopsy status was known). The proportion of autopsies ranged from 20.7% in 1993 to 37.8% in 1983. Autopsies of persons &lt;45 years of age were indicated in 51.5% of the known deaths, while 30.2% and 29.0% were indicated in the 45- to 59-year-old and &gt;= 60-year-old age groups, respectively.

<P> During 1979 through 1994, the average annual age-adjusted death rate was 0.95 per million persons, which is consistent with published estimates of the crude incidence worldwide of one case per million persons <a href="#ref3">(3</a>,<a href="#ref11">11)</a>. The addition of the 4 recent years of data to our previous report did not alter our initial findings <a href="#ref24">(24)</a>. The previously reported racial differences in the U.S. CJD death rates were found again and should be further studied. In addition, no CJD-related deaths were found among persons with hemophilia A, hemophilia B, thalassemia, or sickle cell disease. 

<P> In 1994 and 1995, a cluster of 10 unusually young (median age at onset 28 years, range 16 to 39 years) CJD patients in the United Kingdom were reported with atypical clinical features <a href="#ref12">(12)</a>. These features included behavioral change and dysesthesia when patients sought

treatment, followed within weeks or months by a cerebellar syndrome,

dementia, and myoclonus in the late stages, a duration of illness of

atleast 6 months, and electroencephalogram changes that were not diagnostic of CJD. These patients had a characteristic neuropathologic profile that consisted of severe spongiform change, neuronal loss, and astrocytosis in the basal ganglia and thalamus, with abundant kuru-type amyloid plaques surrounded by vacuoles in the cerebrum and cerebellum and PrP accumulation in high density shown by immunocytochemistry. These findings, coupled with the unusually young age of the patients, led to the conclusion that the clinicopathologic features constituted a new variant of CJD. A causal association with the BSE epizootic in British cattle was also hypothesized and recently supported by experimental evidence involving intracerebral inoculation of cynomolgus macaques with brain tissue obtained from cattle with BSE <a href="#ref25">(25)</a>. 

<P> To help assess the purported uniqueness and distribution of the newly described CJD variant, CDC intensified CJD surveillance activities to seek evidence for the presence of this variant in the United States <a href="#ref13">(13)</a>. In analyzing the U.S. multiple cause-of-death data, we did not find any increase in the number of CJD deaths among persons &lt;45 years of age; also, there were no recent CJD deaths in persons &lt;30 years of age, except for the death of the recipient of pituitary-derived human growth hormone (in contrast, five of the eight patients originally reported in the United Kingdom died before the age of 30). To supplement these findings in the United States, CDC also conducted active surveillance in its four Emerging Infections Program sites and in the Metropolitan Atlanta Active Surveillance Program in Georgia (total 1993 population 16.3 million) <a href="#ref13">(13</a>,<a href="#ref26">26)</a>; 92% to 100% of neuropathologists and neurologists were contacted, and information was obtained on their patients who died of CJD from 1991 through 1995. Medical records and neuropathologic reports of decedents &lt;55 years of age were also sought for review. Consistent with national mortality data, nine (10%) of the case patients were &lt;55 years of age, only one case patient was &lt;45 years of age, and no case patient was &lt;30 years of age. Review of clinical and neuropathologic records of the nine patients &lt;55 years of age did not show any with the variant form of CJD. 

<P> The validity of multiple cause-of-death data is potentially a problem because of possible coding and reporting discrepancies, including misdiagnoses <a href="#ref24">(24)</a>. However, past reports have indicated that approximately 80% of histologically confirmed CJD patients were identified through death certificate searches, using national death registries <a href="#ref27">(27)</a>. Furthermore, the consistency of data from the active surveillance sites with the national multiple cause-of-death data supports the conclusion that annual review of multiple cause-of-death data provides an efficient and cost-effective method to monitor CJD incidence <a href="#ref24">(24,27)</a>. Active follow-up of reported CJD deaths in persons &lt;55 years of age has been initiated in the United States to improve the national surveillance of potential cases of the newly described CJD variant. Access to more current national mortality data makes this data source even more beneficial in monitoring CJD deaths in the United States. Although currently available CJD surveillance data do not provide evidence for the variant CJD in the United States, ongoing CJD surveillance in this country and elsewhere, especially in the United Kingdom, will be critical for ultimately determining the geographic distribution of this illness and its possible relationship to BSE.

<P>
There is no practical and reliable pre mortem test for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Two proteins, designated 130 and 131, which have been detected in low concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, appear to be sensitive and specific markers for the disease. Attempts to identify these proteins, howev er, have been unsuccessful. We hypothesized that they may be present in the normal brain.<P>

We detected proteins 130 and 131 in nor mal human brain, partially sequenced their amino acids, and found that they matched the brain protein known as 14-3-3. We then developed a simple, rapid immunoassay for this protein and tested it in cere brospinal fluid samples from 71 humans and 30 an imals with spongiform encephalopathies and in con trol samples from 186 humans and 94 animals.
<P>
The immunoassay detected the 14-3-3 pro tein in cerebrospinal fluid from 68 of the 71 patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (96 percent; 95 per cent confidence interval, 92 to 99 percent). Among 94 patients with other dementias, the specificity was 96 percent. If one excludes the three patients with de mentia who had had strokes within one month be fore testing, the specificity was 99 percent. The test was positive in 12 of 24 patients with viral encepha litis. In animals the sensitivity of the assay was 87 percent and the specificity was 99 percent.
<P>
In patients with dementia, a positive immunoassay for the 14-3-3 brain protein in cerebro spinal fluid strongly supports a diagnosis of Creutz feldt-Jakob disease. This finding, however, does not support the use of the test in patients without clinical ly evident dementia. 
<P>
THE transmissible spongiform encephalop athies constitute a group of uniformly fatal neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and ku ru, among others, in humans,'2 scrapie in sheep and goats, and spongiform encephalopathy in cattle.3 Spongiforn1 encephalopathies are characteriz.ed by spongitorm degeneration of the brain, reactive glio- | sis in the cortical and subcortical gray matter, and the presence of the abnormal isoform of the cellular prion protein.4 These degenerative encephalopatllies are transmissible when the infectious agent is cxpcr imentally inoculated into laboratory animals.
<P>
Therc is an urgent need for a premortem diagnos tic test that can identity humans and animals with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Such a test could be useful in patients with iatrogenically transmitted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease3 s (especially because of ditficulty decontaminating the infectious agent6), as well as in patients with the new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease possibly linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy.7 To date, a definitive di agnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy requires histopathological examination of a brain biopsy specimen. Brain biopsy, however, places pa tients and health care personnel at risk and may miss the site of disease.
<P>
</P>
Most cerebrospinal fluid proteins studied in pa tients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have not proved useful diagnostically.3 &quot; However, two 30-kd proteins detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis and des ignated proteins 130 and 131 correlate well with a di agnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, with high sensi tivity and specificity.'2 Identification of these proteins has clarified the premortem diagnosis in several diffi cult cases,'3 i6 but the assay technique is not practical for routine clinical use. The development of a simpler assay requires the identification and characterization of proteins 130 and 131, but initial attempts have been hampered by their low concentration in cere brospinal fluid. We hypothesized that proteins 130 and 131 might be abundant in normal brain tissue, which would facilitate their identification and the de velopment of an immunoassay that could be of use in establishing the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis ease without the need for a brain biopsy.<P>

Cerebrospinal fluid specimens from humans or animals with possible diagnoses of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or fromwelllstudied controls with established diagnoses were submitted to the National Institutes of Health or to the Calitornia Institute of Technology. The diagnoses were made by the referring physicians or veterinarians accordblg to standard clinical criteria, aswellas pathological signs, as appropriate and available.<P>

The specimens trom patients with possible Creutzbeldt-Jakob dis ease were assigned to one of three diagnostic categories on the basis of the available clinical or pathological information: patho logically confirmed, clinically definite (rapidly progressive demcn tia, myoclonus, and characteristic electroencephalographic find ings), or clinically probable (progressive dementia; the presence of cerebrospinal fluid proteins 130 and 131; and myoclonus, atax ia, or characteristic eiectroencephalographic findings).'7 All sam ules were stored at -700C without preservative.
<P>
Sample preparation, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and image analysis of proteins from brain tissue were performed as described elsewhere.~82i The spot corresponding to protein 130 was excised trom elcctroblotted membranes22 and subjected to amino acid se quencing according to standard methods.23 The partial amino acid sequences obtained were compared with those in the Swiss-Prot data bank with the use of the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.
<P>
All tests were conducted without knowledge of the diagnoses, and the method was adapted from that of Brown et al 24 Fifty microliters of cerebrospinal fluid was mixed with IO ~l of sample buffer (5 percent glycerol, I percent 2-mercaptoethanol, I per cent sodium d`~decyl sulfate, and a trace of bromophenol blue in the final solution) and boiled tor five minutes. Samples were sep arated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electropho resis (4 percent stacking gel with 12 percent resolving gel at 75 V for three hours) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunostain ing was performed by blocking with TRIS-buffered saline con taining 0.3 percent Tween 20 for 30 minutes, followed by incu bation with anti-14-3-3p polyclonal rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, No. sc-629) at a 1:500 dilution and then by in cubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antirabbit IgG antibody (BioSource International, No. ALI3405) at a l:lOOO di lution. Antigen was detected bv colorimetric reaction. Molecular weight markers and a positive control (cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with confirmed Creutzieldt-Jakob disease) were included on every gel.
<P>
Statistical sign)ficance25 was calculated with the chi square test and Fisher's exact test for two-by-two contingency tables. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical signifi cance. Confidence intervals were calculated with the exact meth od for a binomial parameter.25<P>

The results of two-dimensional electrophoresis for the detection of cerebrospinal fluid proteins 130 and 131 in patients with Creutzleldt-Jakob disease are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. Recent technical im provements have resulted in increased resolution, with six spots rather than the two (corresponding to proteins 130 and 131) originally described. In order to find an abundant source of these proteins, we ex amined normal brain tissue to determine whether any brain proteins are located near the constellation of spots corresponding to cerebrospinal fluid pro teins 130 and 131. Figurc 1C shoNvs a region of a silver-stained gel after two-dimensional clcctropho resis of normal brain proteins. Several of the proteins appear in the same area as the 130-131 constella tion, including two that have the same charge and mass as the 130-131 constellation in cerebrospinalfluid. The identification of the two spots on the ba sis of their position was confirmed by comigration studies. Spot 130 was purlfied by narrow-range two dimensional electrophoresis (pH range, 4.5 to 5.4), as shown in Figure 1D.
<P>
Spot 130 was excised from 10 blots, enzymatically digested, and microsequenced. Amino acid sequences were obtained from four peptide fragments. Three of these sequences, Val-Thr-Glu-Leu-Asn-Glu-Pro Leu-Xaa-Asn-Glu-Asp-Xaa-Asn-Leu-Leu-Ser Val-Ala, Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Xaa-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Glu-Val Ala-Thr-Gly-Glu-Lys, and Asn-Val-Val-Xaa-Ala Arg-Arg-Ser-Ser-Xaa-Arg-Val-Ile-Ser-Ser-Ile Glu-Gln, matched the sequence of the human 14-3 3 protein, isoform eta. The fourth sequence, Tyr-Ser Glu-Ala-Xaa-Glu-Ile-Ser, matched the bovine 14-3 3 protein, isoform gamma.
<P>
The 14-3-3 antibody reacted specifically with cere brospinal fluid proteins 130 and 131 on a two-dimen sional electrophoretic immunoblot but did not react with other cerebrospinal fluid proteins, thus verify ing that cerebrospinal fluid proteins 130 and 131 are 14-3-3 proteins.
<P>
The discovery that the cerebrospinal fluid 30-kd
spots (proteins 130 and 131) are 14-3-3 proteins led

to the development of a simple immunoassay to

aid in the diagnosis of transmissible spongiform en
cephalopathy. As Figure 2 shows, in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, there

was a 30-kd immunoreactive band (lanes 2 and 3),

whereas no such band was detected in cerebrospinal

fluid from healthy controls (data not shown) or from

a patient with Alzbeimer's disease (lane 1). 
<P>
As expected, 14-3-3 was abundant in an extract of normal human brain (lane 8). The 14-3-3 protein was not found

in normal serum (lane 6); however, it was also not detected in serum from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob

disease (lane 7). Prion protein purlfied from the brain

of a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (lane 9)

did not cross-react with 14-3-3 antibody, confirming

that 14-3-3 is not prion protein.<P>

Sixty-eight of 71 cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (96 percent) were positive for 14-3-3 (Tables 1 and 2). Four of 94 samples (4 percent) from patients with other dis eases involving dementia were positive for 14-3-3 (Tables 1 and 2) (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, when pa tients with dementia known to have had acute in farctions of the brain within one month before test ing were excluded from the analysis, only 1 of 91 samples (1 percent) was positive (P&lt;0.001). Sam ples from all 10 patients with multi-infarct dementia hut without strokes in the month before testing were negative for 14-3-3. The single false positive re sult among the cerebrospinal fluid samples from the other patients with dementia was from a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease that had not been verified by pathological studies.
<P>
Lane 1 shows cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with patholog ical evidence of Alzheimer's disease, lanes 2 and 3 show cere brospinal fluid from two patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis ease, lane 4 shows cerebrospinal fluid from a normal cow, lane 5 shows cerebrospinal fluid from a cow with experimentally induced transmissible mink encephalopathy and pathological evidence of spongiform disease, lane 6 shows normal human serum, lane 7 shows serum from a patient with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, lane 8 shows an extract of normal human brain, and lane 9 shows purified prion protein from the brain of a pa tient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<P>

14-3-3 was detected in 18 of the 66 cerebrospinal fluid samples (27 percent) from patients with other neurologic illnesses not involving dementia. The 18 positive samples were from patients with acute viral encephalitis, stroke (without dementia) within one month before testing, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or Rett's syndrome. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease could not reasonably be included in the ditierential diag nosis of any of these disorders.
<P>
Overall, the sensitivity of the 14-3-3 immunoassay as a marker for Creutzbeldt-Jakob disease was 96 per cent (68 true positive results divided by 71 true pos itive and false negative results, 95 percent confidence interval, 92 to 99 percent), and the specificity was 88 percent (164 true negative results divided by 186 true negative and false positive results; 95 percent confi dence interval, 84 to 92 percent). More important, the specificity of this assay among all the patients with dementia was 96 percent (90 true negative results di vided by 94 true negative and false positive results; 95 percent confidence interval, 90 to 96 percent), and when the three patients with dementia and brain in farction within one month before testing were ex cluded, the specificity of the immunoassay was 99 percent (90 true negative results divided by 91 true negative and false positive results; 95 perceTlt confi dence interval, 97 to 100 perceut) (Tables I and 2).<P>

immunoassay in 5~) cer~brospinal fluid samples (Ta blc 3). Thirteen of 11; specimens from patients with Creutzfcldt-Jakob di.sease were positive with both tests, and the other 2 samples were negative for pro teins 130 and 131 but positive for the 14-3-3 pro tein. The results of the two tests wcrc the same in samples from patients with dementias not associated with Crcutzbeldt-Jakob disease or other neurologic disorders. Although the spccificities of the two tests are similar, the 14-3-3 immunoassay has a slightly higher sensitivity.
<P>

Thc results of thc studies in animals were consis tent with those of thc studies in humans. Figurc 2 shows the assay results in cerebrospinal fluid from a normal cow (lane 4) and a cow with pathological ev idence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (lane 5). As Table 4 shows, 14-3-3 protein was dc tected in cerebrospinal fluid from six of nine cattle with experimentally induced transmissible mink en cephalopathy or scrapie. The one cow with clinical features but no pathological evidence of transmissi blc spongiform encephalopathy also had a positive test. No control cattle had positive assays. The test was positive in five of six sheep with naturally ac quircd scrapie and was negative in the one control sheep. All 15 experimentally infected chimpanzees had positive tests, whereas none of the 77 control chimpanzees did. The overall sensitivity of the 14-3-3 immunoassay in animals was 87 percent, and the overall specificity was 99 percent.
<P>
The discovery that proteins 130 and 131 belong to the 14-3-3 family of proteins has permitted the devel opment of a premortem immunoassay of cerebrospi nal fluid trom humans and animals with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. The overall specificity of the assay (88 percent) is low because we used a sub stantial number of cerebrospinal Huid samples from patients with various other conditions, including her pes simplex encephalitis, in which we expected 14-3-3 might be present in cerebrospinal fluid. When the as say was used more selectively, thc specificity was very high (99 percent). This finding emphasizes the need to usc the 14-3-3 marker as a test only in the appro priatc clinical setting. For a patient with dementia, the detection of 14-3-3 in cerebrospinal fluid strongly supports a diagnosis t~f Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, provided there has been no recognizable cerebral in farction within the preceding month. However, the onc false positive result, in a patient with a clinical di agnosis of Alzheimer's disease, suggests that some caution in interpretation is required until the assay has been evaluated in larger numbers of patients.
<P>
The predictive values of this test are governed not only by its sensitivity and specificity but also by the prevalence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the pop ulation tested. For example, in a population in which Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has a prevalence of 1 per cent) a positive test has a predictive value of only 49 percent, but in a population in which the prevalence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is 50 percent, a positive test has a predictive value of 99 percent and a nega tive test has a predictive value of 95 percent. There fore, this test will be most useful in patients with clinically suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Thus tar, the test cannot provide information on the clin ical stage, severity, or source of the disease.
<P>
Although only a limited number of animals have been tested, thc 14-3-3 immunoassay may prove to be a premortem diagnostic test for transmissiblespongiform encephalopathy in animals. At this stage, we have not studied animals with other neurologic disorders or cattle in the United Kingdom affected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. However, the results in cattle with experimentally induced transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or natural ly acquired scrapie in sheep suggest that this test will be of help in diagnosing bovine spongiform enceph alopathy. At this time, the test cannot provide infor mation on the clinical stage, severity, or source of the disease in animals.
<P>
We do not know why the detection of the 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid is a useful and specific biochemical marker for transmissible spongiform en cephalopathy. The role of 14-3-3 in the pathophysi ology of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has yet to be de termined. This highly conserved protein is found in a broad range of species, includillg yeast, plants, insects, and mammals, and has a wide variety of functions.27 36 ln humans and other mammals, 14-3-3 is a normal neuronal protein consisting of several isoforms, and it plays a part in the conformational stabilization of oth er proteins.29 33 36 Since misfolded prion proteins are the central feature of Creutzbeldt-Jakob disease, an intriguing additional interpretation for the presence of 14-3-3 in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with this disease is that the protein may be centrally in volved in the molecular pathologic features of trans missible spongiform encephalopathy.
<P>
We believe that the presence of 14-3-3 in cere brospinal fluid may be due to massive neuronal dis ruption and the leakage of brain proteins into cer ebrospinal fluid. Increased amounts of 14-3-3 in cerebrospinal fluid from some patients with inflam matory processes37 and the high number of positive assays for 14-3-3 in patients with herpes simplex en cephalitis (11 of 12) or recent infarctions (7 of 7) are consistent with this hypothesis. This possibility suggests that the quantity of 14-3-3 present in cer ebrospinal fluid should be proportional to the rate and amount of neuronal destruction. We do not have supporting data in humans; however, studies with four experimentally inoculated chimpanzees indicate that 14-3-3 becomes detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid at or just before the onset of clinical signs of disease. Further experiments are required to deter mine the quantity of 14-3-3 detected in cerebrospi nal fluid and the timing of its detection in relation to its clearance in transmissible spongiform enceph alopathy.
<P>
In summary, we describe an immunoassay that may be of help in the premortem diagnosis of transmissi ble spongiform encephalopathy in humans and ani mals. This test can provide objective evidence for the diagnosis of Creutzbeldt-Jakob disease, particularly in the context of a rapidly progressive dementia ac companied by myoclonus or ataxia. The results in an imals suggest that the 14-3-3 marker in cerebrospinal fluid reflects the pathological features of transmissible spongitorm encephalopathy. The 14-3-3 immunoas say of cerebrospinal fluid can now be widely used to establish the diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in patients and animals.

SIR,
<P>
The new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is remarkable because it affects younger individuals, presents with different symptoms, and has different pathological findings to sporadic CJD. There is a need to determine the epidemiology of this disease with a specific and sensitive premortem diagnostic test.
<P>

Among tests available for the premortem diagnosis of CJD is determination of the presence of two low-abundance proteins, 130/131, reported to discriminate CJD from other causes of dementia when detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).2In that previous report, al1 21 patients with CJD had CSF proteins (p) 130/131, which were not present in the CSF of any of the 87 patients with other causes of dementia. This test for p 130/131 has not come into use in clinical laboratories because of its technical complexity. However, in collaboration with researchers at the National Institutes of Health, we have developed a simplified test based on the characterisation of these proteins) that should lead to widespread use of these marker proteins in the routine diagnosis of CJD. Since our publication in 1986, we have studied over 500 samples from patients with dementia referred to us by clinicians. After p 130/131 testing, we were able to determine the necropsy diagnosis in 260 of these patients. Only two of the 260 patients had a misdiagnosis based on the p 130/131 test: one with primary central nervous system lymphoma was p 130/131 positive and one patient with CJD pathological findings had no p 130/131 detected at the time of examination. Of the remaining 258 patients, 48 were positive for p 130/131 and for CJD pathological findings and 210 were negative for p 130/131 and had no evidence of CJD. If we combine these previously unpublished results with those from the original publication,2 the p 130/131 test has a more than 98% sensitivity for CJD with a more than 99% specificity (table).

There is no practical and reliable premortem test for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Two proteins, designated 130 and 131, which have been detected in low concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, appear to be sensitive and specific markers for the disease. Attempts to identify these proteins, however, have been unsuccessful. We hypothesized that they may be present in the normal brain.
<P>
<B><I>Methods. </I></B>
We detected proteins 130 and 131 in normal human brain, partially sequenced their amino acids, and found that they matched the brain protein known as 14-3-3. We then developed a simple, rapid immunoassay for this protein and tested it in cerebrospinal fluid samples from 71 humans and 30 animals with spongiform encephalopathies and in control samples from 186 humans and 94 animals.
<P>
<B><I>Results. </I></B>
The immunoassay detected the 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid from 68 of the 71 patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (96 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 92 to 99 percent). Among 94 patients with other dementias, the specificity was 96 percent. If one excludes the three patients with dementia who had had strokes within one month before testing, the specificity was 99 percent. The test was positive in 12 of 24 patients with viral encephalitis. In animals the sensitivity of the assay was 87 percent and the specificity was 99 percent.
<P>
<B><I>Conclusions. </I></B>
In patients with dementia, a positive immunoassay for the 14-3-3 brain protein in cerebrospinal fluid strongly supports a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This finding, however, does not support the use of the test in patients without clinically evident dementia. (N Engl J Med 1996;335:924-30.)

<P>
The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, are neurodegenerative conditions that affect both humans and animals. They are transmissible experimentally both within and between mammalian species by inoculation with infected tissues and sometimes by ingestion in food. The diseases affecting humans have traditionally been classified as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, and kuru. They are rare, affecting about one person per million worldwide per year. By contrast, the prototypic spongiform encephalopathy scrapie is a relatively common, naturally occurring disease of sheep and goats, recognized for well over 200 years and occurring in many countries. Although these diseases have long been of biologic interest because of the unique properties of the infectious agent, the epidemic of a newly recognized prion disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or "mad cow disease," among cattle in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in other countries has led to fears that transmission to humans could occur through the ingestion of infected tissues.
<P>
The human diseases occur in inherited, acquired, and sporadic forms. Around 15 percent are inherited, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and are associated with coding mutations in the prion-protein gene. Acquired prion diseases include kuru and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Kuru reached epidemic proportions among the Fore linguistic group in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea and was transmitted during cannibalistic rituals. Since the cessation of cannibalism in the 1950s the incidence of the disease has declined, but a few cases still occur as a result of the long incubation period in this condition. Recognized iatrogenic routes of transmission are treatment with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone or gonadotropin, dura mater or corneal grafting, and use of inadequately sterilized neurosurgical instruments. The large majority of prion diseases, however, occur in the form of a randomly distributed illness of unknown cause -- sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
<P>
Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which may be familial, presents as a rapidly progressive dementia with myoclonus and is usually associated with the presence of characteristic pseudoperiodic sharp-wave complexes on electroencephalography. There is a rapid decline to akinetic mutism and death, often within three to four months. Cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal features, cortical blindness, and pyramidal signs are also frequently present. The results of routine laboratory investigations and examination of cerebrospinal fluid are usually normal. Neuroimaging is essential to rule out other conditions but cannot be used to make a definitive diagnosis. Clinically typical cases with a characteristic electroencephalogram will nearly always be confirmed as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at autopsy with the demonstration of the classic histologic triad of spongiform vacuolation (affecting any part of the cerebral gray matter), astrocytic proliferation, and neuronal loss. In about 5 percent of cases these changes are accompanied by the deposition of amyloid plaques. Atypical cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are, however, well recognized and may present diagnostic difficulties. Analysis of the prion-protein gene is important even in patients with no family history of prion disease. It may be diagnostic and used for presymptomatic testing in affected families (<A NAME="cit-1-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-1-1">1</A></A>,<A NAME="cit-2-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-2-1">2</A></A>); it has revealed a wider disease spectrum than hitherto realized. (<A NAME="cit-3-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-3-1">3</A></A>,<A NAME="cit-4-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-4-1">4</A></A>) There can be wide phenotypic heterogeneity within a family; therefore, a history of any neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric illness is potentially indicative of inherited prion disease. (<A NAME="cit-3-1-2"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-3-1">3</A></A>)
<P>
Genetic susceptibility is also relevant to both the sporadic and iatrogenic prion diseases. There is a common polymorphism of the human prion protein, in which either methionine or valine is present at residue 129. Approximately 38 percent of whites are homozygous for the more frequent methionine alleles, 51 percent are heterozygous, and 11 percent are homozygous for the valine allele. The large majority of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occur in persons who are homozygous for either allele (<A NAME="cit-5-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-5-1">5</A></A>); similarly, most patients with iatrogenic disease due to treatment with cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone are homozygous, with most homozygous for the valine allele. (<A NAME="cit-6-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-6-1">6</A></A>) However, although the protective effect of heterozygosity for the prion-protein gene (which is also seen in some inherited prion diseases) has been important in understanding the molecular biology of prion propagation, it is clearly not a specific disease marker.
<P>
In 1995 there was considerable concern in the United Kingdom about two very unusual, apparently sporadic cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in teenagers. (<A NAME="cit-7-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-7-1">7</A></A>,<A NAME="cit-8-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-8-1">8</A></A>) At the time only four cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had been recorded worldwide in teenagers, and none were in the United Kingdom. Most sporadic cases occur in persons 45 to 75 years of age. By March 1996, the United Kingdom Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit had identified eight more young people with the disease. (<A NAME="cit-9-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-9-1">9</A></A>) They shared a unique clinicopathologic picture consisting of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances and early cerebellar ataxia, a prolonged duration of illness, and atypical electroencephalographic findings. (<A NAME="cit-9-1-2"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-9-1">9</A></A>) The clinical presentation was somewhat similar to that of kuru. The neuropathological changes were particularly striking, with extensive plaque formation and an unusual pattern of prion-protein immunostaining. It seems unlikely that such patients would not have been recognized in recent years. The probability that these young patients had sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, with coincidental clustering over this short time frame, is vanishingly small. Until shown otherwise, we must assume that there is a new risk factor for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Since these cases were seen only in the United Kingdom (despite intensive surveillance in other European countries with the same criteria and methods), where a novel bovine prion disease has affected over 160,000 cattle, it was natural to consider whether exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, presumably before the ban on the use of bovine offal (which contained virtually all the infectious material) in 1989, was the explanation. To date, two more patients have been identified in the United Kingdom, with neuropathological confirmation. (<A NAME="cit-10-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-10-1">10</A></A>) A case has also been reported in France. (<A NAME="cit-11-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-11-1">11</A></A>) It is far too early to predict how many more cases will be identified. Nonetheless, early diagnostic markers for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are essential both to facilitate the differential diagnosis and, potentially, to screen blood and organ donors.
<P>
In this issue of the Journal, Hsich et al. (<A NAME="cit-12-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-12-1">12</A></A>) describe a new cerebrospinal fluid marker for these diseases. This is a welcome step forward. In 1986 Harrington and colleagues identified two proteins (designated 130 and 131) on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which provided a sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. (<A NAME="cit-13-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-13-1">13</A></A>) Unfortunately, this test was ill suited to routine diagnostic use. In the current report, these markers are identified as 14-3-3 proteins, and a positive immunoassay for these proteins in cerebrospinal fluid strongly supported a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in patients with dementia.
<P>
The authors screened a wide range of patients with neurologic diseases and found notable false positive results, anticipated from previous studies, in patients such as those with acute viral encephalitis and those who had had a stroke within one month before testing. This is not a screening test for patients without clinical dementia. In patients with dementia, the test appears to be highly specific and sensitive, but further analysis of larger numbers of patients with neurodegenerative diseases will be needed for us to be confident in this regard. In addition, it will be important to investigate how early in the disease this test is positive. Most cases of advanced Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease present little diagnostic difficulty. The usefulness of this test for patients with the recently recognized variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease should also be evaluated.
<P>
An important consideration is the stability of 14-3-3 proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid. Since this test is likely to be available in only a limited number of centers, prolonged transport of some specimens will be required. Although it is interesting to speculate whether 14-3-3 proteins have a role in the disease process, the dramatic neuronal damage in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other diseases in which positive results are found suggests, as Hsich et al. point out, that 14-3-3 proteins may simply be markers of neuronal injury.
<P>
All the prion diseases are associated with the accumulation in affected brains of an abnormal, partially protease-resistant isoform of the normal cellular glycoprotein, prion protein. The transmissible agent, or prion, appears to consist principally or entirely of this abnormal isoform, designated PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which derives from its cellular precursor, PrP<sup>C</sup>, by a post-translational modification that is thought to involve a conformational change. (<A NAME="cit-14-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-14-1">14</A></A>) A current model (<A NAME="cit-15-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-15-1">15</A></A>) of prion propagation is that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> acts as a template that promotes the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>; this process occurs most efficiently when the interacting proteins share the same primary structure. Much of the barrier limiting the transmission of prions between different mammals is determined by differences in the amino acid sequences of prion protein between species. (<A NAME="cit-15-1-2"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-15-1">15</A></A>,<A NAME="cit-16-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-16-1">16</A></A>,<A NAME="cit-17-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-17-1">17</A></A>) This model of prion propagation can also explain why people who are heterozygous for the polymorphism at codon 129 are at lower risk for prion disease. (<A NAME="cit-5-1-2"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-5-1">5</A></A>) In inherited prion diseases, mutant PrP<sup>C</sup> spontaneously changes to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and this is assumed to trigger the conversion of more PrP<sup>C</sup>. The etiology of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is unknown but may involve somatic mutation of the prion-protein gene or spontaneous conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> as a rare, chance event. Although PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-induced toxicity may cause neuronal damage, the demonstration of neurophysiologic abnormalities in prion-protein knockout mice that are similar to those seen in mice with experimentally induced scrapie and in humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease suggests that loss of the normal cellular function of prion protein may play a part. (<A NAME="cit-18-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-18-1">18</A></A>)
<P>
Although detection of protease-resistant prion protein on immunoblotting can be used to diagnose prion disease, analysis of central nervous system tissue is usually required. More sensitive immunoassays able to detect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> might allow detection of this protein in lymph nodes, other lymphoreticular tissues, and conceivably, lymphocytes in venous blood. The identification of an antiserum that will distinguish PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from PrP<sup>C</sup>, without using its resistance to proteolysis, remains elusive.
<P>
How can we assess the risks to humans posed by bovine spongiform encephalopathy? Genetic susceptibility is likely to be important, and persons homozygous for codon 129 would be expected to be at higher risk than heterozygotes. The species barrier limiting the transmission of prions between cattle and humans cannot be studied directly, since this would require the inoculation of humans with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The principal determinants of the barrier are the degree of homology between prion-protein molecules in the host and in the inoculum (<A NAME="cit-15-1-3"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-15-1">15</A></A>) and the strain of the agent; however, bovine spongiform encephalopathy appears to be caused by a single strain. (<A NAME="cit-19-1-1"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-19-1">19</A></A>) Transgenic mice expressing human prion protein, which can produce human PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and human prions when challenged with an inoculum from a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are now being used to determine whether bovine prions can induce the production of human PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. So far the results of such studies are reassuring. Incubation periods for bovine spongiform encephalopathy were unaltered in mice expressing human prion protein in addition to mouse prion protein, and only mouse PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was detectable. (<A NAME="cit-16-1-2"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-16-1">16</A></A>) A more revealing experiment is the inoculation of mice expressing only human prion protein with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. (<A NAME="cit-16-1-3"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-16-1">16</A></A>) So far, such mice remain well up to 500 days after inoculation (mice of this genotype die of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in about 200 days). However, the results of studies of any animal model of human disease must be interpreted with caution, and it is important to appreciate that even a highly effective species barrier would not exclude transmission in some cases, given the extremely large numbers of people potentially exposed.
<P>
Transgenic mice, to which human prions can be easily transmitted, may be useful for strain-typing studies to determine the source of the infection in people. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy produces a distinct pathological "signature" in mice, even when previously passaged in other species. (<A NAME="cit-19-1-2"><A HREF="2.htm#ref-19-1">19</A></A>) This signature could be used to identify patients with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, should they exist.

 N.Y. Times News Service  (Sep 26, 1996 00:30  a.m. EDT)

<P>  A new test of spinal fluid can detect Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal, transmissible disorder of the human nervous system, scientists from the National Institutes of Health and the California Institute of Technology are reporting Thursday.<P>

The test has also found related diseases in experimental animals, and is being studied to determine whether it can indicate "mad-cow disease," which has led to the slaughter of more than 170,000 cattle in England.<P>

   Previously, the only way to confirm the diagnosis of either Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or the cattle disease was to obtain a tissue sample by brain surgery or to wait for the person or animal to die and conduct an autopsy. Both diseases cause dementia, and because there are no treatments, death usually occurs just months after symptoms appear.<P>

   "This is an important step forward," said Dr. Larry Schonberger, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. "We've been hungry for a test for this disease. A lot of people have dementia, and it's unclear as to what it might be, and we're very hesitant to do a brain biopsy. This would be a much easier way to make a diagnosis while the patient is still alive."<P>

   "We think this is a terrific test," said Dr. Audrey Penn, deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. "It's important because it's the first step toward a commercially available test." Dr. Penn said she expected that some private company would develop and market the test.<P>

   The new test will be most useful for diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease when symptoms have already led doctors to suspect that illness, said Dr. Michael Harrington, a developer of the test and co-author of the paper describing it in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. It will be especially helpful to doctors in distinguishing Creutzfeldt-Jakob from Alzheimer's disease, he said.<P>

   In his study, the test correctly identified 96 percent of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and correctly ruled it out in 96 percent of those who had other types of dementia. The test requires the performance of a spinal tap to obtain the spinal fluid, but the laboratory work is relatively easy to perform, he said, and could be handled by many laboratories.<P>

   Creutzfeldt-Jakob and mad-cow disease cause similar types of brain damage, and an epidemic among cattle in England, coupled with reports last year of an increase in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people there, have led to fears that humans might contract the disease from eating infected meat.<P>

   Doctors are particularly concerned about a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that has stricken about a dozen young people in England, leading the European Union to ban the export of British beef.<P>

   No link between the cow disease and the human one has been proved, but the animal disease can cross species, and mad-cow disease is thought to have started in sheep and spread to cattle given feed that included sheep parts.<P>

   Hoping to control the livestock epidemic and regain its place in the world market, the British government has considered destroying as many 4.5 million cattle during the next five to six years.<P>

   No increase in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been reported in the United States, where the disease reflects the worldwide rate and strikes one person in a million, resulting in about 250 cases a year, Schonberger said. The cow disease has not been detected in American cattle, he said.<P>

   Harrington a research scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, developed the test with colleagues there and at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, cautioned that the new test cannot be used to screen apparently healthy livestock for mad-cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.<P>

   The test cannot be used for screening, Harrington said, because it detects the disease only after symptoms have begun. During the long incubation between exposure to the disease-causing agent and the onset of illness, animals would test negative but later fall ill, and might pose a threat to human consumption or to other livestock.<P>

   Scientists have debated for more than a decade about the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It and the cow disease, along with the human disorder kuru, and scrapie in sheep, belong to a group of disorders known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a name that refers to the sponge-like holes that they create in the brain.<P>

   Many scientists believe that the diseases are caused by prions, infectious proteins thought to cause brain damage. Other scientists suspect viruses or other microorganisms.<P>

   The new test does not identify the agent, but rather works by detecting a substance in spinal fluid, 14-3-3 protein, which is thought to leak from brain cells damaged by Creutzfeldt-Jakob or mad-cow disease.<P>

   In suspected cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the new test is valuable because it allows diagnosis without subjecting the patient to brain surgery. That could also protect medical workers, Harrington said, by allowing them to avoid exposure to potentially infective brain tissue during surgery or autopsies.<P>

   He cited the case of an American neurosurgeon who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after accidentally jabbing himself with an instrument that had touched the brain of a patient with the disease. Spinal fluid is much less infective than brain tissue, Harrington said.<P>

   He also said that by helping to identify cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the test might save transplant recipients from exposure to the disease, which has been transmitted in the past by corneas and other tissue taken from people not known to have had the disease.<P>

   The test may be particularly helpful to veterinarians in the United Kingdom, Harrington said, because mad-cow disease can be hard to diagnose. About a third of suspected cases turn out to be negative upon autopsy.<P>

   By identifying animals that really are infected, Harrington said, the new test might help workers and veterinarians avoid exposure to infected brain tissue, which may be dangerous to humans, though the risk is not known. Special precautions could also be taken in slaughtering and disposing of animals known to be infected.<P>

   Harrington said that because the initial tests were conducted on 257 people and 124 animals, further research was necessary to assure the accuracy and reliability of the test.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="New"> New Test For Mad Cow Disease</A></CENTER></H3>

 By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor 9.26.96
<P>

BOSTON -- Scientists have developed the first simple test for mad cow
disease and its human equivalent, providing a possible new way of slowing the
spread of this insidious killer.
Until now, the only way to diagnose these incurable, mind-robbing illnesses
with certainty was to look at a sample of brain tissue, something doctors are
understandably reluctant to do before the death of the victim. <p>

The inexpensive new test should allowve cattle, sparing the needless slaughter
of animals that look sick but are actually healthy. <p>

And it should enable doctors to distinguish patients with the exceedingly rare
human variety of the illness Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from those with much
more common Alzheimer's, which has some of the same symptoms. <p>

``The single most difficult diagnosis is assuring yourself whether the patient
has Alzheimer's disease or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,'' said one of the
developers of the test, Dr. Clarence J. Gibbs Jr. of the National Institutes of
Health. ``If the patient has Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, you have to advise the
family that the patient will die within a year. If it's Alzheimer's, you tell
them it will be a long, drawn-out affair.'' <p>

The new test doesn't offer any way to treat the disease. 
Practically any medical lab could offer the test now, using currently available
equipment.

The test was created by researchers from NIH and the California Institute of
Technology. A report on the discovery was published in Thursday's issue of the
New England Journal of Medicine. 

The human and cattle varieties of the disease emerged from obscurity earlier
this year in Britain. An outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy dubbed
mad cow disease led to a European ban on British beef imports and the
slaughter of nearly 200,000 cows. <p>

Even more worrisome were suspicions, still unproven, that beef eaters could
catch the cow disease. Some experts think that bad beef might be responsible
for a recent cluster of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 12 unusually young
British victims. <p>

Unlike Alzheimer's disease and similar illnesses, Creutzfeldt-Jakob can be
spread through transplants of corneas and brain tissue. Dr. Michael G.
Harrington of Cal Tech, another developer, said checking some organ donors
with the new test could help reduce the risk of this sort of spread. <p>

The test requires a spinal tap, a generally safe but unpleasant procedure. The
samples of spinal fluid are then checked for a telltale protein. Even simpler
versions, including ones that could be done on a farm or in a doctor's office,
are in the works. <p>

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strikes about one in 1 million people annually in
the United States. Alzheimer's afflicts 30 percent of Americans by age 85. <p>

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may lie dormant for years. But once symptoms
appear, it quickly destroys the brain. Victims become demented and lose their
coordination, sight and ability to speak. <p>

In their study, the researchers tested spinal fluid from 71 people with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and 94 with other forms of dementia. It was about
95 percent accurate in telling them apart. <p>

In an editorial in the journal, Dr. John Collinge of the Imperial College School
of Medicine in London called the test ``a welcome step forward.'' <p>

However, the developers acknowledged drawbacks. The test reveals the disease
only about the time symptoms start to appear, but apparently not during the
long dormant stage. And it can produce erroneously positive results in people
who have recently suffered strokes or who have encephalitis caused by the
herpes simplex virus. <p>

Dr. Frank O. Bastian of the University of South Alabama, an expert in the
disease, predicted these shortcomings will limit its practical use. <p>

``It's premature to make a lot of hullabaloo about this test,'' he said. <p>

The test reveals a protein, called 14-3-3, that appears in unusually high
levels in the spinal fluid of people with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cows with
mad cow disease or other animals with similar illnesses. It probably results
from the destruction of nerve cells, which explains why it also shows up soon
after a stroke. <p>

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and related ills are thought to result at least in part
from rogue proteins called prions. These are mutant versions of proteins that
occur normally in the body.

 <H3><CENTER>New <A NAME="library">library</A> of genes that encode secreted proteins</CENTER></H3>
N.Y. Times News Service Sep 26, 1996
<P>
The Genetics Institute said Wednesday that it had developed a library of several thousand genes and their related proteins that could be scanned for potential new drugs.<P>

   The instructions that prompt a cell to produce a specific protein are encoded in a gene, a double strand of DNA that resides in the nucleus. There are 100,000 genes in the human body, which constitute the human genome, but not all are of therapeutic interest.<P>

   The Genetics Institute's breakthrough lies in creating a novel mechanism to screen out only those <B>genes that encode secreted proteins</B>, meaning proteins that leave the cell and are therefore more likely to play a therapeutic role. To date, this technology, for which Genetics Institute has received a patent, has identified 5,000 secreted genes from a wide variety of tissue sources. Genetics Institute's scientists have produced a biochemical "library" of 250 proteins using this information.<P>

   This so-called "functional genomics" is in contrast to the approach taken by most genomics companies, which is primarily a combination of generating as many gene sequences or portions of sequences as possible and scanning vast amounts of hereditary data to identify all the genes implicated in a given disease like cancer or diabetes.

<H3><CENTER>Tonsil test may help to identify infection</CENTER></H3>
 

BY NIGEL HAWKES ... The Times: Britain:June 13 1996<P>


A NEW test developed by Dutch scientists might be used to identify cows with BSE before symptoms appear, avoiding the slaughter of healthy animals.

<P>

The scientists have shown that scrapie, a sheep disease similar to BSE, can be detected by testing samples taken from the animals' tonsils. The test shows positive results in infected animals a year before symptoms appear. They admit it may not work with cattle. But in a report in the journal <I>Nature</I> they argue that "it is surely worth investigating our suggestion further". At present the prion diseases, which include BSE, scrapie and CJD, can be disagnosed with complete certainty only after death.

<P>

Bram Schreuder and colleagues from the Institute for Animal Science and Health at Lelystad have used antibodies to detect the abnormal prion protein from sheep tonsils.

<P>

Tests in which cattle lymph tissues &#173; which include tonsils &#173; have been fed to mice have not transferred the infection. But Dr Schreuder argued that, even if cattle tonsils did not prove useful for the test, another tissue or organ might.

                                          One of the many problems with transmissible spongiform encepalopathies is that the diagnosis
                                          can be confirmed only by histological examination of brain tissue post mortem. But a report
                                          from Schreuder describes a test using immunohistochemistry for the prion protein PrPSC in
                                          the tonsils of sheep half-way to the symptomatic stage of the prion disease scrapie. If this
                                          preclinical test fulfils its early promise, then the same method could be tried for other prion
                                          diseases such as bovine spongiform encepalopathy and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease in humans.
                                          This may help alleviate the current BSE crisis in Europe.<P>

     WESTPORT, Jun 13 (Reuters) - The furor over "mad-cow" disease
     sweeping the UK and Europe has, among other things, focused
     researchers on ways to detect transmissible spongiform
     encephalopathies in the preclinical stage. One such endeavor is
     reported in the current issue of Nature.<P>

     Dr. B.E.C. Schneider and associates at the Institute for Animal
     Science and Health in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, used scrapie in
     sheep as the model for their test. The test looks for prion P80
     (PrP80) in the tonsils of sheep using immunohistochemical methods.<P>

     The test was accurate in their experimental sheep model, but it
     may not work in cattle. The hypothesis, Dr. Schneider says, "...is
     surely worth investigating further."<P>

     The researchers believe the test has "brighter prospects" in human
     spongiform encephalopathies. Since patients with Creutzfeldt-Jacob
     disease have infection in lymphoid tissues, they say, tonsil
     biopsy "is relatively easy" to perform and could prove very
     informative.<HR>

Only in sheep is it possible to investigate by deliberate exposure to infection whether
 polymorphisms are directly correlated with survival time. Cheviot sheep of different PrP genotypes were challenged with one of two
isolates of scrapie or an isolate of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the survival time and incidence of disease were monitored.
Genotype analysis showed that dimorphisms in codons 136 and 171 of the ovine PrP gene correlated with control of disease incidence and
modulation of incubation time. Crucially, the functional effects of these domains of PrP were shown to alternate depending on the isolate of
infecting agent. <HR>

Scrapie is a transmissible degenerative disease of the central nervous system occurring naturally in sheep. It belongs to the group of prion
diseases also affecting man in which an abnormal isoform of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP) accumulating in the brain is responsible
for neuronal death. Three main polymorphisms have been described in the sheep PrP gene, at positions 136, 154 and 171.<P>
 A strong
association between susceptibility/resistance to natural scrapie and a dimorphism at codon 136 of the ovine PrP gene has been reported in
several breeds, including Romanov. This dimorphism, however, is not found in all scrapie-affected breeds. We have compared the PrP
genotypes of Lacaune sheep obtained from enzootically affected flocks with those of apparently healthy sheep. A third variant at codon 171
was also evidenced. <P>
The results were compared with those obtained in a single experimental Romanov flock orally challenged with nematode
parasites in which scrapie suddenly appeared and killed 80% of the sheep. We present evidence that, even in different epizootological
circumstances, the major genetic factor controlling the susceptibility/resistance to natural scrapie in sheep, is represented by codon 171
genotype of the PrP gene. We also suggest that a modification of the allelic effects of codon 136 can occur in heavily infected animals.

2 July 1996<P>

There are at least four known potential
candidates for a field test for BSE, and probably many more companies
and organisations beavering away quietly, each aiming to be the first
to achieve what would be an extremely lucrative prize.<P>

 
(In addition to Dr Narang, there is a  test developed in USA, at
the National Institute of Health and Cal Tech, using cerebrospinal
fluid, which was claimed to work for both CJD and BSE. Details have
not been published pending patenting "to protect intellectual property
rights" but they are prepared meanwhile to test samples sent to them.)<P>

UK Assistant Chief Veterinary Officer, Kevin Taylor, reported to the
MAFF Consumer Panel on 25 April  that the US test had not worked when
tested against UK bovine samples. Proteus claims a slide-based
immunohistochemical assay for antibodies method. MAFF itself has in
the pipeline a patent application for a method.<P>

Talk is usually of  "Dr  Narang's test", which  is confusing unless
one distinguishes among  three different tests claimed on his behalf;
one a urine test for live testing for BSE, the second  an electron
microscope method for postmortem testing of cattle brains for BSE, and
the third  a urine test for live testing of people for CJD.  However,
Bart is specifically referring to the claimed urine test for BSE.<P>

 
On 10 April, I took part in a Border TV  90 minute special programme
on BSE. One of the other participants was Dr Narang's financial
backer, Ken Bell. In answer to a question about why Harash Narang did
not publish his urine method for BSE,  Ken Bell stated that it would
not be published "until his (Narang's) intellectual property rights
were secured".  A few days later I telephoned Dr Narang and asked if
this was true, and he replied that if MAFF would give him a written
undertaking today to guarantee his intellectual property rights, it
could be published.<P>

 
On 17 April, Dr Narang appeared before a joint meeting of the House of
Commons Health and Agriculture Committees. I do not think that there
has been a published report yet, and I was not present but I have had
a report from someone who was present.  It was stated that Dr Narang
had offered his services to MAFF and the Department of Health, and DoH
had asked him for further information. <P>

The Chief Veterinary Officer,
Keith Meldrum, stated that MAFF had already cooperated with Dr Narang,
over his postmortem test, both with independent assessment by
Professor Oxford, and with blind tests. Of BSE positive brains
submitted blind to Dr Narang, only 60% had been identified by that
test. MAFF would be happy to set up a validation procedure for the
urine test, but if it was based.on the  "nemavirus" theory, the CVO
had doubts about its usefulness.<P>

 
The minutes of the MAFF Consumer Panel on 25 April report the
Assistant CVO, Kevin Taylor, answering questions from consumer
representatives about the urine test, "he explained that Dr Narang's
claim that BSE was caused by a 'nemavirus' which was present in urine
was not borne out by the pattern of the disease".<P>

 
That is the most up to date information that I have. However, Bart or
anyone interested could contact Dr Narang personally and enquire on
the present state of play. I do not know the exact whereabouts of
Narang right now. I had heard that Ken Bell was trying to arrange for
him to use laboratory facilities in USA but I had the impression that
it was on a short-term visits basis.<P>

 
Up to the time I spoke to Dr Narang some weeks ago, he had an office
at Ken Bell International, 22-48 Brentwood Avenue, West Jesmond,
Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK,  Telephone:+44 191 2815311.

BY JEREMY LAURANCE, HEALTH CORRESPONDENT
The Times: Britain:June 17 1996<P>



THE threat of an epidemic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease caused by beef infected with BSE is receding, latest figures indicate. <I>[Note these figures do not include CJD misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's --webmaster]</I>

<P>

Forty-six suspected cases were referred to the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh in the first five months of the year, only slightly up on previous years. The figures will be published by the Government this month. At that rate this year's total will be 110, compared with 79 in 1995 and 115 in 1994. At least five of the 46 are suspected of being the new variant linked to BSE.

<P>

Although many suspected cases turn out not to be CJD &#173; in previous years only about half have been confirmed as genuine &#173; a big rise in referrals would have been seen as confirmation of an impending epidemic. Last March, when government scientists first announced a likely link between BSE and CJD, some scientists predicted up to 500,000 deaths.

<P>

James Ironside, the consultant neuropathologist at the surveillance unit who first identified the new variant, said the chances of a devastating epidemic reduced with each month of low referrals.

<P>

"But the fact that we have not seen a huge increase in referrals does not mean we won't see an increase in cases over the next few years and it does not weaken the hypothesis of a link between BSE and CJD," he said.

Selected quotes describing the pathology of the ten young victims in Britain who had unusually early unset and distinct symptoms.  Will et al, <I>The Lancet (1996), Vol 347, 921-925  ...  CJD
Surveillance Unit</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The most striking and consistent neuropathological abnormality in all
cases was PrP plaques. In the eight necropsy cases, plaques were
extensively distributed throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum, with
smaller numbers in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Many
of these plaques resembled kuru-type plaques with a dense eosinophilic
centre and pale periphery, and, unusually for this type of lesion,
were surrounded by a form of spongiform change (figures 1 and 2). This
unusual feature was not seen in any of the other 175 sporadic CJD
cases investigated....<P> 
"These qualitative differences in the nature of the neuropathological
lesions and morphology of PrP deposits were matched by an apparent
increase in the amount of PrP deposited in all grey-matter regions
compared with sporadic cases, 12 iatrogenic cases, six cases of
inherited CJD and in four cases of Gerstmann-Strausler-Scheinker
syndrome...."<P>
 "The ten cases in this report are remarkable in that they have a
specific neuropathological profile which, to our knowledge, has not
been described previously, and which is so consistent that
neuropathological samples from the cases are virtually
indistinguishable. The cases are further characterised by having
remarkable low ages at onset for CJD and other atypical features,
including a generally protracted and unusual clinical course and
absence of EEG changes typical of CJD. These findings raise the
possibility that the cases represent a new clinicopathological variant
of CJD."</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<I> Listserve item of 22 May 1996</I><P>

Will's article on v-CJD describes the pathologic findings along with
the clinical findings.  The frequent pathologic finding in v-CJD was the
presence of numerous plaques which showed immunostaining with PrP.  In sporadic CJD, plaques aren't frequent, and
spongiform change is the major feature.   The presence of plaques is a
feature of Kuru but has been described before as an infrequent finding
in CJD.  When plaques are present in CJD, the disease has tended to be
seen in younger individuals and has tended to be associated with
cerebellar symptoms.  A review of this can be found in an article by
Pearlman, Towfighi, et al. in Neurology in 1988. <P>

V-CJD is distinguishable conclusively only at post mortem, and more closely
resembles Kuru than CJD. Only cases younger than 45 years have been
reported as V-CJD, and it is possible that the differing pathology is a
consequence of youth and also that other, earlier cases will turn up in
historical collections.<P>

Bruton CJ et al (1995), Neurodegeneration 4(4):357-368 <I>Diagnosis and incidence
of prion (Creutzfeldt-Jakob) disease - A retrospective archival survey with
implications for future research.</I>  The article suggests
that only 60% of CJD had been reported in the past, and that younger cases
presented similarly to what is now called V-CJD]. <P>
 
It is certainly true that reported cases of CJD have risen by 30% comparing
the 7-year period before 1986 with the 7-year period afterwards, and that
this is statistically significant (p < 0.05), but it is more probable that
reporting has increased than that deaths have increased. I do not exclude
the possibility that there has been a real increase in CJD incidence and I
agree that if there is an effect it is also likely to appear at older ages.
At present, however, the statistical evidence does not support a real
increase in incidence, either amongst young or old populations.<P>

 
It is particularly notable that around 10% of all CJD cases in Britain are
younger than 45 years (compared to 4.5% in the US and elsewhere) and that
this was so before the first reports of BSE (9% before 1986, 11% after
1986, no significant change, p = 0.6), although cases under 20 years are
highly unusual.<P>

 
Three cases amongst dairy farmers is also unusual, but there have been
statistically significant excesses in other occupational groups not
especially exposed to beef (eg: ministers of religion) and there are many
thousands of occupational groups in which a chance clustering could occur.
No excess deaths in other "beef-exposed" group have emerged (eg: abattoir
workers, meat packers, vets, veterinary pathologists). Only the beef-exposed
excesses make it to the news.<HR>
<I><A NAME="Listserve">Listserve</A> item of 20 May 1996</I><P>

 There is a statistical problem with small clusters (2-3 pathologists etc) because,
although the disease is rare, clusters will always appear in some groups and
it is so easy to define the groups ex post facto (eg: Sheila Gore's letter
in the BMJ in April) - first find some cases, then find a common exposure to
"explain" them. Pathologists may be at risk of CJD but the data is not statistically significant. The corneal and dura mater
numbers are quite big, and it does look like the efficiency of infection
from transplants is very high and  far more than 1/1,000,000 of donors are
infectious. The best estimate of spongiform encephalopathy in humans [which includes CJD]
seems to be 70 per million or 70 times the CDC death certificate rate of CJD.<HR>

<Center><h3>Mortality Database Definitions</h3></center>

The following are brief definitions of the seventeen categories of diseases listed in the Mortality Database. The examples provided are a brief sampling of the diseases. They are <b>not</b> a complete list.</p>

<ol>

<b><li> Infectious and Parasitic Diseases</b>- Diseases which are contagious (can be transmitted from one human or species to another), as well as a few diseases of unknown but possibly infectious origin. Includes Bacterial and Viral Diseases. Example: Tuberculosis, AIDS. </li>



<b><li> Neoplasms</b>-New (neo) growth of tissue which does not serve any physiologic function. Neoplasm can be benign (harmless) or malignant (harmful), meaning cancer.  Example: Leukemia, Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Bone Cancer, Colon Cancer.</li>



<b><li> Endocrine, Nutritional, and Metabolic Diseases</b>- Endocrine Glands are the hormonal glands, including the Thyroid, Ovary, and Pancreas. Example: Diabetes. Metabolic diseases are abnormalities of one's ability to metabolize. Example: Cystic Fibrosis.</li>



<b><li> Blood and Blood-Forming Organs</b>- Includes blood loss, blood coagulation (clotting) and deficiencies in blood cells. Example: Iron Deficiency Anemia, Sickle Cell Anemia,  Hemophilia, Lymphoma, Leukemia, and Spleen.</li>



<b><li> Mental Disorders</b>- Organic psychotic conditions such as Alzheimer's, but mainly other psychoses and non-psychoses such as depression disorders. May be associated with suicide, drug and alcohol abuse. Also includes physiological conditions arising from mental factors, including Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia.</li>



<b><li>  Nervous System and Sense Organs</b>- Diseases which affect the Central Nervous System (spinal cord and brain), and the Peripheral Nervous System (all nervous tissue other than the spinal cord and brain).  Example: Intracerebral Aneurysm, Meningitis, Parkinson's Disease.</li>



<b><li>  Circulatory System</b>- Diseases which affect the arteries and veins, as well as the heart. Example: Myocardial Infarction (heart attack), Pulmonary Embolism (blood clot in lungs), Congestive Heart Failure, Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.</li>



<b><li> Respiratory System</b>- Diseases which affect the system which aids in exchange of oxygen in the lungs into the blood stream. Example: Emphysema, Pneumonia.</li>



<b><li>  Digestive System</b>- Diseases which affect the system which breaks down food, carries it through the body, and eliminates it from the body. Example: Appendicitis, Perforated Ulcers, Cirrhosis.</li>



<b><li> Genitourinary System</b>- Diseases which affect the kidney, bladder, and reproductive organs. Example: Renal Failure.</li>



<b><li> Complications of Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium (3-6 weeks after childbirth)</b>- Example: Ectopic Pregnancy, Miscarriage. </li>



<b><li> Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue</b>- Diseases which affect the skin, fatty tissue, and muscle. Example: Acute Lymphadenitis.</li>



<b><li> Musculoskeletal System and the Connective Tissue</b>- Diseases which affect the bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons. Example: Lupus, Rheumatory Arthritis.</li>



<b><li> Congenital Anomalies</b>- Abnormalities that manifest during gestation and become relevant at the time of birth or afterwards. Example: Congenital Heart Disease, Hydrocephalus.</li>

 

<b><li> Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period</b> (the period  before and after birth, roughly from the 20-28th week of gestation to 7-28 days after birth)- Diseases in which the fetus or newborn is affected by maternal conditions or birthing complications. Example: Drug Abuse, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Cocaine, Chronic Circulatory or Respiratory Conditions, Low Birth Weight, Placenta or Umbilical Cord Complications.</li>

 

<b><li> Symptoms, Signs, and Ill-defined Conditions</b>- Example: Coma, Cardiogenic Shock, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Asphyxia, Respiratory Arrest.</li> 



<b><li> Injury and Poisoning</b>- Example: Intracranial Injury, Injury to Liver, Open Wound,  Crushing Injury, Burns, Hypothermia, Anaphylactic Shock.</li></ol>

<H3><CENTER>CJD, <A NAME="Italian">Italian</A> Style</CENTER></H3>

La malattia di Creutzfeldt-Jacob &egrave; una forma molto rara di malattia del cervello in cui una grave demenza si associa a disturbi neuromuscolari. Pu&ograve; colpire uomini e donne e si manifesta pi&ugrave;  spesso intorno ai 50-60 anni. Il primo sintomo &egrave; spesso rappresentato da un profondo deterioramento mentale. <P>

Purtroppo non esistono ancora terapie capaci di modificare la storia naturale della malattia di Creutzfeldt-Jacob, la cui evoluzione &egrave;  rapidamente progressiva. Basti pensare che il 90 per cento dei pazienti muoiono entro un anno e i casi di sopravvivenza superiore a due anni sono veramente eccezionali.<P>

  Che si tratti di una malattia infettiva &egrave; noto da tempo; gi&agrave; nel 1968 infatti, alcuni ricercatori avevano osservato che il tessuto cerebrale prelevato grazie alle autopsie ed iniettato negli scimpanz&egrave;  poteva indurre il quadro tipico dopo un adeguato periodo di incubazione.
<P>
  Dal 1968 ad oggi molte informazioni sono state raccolte, tuttavia le modalit&agrave; con cui la malattia si contrae in natura non sono ancora note con precisione. La possibilit&agrave; di trasmissione da un individuo malato ad uno sano non &egrave;  stata accertata; allo stesso modo non sono state identificate  sorgenti di infezione  nell ambiente esterno.<P>

  L unico modo di trasmissione sicuramente dimostrato &egrave; quello che in termini tecnici viene definito  iatrogeno , ossia effetto avverso conseguente a un trattamento medico o chirurgico.
  In alcuni casi si &egrave; verificata la malattia dopo un trapianto corneale o dopo l impianto in profondit&agrave; di elettrodi infetti.<P>

  In Francia sono stati documentati negli ultimi anni 25 casi in persone trattate tra il 1984 e il 1985 con ormone della crescita estratto dall ipofisi di cadaveri.
  Queste tragiche esperienze hanno indotto lo sviluppo di studi atti ad individuare metodi adeguati di prevenzione.
<P>

  L ormone estratto dai cadaveri, che in Francia si &egrave; rivelato pi&ugrave; pericoloso che altrove, &egrave; stato sostituito dovunque nel mondo con un ormone biosintetico. Sono state inol tre redatte linee guida per il trattamento del materiale venuto a contatto con tessuti infetti. La combinazione di metodi chimici e fisici, se applicata scrupolosamente, si &egrave;  dimostrata in grado di garantire la sicurezza di strumentazioni e altri materiali. Particolari misure devono inoltre essere prese durante le autopsie dei casi sospetti.
<P>

  E  chiaro che maggiori possibilit&agrave; di prevenzione potranno derivare solo da un aumento delle conoscenze. La dimostrata suscettibilit&agrave; di alcune persone ad ammalarsi e l  esistenza di casi familiari rappresentano in questo senso un dato importante. E  stato infatti evidenziato che i soggetti ammalatisi dopo l esposizione ai  trattamenti a rischio  possiedono tutti un particolare gene.

According to records of the Ministry of Agriculture Foods and Fisheries [MAFF] at least
seventeen calves, of the 23.000 cows confirmed with BSE since the June 1988 feed ban,
were between 20 and 30 months.<P>

Scientific Veterinary Committee and other Dutch scientists: letter to the Dutch Minister of
Agriculture, dated April 1st 1996.</I><P>

 
In 1994, Maff released figures (in response to shadow Minister of
Agriculture Strang) stating that in the period from the June 1988 feed ban
till December 1993, three calves younger than two years (24 months) were
BSE-infected.  The figures of infected cows between 24 and 36 months were: <P>

<H4>25 May 96 Listserve Commentary on above tables:</H4>
For every  "British downer" one can expect at least
a 100 incubators [infected, but not displaying overt symptoms] entering the human food chain. i believed him [ person on British TV]
since the clip showed him wearing a white coat, glasses, he had a microscope
and a computer behind him so he could not have
any vested interests at all."<P>

<STRONG>Cross-contamination with pig or poultry feed</STRONG> after 1990 has likely affected some herds. This was
entirely predictable. As a result we should see a marked difference in
the pattern between the two herd types, ie those not subsequently
reinfected and those significantly infected after 1990. The UK herd is
thus likely to split into two groups over the next couple of years,
those with essentially no cases from animals born after 1989/90 and
those with significant cases from after that time. It is this group that
I presume are targeted with the proposed culling program.<P>
 
<STRONG>Disposal of culled animals</STRONG>. It is clear that the entire incineration
and rendering industry of the EC is unable to cope with even those
animals over 30 months. I have noticed an inability of many to fully
comprehend this. Calls for a full cull of affected UK herds are nice
politics but essentially not possible. The environmental consequences
are also not at all good.<P>

<STRONG>A rational and sensible way of handling it</STRONG> would be to butcher out the
SBO's [specified bovine offals] and incinerate them. Then process the non-SBO's into M&B meal but
place it's use under severe restriction, after all the evidence is
rather strong that this is fit for human consumption so it's use for
specific animal feed should at least be considered. One should note that
this effectively doubles the number of animals that can be processed.
The sort of restriction I had in mind would be along the following
lines:<P>

a) Feed mills that use this M&B must be prohibited from producing any
ruminant feed at all of any kind from that site.<P>

b) Vehicles used for the M&B meal and produce that contains it should be
prohibited from carrying anything else. (Ie a plate?)<P>

 c) End users (most likely poultry and specialised pork finishers) that
are permitted  to use it must be approved by MAFF. Typical regulations
might restrict it's use to sites that have no ruminants, and any chance
of ruminants on surrounding sites becoming contaminated must be nil.<P>

LONDON (Jun 20, 1996) - Britain can expect dozens more cases of a new strain of the human version of mad cow disease
over the next five years, top scientists predicted Thursday.

They said if a newly identified strain of the brain-rotting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is caused by eating beef infected with mad cow
disease, there will be more cases, but the numbers will be impossible to predict.<P>

"If this is indeed a BSE-related epidemic, and we don't know that yet, I personally don't think we've seen all the cases we are going to see,"
said Peter Smith, head of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

"I would expect more cases to occur over the next year, no matter what."<P>

British scientists caused a worldwide scare in March when they said they had identified 10 cases of a new strain of CJD and said it was likely
the victims had caught it from eating beef infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease). An 11th case later
turned up in France.<P>

Based on the patterns of other diseases, CJD linked to BSE could "persist over a long period of time," Smith said. "It would not be uncommon,
with diseases with incubation periods of five years...to persist for five years or more," he added.

He said there would be "tens of cases." "If it was much larger, one would begin to be worried."<P>

Smith, speaking at a news conference held during a meeting of Europe's top experts in spongiform encephalopathies, said a test to diagnose
BSE and CJD was needed urgently.

Currently, the diseases can only be confirmed with examination of the brain after death.

"We also recognized that predicting the size of the epidemic would be easier if we had a diagnostic test. Clearly this must be a major
research priority," Smith said.

He added he would expect "substantial new funds" for this.<P>

John Collinge, an expert in BSE-type diseases at St. Mary's Hospital in London, said there was another problem in predicting any epidemic.
"We don't know what foods it (the infective agent) went into," he said. "We know that one gram of brain can kill a cow. We need to know how
many grams people are exposed to in a typical British diet."<P>

Some scientists say tens of thousands of people could have been infected with BSE and predict an epidemic of CJD, which has a long incubation
period, over the next 30 years.

The European experts, meeting under the auspices of Britain's Medical Research Council, said they were checking to make sure no cases of
the new CJD strain had gone undetected in Europe, but did not think this had happened.<P>

British government scientists said the BSE epidemic, which surfaced in 1986, was caused by feeding cattle the remains of sheep infected
with scrapie, their own version of the disease. There is now a ban on using such feed.

But Smith indicated not all scientists were convinced that contaminated feed was the cause. "It would be the consensus view that this is the
favored hypothesis," he said carefully.

<H3><CENTER>Deaths from <A NAME="dementia">dementia</A> to be investigated for CJD variant</CENTER></H3>


BY JEREMY LAURANCE, HEALTH CORRESPONDENT

<BR>
The Times: Britain:June 21 1996<P>



SCIENTISTS are to increase their monitoring of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease amid fears that there may be hidden cases that have been misdiagnosed.

<P>

The National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh is to run intensive searches for the disease in one or two regions by increasing the number of post-mortem examinations performed on people who die from dementia or similar conditions.

<P>

Experts believe that among the elderly there could be cases of the new variant of CJD &#173; which is linked to BSE in cows &#173; that have been mistaken for Alzheimer's disease or other dementing illnesses. They want similar checks to be made of very young children who have died of neurological illnesses.

<P>

Dr Robert Will, director of the unit, said: "It is possible that we are missing cases. We have to think of doing intensive surveillance across the age range in one or two regions. The findings may be negative but it is important to exclude the possibility."

<P>

Dr Will said that classical CJD &#173; also known as sporadic CJD, which is not linked to BSE &#173; had distinct clinical features and was very unlikely to be confused with dementia or similar conditions. However, the new variant of CJD has less specific symptoms, often beginning with depression in the early stages rather than the movement disorder typical of the classical disease, and is harder to diagnose.

<P>

"We are not confident at all in diagnosing the new variant cases because the clinical features are not specific," he said. "The diagnosis essentially depends on the neuropathology [revealed by dissection of the brain after death]. We are trying to get a high post-mortem rate in one or more regions to check the incidence of the new variant. It is possible very young kids and the elderly over 75 could be missed."

<P>

Up to the end of last month 11 cases of new-variant CJD had been confirmed in Britain and there are at least five suspected cases.

<P>

All the victims have been unusually young, displayed distinctive symptoms and suffered effects to the brain different to those seen in normal CJD. Dr Will said only one more confirmed case of new-variant CJD had come to light in Britain since news of the original ten was made public in March. He would not be drawn on the number of suspected cases still being investigated.

<P>

Scientists from nine European countries convened in London yesterday for a two-day meeting to discuss the latest developments in research into BSE and its links with CJD in humans.

<P>

Professor Peter Smith, head of the department of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was too early to predict how widespread the disease would become in Britain. "It is early days but the size of any epidemic will be informed by the number of cases we see over the next year. If the number is small we will have some confidence that the size of the epidemic will be small.

<P>

"I personally find it unlikely that we have seen all the cases we are going to see. I would not be surprised if we saw tens of cases over the next year but if it becomes larger than that, especially if there are surges in the numbers, then one would be worried.

<P>

"Experience with other diseases of this kind, such as kuru, suggests there is a long incubation of five to ten years. Cases of the disease could continue to occur over a long period of time." Kuru occurred among natives of Papua New Guinea who ate the brains of their ancestors in a cannibalistic ritual.

<P>

Asked what the view among experts was on how safe it was to eat British beef, he said: "Opinions do vary. Probably the consensus view is that if it was hazardous to eat beef products it [the risk] is now lower than before the measures [banning specific parts of beef and cows older than 30 months from the food chain] were introduced."<HR>


<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Hunt">Hunt</A> for new CJD will be widened to children and elderly</CENTER></H3>

By Roger Highfield, Science Editor<BR>
Electronic Telegraph ... 21/June/1996<P>

THE HUNT for the new variant of CJD linked to mad cow disease is to be widened to include the young and elderly and will be extended to more countries, leading scientists agreed yesterday.<p>


 The meeting was told that the World Health Organisation was considering a broader-scale surveillance of CJD around the world. It also heard that extra government funding had been given to the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh to allow for a more thorough search for victims. "Predictions of the size of the epidemic are going to be most informed in the short run by the number of cases that arise over the next year," said the co-ordinator of the meeting, Prof Peter Smith, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "If this number is small, then I think we will have some confidence the ultimate size of the epidemic is likely to be small." He said the meeting wanted "to see whether any cases of the disease have been missed in particular groups such as the very young or the very old". <p>



 Opening the meeting, Prof Philippe Lazar, chairman of the European Science Foundation Standing Committee of the European Medical Research Councils, said: "There is now widespread acceptance that transmission of BSE to humans may have occurred. If this is so, I would find it unlikely that we have seen all the cases we are going to see, if the incubation period is of the order of five to 10 years. I would not be surprised if there were tens of cases in the next year. If it becomes much larger than that, then one would begin to be worried."<p>

 The British Paediatric Association was monitoring children. Suspected victims over 75 would also be included, with scientists looking for cases in a number of sample areas, he said. A European surveillance effort was also underway in France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. Australia was also to be included. "Comparative information from other countries is potentially very important in assessing any change in the incidence of CJD," said the head of the CJD Surveillance Unit, Dr Robert Will.<P>


 The meeting in London of scientists from nine European countries, backed by the Medical Research Council and the European Science Foundation, was also told that, according to a genetic analysis, only half the population is at risk, those homozylgous for a prion gene polymorphism, as was the case in all individuals affected by the new strain of CJD, said Prof John Collinge of St Mary's Hospital Medical School.<HR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Czechoslovakian">
</A> CJD</H3>
by Tim Beardsley ... Scientific American, August 1990</CENTER><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Eva Mitrova, en epidemiologist at the Research Institute of Preventive Medicine in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia , is worried.  Since 1976, <STRONG>22 cases</STRONG> of a rare, fatal dementia have been diagnosed in Oraava, a sparsely populated sheep-rearing region of the Slovakian republic.  The incidence is accelerating: 12 of the cases have  occurred with the past three years. <STRONG> Another 19 cases</STRONG> are clustered around Lucenec, 80 miles to the south.  "The people are extremely afraid," Mitrova says.<P>

The outbreak in Slovakia has been identified as CJD.  It kills within seven months after the first symptoms appear.  CJD normally occurs in about one person per million every year throughout the world:<STRONG> the incidence in Orava is several hundred times that</STRONG>, according to Mitrova.  CJD resembles kuru, a fatal infection that was common among Papua New Guinean tribes that ate and handled the brains of their dead during mourning rites.  In addition, CJD has close similarities to so-called mad cow disease, which has caused 15,000 cattle to be destroyed in Great Britain since 1986.<P>

Mitrovas's concern is shared by others researchers.  Most investigators think that CJD kuru, and mad cow disease are variants of scrapie, a disease of sheep that causes spongy degeneration and deposits of a fibrous protein in the Brain.  Carleton Gajdusek, chief of the central nervous system lab at NINCDS, calls the outbreak "Oravske kuru."  Gajdusek suggests that BSE and Oravske kuru --  as well as the rapid spread of scrapie in the US -- <STRONG>indicate that a worldwide epidemic started during the 1970's</STRONG>. "We have a major problem in human disease," cautions Gajdusek, who won a Nobel prize in 1976 for establishing that kuru can be transmitted to chimpanzees.<P>

What has most alarmed epidemiologists is that <STRONG>Oravske kuru may be the result of scrapie jumping from sheep to humans</STRONG>.  Many of the villagers coming down with CKJ<BR>JD had frequent and close contact with sheep, Mitrova says.  Moreover, she has recently found the characteristic brain degeneration of <STRONG>scrapie in sheep from Orava</STRONG>.  "If Mitrova's numbers are accurate, I would have difficulty being reserved about that," comments Robert G. Rohwer, who is a scrapie microbiologist at UNC Chapel Hill.<P>

Scrapie-like disease are promiscuous in their host range.  Within the past few months a BSE-like disease has been reported in zoo antelopes and in domestic cats in Great Britain.  <STRONG>There is near hysteria there because of the fear that BSE might be transmitted to people and beef prices have slumped.</STRONG>  The  USDA has inaugurated a surveillance program fro BSE and is tracking down cattle imported from the UK.<P>

Yet in spite of the sudden appearance of BSE in Great Britain, scrapie and its variants, including CJD, are not easily transmitted in nature.  Even though scrapie has long been present in the UK, CJD is not common there.  But what is difficult in nature can be helped with technology.  "If you try hard enough, you can eventually transmit theses agents to almost any animal" by injecting infectious extracts directly into the brain, remarks Richard F. Marsh, a scrapie researcher at UW Madison. "You may have to use 40 or 50 animals, and then you'll get it," adds Paul W. Brown, a co-worker of Gajdusek's and an expert on CJD.<P>

At least 25 <A NAME="cases">cases</A> of CJD in western countries can be traced to what Gajdusek refers to as high technology cannibalism.  Fourteen resulted from<STRONG> injections of growth hormone or gonadotrophin</STRONG> extracted from human pituitary glands, according to Brown.  And more cases are likely because of the long incubation period of the disease.  Three cases arose in patients given <STRONG>grafts of dura mater</STRONG>, skull-lining tissue taken from cadavers that is used for patching in neurosurgery.  At least six were transmitted by <STRONG>unsterile instruments</STRONG> or electrodes employed during neurosurgery; one case was transmitted through a <STRONG>corneal graft</STRONG> and one by <STRONG>root-canal dentistry</STRONG>, Gajdusek says.<P>

BSE, in a similar fashion, spread silently in Great Britain during the early 1980's by technological misfortune.  Scrapie-infected sheep carcasses were rendered into protein supplements fed to cattle.  Most likely, changes in rendering practices allowed the scrapie agent to infect cattle via their feed.  The government has now banned the use of ruminant products in ruminant feed, as well as all use of cattle offals. thought to be capable of harboring the scrapie agent.<P>

The nature of the causal agent is bitterly controversial.  The agent has extraordinary properties: in elicits no immune response and is resistant to treatments that kill most other infectious agents.  Brown has four times repeated an experiment apparently showing that scrapie survives -- just barely -- a temperature of 360 degrees Celsius, hot enough to break down base pairs that make up DNA and RNA.  "That's rather distressing," he says....<P>

With no obvious technological catastrophe to blame, why is CJD so  common in Orava?   Genes may play a part.  experiments show that mutations in the gene that codes for the healthy scrapie protein can affect an animal's susceptibility to the disease. Goldfarb, Brown, Gajdusek have found a specified mutation in the human scrapie-protein in five unrelated individuals who were stricken with CJD, including some cases from Orava.<P>

So Oravske kuru could be the result of genetically susceptible people exposed to the scrapie agent.  "I think both factors are important," Mitrova says.  <STRONG>Half of the Orava cases are in families that have other cases</STRONG>, which lends  support to a role for genes.  Yet many CJD cases do not carry the mutation.  A lot could be handing on the efforts of Gajdusek and Mitrova to solve the mystery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Eva Mitrova recorded an unusually high incidence of CJD in the rural Lucenec
area of south central Slovakia (the Slovak Republic) with cases in adjacent
Hungary. During the past decade, she has recorded "an epidemic of CJD which
developed during the 1980's" in the most sparsely populated rural
sheep-raising area of Slovakia (Orava). The numbers were 30 cases in a
population of 15,000, an incidence rate of over 1,000 per million, although
"CJD had not been known in Orava before the 1970's".<P>
 
There are problems in ennumerating the base and case populations in
studying a concentration of disease such as this, but it is clearly a high
incidence. There is also no means of confirming the low incidence prior to
the epidemic, but I take assume the rural community was capable of recognising the novelty
of the outbreak. I can find no reference to changes in the historical
prevalence of scrapie or changes in exposure that "explain" the outbreak.<P>
 
The "epidemic" had interesting features such as "members of the same family
who were 20 to 30 years different in age became sick at nearly the same time.
This suggested a common source of infection... We suspected an accident of
massive contamination of the population with sheep scrapie." Gajdusek
continues: "We are now looking for a cofactor that turns on the expression of
the mutation or a factor that in the past inhibited the post-translational
configuration change of the precursor to amyloid."<P>
 
Gajdusek writes, "Thus, the new question is not what has caused the Orava outbreak - it is
the codon 200 glutamic acid to lysine point mutation - but rather what has
prevented its expression in previous generations so that it has accumulated
as a frequent silent nonpathogenic polymorphism, only expressing itself as a
pathogenic mutation in these people in the past 15 yr."<P>
 
The local population therefore appears to have been susceptible to CJD with
greater frequency than elsewhere , but only challenged
with some (unknown) triggering agent in recent years. What is most important
about this epidemic, V-CJD and possibly BSE is that the size of the epidemic
is strictly limited by the genetics of the exposed populations. <P>

<H4><CENTER>CJD and the <A NAME="PRNP">PRNP</A> codon
200Lys mutation: an analysis of 45 families</CENTER></H4>


Goldfarb LG et al.   Eur J Epidemiol 7: 477-86 (1991) <P>

The mutation at codon 200 to lysine in the human PRNP coding region has been identified in 45 of the 55 CJD-affected families thus far presented to our NIH
laboratory. These codon 200Lys families have a total of 87 patients, and originate from 7 different countries: Slovakia, Poland, Germany,
Tunisia, Greece, Libya, and Chile. Forty-seven patients were neuropathologically verified, and brain tissue from 14 patients transmitted
disease to experimental primates. The mutation was found by direct sequencing in 4 patients, and it was detected by restriction endonuclease
analysis with BsmA 1 and/or the single nucleotide extension reaction in 36 other patients and 45 of 109 first degree relatives (1 parent,
14 siblings, and 30 children). The mutation is associated with all known geographical clusters of CJD (Slovakia, Libyan Jews, Chile) in
which the annual mortality rate is tens or hundreds of times higher than the world average of 1 per million. All patients originating from
the cluster areas carried the mutation, but it was seen in only 1 of 103 unrelated control individuals from the same areas, and in none of
102 controls from other areas, indicating a strong association between the mutation and disease. The penetrance of the mutation was
estimated to be 0.56. Branches of some families migrating from cluster areas to other countries continue to have CJD over several
generations, suggesting that CJD in these families is a genetic disorder, in which the 200Lys mutation is responsible for the disease. <P>

We have found the codon 200Lys mutation in 6 Chilean CJD families, including a family in the rural case cluster in Chillan. Thus, all 3 of
the known clusters of CJD, in Slovakia, Libyan-born Israeli Jews, and Chile, are linked to the presence of the same mutation. The
phenotypic features of the disease in these families are similar to those reported for other clustered or individual families elsewhere in the
world. The heterogeneous genetic composition of the Chilean population interpreted in light of historical migration patterns suggests that the
mutation may have entered Chile by Jewish emigration from Spain. <HR>

Collinge J et al.
 BMJ 306: 301-2 (1993) <P>

OBJECTIVE--To identify cases of inherited prion diseases in Britain and to assess their phenotypic features. DESIGN--Screening study of
patients suspected clinically to have Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other neurodegenerative diseases by prion protein gene analysis.
SETTING--Biochemical research department. SUBJECTS--Patients suspected to have Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other
neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS--Two patients with symptoms characteristic of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were found to
have inherited prion protein disease (PrP lysine 200), with a mutation at codon 200 of the prion protein gene. Both were homozygous at
codon 129 of the gene. One patient was a man aged 58 of British descent while the other was of Libyan Jewish origin. CONCLUSION--Two foci
of inherited prion disease are known, among Libyan Jews and in Slovakia. A separate British focus of the disease may also exist.
Heterozygosity at codon 129 may lead to reduced penetrance of the mutation. <HR>

Morning Call  (Allentown, PA) ...March 23, 1996<BR>
ANN WLAZELEK<P>

Dr. Brian Little, a neuropathologist in Bethlehem,found no links to beef or
anything  else in a 1990 study of a rare cluster of Lehigh Valley residents
with  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  Disease,  the  human  form  of  bovine  spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
   Although  transmission from cows to humans is possible in theory, Little
said  he  knows of no scientific proof that the disease crossed the species
in Britain, the Lehigh Valley or anywhere else.<P>

   Scientists  suspect  cows acquired the disease from eating feed enriched
with the organs of sheep, which get a form of the disease known as scapie.
   Since  first diagnosed in cattle in 1986, Britains have destroyed nearly
160,000  dairy  cows with the symptoms. Recently, they stopped serving beef
in thousands of schools in the United Kingdom.<P>

   The  panic  began in December, when <STRONG>a respected British neuropathologist</STRONG>
and former government adviser, Sir Bernard Tomlinson,<STRONG> said he was giving up beef</STRONG>   because  of  the  possibility  that  mad  cow  disease  might  cause CJD.
   Recent  deaths  fueled the fears. Although CJD normally occurs in adults
50 to 75, two British teen-agers died from it as well as four dairy farmers
who came in contact with the disease in their herds.<P>

   In   the  local  investigation,  Little  and  two  national  authorities
interviewed  the  relatives  of  15-18  residents  of  Lehigh, Northampton,
Carbon,  Monroe  and  Schuylkill  counties who died of CJD between 1986 and
1990.  At  the  time,  the  numbers  were  three to six times the normal or
expected  rate  for  CJD,  which has a worldwide incidence of one case in a
million each year.<P>

   Little  and  his  team  asked family members at least 50 questions about
food  alone,  including  the  deceased's  habits of eating beef, veal, ham,
pork, scrapple and sweetbread (the thymus of a calf or lamb).
   Other  questions  pertained  to surgery, acupuncture, major dental work,
family medical histories, hobbies and travels.<P>
  
   In  the end, no links were found, said Little, who still examines brains
and  brain tumors at LVH once a week but took an associate dean position at
the Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia a year ago.
   "I  believe  we did what we could to determine the cause of the outbreak
in the Lehigh Valley," he said. "But we were unsuccessful."<HR>


   Recent <A NAME="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</A> cases include that of a 44-year-old woman who rapidly lost her ability to work and was diagnosed at Penn this winter, a 75-year-old man who came into Jefferson with an incorrect diagnosis of Alzheimer's, and the ``blue-collar'' patient.
   She was hospitalized at Hahnemann for a month. Initially, her family thought she was suffering from Alzheimer's, but Hahnemann physicians diagnosed her with CJD.<P>
   ``There was no reason for a brain biopsy because there is no treatment, and there's an increased risk of transmission,'' said a hospital spokesman. ``She was discharged to a nursing home because her deterioration was so rapid that her family couldn't care for her.''  <P>

She was discharged from Hahnemann University Hospital 12 days ago, her brain function so deteriorated that she was sent to a nursing home to await death from what the British are calling mad-cow disease.
   ``She is a blue-collar woman,'' her friend said. ``She's never been to England. She's never eaten English food.''<P>
   Still, she contracted the fatal brain disease that is terrorizing England. The British call it mad-cow disease, the term used for the illness found in cattle.
   Here, the rare human disease is called by its medical name, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD.<HR>

   Approximately 200 Americans develop and quickly die from CJD each year, according to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, which examined death certificates from 1979-1990.<P>
<HR>

   ``There are <A NAME="no">no</A> cases of BSE in this country, and we aren't importing their beef,'' said Dr. Roger Pomerantz, professor of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Thomas Jefferson University. <B>``I wouldn't eat a lot of beef for cholesterol reasons but not because of BSE.''</B><P>
   Still, the cause of CJD in most human patients is unknown.
   ``It just simply occurs,'' said Dr. Murray Grossman, associate professor of neurology at University of Pennsylvania Medical Center.
   ``Typically, there's a rapid decline in cognitive function over several weeks or months. It's quite a dramatic unrelenting downturn. It affects the patient's memory, attention, language, visual functioning.''<P>

   CJD's incubation period is from 15 months to more than 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Death occurs three to 12 months after the onset of the disease.<P>

I am a biologist working in the R&D Dept. of a pharmaceutical plant
producing extractive drugs from animal organs,in particular heparin.
In the last years we had a lot of troubles with BSE because in the past our
heparin was from bovine mucosa.<P>

When the BSE problem arose, we performed (according to International
guidelines) a very expensive validation study  (made by a qualified
institute in Scotland) in which our heparin production method completely
purified completely raw material known to have scrapie agent. <P>


The method of extraction and purification of heparin is formed by three steps:
the first step resulted in a clearance of 2.9 log, the second step and the third  completely removed/inactivated the input Scrapie spike
which was 7.7 logs.<P>

To be sure of our results we asked  one of the most
important experts of BSE for comment;  in a detailed Scientific Report he declared, on the
basis of the validation study,  raw material from a BSE-free  country [Brazil], and of a lot of other important reasons that our heparin was free of
 BSE.<P>

Despite of this, we were obliged by Health Authorities to
change raw material source (pork intestinal mucosa instead of bovine
intestinal mucosa).<P>

With an enormous lost of money and consequent lost of jobs in Italy
and in Brazil, we had to convert our production into pork
heparin with the consequent revision of the production, purification,
analytical methods.
Incidentally, we were studing a very interesting fraction of heparin active
against heavy cardiovascular pathologies.<P>
 
Speaking about things less tragical then death but very important: How much
is the "only" economical damage caused by this "hysteria" originated by
misinformation? How many people lost and are losing their jobs (farmers,
workers of food and pharmaceutical industry, etc.), not only in UK but in
all Europe and, my Brazilian collegues are an example, in the world?<HR>

<H3>NATO calls blood safety conference in The Hague<HR></H1></CENTER>

<P>    THE HAGUE, Netherlands (May 3, 1996 3:30 p.m. EDT) -- NATO said Friday it will host a major international conference here next week to discuss the safety of blood transfusions in battle zones in the light of infections such as HIV/AIDS and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease of the brain.<P>

The NATO Military and Civil Blood Conference, the fourth in a series, will be held in The Hague from May 6 to 8. It has been organized by NATO's Joint Medical Committees in collaboration with the Dutch Defense Ministry and blood transfusion services.<P>

    "The main aim is to improve the interchangeability of blood and blood products between NATO forces," Joost Ruitenberg, chairman of NATO's Scientific Committee told Reuters.<P>

    The program comprises around 50 speakers from 25 nations, with an audience of 150 military and civil doctors, scientists and technicians all related to blood and disaster medicines.<P>

    In a timely contribution, one lecture from Paul Brown of the U.S. National Institute of Health Monday will be on whether blood and blood products can transmit Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, the human brain-wasting disorder at the heart of the British mad cow scare.<P>

    Another from Cees van der Poel of the Dutch Blood Bank will be on the harmonization of ways to detect infectious diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS.<P>

    Further discussions will focus on deep-frozen blood for use during NATO and UN peace keeping and enforcing operations, plans for the exchange of blood and blood products among allied forces and storage logistics in extreme climates.<P>

 WELLINGTON, New Zealand (May 4, 1996 7:05 p.m. EDT) - New Zealand health officials said Saturday they had quarantined blood products from a donor who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and played down any risk that other people could be infected.<P>

<h3>Notice to Physicians</h1>

<h4><A NAME="Please">Please</A> Help Locate Patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

 who may have been blood donors</h4>

<hr>

The transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by dura mater, growth hormone, gonadotrophin and cornea has been documented, but the possibility of its transmission by blood transfusion remains controversial. However, a number of manufacturers and blood programs, including the Canadian Red Cross, have taken precautionary measures to prevent the theoretical risk of blood-borne transmission.

<p>The Canadian Red Cross seeks physicians' cooperation to identify, with their consent, patients who have been diagnosed with CJD and who have donated blood. We will then be able to find and remove blood components and products that were derived from blood donated by these patients.

<p>We would also like to know if any such patients received blood transfusions. This information will help us further study the relationship of CJD with transfusion. Your cooperation will be most appreciated.

<p>The blood supply in Canada is safe, and with your help we will be able to make it even safer.

<I>[[Biological errors were corrected in the story below, e.g., CJD is prion-caused, not viral --  webmaster]]</I>

<P>   TORONTO (May 5, 1996 10:05 p.m. EDT) -- In the latest blow to Canada's blood supply, a top hospital has warned hundreds of parents that their children may have received blood products infected with a lethal brain prion.<P>


   Officials at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children say 525 families have received letters about the incident, in which a man who donated blood died last year of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the human equivalent of mad cow disease.<P>

   Though the risk of getting the disease through transfusion is almost nil, chief pediatrician Dr. Robert Haslam said the trust of the public was at stake.<P>

   "We debated the pros and cons of telling the parents," he said during a news conference Friday. "Let me tell you, there was a lot of debate."<P>

   The hospital decided to warn parents because "it was the ethical thing to do," Haslam said, adding that other hospitals should follow Toronto's example.<P>

   Already, 80 parents who received letters have called on the hospital's hotline. "They're very angry and they are very anxious," Haslam said.<P>

   The blood products were used at the hospital between 1989 and July 1995, the same month the Red Cross learned of the donor. That prompted the largest blood recall in the agency's history in Canada.<P>

   The Red Cross has been deluged with calls about the virus, as it struggled to cope with fallout from a continuing judicial inquiry into how thousands of Canadians were infected with AIDS and hepatitis C in the 1980s.<P>

   Many Canadians -- mostly hemophiliacs who must use blood products -- have already received warning letters from their doctors. In Alberta, for example, the Calgary Regional Health Authority sent letters last year to 1,000 people who received blood products.<P>

   A Calgary man who received one of those letters later died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but officials stressed they could not link the death with tainted blood products.  <I>[[If the odds are 6 in 1,000,000 of getting CJD in 6 years, actually the odds of 1 in 1,000 getting the disease is very remote -- webmaster]]</I><P>

   Hospital officials say there has never been a documented case of someone getting the disease through a blood transfusion. <I>[[No surprise -- there is no conceivable way that this could be documented -- webmaster]]</I><P>

   Creutzfeldt Jakob is very rare, afflicting just one in a million people. Symptoms, which can take up to 30 years to develop, include loss of co-ordination and dementia. Death occurs about seven months after symptoms appear. No one knows what causes it, and there is no test to detect it. The only way to tell whether someone has the disease is to examine their brain after they die.<P>

   In March, the British government admitted that people may risk contracting the disease if they eat beef from cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.<P>

<h3>MAD COW DISEASE:  A SOBERING "WAKE UP CALL"?</h3>
The WellnessWise Journal ... April 14, 1996
<p>

Copyright 1996 by David J. DeRose, MD, MPH

<p>

"Mad Cow Disease" grabbed headlines in late March 1996 when a group of

prestigious British Scientists were constrained to admit that the fatal

disease could possibly be transmitted to humans.  The news brought the

British meat industry to a virtual standstill.   English folk avoided the

meat markets.  The European Union and a cascade of other countries banned

British beef.

<p>

Referred to as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) by the medical

community, the illness is aptly named.  The designation makes it clear that

we are talking about a brain disease (encephalopathy) that affects cows

(bovine).  Furthermore, the disease riddles the afflicted cow's brain with

tiny holes--causing it to look like a sponge under a microscope (thus

rendering the brain "spongiform").  The lay term, "mad cow disease," in

addition to being much easier to pronounce, also conveys the fact that

infected cows may develop mental deterioration and behavioral abnormalities.

<p>

First diagnosed in Britain in 1986, BSE has powerful emotional appeal.  It is

one of a group of fatal brain diseases that can be transmitted from one

living creature to another.  These diseases are technically called

"transmissible encephalopathies."  Many British consumers had apparently

comforted themselves for years with the thought that it was unlikely for such

a disease to spread from cows to humans.  However, even before March 1996, I

would guess that scientists who were aware of this fatal cattle disease

would--if honest--have to admit to some level of discomfort.  After all,

transmissible encephalopathies affect many other creatures besides cattle.

 Some 16 or18 animal species have been documented to come down with diseases

that resemble BSE.  Many or all of those species can apparently get a

BSE-like disease from eating infected cattle meat.  Furthermore, cattle

themselves likely contracted the disease from a different species.  Most

researchers believe that BSE was introduced into British cattle herds by

feeding them dead sheep carcasses which were infected with a similar illness

called "scrapie."  (The sheep disease gets its name from the fact that

afflicted sheep can become mentally unstable and literally "scrape" the wool

off their hide.)

<a name="targ_3">

<h3>HUMANS CAN GET TRANSMISSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHIES</h3>

<p>

However, it is not only animals that can contract transmissible

encephalopathies.  Humans can also get them.  A disease called

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) can be thought of as a type of <A NAME="Alz"><B>fast acting

Alzheimer's disease</B></A>.  This is an extremely rare illness that has typically

occurred in older individuals.  I have personally only seen one patient with

this rare and fatal disease.  

<p>

We know from cannibalistic tribes in New Guinea, that a disease like CJD is

transmissible to humans.  There, at one time, the dead were honored through

ritual cannibalistic rites.  Children typically ate the brains of their

deceased parents during these rituals.   Many of them did get a disease

called "kuru" which is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy similar (if

not the same as) CJD.  The disease sometimes took up to 30 years to develop.

 Young children who engaged in these cannibalistic practices tended to

develop the illness sooner than their older siblings or peers who also

consumed infected brains.  

<p>

Many scientists had speculated that if sheep could transmit the disease to

beef, beef could transmit the disease to humans.  In fact even in the United

States, a country which claims to have no evidence of BSE, there have been

reports that are less than comforting.  For example, an outbreak of a related

illness, Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy occurred on a Wisconsin mink farm.

 It was discovered that the mink illness was likely related to that farmer's

practice of feeding them local "<A NAME="downer"><B>downer</B></A>" dairy cows.  This is a designation

for cows that either are so ill that they fall down and can not get up, or

actually are found dead on the farm.  Deemed unfit for human consumption,

such cows have been used for animal feed among other things.  In this case,

the carcasses found their way into the minks' diets.

<p>

The mink outbreak provided another example of probable BSE infecting other

species.  (The link could not be made definitely since the "downer cow or

cows" that were fed to the mink were not autopsied.)  It also raised another

concern:  countries like the US who think they have nothing to worry about,

may in fact have diseased animals in their herds.  

<p>

Despite assurances from the USDA that BSE has not crossed the Atlantic, the

mink story leaves us with an uncomfortable feeling.  However, there is even

more disturbing news.  Laboratory research has demonstrated that different

strains of prions do exist.  For example, a British researcher found that

when he injected the prions from an infected group of goats into mice, those

mice developed an encephalopathy (brain disease) characterized by drowsiness.

 The prions from a different group of infected goats also caused brain

disease when injected into mice; however, instead of becoming lethargic, the

diseased mice turned hyperactive!  The message was clear:  there were

apparently at least two different strains of scrapie-like illness in goats.

 When transmitted to another species (in this case the mice) the infected

rodents came down with one or the other of these two very different looking

diseases.

<p>

Such research has raised an important question.  If scrapie in goats could

give rise to different appearing diseases in mice, could sheep scrapie result

in more than one type of cow disease?  There is some suggestion that this

could be the case.  There may well be more than one strain or type of BSE.

 The different types may cause different looking diseases.  Some who have

been studying links between cattle and mink disease in the US, have raised

the concern that BSE is present in America, but "looks different" than the

British variant due to a different BSE strain.  Specifically, the <B><A NAME="bse">BSE in the

US</A></B> may be one cause of "downer cow" disease rather than its "mad cow" cousin

in England.

<a name="targ_4">

<h3>FINALLY TAKING NOTICE</h3>

<p>

It was Creutzfeldt-Jakob statistics that really got the medical community's

attention in March 1996.  By that time some eight young Britons had succumbed

to this devastating illness.  The unusual occurrence of the disease in young

people combined with a different pattern to the sponge-like brain

destruction, prompted leading British scientists to raise the concern that

BSE may be the source of a new variant of CJD.  Further thickening the plot

was the occurrence of a worrisome cluster of CJD in British dairy farmers.

<p>

The biggest concern, of course, is that we are just glimpsing the tip of that

proverbial iceberg.  One prominent researcher is putting estimates of

BSE-related CJD well into the thousands.  And the problem does not appear to

be confined to Britain.  There are worrisome reports now from France and

Italy.  Still others are raising concerns that some cases of "Alzheimer's"

may actually be spongiform encephalopathy.  Granted, all of these conjectures

may not prove true; but what if just some of them are?  Even if only in part?

<a name="targ_5">

<h3>PRIONS:  FRIGHTENING CARRIERS OF DISEASE</h3>

<p>

Adding to the fear of this relatively newly appreciated disease is the nature

of the BSE infectious agent.  Many animal borne diseases are caused by

bacteria or viruses.  Risk from these illnesses can often be decreased or

eliminated by a combination of careful washing, refrigeration and thorough

cooking.  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, however, appears to be caused by

an unusual infectious agent known as a "prion" (pronounced "pree-on").

 Prions are truly very unusual infectious agents.  They have no genetic

material and consist entirely of protein.  Research suggests that these prion

proteins are similar in structure to proteins that occur naturally in the

brains of humans and other animals.  The prions differ from those similar

normal proteins, however, in their three dimensional shape.  Prions seem to

cause disease by coming into contact with those normal proteins and then

stimulating them to change their shape to mimic the prion protein.  This

change in shape appears to set up a chain reaction.  Normal proteins change

their shape to look like the prion proteins and then later influence

neighboring proteins to do the same.  The end result is a progressively

devastating and ultimately fatal disease.  No treatment has yet been

discovered.

<p>

Making the picture even bleaker is the resiliency of prions.  They are not

destroyed by the usual means used to kill infectious agents.  They are

resistant even to boiling at temperatures as high as 250 degrees Celsius

(well over 400 degrees Fahrenheit).  They are also resistant to ionizing

radiation.

<p>

Prion related diseases are also extremely difficult to diagnose.  There is no

way to do a blood test for BSE and an infected animal does not mount any

immune response to the infection.  Tell-tale signs of diseases like BSE are

usually only possible to diagnose at autopsy.  However, not all infected

animals necessarily have the characteristic sponge-like brain changes.  Of

particular concern, animals who carry the disease and have not yet developed

signs of BSE, may not show the characteristic brain involvement.  

<a name="targ_6">

<h3>WHAT ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE FREE OF PRIONS?</h3>

<p>

Of even more concern is the fact that we do not know which tissues could

carry the infection.  Most of the focus of late has been on beef.  This is

warranted.  Although organ tissue carries the greatest risk, animal studies

do suggest that meat itself can transmit prion-related diseases.  However, we

cannot exclude the possibility that milk could also carry disease-inducing

prions.  Many may recall how some years ago assurances were given that a

mother could not pass HIV to her child by nursing.  Of course, we now know

that HIV can be transmitted in breast milk.   Granted, prion diseases are

vastly different than HIV.  The risk from <A NAME="milk">milk</A> (if it does exist) does appear

to be much smaller than from eating beef or cattle organ tissues.

 Nonetheless, a British BSE expert has pointed out that there has been at

least one human case that suggests passage of prions in milk.  This was the

case of a woman dying with CJD who demonstrated the infectious agent in her

colostrum (the type of breast milk made in the initial days following

delivery).  

<p>

Eating the flesh of other animals (besides cows) or drinking their milk may

not be safe either.  These other animals may also be affected with a

prion-related diseases.  As we have already mentioned, sheep as well as goats

can become infected with such illnesses.  Even if some of these illnesses do

not seem to be easily transmitted to humans (because of what is often called,

"the species barrier"), the possibility exists that different strains of

prions could present more danger.  

<a name="targ_7">

<h3>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p>

There is one other very important aspect that needs to be reemphasized.

 These transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have extremely long

incubation periods.  (This is the technical term for how long it takes for a

person with the infection to actually show signs of the disease)  As already

mentioned, in humans, there is evidence that kuru can take up to 30 years to

manifest itself.  This is likely to be the same with CJD.  With BSE, it may

take up to 6-8 years or more before infected cows show signs of the disease.

 The important implication is that thousands of animals and humans may now be

infected yet not develop symptoms for many years.

<p>

The current British proposal to slaughter all older cows <B><A NAME="inadequate">may not go far

enough</A></B>.  If younger cows are infected they may not yet show any signs of the

disease.  However, an infected cow can theoretically transmit the illness

whether or not it has yet developed symptomatic disease.  The widely

publicized 1988 ban on feeding dead sheep parts to British cattle did not

stop the epidemic.  When the statistics were reviewed in a 1995 report, over

half of all the British cattle that had developed BSE were born after the ban

was implemented.  The important message is that young cows may be infected,

and may be able to transmit disease to humans.

<a name="targ_8">

<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p>

The Consumers' Association , an independent British "watchdog group", has

been quoted as saying that the only way to avoid BSE risk would be to stop

eating beef all together.  Others are saying even more.  Some are suggesting

that the time has come to recognize that disease in animals has become so

rampant that we all need to seriously consider becoming vegetarians.  They

point out that BSE is just one of many fatal diseases linked to animals.

 Literally hundreds of deaths have been documented in the US alone from a

host of animal related infections.  Some of the most significant causative

agents may not yet be household words, however most will recognize at least

one of them:  salmonella, listeria, campylobacter, and yersinia.  Of course,

we can't forget that the risk of dying prematurely from the Western World's

two leading killers, cancer and heart disease, generally rises with

increasing consumption of animal products.

<p>

If there is even a small chance of getting a severe fatal disease, some are

suggesting it would be prudent to avoid all animal products.  But maybe a few

other questions are more important.  What is the next transmissible disease

in animals that will be recognized?  Do I want to wait for tragedy to strike

me or someone close to me--or have I already had warning enough?

<a name="targ_9">

<h3>APPENDIX:  IS IT ALREADY TOO LATE?</h3>

<p>

If you have been eating beef and using other animal products for years is it

already too late?  The answer is clearly, "no."  In the case of human prion

related diseases, there is evidence that the total amount of prion exposure

affects the incubation period of the disease.  In other words, someone who

eats a large amount of prion containing foods may develop the disease in 10

years or less, while someone with moderate, yet significantly less, exposure

may develop the condition in 15-20 years.  Another with still smaller

exposure may not come down with the illness for 30 or more years.

<p>

Thus, even if someone was doomed to come down with a condition like CJD

(because of previous exposure to prions), it may be possible to delay the

onset of the disease significantly.  And don't forget:  a diet that moves

away from animal products can also dramatically help you decrease your risk

of other diseases like heart disease and cancer.

<P>

 THE Agriculture Ministry yesterday dismissed claims that "mad cow" disease (BSE) could be carried in milk and denied that ministry scientists were conducting new tests.

<P>

The claims, published in a newspaper report yesterday, were untrue, a ministry spokesman said. "We are happy that milk is safe, the Spongiform Encepalopathy Advisory Committee (Seac) is happy, and the Chief Medical Officer is happy," he said. The ministry bases its confidence on research carried out by scientists from the Institutes for Animal Health in Edinburgh and Newbury, Berkshire, and the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey. The results were published in the <I>Veterinary Record</I> in June 1995.

<P>

The team fed milk from cows with BSE to mice for 40 days, then observed the mice for a further two years. They also injected milk from a BSE-infected cow into the brains and skin of mice, a route that is far more likely to cause infection. These mice, too, were observed for up to two years.

<P>

No signs of the disease appeared in any of the mice, the team reported. The amount of milk the mice were given to drink was equivalent to a human being drinking a pint of milk a day from an infected cow for almost seven years. <B>Dr Haresh Narang, a scientist who has been a persistent critic of the ministry over BSE, described these tests as "worthless"</B>. He says that milk should have been fed not to mice, which cannot drink a great deal of it, but to mink, which can consume as much as the average baby.

<P>

However, the fact that infection was not passed on through injected material suggests that milk is safe. The injection route is estimated to be 20,000 times more efficient than the oral route in causing infection. The same strain of mice injected with other organs from infected cows, such as brain and spinal cord, have developed the disease.

 Reuter Information Service ... Aug 4, 1996
<P>    LONDON - A British government spokesman denied on Sunday that fresh tests had been ordered into the safety of milk after a newspaper reported fears that it could become infected with mad cow disease.


    The Observer newspaper said government scientists were conducting urgent tests to ascertain whether cow's milk could be infected with Mad cow disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Earlier tests were unreliable, it said.<P>

    A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry described the report as "absolute rubbish."

    "The scientific advisory committee are completely satisfied by the safety of milk," he said, adding that no new tests had been recommended and none was being carried out.

    The government admitted for the first time last week that it had evidence the disease could be transmitted from a cow to its calves, or at least to the last-born calf of an infected cow.

    However, it is not clear exactly how the disease is transmitted. The Observer said milk might play a part.<P>

    The government has already had to concede this year that humans can contract Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from eating beef infected with BSE, and that sheep can get BSE.

    It maintains there is no evidence that BSE can be passed on through milk.

    Previous tests have found that the infective agent was not present even in milk from cows with BSE, but the Observer said some scientists had dismissed these earlier experiments as "poor and inconclusive."<P>

    Microbiologist Stephen Dealler, who first warned of the possibility of BSE being passed to humans, was quoted as calling the experiments "appalling."

   <B> "I would certainly expect there to be some degree of infectivity in milk, although it would be a very small amount," he told the Observer.</B><HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Listserve">Listserve</A> Commentary</CENTER></H3>


8.4.96
<P>

In an interview for Radio France International today (Saturday) Richard
Lacey explained that the "demonstrated" maternal transmission of BSE
should be cause for increased alarm for people in Britain, as it can only
mean that the agent is in the blood, and thus countless people are still
unkowingly being exposed to it.  A "risk" of 15% was mentioned, although
the exact significance of this figure was not made clear.<HR>

It is reported in the Observer today that there have been
five assays for infectivity in milk, with negative findings;  Only the two published. The Observer also reports that MAFF Central
Veterinary Laboratory have tests under way  feeding milk to calves and
<B>the first results are due in October</B>. 
<P>
No previous information about
this has been mentioned, as far as I am aware, but presumably this
means that <B>the tests must have begun back in 1989.</B> I shall
try to find out tomorrow how they know that the calves in question
were not already incubating BSE.

<P>


<B>Blood Banking :</B> 


The Canadian Red Cross Society, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, has initiated the largest recall of blood products in its history in
response to learning that two blood donors were diagnosed with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CID). 

The initial withdrawal was announced on July 12, 1995, the day after the medical director of the Red Cross Vancouver
Center received information that a blood donor had been diagnosed with probable CJD. The second precautionary
withdrawal was initiated on July 18, 1995, when the Red Cross learned that a donor from Toronto also was diagnosed with
probable CJD. <P>


The Canadian Red Cross is withdrawing all plasma derivative products made from plasma pools containing blood from these
donors. The few units of fresh blood components (red cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma) still in the system were
removed immediately. 

The Red Cross withdrawal of plasma products is proceeding well, indicated Dr. M.T. Aye, Canadian Red Cross National
Director, Blood Services. 

"All the hospitals who received plasma products from us have been notified of the lot numbers of affected Factor-1, IVIG
and 25 percent albumin," said Aye. "The affected products - except for 25 percent albumin - have been quarantined in
most hospitals. Arrangements are being made to return the products to our blood centers, where they will be destroyed." <P>

Aye confirmed that only 25 percent albumin, used to treat shock and bum victims, were expected to be in short supply
until the new shipments were scheduled to arrive within a few days. 

In its withdrawal notice to customers, the Red Cross indicated that due to a serious shortage of 25 percent albumin in
Canada, the product was not being withdrawn until new shipments arrived. The Red Cross cautioned customers that if the
25 percent albumin product was used, patients must be informed of the theoretical risks associated with its use. The
agency also cautioned that elective surgery requiring 25 percent albumin should be seriously reconsidered in view of the
recent development. <P>

CJD is extremely rare. Worldwide, one case in 1,000,000 is reported. First described in the 1920s, CID is believed to be
caused by an infectious protein or virus. No blood test is available to detect CID. 

Aye noted that available epidemiological data do not support the transmission of CJD by transfusion of blood or plasma
products. In addition, CJD has not been reported more frequently among patients who required administration of blood
components or plasma derivatives (even among patients who received multiple transfusions) than among the general
population. 

However, other human tissue transplant material, including corneas and brain-associated membrane, does transmit CJD,
and the disease has been transmitted to animals by blood from a person with the disease. In addition, CID has been
transmitted to individuals treated with human pituitary-derived growth hormone. <P>

"While there have been no reported cases of transmission by transfusion, in the past there have been reported cases of
CJD caused by injection of human growth hormone. That's why the Red Cross donor health assessment questionnaire
specifically asks volunteer donors if they have been treated with human growth hormone," Aye stated. 

Aye stressed that the risk is theoretical "But there are unknowns, " he added. 'These have helped guide our actions." <P>

The recall includes 10,557 vials of 25 percent albumin and 8,352 vials of 5 percent albumin. It also includes 5,496
vials of IVIG, which is used for transplants, for patients deficient in gamma globulin and for patients with autoimmune
disorders. The recall also includes 3,865,780 units of Factor-I, used to treat hemophiliacs. <P>

The voluntary withdrawal involved plasma derivative products that were manufactured by Bayer Inc., North Carolina. 

Because plasma from donors is pooled in the manufacturing process, a donation can affect a large number of vials and units,
indicated Aye. 

"To put this in context, depending on the product, each lot will be made of anywhere from 15,000 to 180,000 donations.
For this reason we lost the equivalent of about 60,000 liters of albumin production, " Aye stated. <P>

In its search for replacement albumin products, the Canadian Red Cross turned to suppliers in the United States that are
licensed in Canada. The search yielded sufficient new product to bring Canada's supply up to two months' reserve in the
agency's national office and one month's reserve in the blood centers. Aye noted that this is the customary supply. 

Among the next steps, the Red Cross is finding and collecting withdrawn products and working with hospitals to notify
recipients. <P>

Each year in Canada there are 300,000 recipients of fractionated blood products. In order for Canada to be self sufficient
and end its reliance on foreign blood products, it needs to collect 400,000 liters of plasma, indicated Angela Prokopiak,
communications officer for the Canadian Red Cross Society. 

Currently, Canada collects 200,000 liters of plasma recovered through whole blood donations. Stand-alone plasma centers<P>
will collect the additional 200,000 liters required to attain self sufficiency. <P>

Prokopiak indicated that based on projections for the demand of products, between five and seven stand-alone plasma
centers will be required to collect the additional plasma required. The plasma collected from these centers, combined with
plasma recovered from the whole blood program, is expected to make Canada self sufficient. She added that the Canadian
fractionation plant being developed in Bedford, N.S., is scheduled for licensing in 1999, by which time the agency expects
the country to be fully self sufficient in terms of its plasma requirements. <P>

During the upcoming weeks, the Canadian Red Cross, Health Canada and the Canadian Blood Agency will be reflecting on the
operational and policy issues that arise from the current recall efforts. 

Canadian Red Cross officials stated that this situation proves the value of the master agreement on roles and
responsibilities in Canada' s national blood supply program that was signed April between the provinces and territories,
the Canadian Blood Agency and the Canadian Red Cross. 

That agreement between the Canadian Red Cross Society and the Canadian Blood Agency (CBA) was designed to restructure
future Red Cross funding and end the Red Cross' monopoly on the supply of blood and blood products. <P>

"The CBA, the Red Cross and various provincial health ministers all argued that the new arrangement will provide fro
greater safety within the Canadian blood system because it clearly delineates the various responsibilities and so should
prevent the sort of confusion that surrounded Canada's delay in responding to HIV-contamination of the transfusion system
during the mid-1980s," Wayne Kondro had reported ("New Arrangement for Canada's Blood," the Lancet, April 22,
1995;345:1039). <P>

In the <A NAME="United">United</A> States, a similar recall of blood products potentially contaminated by CJD occurred in the fall of 1994. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not issued a final decision regarding retrieval of blood products affected
by possible CJD contamination. However, the FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee had recommended product retrieval
of blood components contaminated by a donor with CJD and the notification of consignees and recipients who received
products. The committee members noted that while little risk of transmission exists, it is not zero risk. <P>

In the U.S., the advisory committee had met to discuss the issue of plasma-derived products contaminated by CJD after the
American Red Cross discovered that two blood donors from the United States were diagnosed post-mortem with CJD, a rare
neurodegenerative disease. 

During October and November 1994 the American Red Cross had initiated a voluntary withdrawal of in-data single donor
blood components and issued a hold on all plasma derivative products that were in its inventory. In addition, the American
Red Cross withdraw certain lots of plasma derivatives. In November 1994 Miles and Baxter Healthcare initiated voluntary
withdrawals of plasma products manufactured from intermediates purchased from the 'American Red Cross. <P>

Also in the fall of 1994, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation initiated a voluntary withdrawal of certain lots of its
intravenous immunoglobulin, Sandoglobulin, that were distributed in the United States. Sandoz officials had stated that the
company instituted the withdrawal as a precautionary measure promptly after receiving information from the
manufacturer of Sandoglobulin, the Swiss Red Cross, that a small quantity of the blood used to produce the lots was donated
by an individual who was diagnosed with CJD. <P>

The market withdrawal on the part of the American Red Cross that occurred during late 1994 was in cooperation with
Baxter Healthcare Corporation, which manufactures Red Cross plasma products. Miles Inc. also initiated voluntary
withdrawal of certain lots of its plasma-derived product Prolastin (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor [human]) because some
of residual plasma used in the manufacture of Prolastin had come from the CJD- infected donor.

The Blood Products Advisory Committee for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Rockville, Maryland,
recommended that plasma-derived products from recovered plasma not be retrieved due to post-donation information
revealing contamination by a donor with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). 

The committee also recommended that the notification to all consignees and recipients of such products also is unnecessary. <P>


The Blood Products Advisory Committee, a group of outside experts who provide advice to the FDA on blood-related issues
voted ten to three with two abstentions on the above recommendation at the committee' s December 15, 1994, meeting,
indicated FDA spokesperson Monica Revelle. 

Revelle stated that the FDA has not issued a final decision regarding retrieval of blood products affected by possible CJD
contamination. 

Committee member Kenneth Anderson, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute had indicated that while some animal data
supported the withdrawal of cellular components, in the case of noncellular blood products, there has been no evidence for
retrieval. <P>


However, the committee recommended product retrieval of blood components contaminated by a donor with CJD and the
notification of consignees and recipients who received products. The committee members noted that while little risk of
transmission exists, it is not zero risk. <P>


The committee met to discuss the issue of plasma-derived products contaminated by CJD after the American Red Cross
discovered that two blood donors were diagnosed post-mortem with CJD, a rare neurodegenerative disease. During October
and November 1994 the American Red Cross initiated a voluntary withdrawal of in-data single donor blood components and
issued a hold on all plasma derivative products that were in its inventory. In addition, the American Red Cross withdraw
certain lois of plasma derivatives. In November 1994 Miles and Baxter Healthcare initiated voluntary withdrawals of
plasma products manufactured from intermediates purchased from the American Red Cross. <P>


Also in the fall of 1994, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation initiated a voluntary withdrawal of certain lots of its
intravenous immunoglobulin, Sandoglobulin, that were distributed in the United States. Sandoz officials had stated the
company instituted the withdrawal as a precautionary measure promptly after receiving information from the
manufacturer of Sandoglobulin, the Swiss Red Cross, thai a small quantity of the blood used to produce the lots was donated
by an individual who was diagnosed with CJD. <P>


At the December 1994 meeting the Blood Products Advisory Committee was presented with data on the transmissibility of
CJD through transfusion by advisers from the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research Division of
Transfusion-Transmitted Diseases and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). The existing data suggest
that any risk of transmission of CJD by blood products is extremely small and currently unmeasurable. A CDC official had
indicated that the agency is unaware of documented cases of CJD due to transfusion of contaminated blood products and
described the risk as theoretical. <P>


The market withdrawal on the part of the American Red Cross that occurred during late 1994 was in cooperation with
Baxter Healthcare Corporation, which manufactures Red Cross plasma products. Miles Inc. also initiated voluntary
withdrawal of certain lots of its plasma-derived product Prolastin (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor [human]) because some
of residual plasma used in the manufacture of Prolastin had come from the CJD- infected donor. 

American Red Cross officials at that time had stressed that CJD has never been shown to be transmitted by the transfusion
of blood components or through plasma derivatives, and that the Red Cross decided to be ultra conservative and withdraw
the plasma products, keeping them quarantined until the outcome of the FDA meeting. <P>


While CJD does not appear to be a bloodborne disorder, the disease has been transmitted to humans following contact with
brain or other tissue from infected patients. This theoretic concern prompted withdrawal of the affected plasma products. 

FDA officials noted that in the United States the incidence of CID is less than one case per one million people a year and that
the incidence rate is not different among patients who have received blood components and the general population. CJ-D has
been transmitted to patients who received certain human tissue transplant material, including corneas and
brain-associated membrane, and to individuals treated with human pituitary-derived growth hormone. The Red Cross
screens blood donors who may be carrying CJD by preventing from donating blood people who have received human
pituitary-derived growth hormone in the past. 

Currently there is no test for C J-D, Revelle noted.

<H3><CENTER>Ag-Can's mad cow <A NAME="crackdown">crackdown</A> </CENTER></H3>

By Toni Owen Carter
<P>


<I>One case of the disease in Alberta prompts a ruthless response:</I><BR>


The world first became aware of the mysterious malady dubbed mad cow disease
in 1986, when it swept across farms in England and Ireland paralysing and
killing cattle. The fear that it was contagious decimated the British cattle
industry as 15 countries imposed import bans, and there were terrifying
rumours of UK farmers catching the "brain-eating" disease from their
animals. Now Canadian officials are scrambling to protect their
billion-dollar industry from a similar reaction after the first case of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in North America was discovered on an
Alberta farm last month.<P>


The UK outbreak has been traced to infected sheep offal used in protein
supplements fed to cattle. Experts insist that mad cow disease is not
transmissible to humans or other cattle, but it still has tremendous power
to spook the industry. In the wake of the Alberta discovery, Mexico
immediately slapped an embargo on imports of Canadian cattle, threatening
trade worth $13 million a year. The ban was lifted last Friday, after
Mexican officials were reassured by the swift, ruthless action taken by
Agriculture Canada.<P>

Dr. Stan Petran, Alberta director of animal health for Ag-Canada, won't
divulge the name or location of the affected rancher except to say that he
is based in central Alberta. He imported eight purebred English calves in
1987. On November 21, he discovered one of his cows was unable to get up.
Assuming it had a broken leg, he shot it, but then notified officials after
he realized from the ear tag that it was one of the English imports. <P>

"After Canada banned British imports on February 9, 1990, we identified 175
animals that had already been brought here between 1982 and then," says Dr.
Petran, a Calgary-based veterinarian. "Our surveillance program has been to
examine all of them annually and to ask the owners to contact us if there
was anything unusual." Government labs in Lethbridge and Ontario found holes
in the brain of the dead import characteristic of the fatal degenerative
disorder. To be certain, the government flew a scientist with a sample to
England for confirmation.<P>

Five of the remaining cows from the original import herd in Alberta were
also destroyed and incinerated, three from the same farm and one each from
farms in the north and south. Tests on the five proved negative for BSE,
according to Ag-Canada. Nonetheless, the department intends to eradicate the
remainder of the U.K. imports altogether. There are 67 of them scattered
across the country. Moreover, the five immediate offspring of the
BSE-infected cow will also be killed, as will all of its in vitro progeny,
thought to number around 14. In addition, officials are expected to decide
next week whether to destroy all the remaining 270 head on the BSE- infected
farm. Farmers will receive compensation of up to $2,000 a head for their
purebred animals.<P>

Industry and government officials insist their comprehensive action has
reassured Canada's 49 cattle-trading partners. Though they won't say so, the
actions appear to go much farther than was strictly necessary to control the
disease. All the scientific evidence to date shows that BSE is not
contagious. "100,000 cattle have been diagnosed in England since 1986, " says
Dr. Petran. "BSE has now been widely studied, and there is no proof at all
that it spreads from animal to animal, mother to offspring or animal to
human."<P>

Dr. John Waters, director of communicable diseases and epidemiology for
Alberta Health, says BSE is similar to a group of animal and human diseases
known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In humans, it is called
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, which occurs in one or two individuals per
million. Two English farmers died of CJD after drinking raw milk from cows
found to be infected with BSE, but Dr. Waters maintains there is no reason
to presume a cause and effect. "There is no evidence that it was transmitted
from the animals, and since the incubation period is 15 years or more, the
English cases wouldn't have occurred that quickly."<P>

The agent that causes BSE is similar to a centuries-old sheep disease called
scrapie. It is transmissible from sheep to sheep, but was only transmitted
to UK cattle when they were fed scrapie-infected protein supplements in the
1980s. New outbreaks have dwindled since the practice was banned in 1988.

The as-yet unidentified agent that causes BSE destroys brain cells of mature
animals, affecting co-ordination and causing behaviour changes. It was
dubbed mad cow disease because 5% to 10% of afflicted animals become
aggressive toward their herdmates and human caretakers. Dr. Petran calls it
an entirely new disease. "Nobody's seen it," he says. "It is neither a virus
nor a bacteria. It behaves like a virus, but is highly resistant to heat, so
it escaped destruction in the rendering process."<P>

Dr. Waters says a related disease called Kuru devastated tribal populations
in Papua New Guinea until cannibals were convinced to stop eating their dead
30 years ago. Even though it is classed as a transmissible disease and lab
workers who handled contaminated samples have been infected, Dr. Waters says
it is not spread easily. "Whatever causes it is smaller and less complex
than a virus," he says, "but it is species-specific."<P>

 SUMMARY

Two key stages (or unit processes) in the manufacturing process of GELATIN were
assessed for their ability to inactivate scrapie and thus any related agents.


These selected stages from within the process were challenged separately with high tiae
scrapie agent, ME7. Samples were collected following processing through each stage
and were titrated in log10 dilutions in mice to assay for scrapie infectivity.

The first stage involved an acid treatment (demineralisation) step and samples were
collected after 24 h and 48 h incubation at 10 to 12 oC. The second stage involved a
lime treatment step and samples were collected after 5, 20 and 45 days incubation at 10
to 12 oC.

The amount of infectious agent found in each sample was compared to the initial scrapie
spike used for challenge in order to determine the level of clearance achieved by the 2
unit processing steps involved in the scaled-down manufacture of GELATIN.

Based on clinical and selected pathological assessment the titre of ME7 used for
challenge was 8.2 log10 ID50 ml-1. The total spike used for challenging each stage was
8.2 log10 ID50 ml-1. Some random deaths occurred which were due to trauma of inoculation
or non-scrapie associated illness.

Clinical results were confirmed in a represenrative number of mice by pathological
examination and from these results the clearance factors for the longest incubation times

                         INTRODUCTION

The study was performed to determine the ability of 2 unit processes of the scaled-down
manufacturing process of GELATIN to inactivate scrapie. ME7 in C57 B1/6 mice was
the chosen model, as this mouse adapted strain of scrapie has been thoroughly analysed
and exhibits similar physicochemical characteristics to the agent that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.

The use of scrapie as a model for bovine spongiforn encephalopathy  and the
confirmation of scrapie infection by pathological evaluation is accepted by Regulatory
Authorities in the EC.

The validation procedure was carried out according to the EC CPMP Ad Hoc Working
Party on Biotechnology/Pharmacy Notes for Guidance entitled 'Validation of Virus
Removal and Inactivation Procedures' (August 1991) and 'Guidelines for Minimising the
Risk of Transmission from Animals to Man of Agents causing Spongiform
Encephalopathies via Medicinal Products' (May 1992) and the Federal Bulletin No. 40
issued by the German Federal Ministry of Health entitled 'Guidelines on Safety
Measures in Connection with Medicinal Products Containing Body Materials from
Cattle, Sheep or Goats for Minimising the Risk of Transmission of BSE
(February 1994)'.

Due to the serious practical limitations in attempting to simulate the GELATIN
manufacturing process on small scale suitable for scrapie challenge studies it was
proposed to study directly the effect on the scrapie agent of (1) 4% hydrochloric acid
and (2) saturated lime solution, ie 2 key unit stages in the production of GELATIN.

These 2 stages from the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATlN were assessed
for their ability to inactivate scrapie by challenging with high titre scrapie agent and
collecting samples from pre-selected timepoints of the 2 unit processes. The processed

IRI 851180                  10


samples were assayed for remaining infectious agent by titration of log10 dilutions in
mice.

The amount of agent in each sample was compared to that used for the challenge in
order to determine the clearance of scrapie by each stage in the scaled-down
manufacturing process of GELATIN.   Calculation of the final clearance factor was
based on both clinical and selected pathological assessment. Clinical scrapie symptoms
were confirmed by pathological examination of a representative number of mice.

                EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

STARTING MATERIAL
No starting materials were provided by the Sponsor because of the serious practical
limitations in attempting to simulate the GELATIN manufacturing process on a small
scale suitable for scrapie challenge studies. In this study the scrapie agent was exposed
to 2 unit process extraction conditions.

TEST SCRAPIE AGENT

ME7 if a clonally purified strain of scrapie adapted for the mouse model which in the
presence of the sinc S7 genotype gives rise to a short but controlled incubation of
murine scrapie. The agent is physicochemically stable and stimulates no protective host
response to infection. Positive diagnosis is by microscopic examination of pathological
lesions in brain tissue which show themselves as non-inflammatory, vacuolar
degeneration of grey matter areas of the brain. The ME7 agent, which originates from
a strain of scrapie found in the Suffolk breed of sheep, was obtained from the institute
for Animal Health, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

Eleven intracerebral mouse brain passage of the ME7 agent were performed. The first
2 passages were in random bred mice from the Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh. 
UK, with subsequent passages  in C57 B1/6 mice. High dilution cloning passages were
performed at seventh (2 x 10^-7) and eighth (10^-7) passage, with other passages at 10^-2
10^-3 and 10^-4.

ANIMALS

C57 B1/6 mice were obtained 3_6 weeks of age from Charles River (UK) Limited, Kent,
United Kingdom. These mice are homozygous for the S7 allele of the sinc gene. The

IRI 851180                   12


sinc gene has a profound effect on the incubation period of scrapie disease and the S7
allele denotes a short incubation.

The mice were allowed to acclimatise for a minimum of 6 days before commencement
of testing and were then randomly allocated to treatment groups. Each mouse received a
unique ear mark and cage card identifying Project Number, Animal Number and
appropriate treatment group.

The mice were housed within a purpose built scrapie facility comprising barrier
maintained rooms. These facilities incorporate preset temperature controls with
continuous monitoring. As a routine precaution mice were dosed with terramycin in
their drinking water to curtail low levels of Tyzzer's disease, a common murine
bacterial infection. Mice were examined weekly up until 120 days post inoculation and
then they were examined daily.

PREPARATION OF ME7 AGENT STOCKS

Stock scrapie agent, strain ME7. was prepared from infected brains of C57 B1/6 mice.
The inoculum was a 1% homogenate of brain rissue in saline buffer containing scrapie
scrain ME7 at titres of approximately 10^7 ID50. An aliquot of 0.02 mi of this
homogenate was inoculated intracerebrally in C57 B1/6 mice and subsequent
manifestation of the disease followed 170 to 200 days post inoculation. Mice showing
clean clinical symptoms of scrapie infection were sacrificed. The brains were removed
aseptically and stored below -70 oC ready for use as spike material.

PREPARATION OF ME7 SPIKE MATERIAL PRIOR TO CHALLENGE

Eight brains infected with ME7 were pooled and then homogenised in 0.9 % Saline to
produce a 30% homogenate.

PROCESS VALIDATION: PROCEDURE 

The 2 key stages (or unit processes) to be validated for their ability to inactivate the
scrapie agent were as follows:

STAGE 1: Acid Demineralisation

1.   An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to 8.0 ml 4.5% (w/w)
hydrochloric acid to give a final acid concentration of 4.0 % . The mixture
was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 24 h with occasional
agitation.

2.   The acid was then neutralised to approximately pH 7.0 by the addition of
10 N sodium hydroxide (approximately 1.0 ml) prior to titration for
infectivicy. Fine adjustment of pH was done by adding 4N hydrochloric acid
and 1N sodium hydroxide.

3.  An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to 8.0 ml 4.5 % (w/w)
hydrochloric acid to give a final acid concentration of 4.0% . The mixture
was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 48 h for the treatment
incubation and neutralised as detailed above prior to titration for infectivity.


STAGE 2: -Lime Treatment

An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to a slurry of 0.3 g calcium
hydroxide in 8.0 ml water. The mixture was maintained at a temperature of
10 to 12 oC for 5 days with occasional agitation.


IRI 851180                   14


2.  An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to a slurry of 0.3 g calcium
hydroxide in 8.0 ml water. The mixture was maintained at a temperature of
10 to 12 oC for 20 days for the treatment incubation and neutralised as above
prior to titration for infectivity.

3.  An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculun was added to a slurry of 0.3 g calcium
hydroxide in 8.0 ml water. The mixture was maintained at a temperature of 
10 to 12 oC for 45 days for the treatment incubation and neutralised as above
prior to titration for infectivity.

4.  In all cases the lime was then neutralised to approximately pH 7.0 by
addition of 4 N hydrochloric acid (approximately 1.0 ml) prior to titration
for infectivity. (Fine adjustment of pH was done by adding 0.4 N
hydrochloric acid).

TITRATION IN MICE


Scrapie strain ME7 was assayed by titration in C57 B1/6 mice. The processed samples
and positive control were serially diluted 10-fold from undiluted down to the appropriate
dilution in 0.9 % (w/v) saline buffer (see Tables).

The positive control was used to determine the titre of the ME7 challenge. Inoculation
of samples was by intracerebral injection into C57 B1/6 mice.   The volume inoculated
was 0.05 ml for the processed sample dilutions, the positive control and negative
control. Fifteen mice inoculated with 0.9 % saline were used as a negative control in the
study.

During incubation the mice were examined weekly up until 120 days post inoculation
and then they were examined daily. This regular examination will continue over a 2
year period for the test sample mice, the positive control mice and negative control


IRI 851180                       15


mice. Mice in the study showing clinical signs of scrapie infection were sacrificed, their
brains were removed and stored ready for pathological examination.

Mice not required for determining endpoints were sacrificed early at the discretion of the
Study Director. All remaining mice in the study were sacrificed after 2 years, their
brains removed and stored as detailed above.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Initial diagnosis of scrapie infection was by observation of clinical signs of the disease.
Typically these signs include high stepping walk, rolling gait, hunched posture and
dragging rear end.

PATHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT.

At the end of the study selected mice from the test samples showing suspected clinical
signs of scrapie infection were pathologically assessed along with a random number of
negative clinically assessed mice from various dilution groups of the test sample mice.
Any mice assumed as borderline with regard to showing clinical signs of scrapie
infection were also selected for pathological assessment. Selected mice from the
endpoint dilution of the positive control mice and a limited number of the inoculated
negative control mice were also selected for examination. Mice given no definitive
ciinical assessment during the study were also selected for pathological evaluation of the
disease.

Following removal the brains  were embedded in wax and up to 5 x 5 microm sections
stained  with haematoxylin and eosin. The sections were scored for typical vacuolar
change using brightfield light microscopy.
       
IRI 851180                    16


The results confirmed the presence/absence of scrapie infection in mice selected for
pathological assessment. The presence/absence of scrapie infection in those mice not
selected for pathological assessment was based on clinical assessment only.


CALCULATION OF CLEARANCE FACTORS

Titres of scrapie agent were calculated using the Probit statistical analysis detailed by
D J Finney (1971).

Mice nor showing scrapie infection that died before 18 months post inoculation were not
included in the calculation. This was due to the problem of being unable to determine
tbe absence of scrapie infection with early murine mortality.


Probit analyses were carried out to determine the endpoint titration, ID50 of the different
samples including the positive control.

The data for each stage of the test and the positive control included the following:  
Different dilution factors of the processed sample; the number of times the sample
dilution was used (number of replicates); the observed number of infected mice
(response variable) at the end of the incubation period; the inocuIum size; the
internal dilution (optional): the volume of the original sample.

A probit analysis, using the statistical package SAS, transformed the percentage
fractional mortality values of the mice for each dilution factor and then performed a
linear regression on the transformed values against logarithmically transformed dilution
factors.

The goodness of fit of the probit model to the fractional mortality data was checked via
the Pearson chi-squared test statistic. In the case of a significant chi-squared test

IRI 851180                   17


statistic, the variances and covariances were adjusted by a heterogeneity factor.
Following this: the confidence intervals were not reported and the ID50 values should be
treated with caution.

Within each stage of the test, at least 2 dilution factors had to be present. Furthermore,
at least 2 of the dilution factors within each stage should show fractional mortalities, ie
there should be at least 2 dilutions that are not 0% or 1OO%. Where this was nor the
case, Berkson's modification was performed. This involved adding or subtracting 0.5 in
a symmetrical manner from the observed number of infected mice.

Whenever Berkson's modification was used no confidence limits were reported and the
ID50 values should be treated with caution.

If all the dilution factors present at any one stage of a test have equal fractional
mortalities then the ID50 cannot be calculated. This also applies if the fractional
mortalities become equal after Berkson's modification has been used.

Also, in any one stage of a test, if all the dilution factors have less than 50% mortality
or all have more than 50% mortality, the confidence limits will not be reported and the
ID50 value should be treated with caution.

The clearance factor of any individua/whole purification stage is defined by the CPMP
Note for Guidance as a ratio of the 'load in the starting material' to the 'load in the final
material'. The clearance factor is given in log10 and calculated according to the CPMP
(1991). It takes into account both the sample volume and the titre before and after the
purification step to be tested.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The processed samples were both found to be toxic in C57 B116 mice when  
administered undiluted.


The titre of scrapie used to spike the process was calculated using a statistical method
detailed by D J Finney (1971). The titre of the challenge scrapie spike was
8.2 log10 ID50 ml^-1 (Table 1).

During and/or shortly following inoculation of mice, both for the positive control and
test samples, deaths occurred in some dilution groups. These deaths were due to trauma
of inoculation and mice were replaced, where possible, to attain the required number per
dilution group.

Samples were taken during the acid treatment (24 h and 48 h) and lime treatment (5
days, 20 days and 45 days) process steps and serially titrated in mice. The mortality
figures used to calculate the ID50 endpoints are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Table 4 shows that none of the control mice (inoculated with 0.9% saline) showed any
evidence of scrapie infection and deaths occuring during the study were due to other
murine illnesses.              

The clearance factors calculated were based on clinical assessment and selected
pathological confirmation (Table 5).

The clearance factors calculated for the 2  stages are presented below.

               45 days           8.2               <3.4

ID50 = 50 % infectious dose endpoint

To generate a scrapie clearance factor, the residual infectivity measured after processing
was compared to the titre of scrapie agent used for challenge. In order to determine the
minimum clearance factor it was neccesary to assume that no deaths occurred due to
scrapie infections in the next dilution down from the last one examined.

A clearance factor of <2.4 log10 was obtained for the acid treatment (demineralisation)
Stage 1 of the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATIN. Additionally, a
clearance factor of <3.4 log10 war obtained for the lime Stage 2 of the scaled-down
manufacturing process of GELATIN.

CONCLUSION


The potential of the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATIN to inactivate
bovine spongiform encephalopathy was assessed by challenging 2 selected stages with
scrapie, a model for the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

Based on a combination of both clinical and selected pathological assessment of the mice
24 months after inoculation, the titre of the scrapie spike was 8.2 log10 ID50 ml^-1. A
total of 8.2 log10 ID50 was used to individually challenge 2 separate stages of the
process. Upon completion of the acid and lime treatment stages clearance factors of
<2.4 log10 and <3.4 log10 respectively were obtained.


The experimental design was such that no precise numerical values for clearance factors
could be assigned. This is partly attributable to the higher than expected  infectivity of
the inoculum (ie 8.2 log10 ID50, compared with the assumed figure of approximately
7.0 log10 ID50 and also to the limited number of mice surviving the study, on which
statistics could be based.


Higher dilutions would have permitted the assignment of clearance factors to the acid
and limed treatments.

Taking into account interim results after 9 months it appears that the clearance factors
could be close to the detection limits of the present experimental design, ie of the order
2 log10 for acid tre3anenr and 3 log10 for lime treatment.


Since no definite conclusion can be drawn from the results of the study it is 
recommended that further data be sought by utilising a wider range of dilutions.

The negative control mice showed no signs of scrapie infection and any death occurring
during the study were due to other murine illnesses.

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS  August 9 1996<BR>

BY ROGER BOYES
<P>


MORE than 50 per cent of Germans have cut beef out of their daily diet or are eating it less frequently because of "mad cow disease", according to an opinion poll published yesterday.



To counter the boycott, German farmers are throwing barbecue parties throughout the country, with only token fees being charged for prime, grilled chunks of German sirloin.

<P>

The Allensbach Institute found that 38 per cent of Germans now eat less beef and 15 per cent have given it up altogether. A further 5 per cent are vegetarians. Most importantly, 58 per cent of German women say they have reduced their beef consumption, making it clear that Germans have turned against beef in a big way.

<P>

The revolt is mainly concentrated in industrial regions and cities; in the Bavarian countryside beef consumption is still relatively high, partly because consumers know the farmers who supply local butchers.

<P>

Most German butchers now state in posters from which farmers they buy beef and mutton. Large announcements in supermarkets pledge that the shops do not stock British meat and that all dairy products are German.

 <H3><CENTER>Vermont's milk hormone <A NAME="labeling">labeling</A> law suspended</CENTER></H3>
Associated Press (Aug 8, 1996 8:53 p.m. EDT)

MONTPELIER, Vt.  -- The rights of dairies outweighs consumers' right to know what's in
their milk, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday, suspending Vermont's law requiring labels on products from cows
given bovine growth hormone.

The 2-1 decision by a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in New York said there was no proven health threat from the
genetically engineered hormone BGH, and that a lower court "abused its discretion" last September by refusing to block the
law from taking effect.<P>


"We are aware of no case in which consumer interest alone was sufficient to justify requiring a product's manufacturers to
publish the functional equivalent of a warning about a production method that has no discernible impact on a final product,"
said the decision, written by Circuit Judge Frank Altimari.

Now, the state is prevented from requiring stores to label products made with BGH until U.S. District Court Judge J.
Garvan Murtha hears a trial on the case.<P>


In 1993 the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of BGH, also known as recombinant bovine somatatropin, to
help dairy cows increase their milk production by up to 15 percent. Extensive testing found that it did not change the
makeup of milk and posed no human health threat.

But opponents feared the hormone could have unknown long-term health effects and could cause a glut of milk that would
put some small Vermont farmers out of business.<P>


Vermont's Legislature in 1994 passed a law requiring the labeling of most dairy products with milk from cows treated
with BGH. And since last September, stores have used blue labels on packages or signs to tell buyers.

Dairies and grocery groups sued, arguing the law infringed on their right to free speech and that it violated the free
commerce clause of the Constitution.<P>


The appeals panel agreed.

"Although the court is sympathetic to the Vermont consumers who wish to know ... their desire is insufficient to permit the
state of Vermont to compel the dairy manufacturers to speak against their will," the decision said.

Lawyers for the Vermont attorney general's office said Thursday they haven't decided whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.<P>


"Good riddance to bad policy," said Peter Shafer, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America.

The Vermont Grocers Association said it would begin notifying the group's 800 members they could remove labels as soon
as they received official word of the decision.<P>


Vermont Agriculture Commissioner Leon Graves said he would push for a voluntary labeling law during the next legislative
session.

"I think the concept is worth defending," Graves said. "From the consumer's perspective, a voluntary approach" to labeling
would provide the same information "in a much more positive fashion."

<H3><CENTER>USDA gives blessing to <A NAME="yogurt">yogurt</A> in place of beef</CENTER></H3>


Associated Press (Aug 8, 1996 8:53 p.m. EDT)<P>


WASHINGTON  -- What's for lunch?

For millions of America's schoolchildren, the answer soon may be yogurt, not meat. The Agriculture Department has
proposed allowing yogurt to be substituted for meat in school lunches.

Some school officials think it will be a hit with kids.

"I think they would like it, (but) certainly not as a steady diet," said Sally Rucker, co-manager of food service for the
Rochester, Minn., schools.<P>


Child-care providers and the food industry have pressed for the change at least for 15 years, but the Agriculture
Department balked due to yogurt's lack of nutrients such as iron and niacin.

The department's recommendation leaves to school nutritionists the chore of making sure children find their nutrients
elsewhere.<P>


However they do it, <B>using yogurt as meat is a prospect that raises the ire of cattle producers</B>, especially considering that
beef prices are depressed just now.

"USDA should be promoting meat, not pushing it under the carpet," Sen. Larry Pressler, D-S.D., said Thursday. "School
children must be provided nutritious and healthy meals, and they should include meat."

Coincidentally, the Clinton administration attempted this year to prop up cattle prices by stepping up purchases of beef for
schools. USDA provided schools with 146 million pounds of beef during this past school year.<P>


School lunch programs, which feed 25 million children nationwide, are a huge market for the food industry. The federal
government subsidizes the cost of the meals and sets requirement for their nutrition and content.

Agriculture already allows some meat substitutes, including cheese and peanut butter. Proponents say yogurt will add
variety to lunches, is easy for children to digest and requires no preparation.<P>


Department officials do worry that children may drink less milk if they eat yogurt. When children in a Michigan study
were offered both yogurt and milk, just 2 percent wanted both.

On the other hand, for reasons only a dietician could appreciate, children like cheese and milk together.

The Agriculture Department is taking comment on its yogurt proposal until Aug. 19.

FROM BEN MACINTYRE IN PLATEAU DE MILLEVACHES

<P>


THE thousands of cows that gave this verdant hilltop its name may soon be reduced to a mere handful, according to residents of the Plateau de Millevaches who fear that the effects of the "mad cow" disease crisis could be the final blow to a farming population that has steadily dwindled over the past five decades.

<P>

Even before the BSE crisis sent beef prices plummeting, French farms were dying off at the rate of almost 5 per cent a year. As late as the Second World War, agricultural workers made up 40 per cent of the French population, but today fewer than 2 per cent earn their living from the land. Between 1993 and last year more than 66,000 family farms vanished, according to figures from the Ministry of Agriculture.

<P>

Ren&eacute; Courteix, Mayor of the tiny town of St Merd-les-Oussines perched on this plateau in the heart of the Corr&egrave;ze region of central France, has seen the value of his herd of Limousin cattle dwindle since March. "It is catastrophic. Already some of the younger farmers are going under and heading to the cities," he observed.

<P>

Driving through this rolling countryside, the effects of rural depopulation are visible in the many boarded-up stone houses, some already in ruins. "Last century St Merd had a population of more than 500 people, now we are reduced to just over a hundred," M Courteix said. For the French Government, the gradual "desertification" of the land, now compounded by the effects of mad cow disease, represents a psychological as well as a political crisis, not least for President Chirac who has made much of his rural roots in the Corr&egrave;ze. M Chirac was raised in Brive-la-Gaillarde, and the Corr&egrave;ze is often referred to as his personal fiefdom. He is, the locals proclaim proudly, the only President of the Fifth Republic able to milk a cow. Now, M Courteix insists, M Chirac must milk Brussels for increased compensation to help beleaguered French cattle farmers.

<P>

On the road leading to St Merd, cardboard placards nailed to gateposts state: "We need a fixed price for our cows this autumn" &#173; they are remnants of the protests over mad cow disease earlier this year. Many French farmers blame Britain for the disaster but M Courteix insists: "This crisis has been building for a long time".

<P>

In February the French Government began offering incentives to the rural population, including relief on social security charges and reduced property taxes, in an effort to anchor the declining rural population to the land. French farms have grown in size just as they have shrunk in number. On the Plateau de Millevaches, farmers have taken to planting conifers and begun diversifying into sheep, but in many cases the land is simply being allowed to lie unused.

<P>

Cattle breeders are not the only sufferers. Many grain farmers blame European Union rules, which require land to lie fallow to prevent over-production, for reducing profits and accelerating the flow of young people to cities. The statistics show that France is no longer a land of country people, but that conceit remains central to the national self-image. This month millions of city-dwellers will head to the countryside for a month of bucolic relaxation for, as one historian has observed, "a French man's second home is his castle".

<P>

"In the past local men travelled north to carry out seasonal labour as stonemasons and the like. Now they go, but they do not come back," M Courteix said. "Instead we have seasonal people who come from Paris for a few weeks and then leave again."

<P>

Robert Mazaud, 80, said: "This cow disease may be the end. Not a single cow here has caught this plague, but we are suffering. It does not make sense," he says, draining his glass.

<P>

M Mazaud's bafflement is repeated across the Plateau de Millevaches as the remaining farmers watch their once rich land left to grow weeds, their cattle suddenly rendered cheap and the cows themselves, shining with good health, threatened by the effects of an unknown disease from a foreign land.<HR>


<H3><CENTER>Damaged <A NAME="corn">corn</A> could carry aflatoxin mold</CENTER></H3>

The Associated Press ... Aug 2, 1996
<P> WILMINGTON, N.C.- Crop damage from Hurricane Bertha has prompted North Carolina officials to begin testing for a cancer-causing mold earlier than normal this year.


   The North Carolina Agriculture Department is offering free aflatoxin testing for farmers with hurricane-damaged corn. Pender and Onslow counties asked the state to provide the testing because their farmers were hit hard by the storm.<P>

   Aflatoxin, produced by a mold that thrives in humid and wet conditions, can cause cancer in humans if ingested in large quantities, said Dr. Joel Padmore, the department's laboratory director.<P>

   Researchers are primarily concerned about corn used for animal feed <B>because the toxin can be passed to humans through pork, beef, poultry or milk</B>, Padmore said.

   "If we can prevent it from getting into the food chain, we'll be a lot better off," Padmore said.
  He didn't expect to find many problems in harvested corn, because North Carolina has had adequate rainfall, and aflatoxin normally is associated with drought stress in corn.

 "I suspect it probably isn't going to be a problem, but... it's better to be safe than sorry," he said.<P>

 Sweet corn bought in grocery stores and at produce stands is not as big a problem, Padmore said. Because the mold is easily spotted, consumers usually just break off the rotted portion or throw the entire ear away.

 The corn was nearing harvest and at its most vulnerable stage when the hurricane hit North Carolina's coast July 12.

 Many farmers stood their windblown-stalks upright again, hoping the corn would continue to grow. The corn could easily have grown mold after lying on the ground for several days, Padmore said.<P>

 Sandy Maddox, Pender County cooperative extension director, said her main concern is the extremely wet conditions of the past few weeks. Because mold thrives in moisture, the frequent heavy downpours have added to the corn crop's troubles.

 Aflatoxin has not been found in Pender County, Maddox said, primarily because farmers have not begun harvesting corn. That is when toxin tests are done, she said.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3><CENTER>Scientists fear <A NAME="worldwide">worldwide</A> brain disease epidemic </CENTER></H3>


The Times: Britain: July 29 1996<BR>
BY JEREMY LAURANCE<P>

 A UNIQUE collection of human brains that has been stored in a hospital vault for more than 70 years could provide a clue to the cause of one of the worst epidemics the world has seen.



Scientists at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, believe that genetic analysis of the samples will help public health authorities to prepare for the next flu onslaught. The pandemic in 1918 killed more than 20 million people.



They say that the investigation is essential to answer the question of whether the flu virus can attack the brain, raising the prospect of an epidemic of neurological illness triggered by flu.

<P>

The 1918 pandemic was followed by outbreaks of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s, the sleeping sickness made famous by Oliver Sacks in his book <I>Awakenings</I> &#173; filmed by Penny Marshall with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams &#173; and of Parkinson's disease in the 1930s. Scientists have long suspected the diseases were linked with the earlier flu pandemic, but until now have lacked the technical means to confirm it.



There have been three flu pandemics this century: in 1918, 1957 and 1968. The next is overdue. John Oxford, Professor of Virology at the Royal London, who is leading the research, said: "Everyone is worried we are going to get another pandemic and it has reawakened anxieties about 1918. We need to know more about it. I would guess there was something odd about that virus."

<P>

The research team is analysing sections of lung and brain preserved from victims of pneumonia in the 1918 outbreak and in the subsequent outbreaks of encephalitis and Parkinson's disease.

Using the technique of polymerase chain reaction, they aim to identify the flu genes and reconstitute the virus. "If we find flu genes in the brain samples it will confirm that the diseases are linked. That would add another worry about a new strain of pandemic flu: that it could be neuro-virulent [attacking the brain] as well as pneumo-virulent [attacking the lungs]. It would mean we would have to take it very seriously."

<P>

Governments were doing too little to plan for the next flu pandemic. "It is one thing to produce pieces of paper, but one could do more than that. We could sensibly deduce which viral strains could be in the next pandemic and produce experimental vaccines."

Professor Oxford, whose study is part funded by the Parkinson's Disease Society, is appealing for donations of tissue preserved from the early decades of the century to assist the research. Samples have already been sent to the Royal London Hospital from Prague and more are being collected from Istanbul. "We are worried that the evidence is being thrown out just as we have acquired the techniques to analyse them. At the Royal London, all the clinical records, the post-mortem books and the pathology reports are preserved." He dismissed fears that the reconstitued virus might escape, triggering a fresh pandemic. He said there was no danger because of the difficulty of recreating the whole virus. "I will be content if we can find the virulent gene. That will tell us if the 1918 gene was something special."

<P>

The flu virus has eight genes, two or three of which control the level of its virulence. It is constantly mutating, creating new strains, which accounts for its capacity to cause epidemics year after year. Occasionally the virus undergoes a more dramatic change, giving it a renewed capacity to attack human cells and causing the pandemics.

BSE may infect soil 'for years' </CENTER></H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>The Times: Britain: 10 June 96<P>


 BSE-infected material could be contaminating land and water supplies for years to come because of the ineffectiveness of the rendering process, a neurologist said yesterday.

<P>

Dr Alan Colchester, a consultant neurologist at Guy's Hospital in London, has been caring for the only cluster group of people suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human equivalent of BSE, in the country. There have been three suspected cases of CJD from the Ashford area of Kent, with one of them confirmed.

<P>

He told BBC Radio 4's <I>World This Weekend</I> that there was no guarantee that the substances known as prions, which cause BSE and CJD, were being consistently destroyed by the rendering process. He called for the whole rendering industry to be reassessed.

<P>



The BBC programme focused on the Canterbury Mills rendering plant in Kent, one of nine in the country receiving cattle from the national cull. It operates a soakaway system, discharging its liquid effluent through pipes onto surrounding land. The licensing agencies and the plant itself insist the process is safe, the programme reported.

<P>

Dr Colchester alleged that prions could survive the rendering process and pollute land and water supplies for years. He recommended that the surrounding land, if contaminated, be quarantined, "possibly indefintely".


He added: "Prions are definitely very different from viruses and bacteria when it comes to how they behave in the face of all the usual processes of destruction of infectivity." It was very difficult to detect prions and tests on water supplies or on land would take years.

<P>

"That is one of the problems, which is why I am arguing that the time has come to err on the safe side and if there is contaminated land then I fear that I think the whole area should indeed be fenced off and no sort of human trespassing should be allowed."



Asked whether this meant quarantine, he replied: "Yes, possibly indefinitely."

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food declined to comment on Dr Colchester's claims, saying it was a matter for the Intervention Board.
 A spokesman for the UK Renderers' Association defended the industry, saying it was doing a job on behalf of the Government and under its authority and control.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BY DOMINIC KENNEDY AND LIN JENKINS ... The Times: Britain:11 June 96

<P>

EXPERTS were divided yesterday over the risks to public health from the disposal on land of the remains of cattle slaughtered in the cull against "mad cow" disease.


They spoke as the Government announced an <STRONG>amnesty for farmers</STRONG> to return banned animal feed blamed for the start of the BSE crisis, before fines and imprisonment for the possession of the meal are introduced in August.

<P>


The Ministry of Agriculture yesterday announced fines and imprisonment for farmers still keeping banned animal feed from the remains of sheep and cattle, which was blamed for the BSE outbreak. There will be a &#163;5,000 fine for a first offence and one month's jail for a second.
<P>

The debate about disposal was sparked by the disclosure that Canterbury Mills in Kent was spreading liquid effluent from the rendering process on to land at its plant.

Alan Colchester, who has been treating three of five people believed to be suffering from CJD in Kent, called for the land to be sealed off in case it infected people or animals.
The first herd in Britain in which "mad cow" disease was diagnosed had been reared near by in Ashford in 1985. Renderers are dealing with 18,000 carcasses a week and are expected to have to <STRONG>cope with 250,000 cattle</STRONG> before the cull, which began last month, is finished in about six months.

<P>

Richard Lacey, one of the loudest voices warning of the connection between BSE and the human equivalent CJD, feared that the practice could lead to the return of the illness to Britain even if the entire national herd was killed.
Scientists are divided about the dangers posed by the remains of cattle that have been through the rendering process, which involves boiling at high temperatures such as 145C for an hour.


<P>

But others dismissed the dangers as negligible. They said the prion protein that causes BSE should be destroyed during rendering, which involves boiling at high temperatures for long periods. Canterbury Mills is thought to be <STRONG> the only one of the nine rendering plants disposing of the remains of cattle</STRONG> being slaughtered in the cull which has permission to spread the liquid effluent on land, according to the Environment Agency, which is responsible for waste disposal. The others, at Huddersfield, Aberdeenshire, Dumfries, Lancaster, Stoke-on-Trent, Widnes, Bradford and Motherwell, are all understood to <B>pump it into the sewage system.</B>



<P>

The Canterbury Mills rendering plant, at Godmersham, defended its practices yester day. Joseph Cheale, managing director, dismissed concerns raised by Dr Colchester, consultant neurologist at Guy's Hospital, that infected agents in effluent discharged from the plant could reach human beings through direct contact or the water supply.

<P>

"If there was a danger we would not do it. The rendering process is right and effective. What escapes people's attention is the fact that this process is the same as the human body's," Mr Cheale said.
He said that viruses and bacteria entered the sewage system from a variety of sources. "So why should what we do be any less safe?" he said.

<P>

The plant is dealing with 1,800 culled carcasses a week. Dead trees around the mill are just one of the reasons local people want it closed. The stench affects the surrounding villages of Waltham, Chartham, Godmersham, Petham and Crundale, but local campaigners also complain of contaminated lands and offal spills on the road.

<P>

David Richardson, site manager, said the plant complied with all EU safety standards. Ministry of Agriculture Food and Fisheries inspectors visited twice each day. Operations go on 24 hours a day, six days a week. Some of the resulting effluent is sprayed on 40 acres of land where they grow linseed. "There is no health hazard," he said.

<P>

The Forestry Commission opposed plans to tip a further 26,000 gallons a day on fields next to the plant. It claimed dumping effluent on its land without permission had already done serious damage.

<P>

Anne Graham, who co-ordinates local opposition to the plant from her home in Petham, said that only last Friday offal fell from one of the lorries on its way to the plant. She said blood and carcasses could often be seen in the open and the smell and the draining of effluent on to land were unnecessary.

Assuming that a tiny fraction of cats with BSE-FSE ever get diagnosed as
such (vestibular disorder more likely, no diagnosis at all likliest), there
would be a potential for re-cycling the disease should these infected cats
be non-discriminately rendered for pet food:<P>
 
From Summer 1996 Earth Island Journal v11, #3 pg 27-31:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The rendering plant floor is piled high with raw product.  Thousands of
dead dogs and cats; head and hooves from cattle, sheep, pigs and horses;
whole skunks; rats and raccoons -- all waiting to be processed.  In the
90-degree heat, the piles of dead animals seem to have a life of their own
as millions of maggots swarm over the carcassess."<P>
 
"Rendering plants process decomposing animal carcasses, large roadkill and
euthanized dogs and cats into a dry protein product that is sold in the pet
food industry. One small plant in Quebec renders 22,000 pounds of
dogs and cats per week... The fur is not removed and dead animals are
cooked together with viscera, bones and fat at 115 C for 20 minutes."<P>
 
"Each year in the US, 286 rendering plants quietly dispose of more than
12,500,000 tons of dead animals, fat and meat wasts. ... Baltimore's Valley
Proteins "hogger" vat contained an eclectic mix of body parts ranging from
dead dogs, cats, raccoons, possums, deer, foxes, snakes, a baby circus
elephant, and a police quarterhorse.... In an average year, Baltimore's
pound hands over 21,888 dead animals to Valley Proteins [which] sells
inedible animal parts and rendered material to Alpo, Heinz, and
Ralston-Purina [US pet food manufactureres]"<P>
 
"Valley Protein maintains two production lines -- one for clean meat and
bons and a second line for dead pets and wildlife.  However, VP President
Smith reported, that the [final] protein material is a mix from both
production lines.  Thus the meat and bone meal made at the plant includes
materials from pets and wildlife, and are about five percent of that
product goes to dry-pet-food manufacturers."<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR><CENTER><H3>Valley Protein responds</H3></CENTER>

Gerald F. Smith, Jr., President of Valley Proteins, Inc. responds to your 
Wednesday, October 23, 1996 transmission at 10:45 a.m. as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I was misquoted in the article you referenced. Our plant in Baltimore, MD 
does indeed process dead domestic house pets which have been euthanized 
by veterinarians, animal control officials, humane societies and other 
animal protection organizations. This represents less than one-half of 1% of our 
Baltimore plant's business on an annual basis. Valley Proteins has a 
total of nine rendering plants in five states. Except for one pet food 
producer which purchased approximately 10 tons from our Baltimore plant 
on three different occasions during the last 12 months, we only sell 
animal proteins to pet food manufacturers from our facilities which are 
capable of recycling poultry by-products from poultry slaughter 
facilities. This pet food producer purchased less than one -half of 1% of our 
total Baltimore Meat Meal production. Therefore, during the last 12 
months approximately 300 pounds of our animal protein containing 
by-products from dead domestic house pets entered the pet food market."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR><H3>Listserve commentary 10.31.96</H3>

Since the renderer (Valley Proteins) mentioned is in the U.S., presumably
the meat and bone meal so generated (if the story is true) must be used in
pet food in a manner consistent with FDA and USDA regulations.

<P>
First of all, the pet food made must specifically reference the species name
on the label. E.g., "chicken byproducts", etc. I personally have never seen
"opossum byproducts" or "raccoon meat" or "cat byproducts" listed on ANY
petfood I have ever seen.<P>
 
Secondly, any diseased tissue is inelgible for use in petfood.<P>
 
IF the story described is true, then most likely any recycled pets/roadkill
would be used in fertilizer meat and bone meal. While this might
the direct closed-loop feedback suggested.<P>
---------------
The label on Hill's Feline Senior Science Diet includes among the more
specific ingredients, "animal fat (preserved with BHA, propyl gallate
and citric acid)" and "natural flavor".
<HR><CENTER><H3>Cats and  BSE: the <A NAME="body">body</A> count</H3></CENTER

Does anybody know the newest number of FSE cases in GB?  What is the youngest case?
<PRE>1994: 16
1995: 8
1996: 6 so far</PRE>

<PRE>The first FSE case was reported already in 1990
(Wyatt et al (1990) Vet.Rec. 126, 513).
 
Wyatt and coworkers reported 5 more cases in 1991 (Vet Rec.129,233) and
sometime during 1992 the number of confirmed cases had reached 24.
 
"Since the first report <..> a further 23 cases have been confirmed
histologically (J.W. Wilesmith, personal communication).."
(quote from Journal of small animal practise (1992),33,10,471)
 
This leaves only a plausible discrepancy (of 28 cases) --
for further cases confirmed in 1992 and cases from 1993.
 
Maybe the single case reported from Norway is included in
the total count mentioned in Devins' article in THE INDEPENDENT?
 
Total count 72 diagnosed FSE cases can't be far off.
This leaves only a plausible discrepancy (of 28 cases) --
for further cases confirmed in 1992 and cases from 1993.</PRE>

<P>
<B>SUMMARY</B><BR>
Two key stages (or unit processes) in the manufacturing process of GELATIN were assessed for their ability to inactivate scrapie and thus any related agents.<BR>
These selected stages from within the process were challenged separately with high titre scrapie agent, ME7. Samples were collected following processing through each stage and were titrated in log10 dilutions in mice to assay for scrapie 
infectivity.<BR>
The first stage involved an acid treatment (demineralisation) step and samples were collected after 24 h and 48 h incubation at 10 to 12 oC. The second stage involved a lime treatment step and samples were collected after 5, 20 and 45 days incubation at 
10 to 12 oC.<BR>
The amount of infectious agent found in each sample was compared to the initial scrapie spike used for challenge in order to determine the level of clearance achieved by the 2 unit processing steps involved in the scaled-down manufacture of GELATIN.<BR>
Based on clinical and selected pathological assessment the titre of ME7 used for challenge was 8.2 log10 lD50 ml-1. The total spike used for challenging each stage was 8.2 log10 lD50 ml-1. Some random deaths occurred which were due to trauma of 
inoculation or non-scrapie associated illness.<BR>
Clinical results were confirmed in a representative number of mice by pathological examination and from these results the clearance factors for the longest incubation times of Stage 1 (acid treatment and Stage 2 (lime treatment) unit processes were 
obtained. These are represented below:<BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><BR>
The study was performed to determine the ability of 2 unit processes of the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATIN to inactivate scrapie. ME7 in C57 B1/6 mice was the chosen model, as this mouse adapted strain of scrapie has been thoroughly 
analysed and exhibits similar physicochemical characteristics to the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy.<BR>
The use of scrapie as a model for bovine spongiforn encephalopathy  and the confirmation of scrapie infection by pathological evaluation is accepted by Regulatory Authorities in the EC.<BR>
The validation procedure was carried out according to the EC CPMP Ad Hoc Working Party on Biotechnology/Pharmacy Notes for Guidance entitled 'Validation of Virus Removal and Inactivation Procedures' (August 1991) and 'Guidelines for Minimising the Risk 
of Transmission from Animals to Man of Agents causing Spongiform Encephalopathies via Medicinal Products' (May 1992) and the Federal Bulletin No. 40 issued by the German Federal Ministry of Health entitled 'Guidelines on Safety Measures in Connection 
with Medicinal Products Containing Body Materials from Cattle, Sheep or Goats for Minimising the Risk of Transmission of BSE (February 1994)'.<BR>
Due to the serious practical limitations in attempting to simulate the GELATIN manufacturing process on small scale suitable for scrapie challenge studies it was proposed to study directly the effect on the scrapie agent of (1) 4% hydrochloric acid and 
(2) saturated lime solution, ie 2 key unit stages in the production of GELATIN.<BR>
These 2 stages from the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATlN were assessed for their ability to inactivate scrapie by challenging with high titre scrapie agent and collecting samples from pre-selected timepoints of the 2 unit processes. The 
processed samples were assayed for remaining infectious agent by titration of log10 dilutions in mice.<BR>
The amount of agent in each sample was compared to that used for the challenge in order to determine the clearance of scrapie by each stage in the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATIN.   Calculation of the final clearance factor was based on 
both clinical and selected pathological assessment. Clinical scrapie symptoms were confirmed by pathological examination of a representative number of mice.<BR>
This report describes the methods used and results obtained in tests carried out at the Inveresk Gate and Elphinstone Research Centre laboratories of Inveresk Research International Limited. The study was initiated on 19 March 1993. The experimental 
start date was 4 June 1993 and the experimental completion date was 28 July 1995. For the study completion date see the Authentication page for the date of the Study Director's signature.<BR>
All data generated and recorded during this study, including a copy of the final report, will be stored in the Scientific Archives of Inveresk Research International Limited for 5 years after issue of the final report. At the end of the 5 year period 
the Sponsor will be consulted regarding the disposal or continued storage of raw data.<BR>
<P>
<B>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE<BR>
<P>
STARTING MATERIAL</B><BR>
No starting materials were provided by the Sponsor because of the serious practical limitations in attempting to simulate the GELATIN manufacturing process on a small scale suitable for scrapie challenge studies. In this study the scrapie agent was 
exposed to 2 unit process extraction conditions.<BR>
<P>
<B>TEST SCRAPIE AGENT</B><BR>
ME7 is a clonally purified strain of scrapie adapted for the mouse model which in the presence of the sinc S7 genotype gives rise to a short but controlled incubation of murine scrapie. The agent is physicochemically stable and stimulates no protective 
host response to infection. Positive diagnosis is by microscopic examination of pathological lesions in brain tissue which show themselves as non-inflammatory, vacuolar degeneration of grey matter areas of the brain. The ME7 agent, which originates from 
a strain of scrapie found in the Suffolk breed of sheep, was obtained from the institute for Animal Health, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.<BR>
Eleven intracerebral mouse brain passage of the ME7 agent were performed. The first 2 passages were in random bred mice from the Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh.  UK, with subsequent passages  in C57 B1/6 mice. High dilution cloning passages were 
performed at seventh (2 x 10^-7) and eighth (10^-7) passage, with other passages at 10^-2 10^-3 and 10^-4.<BR>
<P>
<B>ANIMALS</B><BR>
C57 B1/6 mice were obtained 3-6 weeks of age from Charles River (UK) Limited, Kent, United Kingdom. These mice are homozygous for the S7 allele of the sinc gene. The sinc gene has a profound effect on the incubation period of scrapie disease and the S7 allele denotes a short incubation.<BR>
The mice were allowed to acclimatise for a minimum of 6 days before commencement of testing and were then randomly allocated to treatment groups. Each mouse received a unique ear mark and cage card identifying Project Number, Animal Number and appropriate treatment group.<BR>
The mice were housed within a purpose built scrapie facility comprising barrier maintained rooms. These facilities incorporate preset temperature controls with continuous monitoring. As a routine precaution mice were dosed with terramycin in their drinking water to curtail low levels of Tyzzer's disease, a common murine bacterial infection. Mice were examined weekly up until 120 days post inoculation and then they were examined daily.<BR>
<P>
<B>PREPARATION OF ME7 AGENT STOCKS</B><BR>
Stock scrapie agent, strain ME7, was prepared from infected brains of C57 B1/6 mice. The inoculum was a 1% homogenate of brain tissue in saline buffer containing scrapie strain ME7 at titres of approximately 10^7 lD50. An aliquot of 0.02 ml of this homogenate was inoculated intracerebrally in C57 B1/6 mice and subsequent manifestation of the disease followed 170 to 200 days post inoculation. Mice showing clean clinical symptoms of scrapie infection were sacrificed. The brains were removed aseptically and stored below -70 oC ready for use as spike material.<BR>
<P>
<B>PREPARATION OF ME7 SPIKE MATERIAL PRIOR TO CHALLENGE</B><BR>
Eight brains infected with ME7 were pooled and then homogenised in 0.9 % Saline to produce a 30% homogenate.<BR>
<P>
<B>PROCESS VALIDATION: PROCEDURE</B><BR>
The 2 key stages (or unit processes) to be validated for their ability to inactivate the scrapie agent were as follows:<BR>
<P>
STAGE 1: Acid Demineralisation<BR>
1.   An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to 8.0 ml 4.5% (w/w) hydrochloric acid to give a final acid concentration of 4.0 % . The mixture was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 24 h with occasional agitation.<BR>
2.   The acid was then neutralised to approximately pH 7.0 by the addition of 10 N sodium hydroxide (approximately 1.0 ml) prior to titration for infectivicy. Fine adjustment of pH was done by adding 4N hydrochloric acid and 1N sodium hydroxide.<BR>
3.  An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to 8.0 ml 4.5 % (w/w) hydrochloric acid to give a final acid concentration of 4.0% . The mixture was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 48 h for the treatment incubation and neutralised as 
detailed above prior to titration for infectivity.<BR>
<P>
STAGE 2: -Lime Treatment<BR>
1.   An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to a slurry of 0.3 g calcium hydroxide in 8.0 ml water. The mixture was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 5 days with occasional agitation.<BR>
2.   An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to a slurry of 0.3 g calcium hydroxide in 8.0 ml water. The mixture was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 20 days with occasional agitation.<BR>
3.   An aliquot of 1.0 ml spike inoculum was added to a slurry of 0.3 g calcium hydroxide in 8.0 ml water. The mixture was maintained at a temperature of 10 to 12 oC for 45 days with occasional agitation.<BR>
4.   In all cases the lime was then neutralised to approximately pH 7.0 by addition of 4 N hydrochloric acid (approximately 1.0 ml) prior to titration for infectivity. (Fine adjustment of pH was done by adding 0.4 N hydrochloric acid).<BR>
<P>
<B>TITRATION IN MICE</B><BR>
Scrapie strain ME7 was assayed by titration in C57 B1/6 mice. The processed samples and positive control were serially diluted 10-fold from undiluted down to the appropriate dilution in 0.9 % (w/v) saline buffer (see Tables).<BR>
The positive control was used to determine the titre of the ME7 challenge. Inoculation of samples was by intracerebral injection into C57 B1/6 mice.   The volume inoculated was 0.05 ml for the processed sample dilutions, the positive control and 
negative control. Fifteen mice inoculated with 0.9 % saline were used as a negative control in the study.<BR>
During incubation the mice were examined weekly up until 120 days post inoculation and then they were examined daily. This regular examination will continue over a 2 year period for the test sample mice, the positive control mice and negative control 
mice. Mice in the study showing clinical signs of scrapie infection were sacrificed, their brains were removed and stored ready for pathological examination.<BR>
Mice not required for determining endpoints were sacrificed early at the discretion of the Study Director. All remaining mice in the study were sacrificed after 2 years, their brains removed and stored as detailed above.<BR>
<P>
<B>CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</B><BR>
Initial diagnosis of scrapie infection was by observation of clinical signs of the disease. Typically these signs include high stepping walk, rolling gait, hunched posture and dragging rear end.<BR>
<P>
<B>PATHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT.</B><BR>
At the end of the study selected mice from the test samples showing suspected clinical signs of scrapie infection were pathologically assessed along with a random number of negative clinically assessed mice from various dilution groups of the test 
sample mice. Any mice assumed as borderline with regard to showing clinical signs of scrapie infection were also selected for pathological assessment. Selected mice from the endpoint dilution of the positive control mice and a limited number of the 
inoculated negative control mice were also selected for examination. Mice given no definitive clinical assessment during the study were also selected for pathological evaluation of the disease.<BR>
Following removal the brains  were embedded in wax and up to 5 x 5 microm sections stained  with haematoxylin and eosin. The sections were scored for typical vacuolar change using brightfield light microscopy.<BR>
The results confirmed the presence/absence of scrapie infection in mice selected for pathological assessment. The presence/absence of scrapie infection in those mice not selected for pathological assessment was based on clinical assessment only.<BR>
<P>
<B>CALCULATION OF CLEARANCE FACTORS</B><BR>
Titres of scrapie agent were calculated using the Probit statistical analysis detailed by D J Finney (1971).<BR>
Mice not showing scrapie infection that died before 18 months post inoculation were not included in the calculation. This was due to the problem of being unable to determine tbe absence of scrapie infection with early murine mortality.<BR>
Probit analyses were carried out to determine the endpoint titration, lD50 of the different samples including the positive control.<BR>
The data for each stage of the test and the positive control included the following:<BR>
Different dilution factors of the processed sample; the number of times the sample dilution was used (number of replicates); the observed number of infected mice (response variable) at the end of the incubation period; the inocuIum size; the internal 
dilution (optional): the volume of the original sample.<BR>
A probit analysis, using the statistical package SAS, transformed the percentage fractional mortality values of the mice for each dilution factor and then performed a linear regression on the transformed values against logarithmically transformed 
dilution factors.<BR>
The goodness of fit of the probit model to the fractional mortality data was checked via the Pearson chi-squared test statistic. In the case of a significant chi-squared test statistic, the variances and covariances were adjusted by a heterogeneity 
factor. Following this: the confidence intervals were not reported and the lD50 values should be treated with caution.<BR>
Within each stage of the test, at least 2 dilution factors had to be present. Furthermore, at least 2 of the dilution factors within each stage should show fractional mortalities, ie there should be at least 2 dilutions that are not 0% or 1OO%. Where thi
case, Berkson's modification was performed. This involved adding or subtracting 0.5 in a symmetrical manner from the observed number of infected mice.<BR>
Whenever Berkson's modification was used no confidence limits were reported and the lD50 values should be treated with caution.<BR>
If all the dilution factors present at any one stage of a test have equal fractional mortalities then the lD50 cannot be calculated. This also applies if the fractional mortalities become equal after Berkson's modification has been used.<BR>
Also, in any one stage of a test, if all the dilution factors have less than 50% mortality or all have more than 50% mortality, the confidence limits will not be reported and the lD50 value should be treated with caution.<BR>
The clearance factor of any individua/whole purification stage is defined by the CPMP Note for Guidance as a ratio of the 'load in the starting material' to the 'load in the final material'. The clearance factor is given in log10 and calculated 
according to the CPMP (1991). It takes into account both the sample volume and the titre before and after the purification step to be tested.<BR>

<B>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</B><BR>
The processed samples were both found to be toxic in C57 B116 mice when administered undiluted.<BR>
The titre of scrapie used to spike the process was calculated using a statistical method detailed by D J Finney (1971). The titre of the challenge scrapie spike was 8.2 log10 lD50 ml^-1 (Table 1).<BR>
During and/or shortly following inoculation of mice, both for the positive control and test samples, deaths occurred in some dilution groups. These deaths were due to trauma of inoculation and mice were replaced, where possible, to attain the required 
number per dilution group.<BR>
Samples were taken during the acid treatment (24 h and 48 h) and lime treatment (5 days, 20 days and 45 days) process steps and serially titrated in mice. The mortality figures used to calculate the lD50 endpoints are shown in Tables 2 and 3.<BR>
Table 4 shows that none of the control mice (inoculated with 0.9% saline) showed any evidence of scrapie infection and deaths occuring during the study were due to other murine illnesses.<BR>
The clearance factors calculated were based on clinical assessment and selected pathological confirmation (Table 5).<BR>

To generate a scrapie clearance factor, the residual infectivity measured after processing was compared to the titre of scrapie agent used for challenge. In order to determine the minimum clearance factor it was neccesary to assume that no deaths 
occurred due to scrapie infections in the next dilution down from the last one examined.<BR>
A clearance factor of <2.4 log10 was obtained for the acid treatment (demineralisation) Stage 1 of the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATIN. Additionally, a clearance factor of <3.4 log10 war obtained for the lime Stage 2 of the scaled-down 
manufacturing process of GELATIN.<BR>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B><BR>
The potential of the scaled-down manufacturing process of GELATIN to inactivate bovine spongiform encephalopathy was assessed by challenging 2 selected stages with scrapie, a model for the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy.<BR>
Based on a combination of both clinical and selected pathological assessment of the mice 24 months after inoculation, the titre of the scrapie spike was 8.2 log10 lD50 ml^-1. A total of 8.2 log10 lD50 was used to individually challenge 2 separate stages 
of the process. Upon completion of the acid and lime treatment stages clearance factors of <2.4 log10 and <3.4 log10 respectively were obtained.<BR>
The experimental design was such that no precise numerical values for clearance factors could be assigned. This is partly attributable to the higher than expected  infectivity of the inoculum (ie 8.2 log10 lD50, compared with the assumed figure of 
approximately 7.0 log10 lD50 and also to the limited number of mice surviving the study, on which statistics could be based.<BR>
Higher dilutions would have permitted the assignment of clearance factors to the acid and limed treatments.<BR>
Taking into account interim results after 9 months it appears that the clearance factors could be close to the detection limits of the present experimental design, ie of the order 2 log10 for acid treatment and 3 log10 for lime treatment.<BR>
Since no definite conclusion can be drawn from the results of the study it is  recommended that further data be sought by utilising a wider range of dilutions.<BR>
The negative control mice showed no signs of scrapie infection and any death occurring during the study were due to other murine illnesses.<BR>

<H1>ANNEX B</H1>
<H1>PHASE 2 EXPERIMENT</H1>
<H2><A NAME="DEACTIVATION">DEACTIVATION</A> OF THE SCRAPIE AGENT BY SIMULATED RENDERING METHODS</H2>
<H2>Taylor,D.M.; et al. unpublished results</H2>
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>
1.1. Bovine spongiform enceplialopathy (BSE) is thought to have been caused by ihe inclusion of scrapie-infected meat and bone meal in cattle rations. A significant factor in the expansion of the epidemic is thought to have resulted from the production and feeding of meat and bone meal from the carcases of sub-clinical cases of BSE. Scrapie-like agents are known to be relatively resistant to inactivation by heat treatments that are effective for conventional micro-organisms, but the ability of rendering systems to inactivate the BSE agent had not been examined. This study was designed to investigate, on a pilot scale, the effect on the BSE and Scrapie agents of the various time/temperature regimes used to render animal material within the EU, together wifh some procedures not used generally but which, it was thought, might be expected to be effective.
<P>
1.2. Surveys of rendering practices in the UK and other EU member states showed that although a relatively small range of appliances were used, they were operated in many different ways. Because it was not practicable to test every method in precise detail, the first objective was to test the minimum and average conditions employed in each generic process.
<P>
1.3. The second objective was to test processes which were not in general use but which were thought likely to inactivate the BSE and scrapie agents, and which might be introduced to enable "safe" products to be manufactured. These involved the exposure of raw materials or meat and bone meal (MBM) to steam above atmospheric pressure.
<P>
1.4. The collection of brains from cattle with clinical signs of BSE was completed in November 1990, and processing of this material was completed by March 1991. Mouse inoculation work began shortly thereafter and was completed by September 1991.
<P>
1.6. The collection of brains from sheep with clinical signs of scrapie was completed by August 1992. Rendering of this material was completed by 31 September, and solvent extraction on 23 June 1993. Mouse inoculation work began shortly thereafter and is essentially complete.
<P>
1.7. Collection of scrapie-infected material in other EU member states proved difficult despite strenuous and varied efforts on the part of the project co-ordinator and the GB authorities. The planned third phase of the experiment was therefore abandoned.
<P>
<H2>2. Materials and methods</H2>
<H3>2.1. Description of equipment design and usage</H3>
2.1.1. With a few exceptions, the equipment and its mode of use were as described for the phase 1 (BSE) experiment already described at Annex A.  The single exception involved the use of an AB 20 twin screw press (Atlas; Balerup, Denmark) instead of the Stord twin screw press used in phase I (BSE) of the experiment. The design and function of the AB 20 press was essentially the same as the Stord press.
<P>
<H3>2.1. CoIlection and preparation of spiked niaterial</H3>
2.1.1. Brains from 2,867 sheep infected with scrapie were collected by MAFF Veterinary Investigation Centres between October 1990 and August 1992.
<P>
2.1.2. Brains were collected only if the examining veterinarian considered that the animal exhibited clinical signs of scrapie. All 2,867 brains were placed in individual polythene bags and held at < -20 C prior to use. To facilitate maceration during the preparation of the brain pool, their temperature was increased to + 4 C immediately beforehand.
<P>
2.1.3. To facilitate maceration during the preparation of the brain pool, the brains were removed from cold storage and allowed to reach approximately 4C. To ensure the homogeneity of the pool, the brains were unwrapped and placed randomly in a presterilised stainless steel bin, and then processed through a mincer  fitted with a 10 mm extrusion plate to produce six equal aliquots in sterilised plastic dustbins. These aliquots were mixed further by re-mincing, and were again collected as six equal lots. From these, appropriate amounts were weighed out into double polythene bags for the individual experiments.
<P>
2.1.4. Approximately l0g of each aliquot was collected and pooled to provide a sample for measuring infectivity titre by bioassay in mice (Table B2). All aliquots were held at <-20C until required.
<P>
<H3>2.2. Raw material selection and mixing</H3>
2.2.1. For each process the raw material mixtures were prepared on the day of the experiment. The equipment used and the method of mixing were the same as for the BSE study except that only pig bone and intestines were used so as to exclude any possibility of contamination with the BSE agent from the study. The mixtures were processed through a mincer using extrusion plate sizes as appropriate (Table A.1). To maximise the homogeneity of the mixtures, aliquots of bone, intestine and brain were fed sequentially into the mincer in proportion to their inclusion level until all had been processed. The mixtures used in these pilot scale studies were typical of those rendered to produce feed grade tallow and MBM.
<P>
<H3>2.3. Experimental rendering procedures</H3>
2.3.1. The range of processes tested and the rationale adopted towards their use was the same as for the BSE study. The instrumentation used to record times, temperatures, pressure etc were as described previously as were the procedures for the collection and preparation of tallow, greaves and meat and bone meal.
<P>
<H4>2.3.2. Protocol B: Batch processing</H4>
Raw material was processed at atmospheric pressure in a cooker (Iwel; London, UK). This had a steam-jacket and a rotating central shaft with agitator paddles that was also steam-heated. At the start of the process the temperature of the raw material was 40C; at the end of the process (150min) the temperature achieved was 114C
<P>
<H4>2.3.3. Protocols C, D, E and F: Continuous processing with natural fat content</H4>
These protocols were designed to simulate the conditions for full-scale continuous rendering without added tallow at minimum (C and D) and average temperatures (E and F). The raw materials were processed at atmospheric pressure in a model 1 VA Rotadisc drier (Stord International; Bergen, Norway). The temperatures attained during the various cycles are shown in Table B1.
<P>
<H4>2.3.4. Protocols G and H: Continuous processing with high fat content</H4>
These protocols were designed to simulate the average and minimal conditions for full-scale continuous rendering at atmospheric pressure with added tallow (1:1) pre-heated to 100C. The basic design of the cooker was similar to that of the Rotadisc drier except that a sliding valve arrangement permitted vacuum to be applied optionally from a pump.  The temperatures attained during the various cycles are shown in Table B1.
<P>
<H4>2.3.5. Protocols I and J: Continuous vacuum processing with high fat content</H4>
The raw material was loaded into the Atlas cooker in which the added tallow had been pre-heated to 65C. Vacuum was applied in two distinct stages to simulate minimal conditions for the production-scale method.  The temperatures attained during the various cycles are shown in Table B1.
<P>
<H4>2.3.6. Protocols K and L: Continuous wet rendering</H4>
These protocols were designed to simulate the average and minimal conditions for full-scale rendering by the low temperature wet method. The temperatures attained during the various cycles are shown in Table B1.
<P>
<H4>2.3.7. Protocol M: Continuous wet rendering</H4>
The purpose of this procedure was to produce starting material for solvent rendering protocols. The temperatures attained during the various cycles are shown in Table B1.
<P>
<H4>2.3.8. Protocols Q, R and S: Pressure cooking</H4>
All of these procedures were conducted in the Iwel cooker in which the raw materials were heated initially to 100C. As steam was generated, air was displaced by venting for 10 min. The venting valve was .then closed and the chamber pressure was permitted to increase to the appropriate pressure. Holding times were started when the required temperature was reached on the surface of the raw materials. Exposure times included 10 min to permit heat to penetrate into the particles. The process conditions for these protocols are shown in Table B1.
<P>
<H2>4. Procedures for decontamination and prevention of cross contamination</H2>
4.1. Procedures for chemical decontamination were based upon what was known for the scrapie agent.
<P>
4.2. Where possible, sodium hypochlorite solution yielding 20,000 ppm available chlorine was used, and was prepared each day from a stock 14-15% solution (Hay's Chemicals Ltd, Leeds). Where the use of hypochloriie was impractical, 2M sodium hydroxide was utilised, and was prepared daily from a stock 32-35% solution (Hay's Chemicals Ltd, Leeds).
<P>
4.3. The experiments were conducted within three separate locations on a single site. Movement of materials between these locations was accompanied by decontamination of containers. Personnel also changed their protective clothing except for wellington boots which were scrubbed with hypochlorite. Where there was a possibility of spillage of infected material, floors and working surfaces were covered with disposable polythene sheeting. In all respects, the procedures for decontamination and prevention of cross contamination were those followed for the BSE experiment.
<P>
<H2>5. Bacteriological screening</H2>
5.1. Although scrupulous measures were adopted to prevent cross-contamination of the experimental samples with BSE agent, it was recognised that the starting materials would be contaminated with conventional microorganisms. Bacteriological screening of the MBM samples was carried out by Q Laboratories Ltd, Preston, UK, the brain macerate and tallow samples were screened at the Neuropathogenesis Unit.
<P>
<H2>6. Bioassay of BSE infectivity</H2>
6.1. Weanling RIII/FaDk-ro mice were used for bioassay because they had been shown to have shorter incubation periods with BSE agent than other mouse genotypes; they were injected by the combined intracerebral (0.02 ml) and intraperitoneal (0.5 ml) routes.
<P>
6.2. To assay its infectivity titre, the pooled scrapie brain macerate was homogenised in sterile antibiotic solution containing 5,000 U of penicillin and 5,000 g streptomycin per ml (Northumbria Biologicals Ltd., Cramlington) in a Griffiths tube to give a 10^-1 w/v preparation. Further tenfold dilutions (v/v) were made in antibiotic solution through to 10^-4. Each dilution was injected into weanling RIII mice.
<P>
6.3. Each sample of MBM was homogenised in sterile distilled water to give a 30% (w/v) homogenate using a Virtishear homogeniser (Virtis Co., USA); homogeniser probes were decontaminated between each usage by porous-load autoclaving at 136C for eighteen minutes, followed by washing and re-sterilisation by autoclaving.  The homogenates were centrifuged at 500g for l0 min; the supernates were injected into groups of weanling RIII mice. For those samples assayed quantitatively, aliquots of the supernates were also diluted 1:10 in sterile physiological saline.  Further serial tenfold dilutions were made as appropriate (Table B2).
<P>
6.4. After injection, the mice were observed and scored for the development of clinical neurological disease according to a protocol developed for scrapie in mice. Brains from all mice were immersion-fixed in 10% formol saline. Sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin were prepared from five coronal sections chosen to represent the whole brain, and examined microscopically for the presence of spongiform encephalopathy.
<P>
<H2>7. Results</H2>
7.1. The brain pool macerate contained moderate numbers of Bacillus spp., Micrococcus kristinae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
<P>
7.2. Table B2 shows that the infectivity titre of the scrapie-infected brain-pool macerate was 10^4.5 lD50/g. Since the concentration of this macerate added to the raw materials for rendering was 10%, the infectivity titre of the spiked starting material was 10^3.5 lD50/g. Because the weight of the solid material remaining after rendering is 30% of that of the Starting material, the maximum titre in the resulting MBM would be 10 ^3.5 lD50/0.3g (or per ml of 30% suspension of MBM).
<P>
7.3. Table B3 shows the estimated titre of infectivity surviving in MBM produced by protocols B, D, F, H, J, L and M at 24 January 1996. Titrations have not been conducted on MBM samples C, E, G, 1, K, N, 0 and P.  As of 24 January 1996, no infectivity has been detected in MBM samples from protocols Q, R, S, T and U.
<P>
<H2>8. Discussion</H2>
8.1. At this time (24 January 1996), the results indicate that only the batch pressure rendering Systems simulated in Protocols Q - U achieve total inactivation of the scrapie agent as judged by the starting titre in the brain pool and the indicator systems employed. Other simulations appear to achieve a reduction in infectivity varying from 80 - 2000 fold.
<P>
8.2. Full and final analysis of Phase 2 (scrapie) of the experiment must await the completion of the remaining bioassays for protocols 3 - P, T and U, later in 1996. However, it is thought unlikely that any more results of significance will emerge. The results are presently being considered by the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Germans">Germans</A> to ban import of sheep tissue from Britain</H3></CENTER>

The Times: Britain: October 26 1996 
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY
<P>


GERMANY announced yesterday that it is to ban the import and use of brains, spinal cord and eyes from French and British sheep over 12 months old as a safeguard against "mad cow" disease. The precaution has been prompted by the possibility that BSE might have spread to sheep and could pose a risk to humans.

<P>

"This measure implements for Germany regulations which these countries have already applied to their own areas," a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Bonn said. It is to be put before the German cabinet for approval next month.

<P>

Britain has banned the consumption of sheep heads since the summer but not spinal cords, which are still included in exported sheep carcasses. Last year Britain exported 140,000 tonnes of sheepmeat worth &#163;283 million, of which Germany accounted for &#163;15 million.

<P>

About two thirds of sheepmeat exports are lamb, which would be under 12 months old and therefore not affected by the German ban. The Germans consider sheep under a year old to be too young to be infectious. Brains, spinal cord and eyes are the only tissues thought likely to carry the infection.

<P>

Peter Scott, general secretary of the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers, which represents abattoirs, said: "If other countries followed the German lead, it could create practical problems. Removing the spinal cord from sheep carcasses is more difficult than in cattle because they are normally exported whole and not split in half." France, the biggest importer of British sheepmeat, has banned spinal cord from human consumption but allows the material to be imported, removing it on arrival in France.

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture said: "We cannot comment directly on the German action. Talks have been under way for some time with our European partners to get agreement on standardised procedures for handling sheepmeat."

<P>

Professor John Collinge, one of the Government's scientific advisers, called earlier this week for tests on sheep to see if cases of scrapie, the ovine form of spongiform encephalopathy, might show similarities to BSE. Humans have been eating scrapie-infected sheep for centuries without harm but scientists now accept that some cases of scrapie may be of BSE origin.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#009F00">British beef is perfectly safe,
pledges Major</FONT></H3>
<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By George Jones, Charles Clover, and Helen Cranford
in Brussels<BR>
<BR>
Daily Telegraph ... Friday 25 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>John Major declared British beef <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;perfectly
safe&quot;</FONT></B> yesterday. He said there was no new public health
concern, despite the strongest evidence yet of a link between BSE and the
human version of the disease, <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
He said the Government had taken all the necessary precautions and was
supported by one of the Government's leading scientific advisers. But the
European Commission - while apparently ruling out the imposition of tougher
measures - made clear the ban on British beef exports would remain.<BR>
<BR>
Franz Fischler, EU Agriculture Commissioner, said in France: &quot;What
British scientists have discovered shows how serious the crisis is. &quot;We
must make sure all the measures which have been put in place are maintained,
because now we have to face the fact that the disease can be transmitted
to people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He was speaking after briefing a French parliamentary committee on the
seven-month-old beef crisis. The EU banned British beef exports in March
after Britain reported a suspected link between <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B> disease and <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
In Brussels, an EU spokesman said the measures already approved by Europe
at the Florence summit in June had taken into account the <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;worst
scenario&quot;</FONT></B> possibility. &quot;From a scientific point of
view, this should not change anything. All measures taken since 1989 have
been based on the assumption that one day it might be shown that there
is a link,&quot; the EU spokesman said.<BR>
<BR>
Earlier, Mr Major led a concerted effort by ministers and scientific advisers
to calm fears over evidence showing a critical similarity between the new
type of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> and BSE.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's no new, fresh public health concern. People can eat beef
as safely today as they could yesterday and I think it is perfectly safe.&quot;
He said the latest research was a &quot;further endorsement&quot; of the
suspicion of a link which had resulted in the Government first taking action
in the late 1980s to ban contaminated cattle feed.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;It's not conclusive yet but it adds to the
evidence that there might be a link,&quot;</FONT></B> said Mr Major. <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;
There's no need for any more action and, because the action has been taken,
there's no need for the EU to panic and change its views.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Scientists would not know for another year or more if Britain was
facing an epidemic of the new form of</B> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>
<B>linked to infected beef products<BR>
<BR>
</B>Prof John Pattison, chairman of the Spongiform Encepalopathy Advisory
Committee, said precautions now in place meant that he would still be prepared
to eat beef from British cattle himself &quot;without any reservations&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;All the necessary restrictions on British beef going into the human
food chain are now in place,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
However, he added that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">scientists would not know
for another year or more if Britain was facing an epidemic of the new form
of</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">linked
to infected beef products</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Tony Blair, the Labour leader, used the latest evidence to attack the Government's
&quot;incompetent&quot; handling of the beef crisis.<BR>
<BR>
But Douglas Hogg, Agriculture Minister, said no one, neither ministers
nor the rendering industry, could be held liable in the courts for the
BSE epidemic.<BR>
<BR>
Farmers could only pursue the rendering industry through the courts for
the cost of BSE if negligence could be proved.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Negligence depends on doing that which ought not to be done, or not
doing that which ought to be done, judged by the canons of the day. I don't
think negligence could be established,&quot; said Mr Hogg.<BR>
<BR>
British beef was not only best but also had been first in the world in
listening to consumer concerns.<BR>
<BR>
In the Commons, Robin Cook, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said the
public knew that the BSE crisis was made in Britain.<BR>
<BR>
<B>* David Brown, Agriculture Editor, writes: The Festival of British Beef,
staged in London yesterday, was a good idea at the time.<BR>
<BR>
</B>What better way to restore confidence than to hire a prime site in
London to demonstrate British beef is the safest and best in the world.
Then up popped the scientists again to spoil the party. As festivals go,
it was a pretty low-key affair. There was no dancing in the streets, no
colourful balloons or flags and bunting.<BR>
<BR>
Even as it began Angela Browning, Food Minister, and Don Curry, chairman
of the Meat and Livestock Commission, realised that months of planning
and &pound;45,000 it cost to stage were likely to go down the tubes.<BR>
<BR>
Fortune did not favour Mrs Browning as she opened the event. Her expected
audience of 500 catering trade delegates was much diminished by a Tube
bomb scare. Undeterred, the food minister was upbeat. <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;British
beef can be used with confidence,&quot;</FONT></B> she said.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="009F00">By Sian Clare, Political Correspondent, PA News<BR><BR>
PA News    ...   Fri 25 Oct 1996</FONT><BR><BR>
Europe has hardened its attitude to the beef crisis after fresh scientific evidence linking <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease to the fatal human brain condition <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT>.<BR><BR>
As a top Government scientific adviser raised the spectre of a <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> epidemic, Brussels warned yesterday that the new research exposed the serious risk facing consumers.<BR><BR>
The European Commission warned there could be no relaxation of the ban on British beef products and said there was now no excuse for further delay by the Government in carrying out the selective cull of 147,000 cattle.<BR><BR>
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said the research &quot;shows that the risk of transmission to humans is a fact - it is not the proof, but it is one more proof&quot;.<BR><BR>
The strongest evidence to date that the new strain of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease is caused by BSE, or <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease, was produced by British scientists.<BR><BR>
They discovered that a new strain of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> found in 12 young people over the past two years is distinct from other types, and almost indistinguishable from BSE.<BR><BR>
But the Prime Minister, backed by farmers, yesterday embarked on a fresh drive to convince the public that British beef is safe and urged the EU not to &quot;panic&quot;.<BR><BR>
He insisted that the Government had been taking precautions to safeguard the meat since the risk of a link between BSE and <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> was first suggested in the late 1980s.<BR><BR>
&quot;There's no new, fresh public health concern. People can eat beef as safely today as they could yesterday, and I think it is perfectly safe,&quot; Mr Major declared.<BR><BR>
He was supported by Professor John Pattison, chairman of the Spongiform Encepalopathy Advisory Committee, who insisted the precautions now in place meant he was prepared to eat British beef &quot;without any reservations&quot;.<BR><BR>
But he said scientists would not know for another year or more whether people who ate infected beef before the precautions were introduced in 1989 could become ill.<BR><BR>
Experts fear a <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> epidemic could be on the scale of the Aids-HIV crisis, which has resulted in 26,000 cases in Britain in the past 13 years.<BR><BR>
&quot;We are not in a position yet to exclude the possibility of those numbers of cases,&quot; Professor Pattison said.<BR><BR>
The new research is a serious blow to Britain's beleaguered beef industry, which now fears tougher action by the EU.<BR><BR>
Beef is almost certain to be on the agenda when Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg attends the European Agriculture Council with Europe's other farming ministers in Luxembourg on Monday.<BR>

<HR>

<H3>Gelatin Without BSE-Infectivity can Only be produced From <A NAME="healthy">healthy</A> animals</H2>
<A HREF="mailto:roland.heynkes@t-online.de">Roland Heynke</A>, Germany
<P>

The agents of scrapie and BSE are extremely resistant to physical and chemical influences. Compared with the conditions during gelatin production, in experiments they withstood an acidity, which was ten times as high, an alkaline concentration twenty times as high and a drying temperature that was about 220&#176;C higher. As the procedures of gelatin production can not be tightened up without significant losses of yield and quality, gelatin can only be produced safely from healthy animals. In order to get a reliable test for the agent in man, animal, and raw material, it has to be shown, whether the altered prion protein is identical with the agent. Therefore a simple experiment has been proposed, by which the prion theory can be proved or refuted within a few days.<P>

<H3>Gelatin is everywhere</H3>

Gelatin is a primary product with an extraordinary wide field of application, used for quality improvement of innumerable foodstuffs and medicaments. It serves for supplementary source of protein, carrier material, bonding agent, stabiliser and emulsifier. It is also used as an aid for frothing up, flavour enhancement, common salt replacement, clearing of drinks and as a collagen source for dietetics.

<P>

It can be found in jelly, jellied meat and aspic, in ice cream, some margarines, sweets like gummy bears, soft caramels, marshmallows, meringues, liquorice and cream-filled chocolate cakes, in gateau fillings and desserts, in milk products like yoghurt and crmes as well as in pies and convenience food. Cream and foam are often made of jelly with beaten egg white, whipped cream or cream cheese.

<P>

Quality-tested wines, cider, apple juice and in some countries also beer, are freed from blurrings, tannin agent and bitter constituents with the help of gelatin. From fizzy drinks it is not removed at all. In milk-shakes with fruit or vegetable additives gelatin prevents the milk from curdling. Vegetable juices are thickened with gelatin and enriched with vitamins and minerals. In tinned meat gelatin binds the meat juice. In some cases salami and pepper sausage are protected from drying up by gelatin.

<P>

The pharmaceutical industries use gelatin in soft and hard medicament capsules, for binding in tablets and dragees, in form of sponges for treating wounds and as a colloid to expand the plasma after severe losses of blood. They are also included in vitamin compounds and cosmetics. People having problems with their nail growth or with their joints and cartilage are treated with gelatin. Animal food industries sometimes use gelatin in substitute milk products for calves.

<P>

As gelatin is so omnipresent, nobody in the industrial nations can avoid its assimilation. Therefore even vegetarians have to doubt whether the production of gelatin from slaughter wastes of pigs and cattle totally removes BSE infectivity.

<H3>BSE-safety disputed</H3>

The World Health Organization writes in its data sheet 113 and in the report WHO/EMC/DIS/96.147 about the conference on April, 2 and 3 1996 in Geneva they held together with the FAO and the OIE (Office International des Epizooties) on human and outher transmissible spongiform Encephalopathies: "Gelatin in the food chain is considered to be safe if produced by a manufactoring process utilizing production conditions which has been demonstrated to significantly inactivate any residual infectiviy". This is as true as it is trivial. Unfortunately there is no sensitive test for low titers of infectivity, so that this condition can not be fulfilled. The reasons are the short lifespan of rodent recipients and the necessity to overcome the species barrier between cattle and rodents.

<P>

The Press Release WHO/28 - 3 April 1996 (Rev.1 15 April 1996) garbles this insignificant but true assessment to a misleading and scientifically untenable contention: "Gelatin is considered safe for human consumption since its preparation involves a chemical extraction process that destroys BSE infectivity". BSE-infectiousness is also destroyed during cooking and baking, but nevertheless anyone with a bit of sense would not eat the cooked brain from a cow which died of BSE. This attitude is especially questionable, as WHO knew about a scottish study which had been ordered by the European gelatin industries in Scotland in 1993. A scaled-down simulation of the acid and the lime treatment, the two chemical key stages in the manufacturing process of gelatin, did not reveal any reduction of scrapie infectivity.

<P>

Likewise in the report WHO/EMC/DIS/96.147 it is explicitly pointed out, that parts of cattle destined for the pharmaceutical industries should only be bought from practically BSE-free countries. The reason is the fact that the applicable inactivating procedures can only reduce the risk of infection with the BSE agent, which is extremely resistant to physical and chemical influences. The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products in London decided, that gelatin for medicaments should not come from cattle slaughtered in Britain.

<P>

British slaughter wastes contain considerable amounts of infectivity and there is no manufactoring process utilizing production conditions which has been demonstrated to significantly inactivate any residual infectiviy. Nvertheless EU-commissioner Franz Fischler pushed through a lifting of the export ban for British gelatin, on condition that it is produced according to the procedure applied by the German gelatin factories Stoess AG [6]. Therefore it is interesting to compare the conditions of this procedure with those of the experiments, which the agents have demonstrably withstood.

<H3>The raw material in gelatin production</H3>

About 65 % of the world-wide produced gelatin comes from hidesplits, connective tissue and the bones of cattle [6]. Otherwise pigs serve for source material [6]. Only in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand also sheep are used [6]. The quality of the gelatin is influenced by the source of supply, which in Europe traditionally is mainly from pigs in the case of gelatin for food and medicaments [6].

<P>

There is such a huge demand of raw material, that a limitation to very young or especially natural living animals is not possible [6]. But at least in Germany only slaughter wastes from animals, which are released for human consumption, are used for the production of gelatin for food and medicaments. Because however, up to now BSE can only be diagnosed very lately, most of the infected animals are not identified. Thus the veterinarian's check-up before slaughtering does not provide a remarkable protection against BSE and scrapie.

<P>

It is obvious, that hidesplits, connective tissues and bones of BSE-infected animals are far less infectious than the central nervous system. But as long as the agents are not definitely identified and not detectable by any sensitive test, not any tissue and body liquid can seriously be declared free of infectivity. Skin and bones from infected animals must also be supposed to be infectious, because they are well supplied with blood and nerves. The infectivity of blood has been demonstrated as early as 1962 with a goat [5] and among others in 1992 with human beings [7]. That this did not work with cattle until now, is due to the very low sensitivity of the common functional test and absolutely insufficient efforts made in this concern.

<P>

The 10-15 kg raw material from one cow disappear in production batchs of 20,000 to 100,000 kg. It is then diluted with other gelatin about the factor 10-100 to achieve the final products [6]. Thus the agent is certainly diluted to a great extent, but at the same time it is distributed to a very large number of end products.

<H3>The infectivity withstands acidulation and alkaline treatment</H3>

Bones are splintered into pieces of less than 12 mm diameter. Their fat content becomes reduced to below 2% with hot water and then they are dried for a minimum of 30 minutes at a temperature of well over 100&#176;C [6]. This procedure removes much of the infectiousness of the raw material, but certainly not all of it.

<P>

The cleaned pieces of bone are freed from phosphate minerals with 4% hydrochloric acid, at a pH below 1.5, so that only the collagen structure remains [6]. This procedure takes five days, but begins with an already used, more diluted hydrochloric acid, which becomes replaced by a fresh one only toward the end of the treatment [6]. The finally reached pH 1.5 corresponds to a concentration of less than 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Unfortunately, the effect of this long-lasting treatment with a weak acid on the BSE agent has never been published yet. According to one publication however, the effect of acids in contrast to strong caustic solutions seems to be only temporary [3]. In an experiment the treatment with 1 M hydrochloric acid turned out to be insufficient [2]. This indicates, that the acid treatment during the gelatin production is quite probably not adequate to inactivate the agent.

<P>

More than 90 % of the gelatin won from cattle receives an additional treatment. It normally takes about 50 days with pH higher than 12.5 to open cross connections between the collagen molecules [6]. Even a pH 13 corresponds to a sodium hydroxide concentration of only 0.1 M. Sometimes the incubation time is being shortened from 50 to 14 days by increasing the concentration up to 0.3 M (6(. As the infectivity is not fully inactivated by 2 M sodium hydroxide (8(, this lime treatment cannot be considered to be safe. The non published scottish study which had been ordered by the European gelatin industries demonstrated no measurable reduction of scrapie infectivity after days of treatment with acid or lime (personal communication(. Furthermore the lime treatment is only applied for raw material from cattle (6(. The delicate skin of young pigs is not treated with the caustic solution. For them an acid treatment during one day is sufficient. The effect on BSE agents however is comparable to the demineralization of bones.

<H3>Heat resistence of the infectious agent</H3>

After having been extracted step by step with water of increasing temperature, the gelatin is sterilized at 140&#176;C for 4 seconds. Of course, also this treatment is not suitable to fully inactivate the BSE-agent. This was demonstrated by an experiment, in which brain samples with an average weight of 340 g were autoclaved during 1 hour at 134&#176;C or for at least 18 minutes at temperatures of 135oC or 134-138oC. This was not sufficient either to inactivate scrapie- and BSE agents. So 14 out of 22 mice fell ill from the brain of hamsters which had been autoclaved during 1 hour at 134oC. Hamster brain that had been autoclaved at 134-138oC during 18 minutes, killed all of 19 mice. It is interesting that a longer period of time of autoclaving does not result in a more efficient inactivation. Although autoclaving reduced the infectiousness by 7 orders of magnitude, it was still fit for lethal infections. Drying material is even more difficult to sterilise. Amylid fibrils from scrapie-infected brains of hamsters remained infectious after autoclaving and partially even after one hour at 360&#176;C (1(.

<H3>Total inactivation impossible</H3>

On the whole the procedures used for gelatin production certainly are suited to reduce the infectiousness of BSE-contaminated raw material. But it is just as certain, that hereby a complete inactivation is not possible.

<P>

There is not any indication that a minimun dose is required for the transmission of BSE to other species. On the contrary, the characteristic stability of the agent and the defenselessness of the immune system seem to indicate, that extremely small doses up to only one single molecule could be enough for an infection. On the other hand, from all the cattle that got infected foodstuff and the thousands of recipients of infectious growth hormone, only comparatively few fell ill. Thus there must be an individually different, but unknown lethal dose. Not mortally infected human beings and animals can nethertheless represent sources of infection. Therefore it is important to distinguish lethal from sublethal infections, and at the same time the non-mortal infections have to be recognized much more as a problem.

<H3>Open questions</H3>

From the scientific pont of view it is surprising, that until now there has been published no simulation of the gelatin manufacturing process with highly infectious material. This would be necessary to calculate the degree of agent inactivation. To detect even very low levels of infectivity, we need a for example immunologic system, that directly marks the agent instead of functional tests with the injection of test material into the brains of mice. Beforehand however, the agent has to be identified. Therfore scientists have been searching for a scrapie virus since decades. This approach was without success and by combining available facts, the virus-theory can already be excluded [4].

<H3>Proof or disproof of the prion theory</H3>

If the prion theory was right, we would already know quite a lot about the agents and we could immediately detect them with available antibody-tests. Unfortunately this already fairly old theory has not been proved or refuted despite of numerous attempts. However, this could be done within a few days, with an experiment, which in principle has been published repeatedly. It only has to be carried out and analyzed somewhat more sophisticated. Therefore one has to mix radioactively labelled prion proteins with infectious material in a test tube and to record the increase of amount of protease resistant and labelled prion protein. According to the virus-hypothesis this increase would be at most linear, because only driven by the added infectious material, which could not reproduce. In accordance with the prion-theory the newly transformed prion protein would contribute to conversion of the rest. In that case an accelerating increase of the protease resistant and radioactive prion protein could be observed, until the reserves of normal prion protein will run out.

Listserve commentary 10.10.96
<P>

The change in rendering started in 1974, but the decisive (to 
cause BSE outbreak) changes probably occurred in 1980.
Changes below:<P>
  
*1974  Start of a low temp/short time/vacuum system in the 
Midlands (Hearth sp?)  Produced greaves which were sent to a 
Northern solvent extraction plant.<P>

*1977  Start of a low temp/short time/vacuum system in the 
North (Duncaster sp?).  Produced greaves which were sent to 
on-site solvent extraction plant.<P>


*January 1980 (possibly late Dec 79')  Northern solvent 
extraction plant shut down.  Both plants above started to sell 
proteins without the fat extracted via solvents.<P>


*July 15, 1980  Startup of a new low temp/short time/vacuum 
system in the South (Silverton?).  NO solvent extraction.  
(This site appears to be around BSE's ground zero.)<P>


What this shows is that from 1974 to 1980 3 facilities, which 
processed about 30% of the ruminant material in the UK, 
switched from older systems which acheived 2 log inactivation 
potential to newer energy efficient systems with NO apparent 
inactivation potential.  Within an 8 month period in 1980 the 
third low temp system started up and the other two existing low 
temp systems discontinued to send their finished products 
through the solvent extraction step.  <P>


The solvent extraction process provided only a small amount of 
inactivation compared to the 2 log inactivation previously 
employed on the materials processed at these 3 sites.  See Dr. 
Taylor's comments on solvent extraction from the May 13, 1996 
symposium in Riverdale MD found within Mark Varner's BSE site 
at:     http://dairy.umd.edu:80/varner/tsepgm.html <P>


I agree with the *hypothesis*, stated by Ray Bradley and posted 
by Ralph Blanchfield, that the BSE outbreak was triggered when 
the discontinuance of solvent extraction occurred.  But it was 
not the sole cause, the UK was bordering upon the infectious 
dose already.
<HR width =24%>

If such lengths are needed, is there any hope of reasonably economic
methods of decontamination of TSE-infected material?  Taylor
claimed that 4/15 rendering processes produced MBM with detectable
BSE infectivity, i.e. 11/15 seemed to decontaminate infected MBM, as
assessed by "mouse bioassay".<P>

Bovine
brain infected with the BSE agent was used to spike material
processed in pilot scale facsimiles of rendering processes which are
used within the European Union, and 3 which are not.  The raw
materials for experimental rendering represented those used in
practice, and consisted of appropriate proportions of BSE-infected
brain tissue, bovine or porcine intestine, and bovine bone, MBM, and
tallow were produced from the rendered tissues.  Suspensions of all
the MBM samples were assayed in inbred mice for BSE infectivity, and
2 of the tallow fractions were tested similarly.  4/15 processes
produced MBM with detectable BSE infectivity.  Neither of the tallow
samples had detectable infectivity.
<P>

The published rendering inactivation study cited by  above 
(D.M. Taylor) demonstrated that conditions found in 11 of the 
14 "systems" studied achieved a minimum of a 2 log inactivation 
of the BSE agent (100 fold).  The companion research study on 
scrapie, yet unpublished, demonstrated that conditions found in 
2 "systems", both using pressure, achieved a minimum 3 log 
inactivation (1000 fold).  So the question becomes "Are these 
levels of inactivation sufficient enough to prevent the 
transmission of BSE to cattle if/when a single BSE animal is 
processed into an ingredient for use in cattle feed."<P>


>From 1940 to 1980 rendering equipment which fell into the 
minimum 2 log inactivation category were the only major type 
used in the UK for processing ruminant material. BTW, heavy 
meat and bone meal feeding to cattle started in the UK around 
1940 due to war time reduction in supply of alternative feed 
ingredients.  Nothing sinister here, they just needed to feed 
the population.  <P>


Around 1980 three of about 7 of the major rendering facilities 
in the UK were converted to "energy efficient" systems. 
Remember the oil crisis?  These systems evaporated water under 
lower temperatures, had much shorter material retention times 
and operated under hypobaric conditions (vacuum).  D.M. 
Taylor's inactivation research later demonstrated that no 
detectable level of reduction in infectivity occurred under the 
operating conditions normally found in these low temp/short 
time/vacuum systems.<P>


The rest is history, BSE appeared around 1985.  We need to ask 
ourselves why not in 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975 
or 1980?  Where prevention of the potential to spread BSE via 
cattle feed is the goal (vs. eradication of existing BSE)  
would not a mandate to use equipment which achieves a minimum 2 
or 3 log inactivation coupled with removal of known high risk 
TSE sources be a consideration?  (ie: North America)

Around 1980 three of about 7 of the major rendering facilities 
in the UK were converted to "energy efficient" systems. 
Remember the oil crisis?  These systems evaporated water under 
lower temperatures, had much shorter material retention times 
and operated under hypobaric conditions (vacuum).  D.M. 
Taylor's inactivation research later demonstrated that no 
detectable level of reduction in infectivity occurred under the 
operating conditions normally found in these low temp/short 
time/vacuum systems.<P>

On BSE genesis in the UK:  there was another
reason for the use of these processes and that was to improve the
feeding quality of the MBM. The lower temperatures resulted in much less
denaturing of the proteins and thus a premium product of higher
digestibility. One feed where it would pay to pay a premium is in calf
weaner pellets. In many UK herds I know of the calf weaner pellets look
to have been the source of the infection. <P>

The rest is history, BSE appeared around 1985.  We need to ask 
ourselves why not in 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975 
or 1980?  Where prevention of the potential to spread BSE via 
cattle feed is the goal (vs. eradication of existing BSE), 
would not a mandate to use equipment which achieves a minimum 2 
or 3 log inactivation coupled with removal of known high risk 
TSE sources be a consideration?  (ie: North America) <P>

In the case of an outbreak in the process of brewing up, these
reductions will not be enough to prevent the feed from being infective,
as we know from the UK. They may well stop one from starting. Banning
MBM as a feed should be avoided as it provides many conservational,
ecological and economic advantages. However we are no longer in the
position that the UK was in the mid 80's, when little was known of the
disease. It might be prudent to take more measures than those that have
been completely effective for the first 80 years of this century.<P>

One measure would be to ban the use of MBM for feeds designed to be used
by cattle under 1 year, and certainly in calf weaner pellets. It is
usual in the UK to use a low cost ration after weaning that is entirely
derived from vegetable feeds and by-products and the animal would not
come across a premium feed until the final finishing (beef) or until it
entered the dairy herd. 
<P>
As a result beef animals would be completely
safe even if the MBM had become slightly infectious by chance since
finishing only occurs in the final six months or so which one can be
certain will not cause any expression of BSE in the carcass. The
resultant animals will be BSE-free, even if the feed has trace
infection. (Actually even if the feed has high levels of infection). <BR>
<I>[This is highly speculative -- webmaster]</I>
<P>
As
far as the dairy herd is concerned any possible infection would only
start when the animal enters the herd aged 2 to 3 years old. It has been
suggested that adult animals are significantly more resistant to
infection than young ones  and the typical
incubation period of 3-5 years would mean that most animals would leave
the dairy herd before expressing the disease, or producing an infective
carcass, even if coming across trace infection. Those smaller numbers
staying up to 10 years would provide a useful marker for assaying any
potential disease and are valuable for public confidence. Since the use
of MBM in tonnage terms for this young cattle feed is a very small
proportion of the total, you would lose very little in imposing these
regulations. Also incinerate all skulls complete with brain in the
US. This alone would probably give a negative growth
rate for any infectivity.
<P>
I hope that the compensation that you would give to your farmers who
have a case of BSE is VERY generous for whole herd slaughter. Picking up
cases early is very important. Generous compensation to cover the real
replacement cost of cattle (not their 'valuation') and loss of earnings
whilst the herd is being re-established is essential. If having a case
of BSE results in bankrupcy or severe financial loss, then expect many
cases to be concealed. It is VASTLY cheaper to do this than have a
problem later.
----<BR>
<B>Change in rendering started in 1980-81?</B><BR>

The story is usually related to a combined abandonment of the solvent
extraction process to remove fat, and reduction in heating, around
that time. This was in fact part of the rationale in the hasty
"detective work" in early 1988 to try to ascertain the cause of BSE
and the reason for it. The conclusion did suggest measures which,
after a time lag, mainly due to incubation period,  have proved
effective in bringing about dramatic year-on-year reductions in new
BSE cases, but the historical facts are wrong.
<P>

As an example of the "official" account of the story, the following is
a verbatim account given by Ray Bradley, BSE Coordinator, MAFF Central
Veterinary Laboratory, at a BSE seminar on 29 February 1996
<P>

"The precipitating factor causing BSE was a sudden cessation of
hydrocarbon solvent extraction of tallow in the rendering system. Why did this occur? Well, this process probably inactivated the
causal agent sufficiently to prevent disease and when that procedure
was stopped independently by the rendering companies for commercial
reasons, this permitted sufficient infectivity to pass into the feed
and cause disease. It was then recycled and initiated the escalation
in the epidemic from mid 1989 onwards. How had the solvent extraction
of tallow prevented the disease?  We think by the double heating
process which this particular rendering utilised and in particular the
use of a second wet heat stage using steam in a low fat environment.
When did that happen? It happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
especially in the period 1981/82 when cattle were first exposed to
sufficient agent to cause disease which was first recognised five
years or so later after the incubation period was complete".
<P>

The reality of what happened and why, is as follows:<BR>

There are two separate industries involved in the production of animal
feedstuffs based on meat and bonemeal.  They are the rendering
industry, making and milling the meat and bonemeal, and the feed
compounding industry. The renderers do not normally sell their product
direct to farmers but to the compounders.
<P>
 
After the main rendering process at high temperature, much of the fat
(tallow) was removed by pressing, leaving behind the "greaves"
containing 8-10% residual fat. Delving further into detailed history,
with a now-retired technologist who was active in the rendering
industry at that time, it transpires that, in practice, "many of the
older batch cookers, although rated to work up to 130 deg C , were
frequently operated at atmospheric pressure to give increased
throughput and to improve drainage of free fat at the end of the
cook".  
<P>
Why was solvent extraction ever involved? It was because it
was virtually impossible, in the small-scale batch processing plants
that existed in the early 1960s and before, to mill the meat and
bonemeal without first removing the residual fat, by solvent
extraction. Up to the early 1960s, the renderers therefore carried out
solvent extraction, and sold the milled product to compounders on a
commercial specification of 50% protein, which anyway could only be
achieved by removing all the fat residues by solvent extraction (the
fat-in-solvent solution was then evaporated to leave the by-product,
tallow).  After extraction,  the residual solvent then was removed
from the product by "stripping" it with steam.  
<P>  

But tallow was increasingly being added as an ingredient during
compounding,  as an energy supplement.  Realisation gradually dawned
that it was ridiculous to go to all the trouble, expense, hazard and
environmental pollution involved in removing residual tallow by
solvent extraction, only for it to be added back in compounding. This
coincided with a worldwide trend to move from a larger number of
renderers operating small-scale batch processing to fewer large-scale
continuous processing plants of modern design, on which, moreover, it
was possible to mill the product containing residual fat. This led to
the increasing adoption of a commercial specification of a 45% protein
meal with 8-10% fat, which could, of course,  be achieved without
solvent extraction. 
<P>
So solvent extraction became eliminated.  And, of
course, where there was no solvent extraction, there was also
no need for a post-extraction steam-stripping  to remove the solvent
residues. It should be noted that this trend started with the largest
renderers back in the early 1960s, not in 1981, as the mythology would
have it. It should be also be noted that these changes were taking
place world-wide, not just in the UK, and, moreover, that there was a
substantial export of UK meat and bone meal cattle feed. The pace was
accelerated by the oil crisis in the early 1970s and in the UK by the
Flixborough disaster in 1974 resulting in drastic tightening up of
safety procedures in UK industry.
<P>

So the combined effect of removing the two unnecessary processes,
interlinked with the changes in technology that made it possible, the
increase in  operating scale and the concentration of the industry
into fewer larger units, started in the early 1960s.

If the ruminant feed hypothesis is correct, at least as a major factor
(as appears to be confirmed by the dramatic reduction in new cases in
the last few years), and if the change in rendering was the key
factor, it will have started in the early 1960s  rather than around
1981 (as the mythology states). 
<P>

Finally, so far research to investigate procedures to inactivate BSE
infectivity indicates that it is highly unlikely that the
steam-stripping process to remove solvent residues could have been
sufficient to inactivate it.

Lancet Vol 348  August 31, 1996
<P>

SIR,
<P>
We found grossly visible brain tissue (confirmed microscopically) in the left and right branches of the main pulmonary artery of 2 5-5% cattle aher slaughter. The brain tissue varied in size between several millimetres to as large as 14 cm (figure). The emboli were caused by the stunning process used at slaughter. The stunning device used in the abattoir visited was a pneumatic-actuated penetrating captive bolt. This model, &quot;The Knocker&quot;, by Hantover, has been in use in the USA since <B>1982 </B>and available in the UK since the early <B>1980s. </B>Although pneumatic stunning has not been recommended since the March, 1996, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) scare in the UK, pneumatic stunning is not prohibited and may be in use in the UK and in other countries.
<P>

Lungs are designated as edible tissue in the UK and are usually minced to put into sausages' because they are not part of the specified offal ban.2 Cooking temperatures required for sausage production are not aufficient to inactivate the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrP'), which is regarded to be the probable agent responsible for BSE. Therefore, lungs represent a possible source of human exposure to brain tissue and PrPS~ in the UK.
<P>
Macro-embolisation of brain tissue to the lungs as a result of head trauma has been recognised in human beings for more than 60 years. Cerebral emboli have been found in human pulmonary arteries as a result of falls, gunshot, automobile accidents,+ and difficult neonatal delivery.' McMillan estimated the incidence of embolism of cerebral tissue in the lungs after fatal human head trauma at 2%.' Brain proteins enter the circulation of human beings after head trauma. Creatine kinase brain isoenzyme (CKBB), a brain-specific protein, is found at elevated concentrations after head injury and serum CKBB have been used to quantify brain damage.9 CKBB is 80 kilodaltons while a prion protein is only 30 kilodaltons, and the scrapie isoform of prion protein is approximately 40 kilodaltons. It is likely that prion proteins are found throughout the bodies of animals stunned for slaughter.

<P>
SIR,
<BR>
It would be unfortunate if inaccurate information in Garland's letter (Aug 31, p 610) were to go unchallenged. There is, at present, no evidence that bovine lungs present a source of human exposure to bovine brain tissue in the UK. The type of captive-bolt stunner which injects compressed air into the cranial cavity to disrupt the brain structure is not used on cattle in the UK, and it would be an offence to mince lungs to put into sausages. It is true that lungs are not Specified Bovine Material, but their use in the way described has been prevented by the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984 (SI 1984, no 1566).
<P>

Since becoming aware some weeks ago of Garland's claims we have arranged for lungs from ten cattle killed by the usual type of captive-bolt pistol to be examined for brain emboli. None were found, but the study is being repeated using lungs from 200 cattle killed in ten different slaughterhouses

SIR,<BR>
We thoroughly researched our letter. Hantover presented &quot;The Knocker&quot; to the Institute for Food Research (UK) in 1989. The Institute thoroughly tested it and proclaimed it to be wonderful. The UK Humane Slaughter Association has pneumatic stunners listed as being acceptable for use in the UK. Hantover confirmed to us by fax in May, 1996, that &quot;The Knocker&quot; is still sold in the UK.
<P>

&quot;The Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulation 1984 (SI 1984 no 1566) states that mammalian lungs may be used in cooked but not uncooked meat products. An e-mail from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (MAFF) on June 21, 1996, informed us &quot;In Statutory Instrument 1984/1566 'cooked', in relation to a food, means subjected to a process of cooking throughout the whole food so that the food is sold for consumption without further cooking, and 'uncooked' shall be construed accordingly&quot;. Cooked sausages means sausages like frankfurters and pepperonis.

<P>

The Bntish Veterinary Association faxed to us on May 28, 1996, &quot;Just to confirm that it is perfectly legal for bovine lungs to enter the human food chain, though they are more commonly used in pet feed&quot;. The fax continues, that &quot;Lungs can be legally sold in their fresh state but would normally be minced and perhaps be mixed with sausage meat in order to cheapen the mix&quot;.
<P>
We suggest that Taylor's sample size of ten cattle is much too small to find neurological tissue. His proposed study is also too small: he should include at least 100 slaughterhouses.
<P>

The presence of brain emboli in the lungs of people after non-invasive head trauma has been known for over 60 years. Reason dictates that any method of stunning to the head will result in the likelihood of brain emboli in the lungs or, indeed, other parts of the body.</P>

 <h3><center>Fury as crew leave 70,000 sheep to die in ship <a NAME="blaze">blaze</a></center></h3>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY<br>

The Times: World News: September 5 1996
<p>


ANIMAL welfare campaigners expressed outrage yesterday that nearly 70,000 sheep had been left to die on a blazing Panamanian cargo ship en route from Australia to the Middle East.



The vessel, the 20,884-ton <i>Uniceb</i>, which set sail from Fremantle in Western Australia on August 23, bound for Aqaba in Jordan, was reported to be adrift in the Indian Ocean 400 miles northeast of the Seychelles after being abandoned by its crew.

<p>

Hugh Worth, the Western Australian president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the disaster added weight to the organisation's campaign to stop live sheep exports. "It is another classic example of why the trade should be abandoned," he said. "These sheep have been left to a horrific and cruel death."

<p>

All but one of the 55 <i>Uniceb</i> crew were reported to have been rescued by another cargo vessel, the <i>Mineral Century</i>, on Monday after a fire which started in the engine room on Thursday spread to their quarters. Mark Leech, a spokesman for LLP Ltd in Colchester, Essex, which collates shipping accident reports for <i>Lloyd's List</i>, said: "We understand that the chief engineer fell overboard during the evacuation and has been listed as missing. A tug from Djibouti and another livestock transport vessel in the area are heading for the <i>Uniceb</i>."

<p>

There was no immediate news of the fate of the 67,488 sheep which are said to have been housed on the ship's eight cargo decks. The vessel has been carrying sheep from Australia to the Middle East for the past 14 years.

<p>

Martin Potter, head of the farm animal division of the RSPCA in Britain, said: "This is a disgraceful trade which all reasonable people should oppose. I understand that vets are generally not present on board these ships."

<p>

For the past 15 years, Australia has shipped about five million sheep annually to destinations in the Middle East, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain, according to the RSPCA.

<p>

Last year the South African Government turned down a request by domestic meat traders to be allowed to import Australian sheep because of the high number of animals which die during the three-week voyage to the Middle East. Rudolph Bigalke, a former deputy director-general at the South African Department of Agriculture who led a fact-finding mission to Australia, said: "We found that about 100,000 sheep die every year because they refuse to feed or succumb to bacterial infection under the stress of the journeys."

<p>

Large numbers of sheep have died in previous accidents on their way from both Australia and New Zealand to the Middle East, according to the RSPCA. In 1980, 12,000 were drowned when the <i>Star of Shaddia</i> sank in the Red Sea. In a second accident in the same year, 40,605 sheep died in a fire on board the <i>Farid Fares</i>. In 1990, about 10,000 sheep on board the <i>Cormo Express</i> died from lack of proper ventilation.

<p>

Joyce D'Silva, director of Compassion in World Farming, which led last year's protests in Britain against calf exports to Europe, said: "This is another appalling incident in a trade that should have stopped long ago. It shows long-distance transport of livestock cannot be properly policed and is inherently cruel."

<p>

The <i>Uniceb</i> is owned by a Panamanian company, Mazamet Shipping, and managed by Accord Shipping in Bombay.

<p>

Although the sheep could be killed and shipped in carcass form, there is a big demand in the Middle East for live animals which can be slaughtered locally in accordance with Muslim ritual.

<h3><center>Ship fire: 67,000 of the animals were <a NAME="left">left</a> to die</center></h3>
.Associated Press ... 5 September 1996
<p>
PERTH, Australia -- Animal welfare activists called Thursday for an immediate ban on live sheep exports from Australia after 67,000 sheep were left to die on a blazing ship off the east coast of Africa.


The 14,990-ton Uniceb, a Panamanian-registered vessel bound for Jordan from Western Australia, caught fire off Tanzania earlier this week.

Fifty-four crew were rescued by a passing freighter, but the stricken vessel's engineer was lost overboard. No crew remained on board.



A tug is on its way to salvage the ship, which is adrift, Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio reported Thursday. Other unconfirmed reports said the ship might have sunk.

<p>

Australia regularly exports live sheep to the Middle East, where the animals are slaughtered according to Islamic religious requirements.


''I was horrified by the thought of 67,000 sheep being burned to death or perhaps dying from smoke or possibly dying of thirst,'' said animal rights activist Peter Singer.

<p>

Hugh Wirth, president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, condemned the live sheep exports as cruel, saying up to 8 percent of the animals die in transit even during successful voyages.

Although the Australian government admits there are problems with live exports, it said the exports are worth $390 million a year and will continue.<hr>


<H3><A NAME="Debris">Debris</A> indicates shipload of Aussie sheep has sunk</H3>
SYDNEY (Reuters) -- The search for an abandoned ship carrying almost 70,000 Australian sheep has been called off after the discovery of debris, an Australian livestock official said on Tuesday.

''This (the debris) indicates the vessel has sunk,'' Lloyd Beeby, a spokesman for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp., told Reuters.

The debris was discovered just before the four-day search for the 14,990 tonne Uniceb was abandoned in the Indian Ocean north of the Seychelles.

<P>

The search, by a salvage tug, an empty livestock carrier and at one stage a U.S. Air Force aircraft, covered a 200-square-nautical-mile area.


The Panamanian-flagged, Swiss-owned Uniceb was traveling from Fremantle, Western Australia, to the Jordanian port of Aqaba when fire broke out in the engine room a week ago. The ship was about 250 miles east of the Seychelles off the east African coast.

The crew abandoned the Uniceb, leaving 67,000 live sheep on the blazing vessel.

<h3><center>Row over <a NAME="power">power</a> station plan to burn mad cows</center></h3>

The Socialiat Group - European Parliament  9.4.96
<p>
 British Government plans to incinerate mad cow carcasses in power
stations today provoked outrage at the European Parliament.

     Environment committee chairman Ken Collins fired off protest letters
to the European Commission over alleged breaches of EU law on air
pollution.<p>

In a letter to environment commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard, Mr Collins
(Labour, Strathclyde East) writes of 'the potentially catastrophic
environmental consequences of the British Government's plans to dispose
of animal carcasses in power stations.'

     'Animals which have been rendered down into meat and bone meal
should be burnt in high temperature incinerators which have the necessary
safeguards to ensure that noxious fumes and germs do not escape.<p>


     'However, I have been informed that the UK has enacted emergency
powers which circumvent legislation on the safe disposal of potentially
infected meat and bone meal and allow it to be disposed of in power
stations instead.<p>


     'I am concerned that this action may contravene Community directives
in place to limit air pollution from large combustion plants and rules
governing the disposal of hazardous waste.  I hope therefore that your
services will take this up with the British Government as a matter of
urgency to ensure that EU environmental standards are not breached.'

<a NAME="Generators call for indemnity on BSE measures"></a><br>
<h3><center><font COLOR="#009F00">Generators call for indemnity on BSE measures</font></center></h3>
<font COLOR="009F00">By Roland Gribben<br><br>
Daily Telegraph    ...   Saturday 31 August 96</font><br><br>
THE government is coming under pressure from electricity generating companies for indemnities to cover them against "<strong><font COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</strong></font>" risks.<br><br>
They want protection to cover possible health damage claims that may result from burning the remains of cattle in power stations as part of the programme to eradicate BSE. The three generators involved in trials to burn the carcasses, National Power, PowerGen and Scottish Power, are anxious to protect themselves against risks involving their own employees or members of the public who may be affected by emissions from power stations burning the animals.<br><br>
Tests carried out by the three companies have shown there are no practical difficulties in disposing of the remains although there is a danger of damage to boilers from calcium deposits if the mixture of cattle remains and coal is unbalanced. One company source said: "We don't know whether there are any risks but with the history of this disease we don't want to find ourselves faced with any claims in the years ahead."<br><br>
The government has still to decide whether to place contracts for burning several hundred thousand cattle and is expected to baulk at providing guarantees against any damage claims. The generators have made a presentation to a Cabinet sub-committee about the implications of a programme that is likely to stretch over a two- year period and they spelled out some of their concerns.<br><br>
One executive said: "There are enormous sensitivities over the whole issue and we have to be careful how we proceed. We want to help out in the national interest to deal with this emergency but we have to get cast-iron guarantees from the government. We have been talking to them about the legal aspects. We don't want to make a big profit on this arrangement but we have to make sure we are not out of pocket."<br><br>
National Power has been carrying out tests at a special installation at its Didcot power station in Oxfordshire, while PowerGen has been conducting its own experiments at a plant in the Midlands.<br>

Vellore 632 004  India
<P>
Anthrax continues to be a problem in southern India. We have found several endemic foci of animal anthrax and a concomitant increase in human anthrax cases in our region. Although there are reports of human anthrax from other parts of India, we believe there is a lot of under-reporting because there is a paucity of adequate microbiological facilities for the diagnosis of anthrax.
<P>
Vellore, which is one of the towns in North Arcot Ambedkar (NAA) district in southern India, is known to be endemic for anthrax. An increase in the number of cases of anthrax has been documented in both animals and human beings. The increase in human cases after 1990 may be due to increased awareness of this illness among clinicians. A health-information networking system in our district helps to stress the importance of diagnosis and treatment of this disease. The first recorded case of human anthrax in this region was a patient with anthrax meningoencephalitis (AME) in 1977.  Since then, at our institution up to May, 1996, we have seen 49 cases, including an outbreak of AME in 1990, all microbiologically proven. 
<P>
The outbreak occurred in the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh, in a group of villagers who were involved in handling the skin and meat of infected sheep. Since then we have seen two outbreaks among family members; father and son, and a brother and sister. Most of the patients were from NAA or nearby districts of Tamil Nadu. In this region, human anthrax has occurred in the vicinity of animal anthrax. Among the 49 cases there were nine from Vellore town. 
<P>
Most of the cases (31/49) were labourers and 32/49 (65 3%) gave a history of handling animals or animal meat or hide. The other 17 denied history of contact with animals, and in seven of these patients cutaneous lesions were seen close to the eye, suggesting an insect bite, although most worked in the fields and could have acquired the infection by cleaning their faces after handling infected animals, animal products, or soil contaminated with <I>Bacillus anthracis </I> spores. No epidemic has been reported among the numerous tannery workers or in slaughter house pens in this area.
<p>AME was seen in 29 patients; 17 had cutaneous anthrax; and three had septicaemia. The reason there were so many cases of AME could be due to the majority of cutaneous cases being treated by general practitioners. All cases of AME were treated with high doses of intravenous penicillin 2 million U every 2 hours (to 24 million U over 24 hours). Patients with cutaneous anthrax received intravenous penicillin 2 million U 4-hourly for 5 days followed by intramuscular procaine penicillin 800 000 U twice daily for 8 days. All patients with cutaneous manifestations responded to treatment; there were two survivors among AME cases. Of the three patients with septicaemia, one survived.

Development of non-encapsulated avirulent animal vaccine is an important contribution to the control and prevention of anthrax. Routine immunisation of domestic animals with a single inoculation of live Sterne vaccine is presumed to provide protective immunity for about a year, but ideally a booster dose should be given every 6 months. Mass immunisation of the animal population has not been practiced by farmers in our region owing to the ungrounded fear of the vaccine contributing towards disease. Attempts are being made to legislate meat handling, although it is difficult to encourage villagers to discard the meat of dead animals. In southern India, continuous surveillance, mass education, and animal vaccination efforts must be undertaken to control human and animal anthrax.

<H3><CENTER>Abattoirs' <A NAME="fee">fee</A> for BSE cull attacked</CENTER></H3>

By Alison Maitland in London<P>

Financial Times    ...   Wednesday August 14 1996<P>

Abattoirs are being paid far more than their actual costs for killing
cattle under the government's BSE slaughter scheme, it has emerged.

Abattoirs have been paid (UK pounds) 87.50 ($136.50) per animal since
the cull of cattle aged more than 30 months began in early May as part
of UK government efforts to reassure consumers about the safety of beef
in the wake of the crisis over mad cow disease.<P>

But Coopers & Lybrand, the accountancy firm, is believed by abattoir
executives to have put the actual cost at between (UK pounds) 35 and (UK
pounds) 40 in a report for the government.<P>

Abattoir representatives and officials from the Intervention Board, the
government agency administering the cull, start negotiations today on a
fee reduction.

The board refused to disclose its starting figures in the talks but said
Coopers had produced a range of costs that were "considerably less than
(UK pounds) 87.50".<P>

The government's aim is to backdate a fee reduction to June 17. The (UK
pounds) 87.50 fee - thrashed out in an atmosphere of "panic" in May,
according to one abattoir director - was made effective until mid-June
and subject to independent review.<P>

So far 350,000 cattle have been slaughtered, of which 137,675 had been
killed by mid-June. On the basis of actual costs of (UK pounds) 40, that
would have cost abattoirs (UK pounds) 5.5m to mid-June. But they were
paid (UK pounds) 12m - a profit of (UK pounds) 6.5m. This has been
shared among about 60 abattoirs, although half a dozen are conducting
the biggest share of the cull.<P>

Mr Elliot Morley, an agriculture spokesman for the opposition Labour
party, said the Commons public accounts committee should investigate the
cull. "This is public money," he said. "That money should be used in the
most cost-effective way. It's quite wrong for anyone to exploit this
crisis to make excess profits."<P>

Mr Paul Tyler, the centrist Liberal Democrat party's farming spokesman,
said the government should have put the cull out to competitive tender
from the start.
Mr Richard Cracknell, vice-president of the meat federation and managing
director of ABP, one of the UK's largest abattoir groups, warned that
slaughterhouses would pull out if the fees were cut too heavily.<P>

They will argue they need extra money on top of basic costs to cover
profit and "incentive" payments. Mr Cracknell said the cull involved
additional costs and only abattoirs that had invested heavily in
modernising could do "a proper job".

<H3><CENTER>Farmers <A NAME="demand">demand</A> 30m (UK pounds)  aid for cattle ear-
tags</CENTER></H3>

The Daily Telegraph<P>

By David Brown, Agriculture Editor    ...   Tuesday August 13 1996<P>

FARMERS demanded (UK pounds) 30 million in Government aid yesterday to
set up a computerised national cattle tracing system to persuade Europe
to lift its British beef ban.

The bill, they said, would be "cheap at the price" to rid Britain of mad
cow disease and to restore world confidence in British beef.<P>

The National Cattle Database Working Group, representing farmers,
retailers and consumer groups, said Government support was essential for
a system in which more than 11 million cattle would be fitted with
electronic ear-tags. Such a system, it said, was essential to reassure
consumers about the origin of the meat they bought in the wake of mad
cow disease.<P>

If the Government acted swiftly, the system could be running by January
and fully operational by 1998.

Difficulties in tracking down many cattle most at risk of carrying BSE,
including offspring of BSE victims, have baulked efforts to end the EU
restrictions. Bill Madders, a Staffordshire dairy farmer who chairs the
group, said members were unanimous about the urgent need for an
efficient identification and tracing system.<P>

"Ultimately all food animals, including sheep and pigs, will need to be
covered," he said. The cost "paled into insignificance" compared with
current emergency measures to wipe out mad cow disease and restore
confidence.<P>

The emergency destruction scheme for cattle more than 30 months old will
cost the taxpayer about (UK pounds) 2.5 billion over three years. It
would cost up to (UK pounds) 5 million to establish the database and
about (UK pounds) 30 million more to fit cattle with the extra ear-tags
and install scanning equipment in abattoirs and markets. Metal ear tags
would cost 25p-35p each and electronic ones about (UK pounds) 1 more.<P>

Bulk purchase, under a Government programme, would cut the costs.

"In the long run, this will save the Government money," Mr Madders
said.<P>

Under the scheme, all cattle would have to be fitted with two ear-tags,
not one as at present. Older cattle would be fitted with a coded metal
tag but each new-born calf would be fitted with a plastic, electronic
tag which would enable the animal's unique 12-digit identity number to
be read easily by scanners on the farm and at markets. Eventually, all
cattle would be fitted with electronic tags and the animals would be
scanned at markets by simply walking through a frame, similar to
security scanners at airports.<P>

An advantage of the numerical electronic system was that a farmer could
register his cattle by using telephone push-buttons and would only need
to tap into the database again to amend the information if they sold an
animal or an animal died.

Mr Madders said the system should be linked to food labelling to give
retailers accurate information about the origin of meat they sold.

The National Farmers' Union backed the report but, while the ministry
agreed that a database was needed urgently,<B> senior officials refused to
be drawn on who would foot the bill.</B><P>

While the EU Commission in Brussels wants to see such a system in place,
it favours the alterative idea of implanting electronic "chips" behind
the ears of cattle and is carrying out Europe-wide trials. But critics,
including many vets, argue that the technology is imperfect and there
were <B>dangers of the chips moving inside the animals and turning up in
meat.</B><P>

Ear-tags would provide a faster and more effective solution, they say,
if they can be produced to acceptable international standards.

<H3><CENTER>Beef <A NAME="cheats">cheats</A> hit shoppers</CENTER></H3>

London Evening Standard    ...   Wednesday, 14 August<P>

Stores face charges as mix is found in packs of 'pure lamb'<P>

A NATIONWIDE hunt for BSE "cheats" was demanded today as two supermarket
chains were threatened with prosecution for selling beef disguised as
lamb. Trading standards officers say shops are off-loading their
unwanted beef onto unsuspecting customers who are trying to avoid it
because of fears about mad cow disease. <B>The meat is sold as pure lamb or
pork mince - but in fact has a beef content of up to 10 per cent</B>. Random
checks by local authorities hundreds of miles apart suggest consumers
are being deceived on a large scale by outlets ranging from small
independent butchers to big supermarket chains.<P>

Hounslow Council, whose inspectors found beef in lamb mince from two
small shops and two supermarkets, called for a nationwide investigation
to establish the extent of the problem. However, food minister Angela
Browning <B>ruled out</B> a national Government inspection programme. If the
inspectors had identified anything dangerous it would be a different
matter, she said. <B>"There is nothing that has been purchased that was
unfit for human consumption."</B><P>

 Hounslow's environmental services chairman, Bob Whatley, said he was
"horrified" by what inspectors found. "The Government needs to take this
problem very seriously," he said. "In some cases it may be due to staff
failing to clean the mincing machine before changing from one product to
another, but I refuse to believe it's all down to sloppiness. Some
stores must be doing this as a way of selling beef that nobody wants to
buy."<P>

 John Morris of the British Retail Consortium, said: "This is something
that should not be happening and I am very concerned."" Roger Pope, a
trading standards officer in Bath, where contaminated meat was also
discovered, said: "It is outrageous and very distressing for consumers."
Millions of families have been trying to cut beef out of their diet in
recent months. Beef consumption in Britain dropped by 20 per cent
between January and March, while sales of lamb and mutton rose by 16 per
cent.<P>

 Hounslow's head of business regulation, Ken George, said: "We have
asked to interview the supermarket chains about the results but so far
they have declined. "If the manufacturer of the lamb mince is
<B>distributing from a central point, it is possible that other
supermarkets are being supplied throughout the country</B>." Officials
refused to name the supermarket chains involved pending possible legal
action against them.<P>

 Labour agriculture spokesman Gavin Strang said: "All products,
particularly meat at this time, should be accurately labelled."

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Steak">Steak</A> house holders in pay rise protest</CENTER></H3>

By Edward Baring<P>

The Daily Telegraph    ...   Tuesday August 13 1996<P>

SMALL shareholders protesting about pay and performance at Aberdeen
Steak Houses walked out of the annual meeting in London yesterday, after
a motion was passed to increase chairman Ali Salih's pay next year by
82pc to (UK pounds) 450,000.<P>

The shareholder group, which claims the support of investors owning 5pc
of the company, is infuriated by the company's decision <STRONG>not to pay a
dividend for the seventh year in succession</STRONG> - <B>this time "as a result of
the BSE situation</B>" - while going ahead with plans to award Mr Salih a
pay rise as well as a bonus for 1995 of (UK pounds) 185,000. "We won't
let the matter rest. Anyone purchasing shares will not have their
interests represented," said action group spokesman Aysin Behchet.<P>

He said the shareholder group had also demanded the resignation of the
non-executive directors: "They are supposed to be representing the
interests of the small shareholder, but they do not," Mr Behchet
claimed. Speaking after the meeting, directors said that the size of Mr
Salih's pay rise was intended to compensate for the lack of pension
benefits over the past 20 years at the company.<P>

Director Peter Marsh said the decisions to pay Mr Salih a bonus and not
to pay shareholders a dividend could not be linked. He said the first
was taken in December-before the latest BSE scare occured-and the
decision on the dividend was taken after the outbreak. Mr Salih, who
owns 80pc of the company, said only he worked "18 hours a day, seven
days a week". Aberdeen shares closed 10 higher at 70p.<P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Select">Select</A> cattle may beat export ban</CENTER></H3>

By David Brown, Agriculture Editor<P>

Daily Telegraph    ...    Saturday August 10 1996<P>

MEASURES were launched by the Government yesterday in an attempt to
persuade Europe to ease the beef export ban for some breeds by
October.

Up to 2,000 specialist beef farmers will be eligible to join a Beef
Assurance Scheme, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture, provided they
can meet five key safeguards against BSE.<P>

A Statutory Instrument implementing the scheme was laid before
Parliament yesterday. Under the scheme, farmers must guarantee that:<P>

They have a specialist beef herd that has included no dairy cattle for
the past seven years. Most cases of mad cow disease have occurred in
dairy cattle. 
<P>
Their herds have been established for at least four years.
<P>

They have suffered no cases of BSE in their herds or imported cattle
into their herds from farms that have suffered from BSE. 
<P>
* They have fed
no concentrated food rations to their cattle, except from their own
home-mixed cattle rations. No meat and bonemeal has been fed to their
animals over the past seven years.<P>

Farmers will have to pay (UK pounds) 35 plus VAT to register their herds
under the scheme this year in addition to (UK pounds) 3.35 plus VAT for
every animal registered. In return they will be able to sell beef from
animals up to 42 months old.
At present, under the Government's emergency controls to restore
confidence to the beef market, cattle over 30 months old are destroyed
to remove them from the food chain.<P>

The scheme should benefit, among others, farmers who keep rare breeds of
cattle, including Dexters, which have suffered no cases of BSE. These
cattle take longer than 30 months to mature for market. But, under
existing rules, they are destroyed like all the others. Farmers and the
Rare Breeds Survival Trust have complained that some of the finest and
safest beef cattle in the UK are being destroyed needlessly.<P>

Although <B>the scheme is expected to cover no more than 70,000 cattle</B>  [out of a total herd of 11,000,000]
these animals are seen as the most likely to be restored to the export
market.

<H3><CENTER>FOOD: Britain's farmers should <A NAME="bring">bring</A> back
hanging</CENTER></H3>

By Giles MacDonogh<P>

Financial Times    ...   Saturday August 10 1996<P>

It was beef, now it is lamb, soon it will be chicken and pork. You
cannot gloss over it,<B> intensive farming is to blame</B>: cheap meat for the
punters, with big profit margins for the producers. Now we all need to
think about the future and decide if there isn't a little silver lining
to this big, black cloud.<P>

I am prepared to believe that the authorities have tried to steer us
through the minefield of what is safe and what is not, but no one could
suggest that they have done anything other than create confusion.

If the risk was chiefly from old dairy cattle minced up into hamburgers
and industrially prepared food, why was this not made clear from the
outset? Was there ever any real danger from prime cut beef?<P>

A few months ago in these pages I suggested that what we needed were
effective guarantees as to the origins of the beef (and other meats)
which we buy, and I threatened to go on the barricades for British beef.
I thought I might pull in a few like-minded souls, but the response was
derisory. I retired, sulking, to my tent.

That was before the storm broke. Now I am more adamant than ever:
consumers need to know more about the meat they buy from the shops.<P>

It is an opportunity for quality-conscious farmers to clean up. It is
also the moment for the poor butchers, squeezed by the supermarkets at
one end and vegetarians at the other, to demonstrate that they are far
better equipped to reassure the shopper than the supermarket.<P>

These thoughts occurred to me in Kincardineshire in Scotland, where I
had gone to Glenbervie to see Stewart Macphie. Macphie has a closed herd
of 100 per cent Angus cattle, from which he produces the sort of meat
Britons were reared on: <B>well-hung cuts of beef with pronounced
subcutaneous marbling</B> which keeps it sweet and moist in the oven; no
Brobdingnag steaks from scrawny Tuscan beasts, and no fat-free fillets
from quick-growing French heavyweights either.<P>

Macphie's idea of opening his own butchery unit has come to fruition; he
can now be certain of the quality of his meat right down to the minute
it leaves his premises to be delivered to a hotel, restaurant or
butcher's shop.<P>

The (UK pounds) 1m unit - (UK pounds) 200,000 of which came from the EU
- opened on July 12. Egon Ronay, the Hungarian-born gastronome, was
there to do the honours. Instead of the usual cake, he carved a slice
from a rib of beef and, holding it aloft, declared "Bring back hanging!"
- thereby addressing an issue central to the revival of proper beef
production in Britain.<P>

I have long been convinced that the downward turn in consumption is in
part to do with the relative freshness of meat offered in the
supermarkets. <B>A generation ago all British flesh - from chicken to beef
and game - was hung for a few days.</B>

As a Swedish biochemist once explained to me,<B> meat needs to be hung to
break down the acids which multiply in the flesh after slaughter.</B> Meat
eaten before it is ready is unhealthy and hard to digest.<P>

>From now on, all Macphie beef will be hung for between 14 and 20 days,
like the <B>magnificent carcasses</B> I saw in the new butchery unit. And
taking an idea which is dear to my heart, all his beef will now be
transported in boxes bearing a "kite-mark", assuring the recipient that
it is 100 per cent Angus (for beef from the grass-fed, suckler herd at
Glenbervie), or 75 per cent Angus (for local farmers who want to come in
on the scheme).<P>

These farmers must assure Macphie that their bulls are pedigree Aberdeen
Angus, and their cows no less than 50 per cent Angus and 50 per cent
from another prime beef herd. As Macphie's stockman told me, where
confusion exists over how BSE got into beef herds, it normally occurred
when the farmer had bought a replacement cow which was partly of dairy
stock.<P>

I should have liked him to do even better, at least as far as the meat
destined for butchers' shops was concerned, and actually supply the meat
with a 100 per cent Glenbervie Angus tag. In France top butchers use
tags such as these for their best veal, for example. This way, consumers
have ocular proof of the quality of the meat they are buying.

I should also like to see a better policing of the meat in butchers'
shops by disinterested panels or committees. The Q-Guild of butchers is
one small group with a reputation for offering meat of the best quality,
but they are thin on the ground.<P>

Butchers who could prove the origin and quality of their meat would be
eligible to membership of a wider chain which would offer further
reassurance to the consumer.
Macphie has made a splendid counter-attack which would be the envy of
all good tacticians.<P>

<B>It is high time to fight for meat.</B> No one can decently expect it to be
cheaper than it was in the bad old days, but with any luck it will be
much, much better.<P>

Reuter Information Service
<P>    TOKYO (Oct 2, 1996) - More than 200 students and teachers at an elementary school in northern Japan have come down with the food poisoning bug that killed 11 people when it swept the nation this summer, health officials said on Wednesday.<P>


    The students and teachers at Midorigaoka Elementary School in the city of Morioka, 600 km (360 miles) north of Tokyo, have been infected with the O-157 strain of the E. coli bacteria, joining the more than 3,800 people infected since June, health officials said.<P>

    Following Health Ministry orders, local health officials are investigating school lunches as a probable cause of the food poisoning outbreak, the official said.<P>

    The western city of Sakai was hit hardest by the epidemic, with more than 6,500 people affected in the area, mainly schoolchildren. Experts believe the bacillus that struck there was also in school lunches.<P>

    But investigators failed to track down the original source of the bacteria and schools in Sakai stopped providing school lunches when classes resumed this autumn after summer holidays.<P>

    As of last week, eight people in Sakai were still in hospital, of whom one was said to be in serious condition.<P>

    Last week the Health Ministry said in its "final" report on the crisis that it was unable to specify the source and route by which the deadly O-157 bacteria spread, creating one of Japan's biggest health crises of the postwar era.<P>

    The report declined to rule out contaminated radish sprouts, a salad vegetable similar to cress, as a cause of the infection, prompting farmers to threaten damages suits against the central government for lost business.

<H3><CENTER>Bacillus breeds conspiracy theory</CENTER></H3>
By Gerard Baker<BR><BR>
Financial Times    ...   Monday September 2 1996<BR><BR>
To the regular observer of Japanese social and political life, apparent contradictions are so familiar they become the norm. The mind is gradually re-tuned to expect contradiction where it might once have expected logical consistency, and few non sequiturs any longer have the capacity to surprise.<BR><BR>
Yet even the cynical have been jolted out of their indifference by the most recent example of institutionalised paradox. Over the summer, at least 10 people have been killed by food poisoning from a rare form of bacterium. Another 10,000 have been taken ill, most of them schoolchildren and elderly. And though the worst of the epidemic has been concentrated in a relatively small area in western Japan, cases have been reported in each of the country's 47 prefectures.<BR><BR>
E-coli 0-157 lives relatively harmlessly in animal intestines, but can be highly poisonous if ingested by humans. In its deadliest form, it can lead to rapid deterioration and failure of internal organs.<BR><BR>
A typically phlegmatic Japanese version of a national panic has attended the spread of this plague. Sales of foods suspected of having been the source of the bacterium have dried up, visits to normally packed swimming pools have dropped off, and companies directly associated with the problem have seen sales slide.<BR><BR>
Yet, three months after the first cases were diagnosed, the Japanese authorities are no nearer understanding the cause of the outbreak. A number of possible culprits has been identified. First, the authorities said solemnly, it was raw beef; then, improbably, it was all the fault of a harmless looking vegetable that the English would call mustard and cress; then again, it turned out, it might have been the fish.<BR><BR>
To mounting incredulity, the scientific tests continue, no nearer discovery. A perplexed nation watches nightly television pictures of scientists floundering in laboratories, testing every piece of flora and fauna in sight.<BR><BR>
To the Japanese, the whole incident is especially shocking. There can be no more hygiene-obsessed country on earth - a place where banks issue sterilised currency notes from their automated telling machines so their customers will not catch anything. The fact that the government's best scientists have apparently been unable to trace the cause has fuelled the anxiety.<BR><BR>
The real puzzle lies not in the fumbling enquiries of investigators but in the silence of official regulators - not in the post hoc shortcomings of medical diagnostics, but in the prior failure of the panoply of rules designed to prevent disaster.<BR><BR>
Japan is probably the most intricately regulated economy on earth. Most of those regulations, attacked by foreigners, are defended by the government on the grounds that they ensure the safety of the people from the hazards of unfettered market forces.<BR><BR>
Nothing is as tightly controlled as the food chain. As in many countries, British beef has been banned in Japan. But unlike most of the rest of the world, the ban dates not from the recent scare about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease) and fears of its connection with Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (<STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT>) in humans.<BR><BR>
The Japanese government has forbidden its people to eat British beef since 1951, following an outbreak of another disease in cattle. The American apple, that well known serial killer, was also barred from entering Japan until last year, on the grounds that it was a danger to public health.<BR><BR>
Yet these extraordinarily protective rules have somehow failed to stop the largest outbreak of deadly food poisoning for decades. Why?<BR><BR>
There is no shortage of conspiracy theories. One has its roots deep in the largely taboo stratification of Japanese society. Slaughterhouses, dirty places shunned by most self-respecting Japanese workers, are largely the domain of the underclass, the burakumin. It is claimed that hygiene standards in the abattoirs are well short of desirable, but government inspectors have been reluctant to enforce higher standards for fear of upsetting the burakumin, who might take offence and cause trouble.<BR><BR>
Another theory suggests a network of corruption among suppliers, distributors and officials. There has been no evidence to support either claim. The true significance of the incident is that it reveals the contradiction at the heart of the Japanese system: the falsehood that rules exist to protect consumers.<BR><BR>
As other shocking incidents have shown in recent years, the reality is rather different - thousands of people grotesquely contaminated by mercury-infested water in a southern town, while the company responsible and officials were aware all along of the dangers and did nothing; and hundreds of haemophiliacs given HIV-infected blood as the company supplying it and government scientists ignored endless warnings.<BR><BR>
The lesson of these cases is that too much of the complex web of rules that exists notionally to protect consumers is in fact there to safeguard the entrenched position of producers and government officials so as to maintain the delicate balance of high prices, strong sales and plentiful jobs for bureaucrats.<BR><BR>
It is a lesson that has been learned and re-learned to their cost by the Japanese for 50 years. It is unfortunate that consumers are too patient and long-suffering to demand change. Until they do, the lesson will have to be learned again and again.<BR>

Since late May 1996, large outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 infections have been occurring in Japan. Initial clusters occurred in Hiroshima and Okayama prefectures. The most recent large outbreak is primarily affecting the city of Sakai, near Osaka, and appears to have caused more than 5000 cases and 6 deaths. Most cases appear to be in schoolchildren. School lunches are a suspected source of transmission, but this has not been confirmed either epidemiologically or by microbiologic testing of food samples. CDC has been in regular contact with counterparts in the Japanese Ministry of Health and is collaborating on issues regarding laboratory methods and possible epidemiologic approaches to the outbreak.<BR><BR>
We are unaware of cases in the United States that might be related to the outbreak. Persons traveling to Japan may have concerns about their risk of becoming ill. The available information does not suggest that travelers are at particular risk, nor does it identify a specific food to avoid. The precautions that are recommended to prevent E. coli O157:H7 in this country are appropriate anywhere in the world; these include avoiding consumption of raw beef, unpasteurized milk, and unchlorinated water. The CDC brochure, "Preventing Foodborne Illness: Escherichia coli O157:H7," is available on the Internet. It includes general information about prevention of E. coli infection.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Japan finds killer <A NAME="germ">germ</A> in U.S. beef intestines</CENTER></H3>
Reuter Information Service .. 30 Aug 96
<P>    TOKYO (Aug 30, 1996 1:42 p.m. EDT) - The Health Ministry said on Friday it had found the deadly O-157 bacteria, responsible for a food poisoning epidemic in Japan which has killed 11 people, in a sample of imported U.S. beef intestine.


    A ministry official added, however, that the finding would not prompt any new restrictions on Japan's imports of U.S. beef, noting that imported beef intestines are heat-treated before distribution to the market and this destroys the killer germ.<P>

    The U.S. embassy said in a statement that the shipment from which the sample was taken had not been distributed for sale in Japan.

    The Health Ministry official said the bacteria was found on Wednesday at one of the ministry's laboratories and that the U.S. embassy was notified immediately.

    The embassy said the product was voluntarily destroyed by the importer and that therefore it had no link with the O-157 epidemic.<P>

    The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic in Japan that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year.

    The government said earlier this week that the threat from the germ, while still requiring vigilance, appeared to be receding in Sakai, a city near the regional commercial centre of Osaka in western Japan, which has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria.

    Health authorities believe school lunches were responsible for the food poisoning in Sakai, but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection.<P>

    The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation's school lunch programme.

   <B> Japan imported 417,105 tonnes of beef</B> in the first seven months of this year, more than half of it from the United States.

    <B>Beef intestines are sometimes used as ingredients in an inexpensive Japanese stew</B> that includes other animal organs and is popular in the winter.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Japan <A NAME="adopts">adopts</A> bacteria-proof meat standard</CENTER></H3>
14 August1996 ... Deseret News
<P>
TOKYO (Reuters) -- Japan's deadly food poisoning scare has driven health authorities to raise meat sanitation standards as high as those of the U.S. space program, officials said Wednesday.

The Health Ministry hopes that raising slaughterhouse practices to space-age standards will safeguard consumers from infection by the O157 colon bacillus bacteria responsible for a poisoning outbreak that has killed nine people and made 9,500  over the past two months.

<P>

The revision of the Food Sanitation Law, to be implemented next month, would require 333 slaughterhouses nationwide to use bacteria-proof methods of butchering carcasses, officials of a ministry study panel said.


The slaughterhouses would also have to inspect for bacteria at every stage of meatcutting, separate intestines and organs from flesh, and maintain detailed records to enable quick follow-up in case of food poisoning outbreaks.

<P>

The O-157 colon bacillus has been <B>detected in about 0.2 percent of the livestock</B> examined in a previous ministry inspection, the officals said.


Current sanitary practice at slaughterhouses focuses on eliminating diseased animals, not on preventing the infection of humans, analysts said.

<P>

The move, which brings forward the ministry's plan to impose stringent meat-packing rules modeled on those in the United States, comes after a frantic but inconclusive search for clues to the poisoning outbreak that has wreaked havoc in the food industry.
On Wednesday, radish sprouts joined the growing list of food items first blamed for causing the epidemic and then cleared of responsibility. 

Last week, the Health Ministry said radish sprouts were the only common link found in meals served at Osaka-area primary schools and a retirement home where there were many victims.
Health officials in Osaka in western Japan, where the epidemic has hit hardest, told reporters the radish sprouts were cleared after exhaustive tests on the vegetable and the farm's water supply and its employees.

Chief government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama on Wednesday also gave the sprouts a clean bill of health.


''It's just that the possibility of contamination existed in radish sprouts from a single producer, but that didn't mean all radish sprouts were unsafe,'' Kajiyama told reporters.



The vegetable, a common salad garnish similar to cress, was the only uncooked food served to people at the locations.

<P>Since the start of the outbreak, raw fish, liver, chicken, noodles and a variety of sweets have all been blamed and then exonerated -- but not before causing sales of the items to plummet.


Some supermarkets that stopped selling radish sprouts after last week's announcement said they would resume sales of the popular vegetable on Thursday now it has been cleared.<HR>

<H4>Poison bacteria found at major <A NAME="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</A></H1>
Associated Press ... Aug 3, 1996
<P>   
TOKYO - Inspectors tracing the source of a food poisoning epidemic in Japan have found a deadly bacteria in beef at a slaughterhouse that distributes nationwide, according to news reports Saturday.


   The E. coli O157 bacteria, which has killed seven people and sickened more than 9,000 since June, has been linked to tainted school lunches, but the specific food that carried it has been a mystery.

   The Mainichi daily newspaper and Kyodo News agency said public health inspectors in Sendai, 190 miles northeast of Tokyo, found the bacteria in beef carcasses on July 26.<P>

   Investigators are examining the genetics of the bacteria to see if it is the same batch that caused the outbreak, which has centered in western Japan. The reports did not say why officials did not reveal the finding until now.

   Officials in Sendai, the Health and Welfare Ministry and the National Institute of Health -- which is reportedly analyzing beef samples from Sendai -- said they could not comment on the reports.
   The wholesale market in Sendai contains a slaughterhouse for beef from six prefectures in northern Japan, and is a distribution point for shipments across Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka.<P>

   As of late Friday, 9,097 people had been sickened, more than 6,000 of them schoolchildren in Sakai, 300 miles west of Tokyo. Of the 216 people hospitalized there, 16 were in critical condition.<P>

   The O157 bacteria attaches itself to the intestinal lining and causes bloody diarrhea and flu-like symptoms. One in 10 victims develops a complication that can cause kidney failure.<P>

   An official at a poisoning task force in Sakai said it was possible the slaughterhouse was a source of meat for city school lunches, but more investigation was needed to be sure.

   The bacteria previously has been found in raw chicken liver and other food samples collected at restaurants, but this is the first time the ministry has reported finding it at a slaughterhouse.

31 July 1996
<P>



TOKYO -- Japan will consider ordering the army's anti-germ warfare unit to help civilian health experts contain the O-157 killer bacteria epidemic, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said Wednesday. 



''It's an embarrassing situation. . . . The government's response was sometimes slow and we must now take active measures,'' Kajiyama said during a meeting with Kansei Nakano of the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier) Party.

<P>

During the meeting, Nakano told Kajiyama the government should mobilise the military's anti-germ warfare unit and other experts. 



''We will consider (the request),'' Kajiyama said.

Across the country, the 2-month-old outbreak of the illness brought on by the O-157 colon bacillus bacteria has killed seven people and infected close to 9,000.


The biggest single outbreak occurred in the western Japan city of Sakai, where 6,500 people have come down with the germ.

<P>

As of Wednesday, 286 of those infected in Sakai were in the hospital and 21 were listed in serious condition, city officials said.


The government has also come under attack from medical experts and the media over its handling of the crisis.

<P>

''In light of the seriousness and urgency of the situation, the Defence Agency is ready to help in preventing the further spread of the epidemic,'' Defense Minister Hideo Usui told a Cabinet meeting Wednesday.<HR>


<H3><CENTER>5,500 <A NAME="children">

Reuter News Service ... 8.1.96<P>

OSAKA, Japan -- Roast pork joined eel sushi on Thursday as a key suspect in a food poisoning outbreak from school lunches that has made more than 5,500 children ill in western Japan.



As the number of victims from the week-old epidemic kept going up, health authorities added roast pork served with cold noodles as a possible carrier of the O-157 colon bacterium blamed for the outbreak.

<P>

In the early days of the epidemic, authorities believed they had pinpointed the carrier to a meal of sea eel sushi and soup served to schools in the area on July 5.


But a spokesman for a national task force set up to investigate the outbreak now believes the bacteria might also have been in a second meal distributed to schools one week ago, two days before the first children came down with the illness.


''We are now looking to see if a meal of roast pork and cold noodles might also be to blame,'' the spokesman told reporters.

<P>

The task force was investigating if there were in fact two waves of poisoning -- one in the July 5 meal and the second in the cold noodles served with roast pork on July 10.



The spokesman said tests have ruled out as a carrier milk and 29 types of seasonings and side dishes used in both the meals.



City authorities in Sakai, the main affected area, said a total of 5,535 children, mainly at primary schools, had become ill.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

Cerebral deposition of the amyloid beta protein (A-beta) is an early and
invariant feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Whereas the 40-amino acid form of A-beta
(A-beta40) accounts for ~90% of all A-beta normally released from cells, it appears to
contribute only to later phases of the pathology. In contrast, the longer more amyloidogenic
42-residue form (A-beta42), accounting for only ~10% of secreted A-beta, is deposited in
the earliest phase of AD and remains the major constituent of most amyloid plaques throughout
the disease. Moreover, its levels have been shown to be increased in all known forms of
early-onset familial AD. Thus, inhibition of A-beta42 production is a prime therapeutic goal.
The same protease, gamma-secretase, is assumed to generate the C termini of both A-beta40
and A-beta42. Herein, we analyze the effect of the compound MDL 28170, previously
suggested to inhibit gamma-secretase, on beta-amyloid precursor protein processing. By
immunoprecipitating conditioned medium of different cell lines with various A-beta40- and
A-beta42-specific antibodies, we demonstrate a much stronger inhibition of the
gamma-secretase cleavage at residue 40 than of that at residue 42. These data suggest that
different proteases generate the A-beta40 and A-beta42 C termini. Further, they raise the
possibility of identifying compounds that do not interfere with general beta-amyloid
precursor protein metabolism, including A-beta40 production, but specifically block the
generation of the pathogenic A-beta42 peptide.

<CENTER><H3>Alzheimer's test <A NAME="planned">planned</A> for new memory-enhancing drug</H3>
</CENTER>Associated Press 11.17.96

<P>   WASHINGTON (Nov 17, 1996 9:30 p.m.  EST) -- A new drug, which in some tests of healthy elderly men restores memory almost to that of young people, soon will be tested on patients with Alzheimer's, the fatal brain disorder that destroys the mind.
   Dr. Gary Lynch of the University of California at Irvine said Sunday the drug called ampakine CX-516 accelerates signals between brain cells and appears to significantly sharpen the memory.<P>

   The drug, used in only mild doses, was tested on students in their early 20s and on men aged 65 to 70 and the results were "particularly striking" among the older people, Lynch said. He delivered a report on the drug Sunday at a national meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.<P>

   Lynch said clinical trials of the drug consisted of memory tests conducted with and without CX-516.

   Before taking the drugs, the subjects were read a series of nonsense syllables, then asked five minutes later to recall as many of them as possible.

   The elderly could recall, on average, only one of the syllables. The score for the young men averaged four out of 10.<P>

   The subjects later were given mild doses of ampakine CX-516, then retested.

   "The results for the 65- to 70-year-old men was particularly striking," said Lynch. "They scored near the range of young people."

   In some tests even the young experienced improvement in memory by about 20 percent, he said.

   Lynch said the hope is that the drug will improve the memory of patients with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive disorder that destroys memory and other functions of the brain and eventually kills. About 5 million Americans, mostly elderly, have Alzheimer's, and it is estimated that the number will climb to 15 million over the next quarter-century as the nation's population ages.<P>

   Ampakine CX-516 has been tested only on small groups in clinical experiments to detect any toxic effects. A more definitive test will start next year at the National Institutes of Health, when 16 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be given the drug.<P>

   Dr. Donald Price, a neuroscience researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said the new drug is "intriguing and innovative" and that it will influence "a very important synapse" in the brain.

   However, he said, "I have reservations about its use in Alzheimer's, because it does not directly address the disease mechanism. It is a palliative."

   "I would suspend my enthusiasm until I see the results of the clinical trials. It is quite early" in the drug development process, Price said.<P>

   Lynch and co-workers at the University of California, Irvine, discovered the drug in 1991 while searching for compounds to improve communications between neurons in the brain. He said it works by causing neuron switches, called synapses, to remain open for a fractional second longer. This enhances the flow of an amino acid called glutamate. The exchange in effect carries a message from one neuron to another.<P>

   In 1993, ampakine CX-516 was tested on laboratory animals. Researchers found that older rats given the drug had a dramatically improved ability to find their way out of a maze and to remember the route later.<P>

   "It reduced the (number of) training sessions for older rats from 10 to five," said Lynch.

   Human trials of the drug started last year. Results will be published in January in the journal Experimental Neurology.

   Tests on humans, using very low doses of the drug, also were conducted using photograph recognition, odor recollection and learning a pencil maze. In all of these tests, the subjects performed better with ampakine than without it.<P>

   Lynch said the improvement in memory may be even better with higher doses of the drug. This will be done only after early tests prove the drug has no harmful side effects.

   People with the greatest amount of memory deficit seemed to benefit most from the drug, which makes it promising for Alzheimer's disease. Lynch said that though the drug appears to sharpen memory, there is no indication that it will effect some of the behavioral aspects of Alzheimer's that are not associated with memory.<P>

   Ampakine CX-516 is licensed to an Irvine, Cal., company, Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Lynch said he has an interest in the firm. Human trials starting next year will be under the control National Institutes of Health scientists.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Estrogen">Estrogen</A> improves memory of some Alzheimer's patients</H3>
</CENTER>
Associated Press 11.20.96

<P>   WASHINGTON (Nov 21, 1996 10:54  a.m.  EST) -- The memory and concentration of elderly women with Alzheimer's disease improved dramatically in a test of estrogen hormone treatment, but experts say larger studies are needed to verify the findings.
In a study presented on Wednesday at a national meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, Dr. Sanjay Asthana reported that women with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease doubled their mental keenness while receiving estrogen through skin patches.<P>

   "Women on estrogen had a significantly improved ability to remember things," said Asthana, a doctor at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System in Tacoma, Wash., where the study was conducted.<P>

   Earlier studies have suggested that estrogen can protect women from developing Alzheimer's disease, but Asthana said this is the first full study of women who have been diagnosed with the brain disorder. He said, however, the study was too small to give final answers and tests using more patients are needed.<P>

   The study involved 12 women in their 70s. All of them received drug-delivery skin patches, six with estrogen, the others with a placebo, or dummy, preparation.

   "The effect of the estrogen was rapid," said Asthana. "Within a week, there was improvement."

   Throughout the eight-week trial, the women received standard neurological and psychological tests to detect changes.<P>

   Asthana said the women on estrogen had memory test scores 2-2 1/2 times greater than their scores without the drug. Attention test scores "almost doubled," he said.

   Loss of memory and attention span are two of the cognitive functions most severely affected by Alzheimer's, a disease that affects about 4 million Americans. It progressively destroys the mind, eventually killing the victim. There is no proven cause or cure.<P>

   Asthana said in his study the estrogen effect was dose-related; that is, patients who absorbed more of the hormone from the patches improved the most. The memory and attention improvements gradually faded, he said, after the experiment ended.<P>

   A number of studies have shown that estrogen tends to slow the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms, including three that concluded the hormone reduces the risk of the disease by up to 40 percent in post-menopausal women.<P>

   Dr. Bruce McEwen, a brain researcher at Rockefeller University in New York, said Asthana's study was good news. Combined with other studies, he said, it shows a "consistent pattern" suggesting that estrogen can have a strong influence on Alzheimer's disease.<P>

   "This research is very encouraging," said Zavern Khachaturian of the Alzheimer's Association and the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute. But he cautioned: "We cannot yet draw any conclusions from so small a sample. These results must be confirmed in a larger group."<P>

   Estrogen is known primarily as a female hormone, but researchers have learned it has many other functions. In women of childbearing age, estrogen protects against heart disease and bone loss.
 In the brain, estrogen appears to increase the action of CREB, a gene that plays a critical role in memory.<P>

   Even the male brain needs estrogen. Testosterone, a male hormone, is converted to estrogen. The production of testosterone throughout men's lives may account for the fact that Alzheimer's is much less common among men than among women, whose estrogen levels drop after menopause.<P>

   Estrogen replacement therapy became used most widely to protect post-menopausal women from osteoporosis, the brittle-bone disease. The therapy since has been found to improve the mental performance of healthy older women, to protect against heart attack and to lower the risks of some types of cancer.
   However, studies have shown that the therapy can slightly increase the risk of breast cancer and of developing blood clots.

Presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene mutations are responsible for the majority of
the early onset familial forms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Neither PS-1's anatomic
distribution in brain nor expression in AD have been reported. Using in situ hybridization in
the rat forebrain, we show that PS-1 mRNA expression is primarily in cortical and
hippocampal neurons, with less expression in subcortical structures, in a regional pattern
similar to APP695. Excitotoxic lesions lead to loss of PS-1 signal. A neuronal pattern of
expression of PS-1 mRNA was also observed in the human hippocampal formation. AD and
control levels did not differ. PS-1 is expressed in brain areas vulnerable to AD changes more
so than in areas spared in AD; however, PS-1 expression is not sufficient to mark vulnerable
regions. Collectively, these data suggest that the neuropathogenic process consequent to PS-1
mutations begins in neuronal cell populations.

<H3>Blocking <A NAME="pathology">pathology</A> in Alzheimer and Parkinson with p75</H3>

<A HREF="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~listserv/archive/BSE-L.html">Listserve 12.07.96</A><P>

The December 5, 1996 <I>Science </I> reports that a Canadian team (Riopelle, Ross, & Hagg) has found a way to block damage to neurons in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
The p75 receptor, responsible for normal cell death cycles (apoptosis),
shuts off in adults, but can become reactivated later in life, when it
again begins to destroy cells. This paper describes a trial in which
transgenic mice, lacking p75 receptor, did not lose the expected 25% of
cells during early development.  They formulated a drug (a peptide) that
can block p75 in normal mice, and again - no neuropathy.  Problems appear
to be the blood-brain barrier and rapid elimination, but there is some
indication, the authors suggest, that this process might find an application
in AD and PD.
<P>
Is it conceivable that such a process with such a
receptor may be involved in TSE? Is there a link between p75 and prP?

<CENTER><H3>Presenilin 2 in <A NAME="Apoptosis">Apoptosis</A>: Enhanced Basal Activity Conferred by an Alzheimer Mutation</H3>
</CENTER>
Benjamin Wolozin et al<BR>
Science Volume 274, Number 5293, Issue of 6 December 1996, pp. 1710-1713
<P>

Overexpression of the familial Alzheimer's disease gene Presenilin 2(PS2) in nerve
growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells increased apoptosis induced by trophic factor
withdrawal or -amyloid. Transfection of antisense PS2 conferred protection against
apoptosis induced by trophic withdrawal in nerve growth factor-differentiated or amyloid
precursor protein-expressing PC12 cells. The apoptotic cell death induced by PS2 protein
was sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting that heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are
involved. A PS2 mutation associated with familial Alzheimer's disease was found to generate a
molecule with enhanced basal apoptotic activity. This gain of function might accelerate the
process of neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer's disease, leading to the earlier age of
onset characteristic of familial Alzheimer's disease. 
<P>
Molecular genetic studies have recently localized some mutations associated with familial
Alzheimer's disease (FAD) to a gene named Presenilin 2(PS2) (1). The function of the
protein PS2 is unknown, but its structure resembles that of heterotrimeric GTP-binding
protein (G protein)-coupled receptors that have seven transmembrane domains. We recently
showed that ALG-3, a truncated mouse homolog of PS2, rescues the mouse T cell hybridoma
3DO from T cell receptor-induced apoptosis (2). ALG-3 is translated into a truncated PS2
polypeptide that acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of apoptosis (3). The involvement of
PS2 in T cell receptor-triggered cell death prompted us to study whether PS2 is also required
for neuronal cell death and whether mutations found associated with FAD affect PS2 activity.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Pinning">Pinning</A> the suspect to the crime in Alzheimer's </H3>
</CENTER>
Elizabeth Finkel  ... Lancet 11.30.96
<p>
 Despite intensive research, Alzheimer's disease remains an unsolved mystery. The evidence is all there--neurons show rampant oxidative damage and neurite outgrowth, microglia are hyperactive. And the prime suspect is easy to identify--accumulations of -amyloid (A). But no-one has been able to pin the suspect to the crime. 
<p>
 Now, David Stern's group at Columbia University (New York, USA) may have serendipitously solved the mystery by showing that A activates the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on the surface of neurons and microglia. This activation results in the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species and neurite outgrowth, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. 
<p>
 RAGE's involvement in Alzheimer's disease has generated great excitement as a potential target for "anti-Alzheimer's drugs", but Stern's research was initially targeted at understanding diabetic vascular complications. Stern had homed in on advanced glycation end products (AGEs), non-enzymatically modified proteins and lipids formed by prolonged exposure to glucose, as causal agents in diabetic vascular damage. AGEs pervade the tissues of diabetics but are especially prominent in the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Because of this localisation, AGEs were prime suspects, but how could they damage blood vessels? Histological data showed that AGEs cluster around vascular basement membranes, perhaps tethered there by a receptor. Ann Marie Schmidt, then a post-doctoral fellow with Stern, set out to purify an AGE receptor. 
<p>
 The task was not trivial. The receptor was neither very avid nor specific--it bound many modified proteins and lipids. But Schmidt succeeded and purified a new AGE receptor--RAGE, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. 
<p>
 Further studies implicated RAGE as a major player in vascular disease. For example, activation of RAGE on endothelial cells generates reactive oxygen species able to damage the integrity of the endothelial lining. And haematologist Jean-Luc Wautier (University Hospital, Paris, France) collaborating with Stern, has shown that the leakiness of blood vessels in experimental diabetic animals can be reversed by blocking the RAGEAGE interaction with soluble RAGE (sRAGE). 
<p>
 That activation of RAGE was likely to have profound implications for vascular pathology was clear, but RAGE is a promiscuous receptor, likely to be activated not only by the modified molecules circulating in diabetics, but whenever delayed protein turnover results in AGE production. Stern began wondering about Alzheimer's disease because two types of proteins accumulate abnormally in this disease. Neurofibrillary tangles made of polymerised tau accumulate within brain cells, and plaques containing deposits of A accumulate outside the cells. Genetic data suggest that accumulation of A is the primary defect in Alzheimer's disease. 
<p>
 Shi Du Yan, at that time a post-doctoral fellow with Stern, looked at tau and A for evidence of AGEs. Tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles was glycated and could activate RAGE, but Yan found little evidence of glycation in A plaques. Says Stern, "at this point the average person who's not crazy would have said, oh well, let's go on to something we know about". But Stern decided to stay on the A case. The histological data suggested that A was wreaking oxidative damage on neurons and Stern's belief was that it was probably via a receptor. His group already had experience of pulling out "less avid" receptors, so Yan and Schmidt, who have both since joined the faculty at Columbia University, set out to purify an A receptor. 
<p>
 Says Stern, "everyone predicted that we would end up isolating the macrophage scavenger receptor". This receptor internalises and degrades AGEs. Indeed at the same time as Stern's group were trying to purify an A receptor, Joseph el Koury, also at Columbia, and his colleagues were demonstrating that the microglial scavenger receptor binds to A fibrils, resulting in immobilisation and hyperactivation of the microglia, and release of neurotoxins. 
<p>
 But Yan did not isolate the scavenger receptor. Instead, she pulled out RAGE. Stern says the initial reaction was disbelief. "When our colleague Tim Slattery at Berlex Biosciences called us with the RAGE sequence, we wondered if we had mixed up samples in our laboratory." It turns out that glycated or not, A binds RAGE on the outside of neuronal and microglial cells (figure). 
<p>
 One consequence of that binding is neurotoxicity as Yan has demonstrated by using cultured cortical neurons. The neurotoxicity can be completely blocked by using an excess of sRAGE to block the RAGEAGE interaction. Another consequence of RAGE activation may be the neurite outgrowth seen in Alzheimer's disease since areas of neurite outgrowth in the developing mouse brain correlate with high concentrations of RAGE. The final piece of evidence linking RAGE and Alzheimer's disease is that although RAGE concentrations are low in the normal adult human brain, they are 25-fold higher in brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. 
<p>
 But none of this evidence proves that RAGE is responsible for neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease. By crossing transgenic "Alzheimer's mice" with mice genetically engineered to express high concentrations of RAGE or its inhibitor sRAGE, Stern hopes to develop a mouse model that will provide a "proof of concept" for the role of RAGE in Alzheimer's disease. The progeny mice will be used to study whether modifying RAGE expression affects disease processes, possibly opening the door to new therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

Those who study Alzheimer's disease are divided into two camps: the &#223;aptists, who see 
&#223;-amyloid plaques as the main cause of the disease, and the tauists, who believe that 
tau fibrils are to blame. A connection between the two comes with the discovery that 
glycosaminoglycans, which are known to be associated with plaques, are necessary for the 
assembly of tau into fibrils.
 <H3>British scientists report finding new <A NAME="clues">clues</A> to Alzheimer's</H3>
Reuter Information Service

<P>    LONDON (Oct 9, 1996 9:48 p.m. EDT) - British scientists have found new clues about one of the classic pathological features of Alzheimer's disease that could eventually lead to an effective treatment for the degenerative brain illness.<P>


    In a report in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday, Michel Goedert and colleagues at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, described how they reproduced abnormal filaments which make up neurofibrillary "tangles" - one of the two defining characteristics of Alzheimer's disease.<P>

    "It is the first time this has been done," Goedert told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    To make the filaments, Goedert mixed a protein called "tau" with substances known as glycosaminoglycans, which are sugars. The filaments make up the neurofibrillary tangles.<P>

    "The number of tangles (in the brain tissues of Alzheimer patients) correlates quite well with degrees of impairment. The more angles, the greater the impairment," he added.
    Goedert said the finding could present a way in which drugs to combat the tangles may be tested in laboratory conditions.<P>

    "Interactions between sulphated glycosaminoglycans and tau may thus be the central event in the development of nerufibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease," Goedert wrote in Nature.<P>

    Alzheimer's disease, which characterised by dementia and disorientation, afflicts nearly 10 percent of people over the age of 65 worldwide.
    Former U.S. president Ronald Reagan is a sufferer, as was the late American actress Rita Hayworth. The disease robs people of their memories and their ability to think, learn and take care of themselves.

<P>

A defining characteristic of the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease is the presence 
of neurofibrillary deposits. These are largely made up of paired helical filaments 
(PHFs), composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated 
state. But what triggers their formation? Goedert <i>et al.</i> show that under 
physiological conditions <i>in vitro</i>, sulphated glycosaminoglycans such as 
heparin induce tau (whether phosphorylated or not) to form PHFs. Moreover, heparin 
prevents tau from binding to microtubules, promoting microtubule disassembly, and 
heparan sulphate is found together with tau in affected regions of the brain from the 
earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. Sulphated glycosaminoglycans may therefore 
play a key role in the pathology of the condition.

 WASHINGTON  - Mental impairment is not a "normal" part of aging and many cases of dementia can be treated, according to U.S. health guidelines released Wednesday.
Even when the problem cannot be cured, such as Alzheimer's disease, early diagnosis is still advisable.

    "Early recognition of Alzheimer's disease or identification of other types of dementias can prevent costly and inappropriate treatment and give patients and family members time to address the complex financial, legal and medical conditions these conditions present," said Paul Costa of the National Institute on Aging, and the co-chair of the panel that drew up the guidelines.<P>

    The clinical practice guidelines are the last in a series drawn up by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

    About one in five apparent cases of dementia are treatable, due to such disorders as depression or drug interaction, which is a particular problem among older people taking several medications for chronic conditions.<P>

    Yet many people, including some health care professionals, regard such symptoms as a difficulty absorbing new information, problems in handling complex tasks or trouble with spatial orientation as sad but normal parts of aging.<P>

    But according to the guidelines, they are instead signals that a doctor should be consulted. If Alzheimer's is suspected, the elderly person should be followed carefully.

 Forgetfulness is not a part of growing old -- and doctors, family members and patients should regard it as medically important, according to new federal guidelines for treating Alzheimer's disease.

   The guidelines, issued by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, said the memory-destroying fatal disorder often goes undiagnosed in early stages by primary care doctors.<P>

   "Many health care professionals, as well as patients, their families and friends, mistakenly view the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease as inevitable consequences of aging," said Health and Human Services secretary Donna R. Shalala.
   In modern managed care medical practices, many patients need the approval of primary care doctors to seek the treatment of specialists, said Cheryl Williams, vice president of medical and scientific affairs of the Alzheimer's Association. Many primary care doctors simply don't recognize the early of symptoms of the memory-destroying disease.<P>

   Williams said about 25 percent of Alzheimer's patients could be diagnosed earlier if primary care physicians were alerted to look for the disease and to eliminate other causes of memory loss.
   "Early recognition of Alzheimer's disease, or identification of other types of dementias, can prevent costly and inappropriate treatment, and give patients and family members time to address complex financial, legal and medical issues these conditions present," said Paul T. Costa Jr. of the National Institute of Aging and a co-author of the guidelines.<P>

   About 20 percent of dementias in the elderly are caused by conditions that can be treated and improved. Experts said the new guidelines will help doctors recognize and treat these conditions.
   Williams said a final, positive verification of Alzheimer's can be made only at autopsy, but that specialists now are quick to detect evidence of the disorder. Primary care doctors, however, must recognize patients who have dementia in order for patients to be referred to specialist, she said.

<P>   CHICAGO (Sep 25, 1996 01:42  a.m. EDT) -- Alzheimer's disease among men of Japanese ancestry is twice as common in Hawaii as it is in Japan, boosting the theory that environmental factors play a role in the development of the mind-robbing illness, researchers say.<P>


   Exactly what those environmental factors are is unclear, but one of the researchers, Dr. Lon White of the National Institute on Aging, speculated that they might include exposure to pesticides on Hawaiian plantations and the stress of moving from Japan to Hawaii.

   The research was reported in Wednesday's <A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org/sci-pubs/journals/standing/jama/jamahome.htm">Journal of the American Medical Association</A>.<P>

   Previous research into possible environmental causes has linked Alzheimer's with a low education level, excess zinc and serious head injuries, although some researchers have challenged those results.<P>

   The latest study involved 3,734 Japanese-American men who were enrolled in a heart study in the 1960s and tracked through the early 1990s. About 15 percent were born in Japan and moved at an early age to Hawaii. The rest were born in Hawaii to Japanese-born parents who left their homeland for a better life.<P>

   The participants were 71 to 93 years old, with an average age of 78.
   Alzheimer's was believed to be present in 5.4 percent of the subjects. That compared with a rate of 1.5 percent found in a recent Japanese study of 887 Hisayama residents 65 and older. Other Japanese studies have found similar rates, the researchers said.<P>

   "These observations lead us to speculate that environmental or cultural exposures associated with migration from Japan to Hawaii may have influenced the development" of Alzheimer's disease, White said.<P>

   Dr. David Bennett, associate director of Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago, called the study provocative but flawed because it involved comparing studies that may have had different designs and methods.

<P>
CASTRO VALLEY, Calif. -- A judge has taken custody privileges away from the wife of an Alzheimer's patient who apparently overdosed on sleeping pills and whiskey.


Dr. Gerald Klooster, who had been the subject of an intense nine-month custody battle, was in critical condition Wednesday, unconscious and breathing with the help of a ventilator, family members said.
Superior Court Judge William McKinstry said if Klooster recovers, the couple's daughter, Kristen Hamstra, must take custody of him -- at least until a sheriff's investigation is completed.

<P>

In June, Klooster returned to the Castro Valley home he has shared with his wife, Ruth, for many years. He had been taken by his son, Chip Klooster, to live in Michigan. 


The custody dispute began after the younger Klooster learned his mother had contacted assisted-suicide advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian about her ailing husband. Chip Klooster feared his father, a retired obstetrician, was being pushed into killing himself.

<P>

On Tuesday, Ruth Klooster told authorities she found her husband unconscious and slumped against a kitchen cabinet in his underwear and a bathrobe. Nearby were a bottle of whiskey, an empty 100-tablet medicine bottle labeled busitol sodium, a barbiturate, and a coffee cup with some whiskey in it.

<P>

''We're calling it an attempted suicide with suspicious circumstances,'' said sheriff's Lt. Dave Hoig. ''We're not pointing any fingers, but there are several unanswered questions, especially because of the family involved.''

<P>

Authorities will fingerprint the whiskey and medication bottles. But Hoig said that evidence would not necessarily indicate whether Klooster acted alone.

Under California law, it is a felony to advise in an assisted suicide or even encourage it.

Asked if her mother could have assisted in the overdose, Hamstra -- who sided with her mother in the custody dispute -- replied, ''Absolutely not. My mother is devastated.''  
Chip Klooster, who has threatened to file a wrongful death suit if his father died suspiciously, said he was in shock.

''All I can say is 'I told everybody this was going to happen,' '' he said.

<H3><CENTER>New <A NAME="mouse">mouse</A> model boosts Alzheimers' research</CENTER></H3>

 Reuter Information Service (Oct 3, 1996)<P>    
WASHINGTON - A new genetically modified mouse that mimics Alzheimer's disease should boost drug research and help scientists decipher the strange tangles of plaque in patients' brains, scientists said on Thursday.
    A report on the transgenic mice, which contain a human gene for an early-onset form of Alzheimer's, appears Friday in the journal Science.<P>

    "This is the first time anyone has shown this association between the plaques and the disfunctional learning and dementia in mice," said Dr. Karen Hsiao, the University of Minnesota neurologist who developed the mouse.
    An earlier transgenic mouse displayed some aspects of Alzheimer's, but according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and the Chicago-bases Alzheimer's Association, both of which helped fund Hsiao's research, this one provides a more complete model for researchers.<P>

    Hsiao said in a telephone interview she will make the mouse widely available to academic researchers trying to understanding the heart-breaking disorder that robs patients of their memories and their independence.
    The University of Minnesota is also licensing the mouse to the Mayo Clinic, which through its Mayo Medical Ventures will sell the mice to pharmaceutical companies on a nonexclusive basis so that they can test compounds that could delay or conquer the disease, Hsiao said. A May spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the arrangement.<P>

    "There are a lot of compounds waiting to be tested and the pharmaceutical industry can use these mice," she said. "And academics can use it to try to understand what causes this disease."
    According to the Alzheimer's Association, the ailment afflicts more than 4 million Americans. Among them is former President Ronald Reagan. It is expected to become an even greater, and more expensive, problem as the baby boomers age.<P>

    There is no guarantee that a drug that works to slow down, or eventually even cure, Alzheimer's in mice will have the same effect in humans but scientists believe the transgenic rodent is an excellent model.

    In addition to being a testing ground for drugs, the genetically altered mice may also finally help scientists resolve the debate about the role of plaque in the brain -- whether plaque causes Alzheimer's or is a manifestation of it.<P>

    "We can't kill people to find out what is going on in their brain," said Hsaio, who suspects that something goes awry in the brain before formation of plaque. "The mice we can look at."

    Her lab worked with a long-lived hybrid mouse, injecting its eggs with a gene from a Swedish family with a history of early onset Alzheimer's. That gene directs production of a protein that forms the plaques.<P>

    The mice were tested against a control group in how well they learned to negotiate a water maze. Young mice performed well but as they aged, the transgenic mice showed more and more impairment, confusion and dementia. After death, the transgenic ones also displayed the plaque in the brain.

    Hsaio wants to now continue studying these patterns, examining the mice at closer intervals to get a better sense of when the plaque forms and the role it plays.

your genes - Alzheimer's test</FONT></H3>
<FONT COLOR="#009F00">Tom Wilkie<BR>
<BR>
The Guardian ... 2 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>As our genetic inheritance is unravelled to reveal more about the
diseases we are likely to sustain, the insurance industry has started to
campaign for greater access to our most intimate secrets. Tom Wilkie listens
in to the latest debate and assesses the implications<BR>
<BR>
Once, the &quot;Man from the Pru&quot; used to ring our doorbells and be
invited into our homes to collect the family's insurance premium. Now he,
and the other insurance companies, are asking for more intimate access
- to our DNA. They want to know what genes we have inherited from our parents
and, therefore, when we are likely to die.<BR>
<BR>
For the past five years, British geneticists have been trying, in vain,
to persuade the insurance companies that they need not pry into people's
genetic inheritance. Insurers, for their part, fear that people who know
from a genetic test that they are liable to develop a fatal disease later
in life will pile on the life insurance to provide for their dependants
after their death - without declaring the test result on the application
form.<BR>
<BR>
Last week, in the normally sedate surroundings of the Royal Society in
London, frustration at the lack of dialogue between the two sides boiled
over into acrimonious exchanges. Peter Harper, one of the country's leading
geneticists, sparked the furore when he warned that if applicants for insurance
feel that the results of a DNA test done by their doctor might be held
against them, they would buy do-it-yourself genetic test-kits even though
they had not received counselling about the consequences of a bad result:
&quot;I am totally against the uncritical and widespread application of
genetic tests.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This was all too much for Mary Reynolds, chief medical officer of Canada
Life. She promptly condemned Harper for supporting people who wanted to
latch on to a &quot;gravy train&quot;. Insurers are right, she insisted,
to demand to see the results of any genetic tests that an applicant may
have had for other reasons.<BR>
<BR>
But at least one actuary seemed not so sure. Angus MacDonald said life
insurance companies could survive perfectly well without getting access
to people's genetic test results - at worst premiums might rise by 10 per
cent for everyone; they would not double, he said. MacDonald's Scots accent,
his sober suit, and his dispassionate discourse on the statistics of human
mortality made it seem as if he had stepped straight from one of the coolly
elegant Georgian buildings that house the great life assurance companies
in the heart of Edinburgh. In fact, he lectures in actuarial mathematics
in the modernistic campus of Heriot-Watt university on the city's fringes.<BR>
<BR>
There is something about regarding the Grim Reaper's visits not as a series
of individual tragedies but as an opportunity to compile statistics on
frequencies and distributions that seems to appeal to the Scot, for there
were many Scottish voices to be heard among the actuaries at the Royal
Society. But there was a feeling that if the insurance industry were to
change its accent to an American one, then the genetic revolution taking
place in laboratories around the world would cause the industry and its
customers severe problems.<BR>
<BR>
<B>In Britain, the development of a genetic test
to pick out those who are at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease later in
life</FONT></B> has happened just when there are moves within the NHS to
shift long-term care for the elderly from medical to social provision for
which people would be encouraged to take out private cover for care in
their old age. <B>In the US, insurers that cover
long-term care are already interested in the genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's
and in excluding those who carry higher risk.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>Medical care, and long-term care for the elderly, the meeting
heard, could only be provided on a basis of universal solidarity - with
everyone contributing according to their ability to pay and receiving benefits
according to their need. Genetics may make more, not less, necessary the
universal provision that the NHS once promised &quot;from the cradle to
the grave&quot;. One of the most surprising aspects of the meeting was
to hear geneticists, the representatives of the actuarial profession (and
a sprinkling of insurers also) praising the NHS in terms more enthusiastic
than have been heard recently from the Labour Party.<BR>
<BR>
If Britain goes down the American road towards private health insurance,
or private insurance for long-term care in old age, then insurers would
be forced to take people's genes into account. In their own legitimate
commercial interests, insurers would refuse to cover those people most
at risk of, say, Alzheimer's disease - the people who need such cover most.<BR>
<BR>
Last week's debate had its roots in two developments during the 1980s.
Aids sent the insurance companies in Britain into psychological shock.
The industry had been making a tidy living selling insurance to young males
who, once they have got past the age of 20, are relatively good risks.
The possibility that some of them might be infected with HIV made the industry
nervous about insuring people who appear healthy today but who might be
at risk of illness later.<BR>
<BR>
The second development is an international scientific programme known as
the <B>Human Genome Project</FONT></B> whose aim
is to tease out and examine every one of the 100,000 or so genes in human
DNA. For obvious reasons, many researchers have started their search by
looking at the genes which, when defective, result in disease. The hope
is that when the genes are isolated and the DNA damage identified, it might
be possible to devise ways of correcting the disorder (not necessarily
by stitching in new genes - gene therapy - but by conventional pharmaceuticals
too). <B>The search has already yielded some spectacular
successes: the genes responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic
fibrosis and Huntington's disease have already been isolated, and the genetic
flaws that result in disease identified.</FONT></B> But cures remain, as
yet, elusive.<BR>
<BR>
What interests the insurance companies is that finding a gene does make
predictive testing possible. Huntington's disease, for example, is a degenerative
brain condition that usually sets in when the sufferer is in his or her
mid-40s. Healthy people in their twenties who know that they are at risk
- because one parent has developed the disease - can now have their own
DNA tested to see if they carry the mutation.<BR>
<BR>
Sensitised by their experience with Aids in the 1980s, the insurers worried
that here again could be a group of people who appear healthy at the time
a policy is taken out, but who will later suffer fatal disease. Worse was
the possibility that those who know they have the Huntington's mutation
may decide to insure their lives for hefty amounts, so that their dependants
are catered for after their death. To avoid the costs of such weighted
selections, insurers want to know the results of every genetic test that
applicants for insurance policies have had.<BR>
<BR>
But MacDonald's analysis suggests that the costs might not be so great
as had been feared - at least for average-sized policies. The costs do
mount up, he conceded, if the amount insured is twice or three times the
average. In such cases, there might have to be a limit above which insurers
were free to ask for the results of any genetic tests. Alternatively, it
might be possible to have &quot;retrospective pricing&quot; of insurance
policies, as happens in Germany, he suggested. Premiums are higher but
if, at the end of an ordinary life insurance policy, the company discovers
it had over-estimated the risk and therefore charged premiums that were
too high, it would return some of them as a &quot;with profits&quot; payment.
The higher initial premiums of a &quot;with profits&quot; system meant
that German insurance companies were more relaxed about the Aids epidemic
than their British counterparts. The German companies, said MacDonald,
could adjust to unforeseen claims by reducing the with-profits payout at
the end of normal policies.<BR>
<BR>
<B>But another American development may undermine
the chances of the insurance industry being able to dispense with genetic
information for all but the biggest of policies. In Britain, 95 per cent
of applicants get life cover at standard rates, about four per cent have
to pay higher premiums because they represent a higher risk, while one
per cent are rejected as uninsurable. In the US, however, some companies
are starting to give cheap rates to &quot;preferred lives&quot; - the superfit
and healthy. The British industry has a choice: it can try to expand the
insurance market to reach more than the 30 per cent of the population who
are insured at present, or it can differentiate within the existing assured
population.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>One of the factors that American insurers take into account
in determining who are the &quot;preferred lives&quot; is family history
of disease. Although the health of one's parents is a crude measure of
the genes that they have passed on, one speaker drew gasps of incredulity
when he asserted that the insurance industry did not regard family history
as &quot;genetic information&quot;. In theory, genetic tests would make
this crude information precise.<BR>
<BR>
And information about the genetics of common diseases is going to be available,
said John Bell, professor of clinical medicine at Oxford University. At
first, the genome project succeeded in teasing out only the genes for comparatively
rare disorders, such as Huntington's, which are due to damage in a single
gene. Now the emphasis is shifting, said Bell, &quot;to more common diseases
which are more interesting to the pharmaceutical industry&quot;, such as
cancer and heart disease. But it is not just the drugs companies that are
interested in the shift, he noted dryly: &quot;the insurance industry may
have more interest in understanding conditions that have high prevalence&quot;.
At Bell's own laboratory in Oxford, scientists have already started to
identify genes that confer a susceptibility to hypertension (high blood
pressure), asthma, adult-onset diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.
He warned though that, for common diseases, there is no simple &quot;if
you have the gene you will get the disease&quot; link. The diseases involve
a complex interplay of genes with each other and with the environment (including
diet) that may confer a high risk on some individuals. &quot;Stop thinking
about them as genes but instead as 'risk factors'.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At present, the available genetic tests are for such rare conditions that
it is not worth the insurers demanding that everyone should undergo a test
before being granted insurance. But when tests for Bell's &quot;risk factors&quot;
for common diseases become available, will the insurers then demand that
we undergo them?<BR>
<BR>
Well, the geneticists and the actuaries at the Royal Society meeting displayed,
in the flesh so to speak, a clear difference of view about the relative
importance of genes and environment. Despite their professional belief
in the importance of genes, every one of the scientists had the lean look
of people who jogged or took other vigorous exercise regularly - they were
clearly not leaving their chances of heart disease up to their genes. In
contrast, the insurers were trenchermen - implicitly relying on their genes
to ensure that regular good business lunches would not adversely affect
their actuarial chances of heart disease.<BR>

A number of mutations have been demonstrated in the open reading frame
(ORF) of the prion protein (PrP) gene in patients with familial
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome. On the basis
of detecting an insertion in the ORF of the PrP gene in a <STRONG>patient
originally suspected to be suffering from familial Alzheimer-type
dementia</STRONG>, we screened 101 individuals with atypical dementias for the
known PrP gene mutations.<P>
 Insertions were found in five individuals,
whereas none of the other reported mutations in the PrP gene was
detected in the present study. One of the five insertions was larger
than that described previously, suggesting that the individuals with
these mutations are unlikely to be all lineally related and that
insertions in the PrP gene may not be uncommon in prion diseases.

<H3>CJD and BSE: Exploring the <A NAME="Possible">Possible</A> Link</H3>

<blockquote>by <A HREF="mailto:<madcow@voyager.co.nz>">Allen E. Goldenthal</A>, B.Sc.,DVM.<br>
submitted to: New York Academy of Science for the Annals 7.1.96<p>

<b>Abstract:</b><p>

It is recognized that a single host gene  encodes the agent for scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, kuru, GSS, Creutzfeldt-Jakob  and other Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies.  This gene is transcribed equally in both normal and diseased hosts. <p>

The claim that rendered sheep offal fed to cattle was the  initiator for BSE is not fully supported by the facts. Although recent revelations of the variant-CJD being possibly linked to BSE are still being debated, it is surprising considering past evidence of just such a cross species transmission. <p>

 It has been the author's experience as Director for the Animal Resources Department and Pathology of a leading biologics manufacturer in Canada that a more plausible explanation may be a pathway failure in which one of the host body's sophisticated production processes is interfered with.  Through comparisons of pathologic lesions at an electronmicroscopic level, the author has discovered what he considers significant associated pathology that suggests mechanical destruction.  The vacuolation resulting from the prion disease is not unlike many other neuropathogeneses.   It may be more appropriate to evaluate prions on a cellular pathway level and thereby examine their development and spread more as a molecular epidemiology. <p>
 
The author reviews the history of prion disease in order to provide a perspective and insight that cannot be gained when reports are read as isolated incidents.  Only by examining prion disease as a logical process which does not require genetic material can the agent be recognized as to its true potential for neural destruction.<p>



<b>DISCUSSION</b><p>


	Upon review of articles and materials involving spongiform encephalopathies, certain hypotheses were expounded in this article suggesting that far more information on this family of disease agents can be extrapolated from current knowledge.  The fact that thus far, prions have been unique in the behavior suggests that accepted principles that normally are applied to other micro organisms do not adhere well in when dealing with abnormal prions. <p>

	Certain species are more prone to TSE's than others.  The high susceptibility of goats does not only apply itself to scrapie but to CJD as well.  When CJD was injected into goats, the resultant disease was indistinguishable from naturally occurring scrapie either on the basis of clinical signs nor by histopathology.  Whereas  other species seem to rely heavily on a host-agent mechanism for determining severity and incubation period, this does not appear to be a restriction exhibited in goats.  <p>

	The potential for human infection with prion disease is a distinct possibility wherever beef or dairy products are consumed and BSE exists.  Since 85% of CJD cases are not familial based, there is the possibility that some of these cases as recently reported in Britain, are BSE related.  A view of the CJD incidence worldwide reported in Masters paper of 1979 overlaid against a map of the beef and dairy industries would possibly suggest that a relationship between the disease was occurring prior to this decade and that BSE may have been present earlier than its recorded date in Kent, England. <p>

	The possibility of a closer relationship in mechanism between CJD and Alzheimers Disease must be fully explored and identification of those cases of AD which were misdiagnosed must be done in order to acquire a more accurate knowledge of CJD incidence.   If the hypothesis of prion disease being the result of an abnormal  pathway resulting in human diseases such as CJD and AD, then it would be likely that the host would eventually encode the abnormality as in AD and propagate the disease in subsequent generations.  Some indicator of BSE or V-CJD would arise in the present of near future in either an isolated cow or a human, respectively. <p>

This would be considered a spontaneous case simply because the host was completely isolated from any of the same species harbouring the disease and not exposed to any products either ingested or injected that may cause the disease.  Scott reports such a case, which he did label as 'spontaneous'occurring to a cow held in isolation at the University of Edinburghs pedigreed Holstein herd.  The subject was a four year old Holstein that was eight months pregnant with her third calf.  She had been born fourteen months after the introduction of the ban and had no exposure to any contaminated materials during its lifetime.  Clinical signs began to manifest themselves after the second calving.   Scott could only conclude that either the cow was accidentally fed contaminated feed from an unknown source that mysteriously appeared at the university or a prion mutation occurred in this particular cow giving rise to BSE spontaneously.<p>

	The alteration of prions as they passage through various host species would indicate that there was a common origin for prion diseases and that host specificity was a result of continued passage within the same species.  This would also suggest that a genetic susceptibility or recognition process would also be achieved within the host species over time.  The process of alteration would increase the opportunity for further prion dysfunction which in turn may advance the onset, severity, and transmissibility of the prion which is evident in the clinical findings of the numerous prion strains within  a single species.   <P>

Such alterations could result in every mammalian species developing a prion disease specific to itself with maximized effect.  The ability for different etiological agents to produce histopathological signs within the central nervous system having similar features amongst numerous mammalian species may indicate a predisposition which encourages genetic incorporation.<p>

	Sourcing of bovine material for any purpose, including consumption, manufacturing, research etc. should be from a country where CWD, scrapie and BSE are not present.  In this way a level of confidence can be achieved which cannot be obtained presently with products from certain countries.  The summons to take the prion situation seriously of almost a decade ago could never be more prophetic than on this threshold that we currently find ourselves upon.</blockquote>

<A NAME="human">Human</A> prion gene deletions in atypical Alzheimer's disease
</H4>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Perry RT; Go RC; Harrell LE; Acton RT <BR>

<I>Am J Med Genet 60: 12-8 (1995)</I></FONT><P>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative neurological
disorder of the central nervous system. AD is the fourth leading cause
of death in elderly persons 65 years or older in Western industrialized
societies. The etiology of AD is unknown, but clinical, pathological,
epidemiological, and molecular investigations suggest it is
etiologically heterogeneous. <P>

Mutations in the amyloid protein <STRONG>are rare</STRONG>
and segregate with the disease in a few early-onset familial AD (FAD)
families. Similarities between AD and the unconventional viral (UCV)
diseases, and between the amyloid and prion proteins, implicate the
human prion protein gene (PRNP) as another candidate gene. <P>

Single strand
conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to screen for
mutations at this locus in 82 AD patients from 54 families (30 FAD), vs.
39 age-matched controls. A 24-bp deletion around codon 68 of the prion gene that codes
for one of five Gly-Pro rich octarepeats was identified in two affected
sibs and one offspring of one late-onset FAD family. Two other affected
sibs, three unaffected sibs, and three offspring from this family, in
addition to one sporadic AD patient and three age-matched controls, were
heterozygous for another octarepeat deletion located around codon 82.<P>

Two of the four affected sibs had features of Parkinson's Disease (PD), including one who was
autopsy-verified AD and PD. Although these deletions were found
infrequently in other AD patients and controls, they appear to be a rare
polymorphism that is segregating in this FAD family. It does not appear
that mutations at the PRNP locus are frequently associated with AD in
this population.<HR>

Numerous Caucasian familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees have
been described in the literature, while only 21 Japanese FAD families
have been reported to date. Here we report the clinical findings and the
result of molecular genetic analysis of 4 patients from two FAD
kindreds, OS-2 and OS-3.<P>

 The proband in OS-2 family has developed loss
of recent memory and place disorientation age at 43. A brain CT showed
severe diffuse cortical atrophy. Her younger brother had dementia at 42
years and her mother and other 3 siblings had also dementia symptoms
suspected to be Alzheimer's disease.<P>

 The proband in OS-3 family showed
declining recent memory at 49 years and developed dysphagia, gait
disturbance and emotional incontinent with cerebral atrophy at 52 years.
His father and elder brother demonstrated dementia signs at 60 and 54
years old, respectively. <P>

Recently it was reported that affected members
from 2 Caucasian kindreds with FAD had missense mutation in exon 17 of
the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP). Patients from three
different Japanese kindreds with FAD also showed the same mutation on
the APP gene. Amino acid substitution (Val-Ile) at codon 717 by this
mutation is responsible for FAD in at least some kindreds. <P>

We used
genomic DNA from 4 affected members of 2 families to determine whether
the disease in these families is associated with a APP717 mutation and
the mutated codons, 102, 117, 129, 178 and 200, on the <STRONG>gene for
protease-resistance prion protein</STRONG> (PrP) which cause transmissible
dementia, Creutzfelt-Jacob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Strausler

This article compares beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP)
disorders exemplified by Alzheimer's disease (AD), with prion protein
(PrP) disorders, exemplified by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in
humans and scrapie in animals. Although there are obvious differences in
the etiology and pathogenesis of both sets of disorders, <STRONG>a remarkable
number of similarities exist.</STRONG> <P>

Both sets of disorders are characterized
clinically by age-related sporadic and familial diseases. In both, an
abnormal form of a neuronal membrane protein appears to play a key role
in the pathogenesis: beta-A4 peptide in AD and PrPCJD in CJD. Both
beta-A4 and PrPCJD are amyloidogenic. Neuritic plaques characteristic of
AD were once thought to be exclusively associated with beta-A4 amyloid;
however, some pedigrees with familial prion disease produced neuritic
plaques with PrP amyloid cores. <P>

Finally, beta-APP accumulation in
skeletal muscle has been implicated in the age-related muscle disorder,
inclusion body myositis. A similar myopathy has recently been discovered
in transgenic mice expressing high levels of normal PrP. These
similarities suggest that what is learned about one set of disorders may
be applicable to the other.<HR>

Brain 116 ( Pt 3): 555-67 (1993) <P>

We report the clinical and neuropathological findings in a patient with a 216 base pair insertion in the prion protein (PrP) gene. She died
aged 57 years after a 2.5-year illness characterized by falls, axial rigidity, myoclonic jerks and progressive dementia. There was no
history of affected relatives. The pathological changes consisted of the deposition in cerebellum, basal ganglia and cortex of small plaques
composed of variable amounts of amyloid and degenerative material which was associated with a marked macrophage reaction. The amyloid
deposits in the cerebellum and basal ganglia gave a positive immunoperoxidase staining reaction for PrP.<P>

 In some places plaques bore a
resemblance to senile neuritic plaques and in the hippocampus there were <STRONG>abundant typical neuritic plaques giving positive staining
reactions for beta-amyloid protein and tau protein, but not PrP</STRONG>. There were few neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles.<P>

 This is the first
report of the neuropathological changes associated with this particular abnormality of the PrP gene and it seems to demonstrate a <STRONG>transition
between the pathology of prion disease and that of Alzheimer's disease.</STRONG> The importance of PrP gene analysis to the understanding of
neurodegenerative diseases is stressed.

Prion gene sequence is thought to affect the phenotypic expression of prion disease and the E2 variant of apolipoprotein E (Apo E) can be
neuroprotective in dementia. We determined codon 129 of the prion gene and the Apo E variants in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) using
PCR and restriction digest. We found a significant correlation between valine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene and the presence of
plaque in CJD and a later age of onset in CJD cases possessing the Apo E2 allele. This study provides further evidence that sequence
variations in the prion gene can modify disease pathology and the <STRONG>neuroprotection afforded by Apo E2 is not confined to Alzheimer's disease.</STRONG>

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapid progressive mental and neurological disorder characterised by dementia and is both infectious
and genetic. Pathogenic mutations and a predisposing polymorphism have been described in the prion protein gene and an abnormal prion
product accumulates in the brain of affected patients. <P>

Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a protein of lipid metabolism, has been detected in some
prion protein deposits. This ApoE exists as three common isoforms, coded by specific allele (epsilon 2, epsilon 3, epsilon 4). The presence
of at least one epsilon 4 allele was described as a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, another neurodegenerative disorder.<P>

 From a
series of 61 patients with CJD we found that epsilon 4 allele of the APOE gene was a risk factor for the disease (p < 0.01). This association
was observed in both definite and probable cases, and for patients with and without prion protein gene mutations. Moreover, in affected
subjects, epsilon 2 allele of the APOE gene delayed occurrence of death (p < 0.01) independently of other known mutations influencing the
phenotype of the disease. These effects on neurodegenerative disease associated with APOE alleles suggest a strong involvement of the APOE
locus in brain metabolism.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     If indeed a form of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) exists in the United States, one might expect to see a rise in the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).  CJD, however, is not a reportable illness in this country (Holman, 1995).  Because the Centers for Disease Control  (CDC) does not actively monitor the disease (Altman, 1996d) a rise similar to the one in Britain could be missed (Altman, 1996d). <P>
 Already, a number of U. S. CJD clusters have been found.  In the largest known U. S. outbreak of sporadic cases to date(Flannery, 1996) a five-fold expected rate was found to be associated with cheese consumption in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley  (Little, 1993)   A striking increase in CJD was also reported in Florida (Berger, 1994) and there is an anecdotal report of an cluster in Oregon (Boule, 1996).  An analysis of death certificates in a number of states, though, showed an overall stable and typical CJD incidence rate from 1979 to 1993 (World, 1996).  To track the disease, the CDC has just initiated a four-state study of death certificates (Altman, 1996a), but since it is considered well known that death-certificate diagnoses are not always accurate (Davanpour, 1993) the survey may not provide an accurate assessment.<P>

     The true prevalence of prion diseases in this or any other country remains a mystery (Harrison, 1991).  Compounding the uncertainty, autopsies are rarely performed on atypical dementias (Harrison, 1991), because medical professionals fear infection  (Altman, 1996a). The officially reported rate in this country is less than 1 case in a million people per year (World, 1996).   An informal survey of neuropathologists, however, registered a theoretical range of 2-12% of all dementias as actually CJD (Harrison, 1991).  And hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer from severe dementias every year (Brayne, 1994; United, 1995).  Two other studies average about a 3% CJD rate among dementia patients (Mahendra, 1987; Wade, 1987).  A preliminary 1989 University of Pennsylvania study showed that 5% of patients diagnosed with dementia were actually dying from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Boller, 1989).  It would seem CJD is seriously underdiagnosed at present (Harrison, 1991).  <P>

     The most common misdiagnosis of CJD is Alzheimer's disease (Harrison, 1991).   CJD was even described by our government's top CJD researcher (Wlazelek, 1990a) as "Alzheimer's in fast forward (Wlazelek, 1990b)."  The symptoms and pathology of both diseases overlap (Brown, 1989).  There can be spongy changes in Alzheimer's, for example, and senile plaques in CJD (Brown, 1989).  The causes may overlap as well; epidemiological evidence suggests that people eating meat more than four times a week for a prolonged period have a three times higher chance of suffering a dementia than long-time vegetarians (Giem, 1993), although this result may be confounded by vascular factors (Van Duijn, 1996).  <P>

Paul Brown, medical director for the U.S. Public Health Service (Gruzen, 1996), said that the brains of the young people who died from the new CJD variant in Britain even look like Alzheimer's brains (Hager, 1996).  Stanley Prusinger, the scientist who coined the term prion,  speculates Alzheimer's may in fact turn out to be a prion disease (Prusiner, 1984).  In younger victims the disease could look like multiple sclerosis or a severe viral infection, according to Alzheimer's expert Gareth Roberts (Brain, 1996).<P>

     An estimated two to three million Americans are afflicted by Alzheimer's (Scully, 1993); it is the fourth leading cause of death among the elderly in the U.S (Perry, 1995).  Twenty percent or more of people clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are found at autopsy to not have had Alzheimer's at all (McKhann, 1984).    At Yale, out of 46 patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's, 6 were proven to be CJD at autopsy (Manuelidis, 1989).  In another post-mortem study 3 out of 12 "Alzheimer" patients actually died from a spongiform encephalopathy (Teixeira, 1995).  <P>

Carleton Gajdusek, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work with prion diseases (Manuelidis, 1985), estimates that 1% of people showing up in Alzheimer clinics actually have CJD (Folstein, 1983).  That means that hundreds of people (Hoyert, 1996; United, 1995) may already be dying from mad cow disease each year in the United States.<P>

A few weeks ago, mention was made of a memorandum submitted by Gareth Roberts to
the Agricultural Committee, House of Commons, June 1990.  For those of us who
are not habitues of the House, very similar arguments were made in a Lancet
editorial (1).  The editorial writer calculates that if 2% of patients with
diagnosed dementias have CJD (1500 cases per annum) and that if 10% of patients
with undiagnosed dementias also have CJD (7500/year), the actual incidence would
be some 250 times that reported.  <P>

That these estimates are markedly high is
shown by another reference previously made in the list, the report of the very
same Gareth Roberts and his colleagues studying 1000 cases of dementia (2) .
They found that on review of the histopathology of autopsied dementia cases and
doing immunochemical stains, the diagnosis of CJD could be increased a
relatively modest 1.7 fold.  Only one of the patients was under 45 and that
patient had a "strong" family history, an observation suggesting either familial
CJD or Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS).  Accordingly none of the
patients would fit the criteria for variant CJD.<P>

<h3>Senile Dementia and Meat Eating</h1>


<i>Age concern for meat eaters as new study suggests links between
meat-eating and senile dementia.</i><P>

Meat-eaters may be more than twice as likely to develop senile dementia as
their vegetarian counterparts, according to the findings of a study 
conducted at California's Loma Linda University
<p>
Dementia is widely recognised as a major medical, social and economic
problem in developed countries where the over 65s account for an
increasingly high percentage of the population. In the UK, around 20 per
cent of the total population are aged over 65. Some five to seven per cent
of the over 65s are estimated to suffer moderate or severe dementia; while
mild, early and borderline demented states affect 10 to 50 per cent.
<p>
Research has suggested a link between diet and dementia; and it is possible 
Alzheimer's Disease and the similar Senile Dementia of the Alzheimer Type 
(SDAT) may involve an infectious component which is spread by an infectious
mechanism.
<p>
Researchers from the Department of Preventative Medicine at Loma Linda 
University investigated the relationship between
>animal product consumption and
evidence of dementia in two cohort substudies. The first involved 272
age and postal area matched Californian residents: 68 vegan, 68
lacto-ovo-vegetarian and 136 meat-eaters (described as 'heavy' meat-eaters,
consuming meat more than four times weekly). The second substudy included
2,984 unmatched subjects residing within the Loma Linda area. All
participants were enrolled in the Adventist Health Study.
<p>
In the matched substudy, it was found subjects who ate meat were more than 
twice as likely to become demented as their vegetarian counterparts. and
this increased to three times as likely when past meat consumption was taken
into account. No difference was observed between the lacto-ovo-vegetarians
and vegans.
<p>
The unmatched substudy found no significant difference in the incidence of
dementia in meat-eaters and vegetarians. It is suggested that this was due
to the unmatched study being unable to detect the effects of 'heavy' meat
consumption. this in turn suggests it is possible that there is minimal or
no difference between the incidence of dementia in vegetarians and
occasional meat-eaters (less than four times/week). Delayed onset of 
dementia in vegetarians was detectable in both substudies. In the unmatched
substudy only one person who had been vegetarian for 30 years developed

The hypothesis that animal-product consumption may be linked to senile
dementia has previously been proposed by Alzheimer's researchers. The
findings from this preliminary study support their views and indicates 
further research is warranted.

<H3>MELATONIN: MIRACLE OR MENACE?  </H3><P>
Deseret News Archives ... 
December 12, 1995 ... Reuter News Service <P>

   A series of books extolling the virtues of the naturally produced hormone have caused a stampede to health stores, with U.S. consumers sweeping melatonin tablets from the shelves.
   Such passionate American espousal has alarmed British regulators, who have ordered it to be made available only on prescription.<P>
   Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally in the pineal gland, a pea-size organ in the center of the brain. It works with the neuro-trans-mitter serotonin to regulate sleep.
   Secreted naturally as darkness falls, it regulates fertility in animals and governs the sleep cycle. Children produce it in large quantities, but production falls with age, dropping steeply in middle age.<P>
   It is known to help regulate sleep in people with sleep disorders and is prescribed in Britain to help counteract jet lag.
  
   ``It does have some free radical scavenging activity,'' said Dr. Josephine Arendt, an endocrinologist at the University of Surrey in southern England. ``But I have yet to see any evidence of this in humans.'   Arendt says there is good evidence that taking synthesized melatonin tablets helps prevent jet lag and regulates sleep patterns in some people.
  Arendt, who said she tested the hormone on herself before using it on humans, said other claims were not borne out. ``I have personally taken it since 1981, and I have, in the process, become old, gray, wrinkled and fat,'' she said.<P>


   She added: ``You should <B>not even consider taking melatonin from any animal source</B>.''<P>
   Most of the companies that make melatonin tablets keep its formula secret. But some scientists working with the hormone describe getting it from rats that have been whisked up in a blender, <B>while other sources may include cattle</B>.<P>
   Children given human growth hormone from corpses have developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal nerve disorder that turns the brain spongy.
   There are fears that people can get CJD from exposure to infected brain tissue from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease).<P>
   There is a more natural source - melatonin is secreted into urine at night. Those seeking a truly natural dose could follow the ancient practice of Indian yogis and drink their own urine each morning.<P><HR>

<I>Listserve item, 29 May 96:</I><P>
What about melatonin? It has been sold in Europe and the US for years and
is very popular in health food circles and as a food supplement for
vegetarians. Many brands of so called "Natural Melatonin" (non-synthetic) are prepared
from bovine pineal glands.

Government health warnings are to be issued to teachers about the possibility of children becoming infected with deadly food-poisoning microbes during school trips to farms.<BR><BR>
Scientists have warned the government that children who fail to wash their hands after stroking farm animals can easily become infected with E-coli 0157, the microbe responsible for the food-poisoning outbreak in Scotland that has so far killed 15 people.
The Scottish Office last week wrote to all directors of education in Scotland with a list of health tips to minimise the risk of children being infected after coming into close contact with animals during farm visits.<BR><BR>
Its letter warns: &quot;Precise information is not available about the prevalence of E-coli among farm animals. Studies have shown, however, that it can be found in cattle, sheep, goats, horses and geese.&quot;
Although many species of farm animals can be infected with the microbe, they do not show any symptoms, the letter says. &quot;The organism can also exist in manure and slurry. Evidence indicates that the infection may be contracted by direct contact with farm animals or by the consumption of contaminated food or water.&quot;<BR><BR>
E-coli is found most commonly in the intestines of cattle, although it can easily be passed from one animal to another. When contracted by humans it causes serious health problems, particularly in children and the elderly.<BR><BR>
Children who stroke animals whose coats may be smeared with contaminated faeces can pick up the microbe if they handle food without washing first.
Professor Hugh Pennington, the scientist in charge of the investigation into the E-coli outbreak in Scotland, warned: &quot;With the prevalence of E-coli, I think one has seriously to con sider farms as being basically dangerous places.&quot; No special hygiene guidance has been issued to English schoolteachers taking part in farm visits since the food-poisoning outbreak in Scotland. However, official advice is issued to farms about hygiene arrangements, particularly hand-washing facilities.<BR><BR>
Scottish teachers are being asked to check that farms have suitable facilities and that children do not eat near animals.<BR><BR>
Richard Slack, consultant in communicable disease for Nottingham health authority, said civil servants are reviewing the government's advice to English and Welsh schools on the risks of infectious diseases and that the new guidance will cover farm visits.<BR><BR>
In 1994 scientists traced an outbreak of E-coli among four children and a teacher to a farm in Leicestershire where a number of different animals were kept in the same pens for children to handle.<BR><BR>
Two farmers in Scotland are thought to have become infected with E-coli as a result of handling sheep.<BR><BR>
* About 90 children and 10 staff from Abington Vale Middle school, Northamptonshire, are being tested for suspected food poisoning after suffering headaches, sickness and diarrhoea. Environmental health officers are investigating the incident after children and staff fell ill after eating Christmas dinner on Wednesday.<BR><BR>

Guardian    ...   18 December 1996</FONT><BR><BR>
The Government yesterday finally acknowledged the scale of the E. coli outbreak in Lanarkshire by setting up a cabinet committee to see what lessons can be learned for food hygiene throughout Britain.<BR><BR>
The move came as it was officially confirmed that the outbreak, which has killed 11 people, is the second worst ever in the world.<BR><BR>
The shadow Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, said: &quot;Clearly, we welcome the fact that the Government appear now to be accepting responsibility for this crisis but why did it take so long to do this?&quot;<BR><BR>
The meeting came three weeks after the outbreak began and will be the third inquiry, with a fatal accident inquiry and an investigation by a leading Scottish academic, Professor Hugh Pennington, already under way.<BR><BR>
The group, which held its first meeting last night, was chaired by the Lord President, Tony Newton, and included Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg and an Environment Minister. Ministers from Northern Ireland and Wales may also be invited to join.<BR><BR>
Mr Forsyth, who asked the Prime Minister to set up the group, had earlier resisted demands for a public inquiry on the grounds that a fatal accident inquiry would cover the same ground.<BR><BR>
After last night's meeting he said the committee had been set up &quot;so that any lessons which are learned from the experience in Lanarkshire can be applied and implemented speedily across the UK as a whole. Bugs do not respect boundaries.&quot;<BR><BR>
Mr Robertson said the credibility of any ministerial committee depended on Scottish Office ministers answering questions about their own handling of the epidemic.<BR><BR>
Motherwell North MP John Reid welcomed any inquiry but questioned the point of what he described as an in-house investigation.<BR><BR>
However, Downing Street said the Cabinet committee had been set up as a reflection of the concern of the Scottish Secretary. 'Our food safety standards are extremely high and we want to keep them up,&quot; added a spokesman.<BR><BR>
Last night the number of those infected remained unchanged for the second day since the outbreak three weeks ago. There are 216 confirmed cases with 36 people in hospital in the Lanarkshire and Forth Valley health board areas. According to the health boards, 17 of those are giving cause for concern.<BR><BR>
The number of Scottish fatalities equals the number of people who died from the bacteria in Japan this summer. The world's worst E. coli death toll was in Canada in 1985 where 19 people died.<BR><BR>
Responding to claims on Wednesday by Professor Richard Lacey of Leeds University that the death toll could reach 100, Lanarkshire health board public health consultant Dr Syed Ahem said the worst of the outbreak was over and that control measures were working.<BR><BR>
However, the Scottish Office issued a further warning to local authorities to re-examine outlets supplied by the Wishaw butcher John Barr & Son, whose shop is at the centre of the outbreak.<BR><BR>
Earlier this week a second butcher, John Mulvaney in New Stevenson, was closed.<BR><BR>
In a further development, lawyers representing John Barr & Son criticised the delay in making available test results from samples of cooked meats taken by environmental health officials.<BR><BR>
In a statement, solicitor George Moore said the results should have been available within three days but three weeks had elapsed and Mr Barr had heard nothing.<BR>

a private function <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">the day after he was told about
the outbreak</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Lanarkshire Health Board said John Barr, whose Wishaw shop has been linked
to the E coli epidemic, supplied cold turkey, ham and beef on Nov 23. The
meat was eaten in sandwiches at an 18th birthday party attended by 106
people in a public house at Coltness, Wishaw.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It has come to our attention that a range of cooked meats (turkey,
boiled ham and roast beef) was supplied by John M Barr and Son, Wishaw,
on Saturday, Nov 23, for a private function, an 18th birthday party at
the Cascade pub, Wishaw, that evening,&quot; a statement from the health
board said.<BR>
<BR>
Police are investigating the incident and the health board said it had
spoken to 98 of the partygoers, 22 of whom had symptoms of E coli 0157
poisoning. One youth is being treated in hospital. Last night environmental
health officials had made &quot;some form of contact&quot; with another
five people at the party and were trying &quot;urgently&quot; to contact
one other person.<BR>

Financial Times ... Monday December 16 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Mr Franz Fischler, the European agriculture commissioner, will today
propose setting up a body with far-reaching powers <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">to
protect consumers in the European Union from dangerous foods</FONT></B>,
such as beef from cattle infected with BSE, or <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B> disease.<BR>
<BR>
His plan seems certain to provoke renewed confrontation with EU member
states determined to preserve their national authority over such a politically
sensitive area. Some countries, particularly the UK, will fiercely resist
any moves to cede power to a Brussels-based body.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Fischler, who will present the scheme immediately before today's EU
farm ministers' council in Brussels, is convinced the present system does
not provide adequate health protection.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;National perspectives are playing an undesirable role in community
decision-making,&quot; he told members of the European Parliament recently.<BR>
<BR>
The agriculture commissioner is expected to call for sanctions against
EU countries which fail to protect consumers and for reforms to ensure
the independence of scientists charged with making decisions on dangerous,
or potentially dangerous, diseases.<BR>
<BR>
The independent agency he is proposing would be less powerful than the
US Food and Drugs Administration, which has sweeping authority to control
the distribution of suspect foodstuffs and impose sanctions. However, Mr
Fischler believes the FDA commands public respect because it is perceived
to be politically independent.<BR>
<BR>
He is expected to call for curbs on the powers of EU member states and
the EU's standing veterinary committee, which consists of national experts
and advises on food safety measures. Mr Fischler has previously questioned
whether the committee is sufficiently independent of national interests
and lobby groups.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, he will argue that a new system of appointments should be established
to ensure the independence of scientists and vets charged with advising
the EU on food and health issues.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Fischler's announcement comes as the European parliament wraps up its
inquiry into the management of the crisis sparked by BSE. The inquiry's
final report, due out early next year, is expected to find that the crisis
was mismanaged by national governments and the European commission.<BR>
<BR>
The inquiry has uncovered a <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">catalogue of poor
decisions and oversights by officials charged with containing the BSE crisis</FONT></B>.
The most damaging accusation has been that Commission and member state
officials placed greater emphasis on protecting the beef market than protecting
consumers.<BR>
<BR>
Ms Emma Bonino, consumer affairs commissioner, told the inquiry last week
that decisions on BSE had been driven by agricultural interests. &quot;The
market is made up of producers and consumers. Producers currently have
far more power. Balance must be restored,&quot; she said.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>New evidence for cow's milk link to <A NAME="diabetes">diabetes</A></CENTER></H3>
Reuter Information Service (Oct 3, 1996)
<P>    LONDON  - New evidence published on Friday added weight to a controversial theory that feeding cows' milk to babies may cause them to develop diabetes in later life, the Lancet medical journal said.<P>
 Researchers from Rome and London said they studied 47 patients who had recently developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and found that 51 percent of them had immune cells which grew and replicated when exposed to a protein called beta caseine found in cow's milk.<P>

    Only 2.7 percent of healthy people in a control group had immune cells that reacted to the cow's milk protein, the scientists wrote in the Lancet.<P>

    "The association between IDDM and early consumption of cow's milk may be explained by the generation of a specific immune response to beta-caseine," said the researchers from the University of Rome and St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.<P>

    The theory says that cows' milk can stimulate a child's immune system to react to certain milk proteins which resemble proteins found on the surface of insulin-producing beta cells.<P>

    This in turn tricks the body's immune system into attacking and destroying the cells.<P>

    Earlier studies in mice specially bred to be prone to diabetes has shown that a protein-free diet prevents the onset of the disease, while a diet containing the cows' milk protein produces it.<P>

    Professor Leonard Harrison from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia, said in a commentary in the Lancet that the new research proved "the cow's milk story remains alive and kicking."<P>

    However, he added: "Much more research is require to define a role for immunity to cow's milk proteins in this process. In the meantime there is no justification for exacerbating cowphobia."

 <H4><CENTER>For cancer risk, <A NAME="rare">rare</A> steak a better bet than well done</CENTER></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   WASHINGTON (Apr 23, 1996 2:01 p.m. EDT) -- Like your steak well done? Lots of pan drippings?<P>


   Not a healthful choice, says the National Cancer Institute.

   The latest research suggests that cooking meat too long -- and at too high a temperature -- increases the risk of cancer.

   And pan gravy? Better not even think about it.<P>

   Red meat has long ridden high on the list of questionable foods, largely because of its high-fat link to heart disease. But meat-eaters are also known to have a higher-than-usual risk of some kinds of malignancy, especially colon cancer.<P>

   So researchers set out to see if the way people fix their steaks and hamburgers has a bearing on this risk. Their study was conducted on beef-loving Nebraska farmers -- 176 stomach cancer victims and 503 healthy people -- and is the first to examine this question.<P>

   "We found increasing risk with increasing doneness," said Mary H. Ward, a cancer institute epidemiologist who presented the findings Monday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.

   Her team discovered that folks who prefer their meat medium, medium-well or well-done are about three times as likely as those who eat their beef rare or medium rare to get stomach cancer.<P>

   Why? Stuff with the decidedly unappetizing name of heterocyclic amines may be the key. These are carcinogens -- cancer-causing agents -- and they are formed when animal protein known as creatinine is heated to high temperatures.<P>

   About 22,800 Americans will be diagnosed with stomach cancer this year. The risk has declined substantially throughout this century, probably because of better ways of preserving and storing food.<P>

   "There are still ways to eat meat," said Rashmi Sinha, another cancer institute researcher.  People who eat mostly roasted meat, which cooks at a much lower temperatures than frying or grilling, have no increased risk of stomach cancer, even if they like their roast beef well done.<P>

   However, even though roast beef does not have heterocyclic amines, the juice that bubbles in the bottom of the roasting pan does. So gravy made from these drippings is high in carcinogens.

  
   Burning meat on the outside introduces another class of carcinogens -- polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These are especially common in barbecue.<P>

   Dr. John H. Weisburger of the American Health Foundation, who has studied the link between meat and colon cancer, said other carcinogens may also come into play when people eat well-done meat.

   "Meat is a very complex product," he said, "and when you cook it, it makes it even more complex."<P>

   When the researchers looked at beef consumption without considering how it was cooked, they found a clear association between the amount eaten and the risk of stomach cancer.

   Those who ate beef at least once a day had about double the risk of those who had it just once a week. However, they found that cooking duration turned out to be more important than the amount eaten.<P>

   They divided consumption into three categories -- low, medium and high. People who ate their meat rare and in low quantities had the lowest risk. It was just 10 percent higher for those with high consumption of rare beef and 20 percent higher for those with low consumption of medium beef.

   However, the risk was 3.2 times higher for people who ate high quantities of medium beef, 2.8 times higher for those who ate low quantities of well-done beef and 3.3 times higher for those with high consumption of well-done beef.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Bacteria in milk <A NAME="three">causes </a> Crohn's bowel disease</H3></CENTER>

GLASGOW (May 15, 1996 5:17 p.m. EDT) -- A bacteria related to <B>bovine tuberculosis</B> may be a common cause of Crohn's disease, a painful and dangerous bowel inflammation, an expert on the illness told scientists on Wednesday.<P>

Dr John Hermon-Taylor, a surgeon at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, said people could be contracting the disease by drinking milk and the bacteria might be getting into the drinking water supply.<P>

Crohn's, which causes victims to lose weight because their bowels cannot absorb nutrients properly, affects up to 250,000 people in Europe, he said. Anywhere between 250,000 and 500,000 Americans also had it.<P>

Hermon-Taylor told the European Congress of Microbial Chemotherapy that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis -- the bacterium which causes Crohn's -- <B>resisted pasteurisation</B>, which kills bovine tuberculosis.<P>
 "It is a street-smart bug," he said, adding that the bacterium passed from cow to calf during pregnancy, showed up in milk, and survived in cow manure.<P>

    The <B>manure washes off into rivers</B>, and he said a study had found higher incidences of inflammatory bowel disease in Cardiff, in Wales, among people who lived along a river found to contain high numbers of the bacteria.<P>

    Hermon-Taylor said two-thirds of all Crohn's patients had the bacteria in their intestines, and more than <B>three percent of all dairy cows</B> were infected with it.<P>

    He said he had tested thousands of dairy cows and found the bacteria. It also turned up in most of his Crohn's patients, But it was hard to detect and diagnose.<P>

    "We know it's in our dairy herds," he told delegates to the conference, discussing ways to use drugs to treat infection. The bacterium grows so slowly that standard tests will not find it.<P>

    Hermon-Taylor said the infection, once identified, was easily treated with the proper drugs. He said he had seen remarkable recoveries in Crohn's patients he treated for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Link between powdered baby milk and <A NAME="diabetes">diabetes</A></H3></CENTER>

<P>   (Jun 3, 1996) -- Scientists are investigating possible links between diabetes in young children and the use of powdered baby milk following the discovery of a two-fold increase in the disease among under-fives in Britain.<P>


   A research project funded by the European commission is to be launched into the reasons why childhood diabetes in western Europe is rising at a rate of 2 percent a year. The disease, which can lead to blindness and kidney failure, is the second most common cause of long-term childhood illness after asthma.<P>

   Repeated studies have found that babies fed exclusively on infant formula milk from birth have up to twice the risk of developing the disease, compared with breast-fed babies.

   Scientists believe that breast milk may carry antibodies against the virus which causes the disease. On the other hand, an auto-immune reaction against the proteins found in formula based on cow's milk may trigger the slow destruction of insulin-producing cells.<P>

   Next month (July) a British Diabetic Association (BDA) meeting chaired by Professor Sir David Weatherall, Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, will discuss the setting up of a national research project. Although there are now at least 20,000 diabetic children and teenagers, the BDA is anxious not to alarm parents using powdered milk.<P>

   It is now widely believed that the destructive process of diabetes, which renders the body unable to process sugar, begins in the first months of life. It may lead to rapid destruction of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (insulin digests sugar), or it can take several decades to develop. The Japanese are the least susceptible, Finns the most. In Britain it is more common in the north.<P>

   Professor Edwin Gale, a diabetes expert at Bart's hospital in London, said incidence of the disease among under-fives has at least doubled over the past decade. "We are exposed to thousands of environmental agents, a lot of them completely new," he said. Professor Terry Wilkin has completed an European Union pilot project among 6,000 babies born. "There is a lot of evidence about environmental factors. The pointers suggest <B>one of the biggest risk factors is cows' milk-based formula foods</B>, but that link is not clear," said Wilkin.<P>

   Breast feeding rates in the UK are among the lowest in the world. Three-quarters of babies are getting powdered milk by three months. Critics point out baby milk companies are allowed to distribute free samples and advertising to new mothers via the British health service, in the scramble for a share of a market worth 119 pounds million a year.<P>

   The scientists have discovered that a high fat content in the digestive system significantly reduces alertness and affects speed and accuracy in tasks requiring sustained attention. Even when people consume more calories in a high-carbohydrate low-fat meal, their mental function is not as impaired as by a high-fat meal with fewer calories.<P>

   The research, published last week, involved testing the performance of 18 volunteers after feeding them high-fat and low-fat mid-morning breakfasts and lunches. Although the meals were apparently the same, their fat and carbohydrate content was manipulated.<P>

   The high-fat late breakfast was even worse than a high-fat lunch, leaving people tired, sluggish and easily muddled three hours later. The low-fat late breakfast was the most energising meal, creating attentiveness and efficiency.<P>

   "Carbohydrates make you feel assertive and alert," said Anita Wells, a researcher at Sheffield University's human nutrition centre, who is leading the project. However, she added: "Although fat makes you more lethargic and impairs mental performance, we found it does make people feel more friendly."<P>

   Previous research by the team has found people in simulated clerical jobs can be rapidly rendered inefficient by fat consumption. Studies compared their performance after 360 calories of fat infused directly into the digestion with that of another group of volunteers who had the same amount of saline solution similarly infused.<P>

 Professor Nicholas Read, who is co-ordinating the project, believes the results have particular implications for those in driving jobs or other activities such as air traffic control, where speed of reaction is crucial.<P>

   "Our studies broadly support what people intuitively know, which is why eating habits have changed in recent years," he said. "A low fat diet helps people to concentrate at work and a higher fat meal helps you relax. That's why people eat cereal and sandwiches for breakfast and lunch and a heavier meal in the evening."<P>

<H3>Diet Rich in Red Meat Causes <A NAME="Lymph">Lymph</A> Cancer<HR></H1></CENTER>


<P>    CHICAGO (Apr 30, 1996 4:01 p.m. EDT) -- Older women whose diet is rich in red meat face an increased risk of lymph node cancer, perhaps because absorbing the fat and protein in the meat overworks their immune systems, researchers said on Tuesday.<P>


    Heavy consumption of animal fat, saturated and mono-unsaturated fat and red meat, especially hamburger, was associated with the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), researcher Brian Chiu of the University of Iowa said.<P>

    He said the immune system may become chronically overstimulated by a high-fat, high-protein diet because more antibodies are released in response to red meat compared to other foods, resulting in a "state of immune tolerance."

    The immune system regularly responds to food intake by producing antibodies.<P>

    "Future studies need to fully evaluate cooking methods and done-ness of meat in order to identify more specific associations," Chiu wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

    In contrast, the research found that diets rich in fruits protected against NHL, while there was no association found between consumption of dairy products and lymph node cancer.<P>

    The study examined 35,156 Iowa women aged 55 to 69 years with no prior history of cancer, of whom 104 developed NHL. The cancer, which generally attacks the lymph nodes or spleen, accounts for roughly three percent of all cancers diagnosed annually in the United States, or 43,000 people last year, but its incidence has increased dramatically in recent years.<P>

    The National Cattlemen's Association was critical of the study, saying it was limited and contradicted findings of a 1994 Nebraska survey. The beef industry trade group also noted that the rising U.S. incidence of NHL has taken place during a period of declining red meat consumption.

<P>    LONDON (Aug 14, 1996 ... nando.net) -- A cancer-causing chemical in bracken can get into cows' milk, and may cause cancer in people who drink it, researchers said on Wednesday.<P>


    Such <B>contaminated milk</B> may be responsible for high levels of stomach cancer in Central and South America.

    Although cows do not normally eat the large, hardy ferns, found in temperate areas around the world, they will eat them if they have to, or if they get into a dense thicket.

    Bracken is known to cause cancer if eaten, and milk from cows that eat it causes cancer in mice and rats.<P>

    Miguel Alonso-Amelot of the University of the Andes in Venezuela, working with New Zealand scientists, tested the milk of six cows they had forced to eat bracken.

    They zeroed in on a <B>chemical called ptaquiloside</B>.
    "When ptaquiloside was first discovered, it was the chief candidate for this carcinogen, but it has never been demonstrated to be present in milk," they wrote in a letter to the science journal Nature.<P>

    They <B>found ptaquiloside in the milk of the cows</B> -- and the more bracken they ate, the more of the chemical there was in their milk.

    "There is rather a <B>high risk to humans</B> of ingesting milk containing ptaquiloside in areas where bracken is dominant," Alonso-Amelot's group wrote.

Ptaquiloside, a potent carcinogen of an illudane-type sesquiterpene glycoside <B>isolated from Pteridium aquilinum  [bracken fern]</B>, and its
related compounds, hypolosides having the same nucleus isolated from the Pteridaceae, exhibited marked mutagenicity in
the modified Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 using a preincubation at pH 8.5. Illudins M and S,
sesquiterpenes of the same illudane type from basidiomycetes, also exhibited mutagenicity. The structural requirements
for mutagenicity are discussed. 
<P>

The chromosomal aberration test using a Chinese hamster lung cell line (CHL) was carried out on ptaquiloside and its
related compounds, hypoloside B, hypoloside C, illudin M and illudin S. Ptaquiloside induced chromosomal aberrations at
doses as low as 4.5 micrograms/ml (0.0113 mM). The clastogenic effect was pH-dependent. The same activity was
observed at a 90-fold higher dose at pH 5.3 in the culture medium compared with the activity at pH 7.4 or pH 8.0. Both
hypoloside B and hypoloside C were also clastogenic at almost the same dose level as that of ptaquiloside. Illudin M and
illudin S were also potent clastogens and induced aberrations at much lower doses than ptaquiloside. These results suggest
that the clastogenic effect is involved in the mechanism of carcinogenic potency of ptaquiloside in animals.

<H3><CENTER>Signs of impending <A NAME="stroke">stroke</A> -- be aware of what they are</CENTER></H3>

<B>By Mike Woods</B><BR>

The Toledo Blade ... 8.15.96
<P>

The word ''stroke'' implies something sudden and unexpected -- a bolt from the blue that strikes without warning.


Yet strokes, or ''<B>brain attacks</B>,'' often produce warning symptoms. The warning may occur days, weeks or months before the actual attack. People who recognize the warning signs and get medical help often can avoid a stroke, along with permanent brain damage and disability.

<P>

Deaths from strokes have been declining, thanks to better diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure and control of cigarette smoking, diabetes and other risk factors. But strokes remain America's No. 3 cause of death, behind heart attacks and cancer. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that <B>500,000 people will have a stroke in 1996, and about 145,000 will die</B>.

<P>

AHA and other groups are trying to convince Americans to regard a stroke as a ''brain attack,'' a kind of heart attack in the head. And use of the term ''brain attack'' is apt, indeed. For strokes, like heart attacks, occur when body tissue is deprived of its normal supply of blood and oxygen and dies.

<P>

About 60 percent of strokes occur when a blood clot, or thrombus, forms in an artery carrying blood to part of the brain. Another 20 percent occur when a clot that formed elsewhere -- usually in the heart or neck -- travels to the brain and plugs a blood vessel. The clots block blood flow through the vessel. Parts of the brain dependent on that blood die, causing speech problems, paralysis and other symptoms of a stroke.

<P>

The remaining 20 percent of strokes result from hemorrhaging or bleeding from an artery in the brain.


Experts hope that the term ''brain attack'' will help people realize that a stroke, like a heart attack, is a medical emergency that requires immediate help. They also hope more people will learn the warning signs of a stroke, just as people are learning the warning signs of a heart attack.

<P>

The warning signs of a stroke are called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). ''Transient'' means brief and ''ischemic'' means deprived of blood. A TIA means that a temporary disruption has occurred in the brain's blood supply.

<P>

Symptoms of a TIA are one of more of the following:

<P>

-- Sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg on one side of the body.

<P>

-- Sudden dimness or loss of vision, especially in one eye.

<P>

-- Loss of speech. Or trouble talking or understanding speech.

<P>

-- Sudden, severe headaches with no apparent cause.

<P>

-- Unexplained dizziness, unsteadiness or sudden falls, especially in combination with the other symptoms.

<P>

Most TIAs are believed to occur when small clots lodge in an artery, and then dissolve before any lasting damage occurs. Without treatment, a total blockage may occur anywhere from hours to months later.


Don't ignore or deny the symptoms just because they vanish and you feel perfectly healthy once again. People who have had a TIA are 10 times more likely to have a stroke soon after, compared to people of the same age and sex who have not had a TIA.

<P>

Get immediate medical help if TIA symptoms occur. Studies indicate that 20 percent to 40 percent of all strokes are preceded by TIAs. If people recognized the significance of a TIA, and got medical attention, thousands of fatal and nonfatal strokes could be prevented each year.

<P>

If you have had a stroke, or are at high risk for a stroke, make sure that your family, friends, and co-workers know the symptoms of TIA. Then they can get medical help if you are unable to recognize your own symptoms or to call for help.


Mention TIA symptoms in conversations, copy them onto a piece of paper and post them in the house, near your work area, or on your locker. The more people who are aware of these tell-tale warning signs, the greater the chances that someone can be saved from a brain attack.<HR>



<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Blackmailer">Blackmailer</A> threatened to poison dairy foods</CENTER></H3>
The Times: Britain: August 28 1996<BR>
BY LIN JENKINS
<P>


A FAILED businessman who attempted to extort &#163;250,000 from British dairy companies by threatening to contaminate their products with poisonous micro-organisms was jailed for three years by an Austrian court yesterday.



The British authorities have begun an inquiry into their failure to extradite him to Britain. Michael Just, 37, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was arrested when he went to withdraw money from an account he had opened in Austria for the proceeds of the blackmail.

<P>

He can serve his jail term in Britain, and accepted the sentence because his wife, Nora, is in custody here awaiting trial. "I want to return to Britain as soon as possible. My wife is in jail there and expecting a child. Otherwise I would be appealing against the sentence," he said. The prosecution asked for the stat utory three days to decide whether to challenge the sentence.

<P>

Ronald Schoen, for the prosecution, said that Just had used his degree in microbiology and virology at Nottingham University to hatch the plot after running into financial difficulties. After leaving university he had set up a firm specialising in methods of processing sewage, but it went bankrupt.



He then set up an information service for Internet users, but his debts grew, he was threatened with the loss of his house and his fourth child was due. He decided to turn to crime. Just told the court: "I was depressed when I got the idea to make a lot of money very quickly using criminal methods."

<P>

In early May Just obtained by mail order cultures of the bacteria <I>Yersinia enterocolinica,</I> which can cause digestive problems, intestinal infections and diarrhoea. He said that it was "much feared" in the dairy industry. "It would not have affected me personally because I do not drink milk, but milk is an important product," he said.



Just made his blackmail demands to the five companies, in London, West Mercia, Northumbria and Suffolk. They were to show their willingness to pay in an advertisement in <I>The Times</I>. The money was to go to an anonymous savings account he had opened at the Credit-Anstalt bank in Vienna via the Internet. Just told the court: "That seemed to me the most secure method because it is all anonymous in Austria."

<P>

He wrote several times to the companies, once including a product carton painted black and another time sending one that was contaminated with the bacteria. He also threatened to go public. Herr Schoen said the companies went to the police after tests showed that the bacteria was present in what they had been sent.

<P>

The Vienna court convicted Just on a charge of "serious blackmail". Herr Schoen said Just was caught as he went to take money out of the account in a sting set up by British and Austrian police.



West Mercia police, who co-ordinated the investigation into the blackmail, said yesterday that they were not told he was to stand trial in Vienna. A Foreign Office spokesman said he could only imagine that the extradition order did not arrive in time. It was being followed up.

The Monsanto corporation's genetically-engineered hormone, rBGH,
seems to be in trouble.  The product is marketed to dairy farmers
for injection into their cows to boost milk production about 10&#37;,
but a survey of farmers last summer indicated that enthusiasm for
the product remains low.[1]  And last month a new peer-reviewed
medical study argued that rBGH may promote cancer of the breast
and colon in humans who drink milk from rBGH-treated cows.[2]
<P>
Monsanto has bet the future of the company on genetic
engineering, and rBGH is the company's first, showcase biotech
product.

Monsanto has refused to release any rBGH sales figures since
January, 1995.
<P>
The hormone, which Monsanto sells under the trade name Posilac,
and which is also known as BST or BGH or rBGH, has been bitterly
opposed by consumer groups on grounds that (a) its effects on
humans are not known, but may well be negative; (b) it is not
good for cows; (c) it is not needed because the U.S. already
produces far more milk than it can consume and taxpayers
presently have to foot the bill for purchasing and dumping this
excess milk; and (d) there are better, non-chemical alternatives
for increasing milk production, if that is a particular farmer's
goal.  (See REHW &#35;381-384.)
<P>
Monsanto's Posilac is a genetically-engineered hormone, known as
'recombinant bovine growth hormone,' or rBGH.  Monsanto some
years ago renamed it bovine somatotropin, or BST, thus avoiding
use of the word "hormone" in public discussions.  With inside
help from a former Monsanto consultant who went to work for the
federal government, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)
approved rBGH for sale in November, 1993 and the product went on
the market in early 1994. (See REHW &#35;382.)
<P>
When grocery stores began labeling certain milk as rBGH-free, as
a help to their customers who might want to avoid purchasing milk
from cows injected with the drug, Monsanto sued to prevent such
labeling.  Those lawsuits were Monsanto's home-grown variant of
the "banana laws" that the food industry has been successfully
promoting nationwide, to prevent food-safety advocates from
speaking out about potential dangers of chemically-treated foods.
(See REHW &#35;481.)  However Monsanto lost --or abandoned --all the
labeling lawsuits, so labeling milk as rBGH-free is now
permitted.  The federal FDA, however, has refused to require
labeling of milk from rBGH-treated cows.
<P>
An important California newspaper, the FRESNO BEE, reported late
last year that farmers in California --the largest dairy state
<HR>are treating rBGH like a dirty secret: no one wants to talk
about it, and no one wants to admit using it.[1]
<P>
Barbara de Lollis, a BEE staff reporter, said Monsanto claims to
have sold 14.5 million injections between February, 1994 and
January, 1995, reaching almost 30&#37; of the dairy herds in the
nation.  But then the company stopped releasing sales figures.
Ms. de Lollis conducted interviews across California and reported
that "an eery silence exists in dairy circles today regarding BST
[rBGH]."
<P>
"It's too controversial," said Jim Deaver, head of California
State University, Fresno's dairy unit, where they inject their
herds with rBGH.  "He refused to say more," Ms. de Lollis
reported.
<P>
"Some are embarrassed to talk about it," said Loren Lopes, a
Turlock, California producer who milks 300 cows without rBGH.
Farmers usually share their success or failure stories when an
important new product comes along, but not this time. "They're
keeping this hidden. They don't want people to know they're using
it," Mr. Lopes told Ms. de Lollis.
<P>
Mr. Lopes said he has heard of farmers who store their Posilac in
an out-of-sight cabinet or in their home.  Some farmers inject
their cows themselves after the hired hands go home.
<P>
Farmers order rBGH straight from Monsanto and sometimes they have
that unmistakable blue-and-orange FedEx truck deliver rBGH to
their feed supplier instead of to their farm, so their neighbors
won't know they're using the controversial hormone, according to
Mark Kastel, a researcher with the Wisconsin Farmers Union.  The
Union recently released an anecdotal report citing animal health
problems tied to the drug.[3]
<P>
A survey published last October in DAIRY TODAY, a respected
midwestern farm journal, said 20 percent of U.S. farmers have
tried rBGH.  But opposition appears to be hardening among
farmers, according to the survey firm, Rockwood Research.  Among
farmers who hadn't used rBGH, 87 percent said they would never
use it.
<P>
Rockwood interviewed 400 farmers in 21 states during the summer
of 1995.  One-fifth of the farmers lived in Wisconsin, the state
with the strongest anti-rBGH sentiment.
The survey says the main reasons for avoiding rBGH are:
philosophical opposition (34 percent); fear that the drug harms
cows (23 percent) and concern that rBGH won't improve profits (17
percent).
<P>
Of farmers who have tried the drug, 40 percent have since given
it up.

Of 30 farmers who used rBGH and then stopped, 16 said the drug
didn't improve profits, 10 said it caused health problems and
four said rBGH required too much time to manage, the survey
showed.

The survey noted that farmers with larger herds are more willing
to use rBGH. For example, 34 percent of farmers with herds of 250
cows or more tried  rBGH, but only 11 percent with herds between
40 and 99 cows used the milk-stimulating hormone.
<P>
Even in California, which is the original home of the large,
technologically sophisticated dairy farm, rBGH usage was down at
the end of 1995, according to two agricultural economists who
track California's dairy industry --Leslie Butler from University
of California at Davis and Vernon Crowder with Bank of America.
<P>
Ms. Butler blamed the decline on the "cost-price squeeze."  Cows
eat more feed when they're on rBGH and feed prices are sky-high
right now. Mr. Crowder blamed bad weather: rBGH would add more
stress to cows already affected by heavy rains earlier in the
year.
<P>
Dr. Charles Holmberg, a pathologist at the Tulare (California)
Veterinary Medicine Center, noticed another trend: Dairy farmers,
fearful of reproduction problems in cows, are using rBGH on a
more limited basis instead of on their whole herd.
<P>
Jerry Steiner, who directs Monsanto's U.S. marketing efforts for
rBGH, said the DAIRY TODAY survey didn't explore changes in the
dairy industry that Monsanto believes will improve sales or rBGH.
<P>
Monsanto's research shows that 30 percent to 40 percent of dairy
farmers plan to leave the industry within five years, Mr. Steiner
said. "A lot of older dairymen will retire," he said. "A new
generation of dairymen have different views."
<P>
Many older farmers believe their cows are more than mere milk
factories to be used up and discarded.  Injecting rBGH reduces a
cow's life expectancy and increases her risk of disease.
Normally for about 12 weeks after a cow calves, she produces milk
at the expense of her own tissues.  She loses weight, she is
infertile, and she is more susceptible to diseases such as
mastitis (inflammation of the udder). Eventually her milk output
diminishes, her food intake catches up, and she begins to rebuild
her body.  By injecting rBGH, a farmer can postpone for another 8
to 12 weeks the time when the cow begins rebuilding her body.
This means that the cow is stressed for another 8 to 12 weeks and
is more susceptible to infection during that period. This takes
its toll on the animal.
<P>
Veterinarians are not supposed to sanction harmful treatment of
animals.  However, U.S. veterinarians have not taken a stand
against the use of rBGH.  In Germany, however, veterinarians
formally oppose rBGH because of its ill effects on treated cows.
German veterinarians take the position that use of rBGH violates
their code of ethics.
<P>
Ethics is not Monsanto's primary concern.  Jerry Steiner said he
expects "significant growth" in doses sold this calendar year.
"Significant" means an increase of 25 percent to 40 percent, he
said.
<P>
Without providing numbers, Monsanto also said there has been
"steady growth" in the number of rBGH-treated cows and in the
percentage of cows within herds receiving the drug.
<P>
However, last October, shortly after the DAIRY TODAY survey was
released, Monsanto began offering new discounts to farmers to buy
rBGH.[4]
<P>
The discount of up to 10 percent rewards farmers willing to use
the drug on more of their cows, Mr. Steiner says.
<P>
The discount plan--for farmers who make a six-month
commitment--was launched in mid-October, 1995. It replaces
another incentive program that gave farmers credits on future
purchases.
<P>
Announcement of the new marketing strategy coincided with the
release of the survey in DAIRY TODAY, showing that farmers'
interest in rBGH is leveling off or even declining, but Monsanto
denies any connection.
<P>
Now a new medical study seems certain to diminish rBGH's
prospects even further.  Proponents of rBGH acknowledge that milk
from cows treated with rBGH contains increased levels of
insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), though there is disagreement
about the size of the increase. IGF-1 occurs naturally in both
cows and in humans, and the molecule is identical in the two
species.[5,6]  Furthermore, IGF-1 is not broken down by
pasteurization.  Therefore, IGF-1 ingested in milk from
rBGH-treated cows will likely be biologically active in humans.
(See REHW &#35;454.)  Dr. Samuel S. Epstein at the University of
Illinois in Chicago last month published a paper arguing that
IGF-1 from rBGH-treated cows may well promote cancer of the
breast and of the colon in humans who drink such milk.  Epstein
pulled no punches: "In short," he wrote, "with the active
complicity of the FDA, the entire nation is currently being
subjected to an experiment involving large-scale adulteration of
an age-old dietary staple by a poorly characterized and unlabeled
biotechnology product.  Disturbingly, this experiment benefits
only a very small segment of the agrichemical industry while
providing no matching benefits to consumers.  Even more
disturbingly, it poses major potential public health risks for
the entire U.S. population," Dr. Epstein wrote.<BR>

The Times    ...   Monday 19 August 96<P>

The recent warm weather has brought back smiles to the faces of farmers
who are completing their harvests. Too busy to read the papers, many may
well have missed an item which in pre-BSE days would have caused
concern.<P>

Now that farmers have been hardened by years of adverse publicity, the
latest <B>research from America into beefburgers</B> barely warrants a mention
in the bar of their local. Doctors from the Ohio College of Medicine
report in the Journal of the American Medical Association that they have
uncovered a tenuous <B>link between eating beefburgers and developing non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma</B>. The journal is a well-regarded American publication
and research published in it is taken seriously by doctors throughout
the world.<P>

Although there is an epidemic of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the Western
world, a cause has not been found and about 4,000 cases are diagnosed
annually in the United Kingdom. Some of the cases being treated are
known to follow damage to the immune system, whether as a result of
disease, as occurs in those infected with HIV, or following essential
treatment for other conditions; for example, when immune-suppressant
drugs are given for the treatment of other malignant disease, after
transplant surgery or in some types of connective tissue disease, such
as SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus).<P>

An association has also been noticed between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
melanoma, the malignant moles which sometime arise as a result of
excessive exposure to sun. It is possible that the increase in numbers
of both of these separate malignancies is a sequel to the sun-
worshipping that became firmly established when foreign travel became
easier after the Second World War. A few cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
are known to be a late result of infection with a virus.<P>

The good news for farmers is that in the Ohio research, based on 34,000
local women who had their diet analysed and compared with the incidence
of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the <B>connection with beefburgers seemed to be
entirely with the method of cooking </B>and not with the nature of the
meat.<P>

This time it may be the restaurateurs who have to alter their habits,
not the farmers. All forms of meat other than beefburgers were
exonerated and any association with beef was present only when it was
cooked in this way. It seems that the <B>cancer-forming power of the
beefburger is apparent only when the meat is overcooked or burnt</B>.<P>

A lymphoma is the form of cancer which attacks the cells of the lymph
glands and spleen. Hodgkin's disease is the best-known lymphoma and in
these cases pathologists find a particular type of abnormal cell, the
Reed Sternburg. When they do it is an encouraging finding, for with
modern treatment most cases of Hodgkin's disease can be cured.<P>

In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in which Reed Sternburg cells are absent, the
lymphoma is classified according to the type of lymphtotic cell which
has been overtaken by the malignant process (and therefore named B or T-
cell lymphoma), by the malignancy the cells are displaying and by the
way in which they are spreading.<P>

The diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually made when the patient
discovers a painless, enlarged rubbery lymph gland. In many cases the
gland is first found in the neck or groin. About a third of the patients
at the time of discovery are seriously anaemic, which worsens later as
the malignant tissue spreads, often to the stomach and intestines.<P>

As a terminal event, many people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma develop a
leukaemic-type blood picture. Whereas often the disease initially
develops slowly and no treatment is required in the early stages, later
on radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used. Although this does not effect
a cure, life is often prolonged for many years.<P>

 <H3><CENTER><A NAME="Meat">Meat</A> Intake and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</CENTER></H3>
 JAMA Letters - August 21, 1996
<P>


To the Editor.--The data from the cohort study by Dr Chiu and colleagues[ref. 1] relating diet to non-Hodgkin (NHL) lymphoma are
intriguing. Evidence from prospective cohort studies is held to be more reliable in generating evidence supporting causal relationships than
evidence from the other common design used in cancer epidemiology, the case-control study, in part because the temporal association
between the exposure (in this case, dietary intake of red meat) and the disease (lymphoma) seems clear. 
<P>
That a putative cause should
precede the disease is the sine qua non of any causal relationship. In spite of the design employed by Chiu et al,[ref. 1] however, the
temporal relationship between diet and cancer might not be as clear as it seems; cancers do not arise spontaneously, but grow until
symptoms lead the affected individual to seek medical attention. Some proportion of the women diagnosed with cancer in the study by Chiu et
al[ref. 1] had prevalent, but undiagnosed, disease when they filled out the dietary intake questionnaire used to quantify exposure. Those
women with prevalent cases of cancer may have reported their diet differently than they would have before the cancer was present. This is
more than a theoretical possibility. 
<P>
The prediagnostic effects of cancer on the host have complicated efforts to understand the relationship
between low serum cholesterol levels and cancer occurrence as cancer influences lipid metabolism long before it is ever clinically
recognized (2 years before or perhaps longer).[ref. 2] [ref. 3] Of more direct relevance, there are transient dietary changes that also may
occur well prior to cancer diagnosis.[ref. 4] 
<P>


The crucial question is to what degree do the observed relationships represent the effect of cancer on diet rather than the effect of diet on
cancer? The answer can be had by seeing whether the strength of the relationship between meat consumption and lymphoma is the same
among the women whose cancers are diagnosed in the first 2 to 3 years following the baseline examination compared with those whose
cancers are diagnosed in the remaining portion of the follow-up period. Though the estimates could be statistically imprecise, they would
help to evaluate an important competing hypothesis to explain the observed results.

To the Editor.--The recent article by Dr Chiu and colleagues[ref. 1] reported that a high meat diet and a high intake of fat from animal
sources was associated with an increased risk of NHL. 

The authors did not comment on the extensive literature pointing to an association between herbicides and other chemicals contaminated with
dioxins and NHL. The most recent review of the published scientific literature by the Herbicide Review Committee of the Institute of
Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, concluded, "The recent scientific literature continues to support the conclusion that there is a
positive association between<B> exposure to herbicides and non-Hodgkins lymphoma</B>."[ref. 2] 
<P>


Highly lipophilic and persistent chlorinated dioxins and the related chlorinated dibenzofurans are readily detected in tissues of persons
residing in industrial countries, such as the United States, and considerably lower levels are found in tissues of persons from less
industrial countries. A recent Environmental Protection Agency review concludes that levels found in the US general population may be
approaching levels associated with an elevated risk of adverse effects, including cancer.[ref. 3] Furthermore, elevated tissue levels can be
found in workers, some Vietnamese veterans, American veterans of Vietnam, and others exposed to herbicides containing dioxin and other
dioxin sources.[ref. 4] 
<P>


The proximate source of these chlorinated dioxins in the US general population is from the intake of food, specifically meat, fish, and dairy
products. Our analysis of dioxin levels in US food, and similar findings from England, Holland, Germany, and Canada, support the conclusion
that <B>foods high in animal fat are the primary source of exposure to dioxins</B> in nonoccupationally exposed individuals.[ref. 5] [ref. 6] The
possibility exists that dioxins found in a diet high in meat and animal fat may be contributing to the NHLs found by the authors in this study.
The addition of tissue (serum) measurement of dioxins to the authors' study or similar future studies, with calculation of dose of
dioxin-like compounds, might strengthen or refute this hypothesis.

In Reply.--Dr Kritchevsky raises the possibility that our results might be influenced by transient dietary changes due to potential
metabolic effects of subclinical NHL, reversing the temporal implications of our cohort study design. One approach to assessing the influence
of subclinical disease in cohort studies is to exclude cases diagnosed early in the follow-up period, and Kritchevsky suggests excluding the
first 2 to 3 years of follow-up. We split the difference and excluded cases (n=33) diagnosed in the first 2.5 years of follow-up (through
July 1988). The new results for the main findings in the original article (Tables 2 through 4) are presented in the accompanying Table.
Point estimates (compared with those published previously for all cases) were slightly attenuated for intakes of animal protein and total
fat, essentially unchanged for saturated and monounsaturated fat and hamburger, and somewhat increased for animal fat, all meats, and red
meats. These data provide no support for Kritchevsky's hypothesis. 

Dr Schecter and colleagues suggest that dioxin contamination of foods high in animal fat might explain our findings. They note that there is
"extensive literature pointing to an association between herbicides and other chemicals contaminated with dioxins" and NHL. While we agree
that there is relatively good evidence for the role of occupational exposure to herbicides and NHL risk (we adjusted for farm residence in
our multivariate model), the evidence for a specific role for dioxin has not been consistent.[ref. 1] As we noted in our comment section,
exposure to pesticide residues in food in the general population is much lower than occupational exposure, and an etiologic role in cancer is
still speculative and controversial.[ref. 2] 
<P>
Finally, it should be noted that the dioxin hypothesis is not fully supported by our data, since the
major dietary sources of dioxin for US adults are not only from beef but also milk and dairy products[ref. 3] [ref. 4]; we found no evidence
for NHL risk with consumption of these latter products. However, the findings by Schecter et al[ref. 4] that <B>ground beef from a New York
State supermarket had the highest "dioxin toxic equivalents"</B> relative to a variety of other foods tested is of interest given our finding of an
association with hamburger consumption. As we previously noted, the role of pesticide residues (as well as dioxins) warrants further
investigation, including the effects of these compounds on the immune system, interactions with oncogenic viruses, and transformation with
various cooking methods.

<H3>Good <A NAME="News">News</A> for Beer Drinkers</H3>
Science 11.22.96
<P>

In the 1970s, several research groups identified substances in charred meats and fish
as carcinogens. Now a Japanese research group has learned that the beer people often reach for
when they're eating barbecue may have an inhibitory effect on at least one of those
cancer-causing substances.<P>

A team at Okayama University led by Hikoya Hayatsu, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences,
reported at the annual meeting of the Japanese Cancer Association in Yokohama last month that
small amounts of beer countered the mutagenic effects of Trp-P-2 (tryptophan pyrolysate
product number 2) on bacteria in a test-tube culture. <B>Trp-P-2 is one of a class of potent
carcinogens known as heterocyclic amines that are produced by burning meat, fish, and
tobacco leaves</B>, among other things. When as little as 0.1 ml, about two drops, of beer was
combined with the Trp-P-2 and administered to salmonella bacteria, the mutation rate in the
bacteria fell to half that seen when Trp-P-2 alone was added to the test tube.<P>

Hayatsu says beer was already known to contain polyphenolic compounds, which inhibit
mutagenesis. But he says beer proved to be a far better inhibitor than the compounds alone.
"There must be another compound, or compounds, causing the effect we are seeing," he says.
His team is now trying to isolate such compounds <B>with an eye to testing them against other
carcinogens in cooked meats.</B><P>

Yoichi Konishi, a professor of pathology at Nara Medical University, says he finds the group's
work persuasive, but cautions that it's "just the starting point" for research aimed at finding
new ways to suppress cancer. Hayatsu couldn't agree more. During the past month, he's been
trying to throw a little cold water on local press reports which leapt on the research as
proving beer's life-giving properties. <B>"The content of Trp-P-2 is rather minor compared to
other carcinogens that have been discovered in charred meat,"</B> Hayatsu says.

<CENTER><H3>Study finds <A NAME="most">most</A> cancer deaths caused by smoking, diet, lifestyle</H3>
</CENTER>
The Associated Press 
<P>


BOSTON (Nov 19, 1996) -- Bad habits and an unhealthy lifestyle cause 65
percent of cancer deaths, a new study says.

The Harvard School of Public Health study found that smoking, diet and lack of exercise caused
a majority of deaths from cancer, while only 2 percent of deaths were traced to environmental
pollution, and 10 percent to genetics.
<P>

The study was published the November issue of the journal Cancer Causes & Control.

"These messages have been sounded time and again, but not adhered to ... and prevention has
much more potential than treatment," said Dimitrios Trichopoulos, director of the school's
Center for Cancer Prevention and one of the report's five editors.<P>

"The public concern about environmental carcinogens is out of proportion with the true risk,"
the report added. The study attributed 30 percent of cancer deaths to smoking, 30 percent to poor diet and
obesity and 5 percent to lack of exercise. Carcinogens in the workplace, family history and viruses each were blamed for 5 percent of
cancer deaths. Alcohol, socioeconomic status and reproductive factors each were blamed for 3
percent.<P>


<PRE>The report recommended a variety of diet changes, including:

-- More fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of cancer of the lungs, esophagus and larynx.

-- More beans and grains, which may reduce cancer of the stomach and pancreas.

-- <B>Less red meat, which is linked to colorectal cancers</B>.

-- <B>Less animal fat, which is linked to prostate cancer</B>.</PRE>

The study also advises daily exercise to reduce the risk of colorectal, breast and prostate
cancer, and avoiding the sun's ultraviolet rays, which were blamed for 90 percent of skin
cancers.

The report is "the neatest, clearest recent overview" of the causes of cancer, said Dr. Jack
Evjy, a Boston University Medical School professor and president-elect of the American
Cancer Society's Massachusetts chapter.

Research boost<BR>
 The European Commission announced plans yesterday for a 40 million research
  programme into spongiform encephalopathies, which include BSE in cattle and CJD in
humans. Edith Cresson, commissioner for research, said that the amount spent at present
 was inadequate and that the programme was urgently needed. <BR>
--------<BR>
 The Spanish Journal "EL PAIS" is publishing today. November 14th, a new on a plan approved By the European Union. The plan is devoted to research on
BSE and related diseases and is funded 50,7
millions ECU's for the 1996-1998 period.
Apparently, a work group directed by Dr Weissmann
has produced the plan.

Under the supervision of Professor John Jefferys and Professor John Collinge I am carrying out neurophysiological studies on hippocampal slices obtained from PrP gene homozygous (with or without PrP gene at all) and heterozygous (one of PrP genes knocked out) mice, to investigate mechanisms of the abnormalities of synaptic inhibition at different levels of the expression of the PrP protein. <HR width = 25%>

<P>
"My specific interest within the group is in prion disease.
Previous work performed by the group suggests that the endogenous, normal prion protein
(PrPC) is required for normal synaptic function, being especially important for normal
synaptic transmission via GABAA receptors (Collinge et al., Nature 370, 295-297). When
scrapie prion (PrPSc) isolates are introduced into mice bearing endogenous hamster PrPC,
electrophysiological recordings from hippocampus and neocortex resemble those from the
same brain areas in models of epilepsy where GABAergic transmission is disrupted (Jefferys
et al., Neurobiol.Disease 1, 25-30). The obvious question is whether the abnormal responses
seen in the scrapie infected animals is due to the loss of normal, functional PrPC as it is
converted to PrPSc, or is the epileptiform activity due to the alteration of other cellular
mechanisms ?
<P>

In order to address this question, I am using in vitro extracellular and sharp electrode
intracellular electrophysiological techniques to investigate network and cellular properties in
Sc237 infected hamsters. To address the specific issue of whether GABAA receptor-mediated
currents are disrupted in this model, I am using voltage clamp to characterise locally and
distally evoked isolated IPSCs in both hippocampus and neocortex.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most common form of a group of disorders termed human
spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases. In response to the Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy epidemic in cattle the Dept of Health established the National CJD Surveillance
Unit in 1990 to monitor the incidence of the disease in the UK. The Unit is run in
collaboration with Dr Robert Will of the Dept of Clinical Neurosciences. The Unit attracts
funding from the Dept of Health, MRC and the BBSRC.
<P>

CJD is a rapidly progressive dementia which is characterised pathologically by the appearance
of spongiform change, astrocytosis and neuronal loss. A fundamental element of the
surveillance project is the pathological verification of cases of this disease. Research
activities involve the investigation of the clinical and pathological features of the disease in
comparison with the molecular genetic abnormalities of the human prion protein which have
been associated with this group of disorders.<P>

Accumulations of the disease specific form of the prion protein have been observed in different
variants of the disease. The CJD Laboratory has established itself as a centre of excellence for
the investigation of prion protein immunocytochemistry. Investigation of the patterns of these
lesions has been greatly improved by the investment in a customised image analysis system.
The system has been successfully applied to the quantification of spongiform change (as
illustrated), astrocytosis and prion protein deposition.<P>

The CJD brain bank held at the Unit now has a substantial amount of autopsy tissue stored in
formalin, paraffin blocks and unfixed at -70 degC. This tissue is available for investigation by
other research groups in the UK and throughout the world.<P>

<H3><CENTER>Mad cow disease must be found in US Cows in low levels, says research</CENTER></H3>

Food Chemical News  ... 3 June 1996<P>


After more than two decades of research on prions, Stanley Prusiner of UCSF suggested that mad cow disease must be present in US cows at low levels.<P>

Prusiner, who spoke at a May 30 congressional caucus luncheaon, said the longer animals live, the more likely they are to develop the disease.  He said he agreed with a Wisconsin researcher [Prof. R.F. Marsh], who believes mad cow disease was linked to US cows in the mid-1980's.<P>

 Prusiner criticized the British government for setting up an expert panel with members chosen by the governmen, rahter than by an independent body such as the National Academy of Sciences.  He stopped short of recommending measures to halt the potential spread of the disease in the US, citing the complex chain of economic, political, and scientific variables affecting policy decisions.<P>

Many factors conspired to cause mad cow disease in Britain, including the deregulation of the rendering industry, he said.  The fat content increased in meat and bone meal fed to cows.  While more than 160,000 cattle have come down with the disease, the numbers peaked in 1992 and are beginning to drop off there.  The practises that led to the disease's spread stopped in the late 1980's, he said.  Today, there are an estimated 1,000 cows dying of the disease every month.<P>

The California researcher said scientists still don't know whether diseased cows can affect humans. He said it's still unclear what route exposes cows to the disease, whether through cuts in their mouths or [infectious agent] carrried by white blood cells. <P>

He took the opportunity to urge Congress to step up funding of biomedical research.

My research has focused on an unprecedented class of pathogens
called prions which cause neurodegenerative diseases. Nascent
prions are created either spontaneously by mutation of a host
protein or by exposure of the latter to prions from an exogenous
source. Prions are composed largely, if not entirely, of a modified
form of the prion protein (PrP) designated PrPSc, yet they can
multliply without a nucleic acid genome. 
<P>
A post-translational,
conformational change features in the conversion of cellular PrP
(PrPC) into PrPSc in which -helices are transformed into -sheets.
Since this structural transition in PrP underlies both the replication
of prions and the pathogenesis of CNS degeneration, much of the
effort in the laboratory is devoted to elucidating the molecular
events responsible for this process. Indeed, prion diseases seem
to be disorders of protein conformation. After demonstrating genetic
linkage between the PrP gene and the control of scrapie incubation
times, we established linkage between a human PrP gene point mutation
and development of the fatal, familial disease Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
(GSS). 
<P>
Like humans with GSS, transgenic mice expressing mutant
PrP develop neurodegeneration and produce prions <I>de novo</I>
as demonstrated by transmission of disease to inoculated recipients.
These studies argue that prion diseases can be both inherited
and infectious. While PrPSc seems to act as a template for the
refolding of PrPC into a second molecule of PrPSc, we recently
discovered that formation of PrPSc involves another molecule which
restricts prion replication between distant species. 
<P>
To overcome
this restriction, we constructed chimeric human/mouse PrP transgenes;
mice expressing this hybrid gene were rendered highly susceptible
to human prions. This discovery opens many new investigations
of the human prion diseases that previously required apes or monkeys.
Identifying the molecule(s), provisionally designated protein
X, that participate in the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc is another
area of research in the laboratory. 
<P>
Prions exhibit different patterns
of disease which mimic strains of viruses where diversity is encoded
within the viral genome. Elucidating the mechanism of prion diversity
is a third area of investigation. Whether strains of prions represent
distinct conformers of PrPSc or a second, as yet unidentified,
molecule features in this process is unknown.

<h3>What is BSE and how did it start?</h3>

BSE, better known as mad cow disease, stands for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, an infectious and incurable disease which slowly attacks the
brain and nervous system of cattle. Spongiform encephalopathies are nothing
new and are not confined to cattle. Scrapie, the form of the disease found in
sheep, has been common in Britain for the past 200 years and a human version,
Kuru, was once epidemic in tribal New Guinea. By late 1994, a handful of
people in Britain had died from another human version, Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease (CJD).
<p>
BSE has been epidemic in British cattle for the last ten years. The first
confirmed cases were reported in late 1986 but it is believed that the first
case may have occurred in Hampshire in 1985. By early 1995 it had been
identified in almost 150,000 cattle and more than half of all British herds.
<p>
The exact origin of BSE is not known, but simplistic claims that it came from
sheep are now discredited. BSE is an incurable disease caused by a mystery 
'infectious agent'. The agent is not a virus or bacteria - nobody knows what
it is. It has broken the most basic rules of biology. Any cure still lies at
the very limits of present-day science.

<h3>What does it do?</h3>

The period between becoming infected and showing symptoms for spongiform
encephalopathies is long in relation to the life span of the animal or human
involved. For example, Kuru in humans can take as long as 30 years before the
person becomes visibly ill. The disease bores into the brain and nervous
system very slowly but once established it rapidly causes dementia and death.
No treatment works. Post mortems show the brain to be sponge-like and full of
holes, hence the name 'spongiform'.
<p>
In cattle, the first signs occur when the cow is put under any slight 
pressure or stress. Movement to a milking station might induce fear, panic 
and stumbling and the infected animal may stand away from the rest of the 
herd, holding it's head in an awkward posture. Despite a good appetite, the
amount of milk she produces may drop and she usually loses a lot of weight.
<p>
As the muscles waste away, there may be twitchings, quiverings and shaking.
Strange behaviour can occur, such as grinding teeth and sometimes the moo
is odd. The cow over-reacts to touch and becomes very jumpy. Eventually,
she will shake violently, stagger and in the end be completely unable to
stand up.
<p>
It is the combination of a drop in milk and the fear that the cow will fall
and be unable to stand again that makes the farmer call in the vet. If the
animal does not recover, it is slaughtered and the head (with it's nervous
tissue) is removed for examination as it is officially believed that this
is the only infected part of the animal. This is unlikely as flesh also
contains nervous tissue. It also ignores the possibility of the disease
being passed from mother to calf.
<p>
The rest of the cow's body should be burnt but as many as 30% of infected
carcasses end up in landfill sites where they could be disturbed by
tractors, bulldozers, dogs or rodents. As BSE is an extremely strong
disease, it remains infective even after years in the soil.
<p>
When cattle are killed for food, the same procedure applies - the head (and
some other parts such as the spinal cord, spleen and thymus - 'specified
offal') is removed. The Government say that people will not be at risk when
they eat cows but the flesh (containing infected nervous tissue) is eaten
and the bones are eventually made into gelatine which finds it's way into
many products.

<h3>How widespread is BSE?</h3>

By late 1994, the disease had been identified in nearly 150,000 animals and
in just over half of all cattle herds in Britain. Some scientists including
myself believe that the only way to tackle the problem would be to destroy
all herds with cattle incubating the disease.
<p>
BSE has affected all breeds including, significantly, Jersey and Guernsey
cattle on their respective islands. The black and white Friesian Holstein
cows are the most commonly affected simply because there are far more of
them in Britain than other breeds. The youngest case so far recorded of a
cow showing the symptoms of BSE was 20 months and the oldest 18 years.
<p>
The cattle industry in Britain is under constant pressure to produce more
milk and dairy products at the lowest possible cost because we, the public,
demand it. The price of our daily pinta is paid for dearly by the suffering
of animals.
<p>
To provide as much milk as possible, cows are often fed protein-rich
concentrated food made from the carcasses of other dead animals that have
been sent to knackers yards or rendering plants. Cows only produce milk
when they have had a calf. After a nine month pregnancy, the calf is
removed within a day or two of birth. A few months later, while still
producing milk, the cow is artificially inseminated again. Cows have around
three or four pregnancies before their milk yield begins to drop.They are
eventually slaughtered at six or seven years old, even though its natural
lifespan would be 20 years or more. Most parts of the cow are used to make
burgers, sausages, pies, stocks and pet food. Until 1989, this also
included the brain.
<p>
More than 90 per cent of BSE cases have been in cows rather than bulls,
simply because cows live longer. Beef animals are usually slaughtered
around three years old and veal calves at six months. As BSE appears when
the animal is around four to five years old, most beef animals are
slaughtered before they are old enough to show symptoms, although they may
have the disease.

<h3>Is BSE a danger to humans?</h3>
All the evidence so far suggests that humans are not immune from infection.
The Fore tribe live in Papua New Guinea, a place unexplored by Westerners
until the second half of the twentieth century.
<p>
Cannibalism, especially by women hoping to increase fertility, was common
until very recently, and this led to an outbreak of 'Kuru', a human form of
scrapie. Kuru killed up to 80 per cent of women in some villages but how it
first started is unknown. Because it occurred within families and mostly
amongst women, it was first thought that Kuru was inherited genetically.
Scientists have since proved beyond doubt that Kuru is infectious and that
the disease was transmitted by eating meat, in this case human meat.
<p>
If BSE can be transmitted to humans then the resulting illness is expected
to be like our own form of Kuru - Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). As a
spongiform encephalopathy, this is again a disease of the brain and is
always fatal.
<p>
Like Kuru, patients first show symptoms of mental changes, such as problems
with co-ordination, recent memory loss and slurred speech. Sometimes
obvious twitching of muscles can be seen, the facial expression becomes
fixed and the person may stumble and fall over. Over the next few weeks,
the person becomes confused and unaware, unable to read or recognise even
close relatives.
<p>
Towards the end of the illness the patient is unconscious and not reacting
to anyone, often having fits or jerking spasms and is doubly incontinent,
blind, deaf and speechless. Patients continue to be fed but are rarely
placed on a respirator nor given antibiotics for infections, particularly
of the lung. It is the latter which usually results in death.
<p>
During the post mortem, extreme care must be taken because the disease is
incredibly infectious. The pathologist wears a mask, goggles, gloves, boots
and a plastic apron and any instruments that have been used on patients
suffering from CJD have to be thoroughly sterilised. For example, the
silver needles used for the EEG (brain examination) must be treated with
high pressure steam for prolonged periods of time or put through six
successive heat cycles in a steriliser. Even then there is no guarantee of
destroying the infection. If contaminated instruments are used on another
patient (which they will be if the person was not visibly ill with CJD),
the disease can, and indeed has been, transferred.
<p>
CJD is so feared by some people in the medical profession that they have
refused to perform autopsies on patients suspected of dying from it. Some 
hospitals have even refused to admit patients suffering from it.

<h3>What is the connection?</h3>

It is now known that regular eaters of veal (and other beef products) are
13 times more likely to die of CJD than those who don't. The prospect of a
huge number of people dying from BSE as CJD next century is very real; 
<b>that is, CJD and BSE are one and the same.</b>

<h3>What is being done?</h3>

Very little. The British Government has hidden the facts and fiddled the
evidence at every stage of the investigation into mad cow disease. It has
told expert scientists, including it's own advisors, to keep quiet in case
the hugely profitable meat industry suffers. In May 1988, the government
set up The Southwood Committee to examine the risks of BSE to both animal
and human health. Extraordinarily, it had no experts on spongiform
encephalopathies and none were consulted. Although experts in their own
areas, none of the members of the Southwood Committee had done any research
into spongiform diseases.
<p>
A month after the first meeting, the Government, on the advice of the
committee, ordered the compulsory slaughter and destruction of carcasses of
all affected cattle. It was already too late. Between the date of the first
known case of BSE in late 1986 and the middle of 1988, at least 600
obviously diseased cows (plus an unknown number of animals not yet
obviously ill) had been slaughtered and their meat had found its way onto
supermarket shelves. Half the normal price of carcasses was paid in
compensation, which encouraged farmers not to report suspect cattle. The
real extent of the problem remained unknown.
<p>
The second recommendation of the Southwood Committee was to set up another
committee to do more research, which simply admitted that the problem was
too big. The next meeting of the committee was five months later, some
indication of how serious the Government regarded the problem.
<p>
The report admitted that spongiform encephalopathies are a danger to humans
and stated: 'With the very long incubation period of spongiform
encephalopathies in humans, it may be a decade or more before complete
reassurance can be given.' The Southwood Committee went on to say how they
thought the disease was passed on, saying that eating was low down on the
list of possible reasons. While admitting that all cows had got the disease
by eating, they were suggesting one rule for cattle and another for humans.
It was easy for a cow to get BSE through eating but very difficult for
humans to get CJD by doing the same.
<p>
Two other general conclusions of the Southwood report were that the risk of
vertical transmission of BSE (passing the disease from mother to calf) was
non-existent (since proved incorrect) and that cattle would prove to be a
'dead-end host', which means the disease would stop at cows and not infect
other species. This introduces the revolutionary biological concept of a
non-infectious infection. Cattle are not a dead-end host. BSE has been
spread to other species and this was known at the time of the report. The
Southwood report stated that '...if our assessment of these likelihoods (of
possible human infection) are incorrect, the implications would be
extremely serious.' Their assessments have been shown to be incorrect. We
do have a terrible crisis on our hands.

<h3>Who cares?</h3>

Evidence that the Government was less than concerned about the risk to the
British public comes from the Tyrell Report, produced by the research
committee set up as a result of the Southwood Report. For example, this
said that the brains of cattle normally sent for slaughter should be
checked to see if some animals had BSE and were not yet ill with it. This
would have shown how big the problem really was. Not surprisingly, this has
never been done, despite numerous requests from the UK Parliament, because
it would have been 'too expensive'. Too expensive for the meat industry,
that is. Once consumers realised that they were eating infected meat,
profits would have plummeted.
<p>
The report also recommended monitoring all UK cases of CJD over the next 20
years (as a matter of 'urgency'!) to reassure the public that there was no
link with BSE. At present 'monitoring' means that a researcher checks death
certificates for CJD. That's it as far as the UK Department of Health is
concerned. Of course, a real investigation was not planned because it would
admit that the government was scared of a major public health problem.
<p>
It finished by saying that more research was needed and that the controls
at that time to prevent the disease spreading were not enough. Overall, the
report was an excellent analysis of the situation as it was in 1989 but
many of the proposals it made were ignored by the government. This report,
dated June 1989, was not released until January 9 1990, showing just how
urgent the Government thought it was. By this time they had accepted that
they did not know whether the disease could pass from cow to calf whether
it was possible other species could get BSE, or that the recent suggested
increase in sheep scrapie was the cause of the rise in BSE cases.
<p>
In April 1990, the Tyrell Committee became 'permanent', a surprising
development as, according to the government, BSE was about to disappear.

<h3>The feed ban</h3>

As part of the cannibalistic merry-go-round that is an economically
essential part of the meat industry, all the bits of animals from
slaughterhouses unsuitable for human consumption are boiled up to produce
fat and protein. The protein makes animal feed.
<p>
Apart from the obvious high risk of different infections being passed on,
it seems strange that nobody had actually questioned the biological sense
of forcing naturally vegetarian animals to become carnivores, eating the
remains of other animals. This is probably what has caused the spread of
BSE.
<p>
In June 1988, the government imposed a six-month ban on feeding animal
protein to cows and sheep as it was thought this was the most likely way
these animals would become infected. In December, the ban was extended for
12 months and laws stopped the sale of milk from cattle suspected of having
the disease. Banning infected feed did not stop the rise of BSE. Cases rose
from 500 per month in January 1989 to 900 per month in December 1989.
<p>
The 'mysterious agent' that causes spongiform encephalopathies has been
found in many of the organs and tissues of animals. For example, cells from
the spleen, thymus and tonsils ('specified offal' banned for use in animal
feed in 1989) enter the blood and find their way to many organs including
the liver and bones. The bones of old cows are one of the major sources of
the protein gelatine, used in many foods from peppermints to pork pies. The
greatest risk could come from bones because the procedures used to
concentrate and purify gelatine could create a stronger source of BSE. With
the passing from mother to calf of BSE confirmed in 1993/94, blood could
also contain the disease, at least as far as cattle are concerned.
<p>
The problem, of course, did not go away. The number of BSE cases per month
rose from 800 in January 1990 to 1,500 in December 1990. The Southwood
Committee had predicted a maximum of 400 cases per month.

<h3>We were wrong but we're not sorry...</h3>
After four years of Government reassurances that BSE could not infect other
species, tests carried out in February 1990 proved the opposite. BSE was
transmitted to mice by feeding and to other cattle by injection. Cattle
were no longer 'dead-end hosts'. The disease had never been previously
reported in cats but in May of the same year, a domestic cat died from a
spongiform encephalopathy. Even then the Government stuck to its guns and
denied that spongiform encephalopathies could jump species. In fact, that
is the very nature of the disease. By the time 52 other cats had died in
July, the government finally admitted that they had contracted the disease
through eating 'pet food'. The question was no longer 'Can BSE affect other
species?' but 'How many species will it affect?'
<p>
A month before, in January, trading standards officers revealed that
infected cattle were still being sent to market because farmers were still
only being given half of the normal price for their cows. A Ministry
official denied that BSE was finding it's way into our food but some people
weren't quite so convinced. In April 1990, Humberside County Council banned
the use of British beef in school meals. The number of known cases of BSE
passed the 10,000 mark.
<p>
In April 1991, the Ministry of Agriculture predicted that a peak in the
number of BSE cases would occur in 1991 and the disease would disappear by
1994. By the end of the year, 25,025 cases had been confirmed in Great
Britain, providing the first indications that, despite government claims to
the contrary, the disease was being passed from cow
to calf.
<p>
The following year, BSE was transmitted experimentally to seven out of
eight species of mammal, including pigs and marmoset monkeys. In four
experiments, this was by eating. A puma and a cheetah were also reported to
have died of the disease. Evidence was mounting of an uncontrollable
epidemic, with serious implications for humans.
<p>
CJD, the human form of BSE, claimed the lives of two dairy farmers who had
tended herds with BSE infected cattle. The number of human CJD cases in
Great Britain was nearly ten times higher than the annual number recorded
25 years earlier and twice as high as the number recorded five years
earlier. Vicky Rimmer, a 15 year old Welsh girl, developed the symptoms of
CJD, despite no family history of the disease or medical mishaps such as
faulty blood transfusion. She was also extremely young considering the very
long period it normally takes for symptoms to show. This meant that the
disease was most probably contracted from an external source, more than
likely food.
<p>
A doctor from the CJD surveillance unit examined Vicky and told her mother
not to make her daughter's case public. According to the <i>Daily Mirror</i>
(January 25 1994) he told her she should think of the economy and the Common
Market.
<p>
More than 17,000 cases of BSE were confirmed in cattle born after the feed
ban, with 500 cases known to have come from mothers which later developed
BSE. This meant that BSE was infecting cows by means other than infected
food. However, the government tries to explain this by blaming farmers,
feed compounders and renderers for breaking the law - they accuse them of
continuing to put ground-up sheep and cattle into cattle feed. This is
manifest nonsense and is the last ditch attempt to deny the occurrence of
vertical transfer of BSE (where the mother passes on BSE to her calf in the
womb). The existence of vertical transfer means that <b>the infectious agent
must be in the cow's blood and will therefore be found in virtually all
beef products.</b>
<p>
In 1994 the government had still taken no action to control cattle being
moved from BSE infected herds to other herds, nor had they taken any other
steps to control the epidemic. The total number of BSE cases confirmed
exceeded 137,000 by the end of August 1994 - more than six times the number
predicted by the Southwood Committee in their 'worst case scenario'.
However, in April 1994, it was admitted that cows did pass BSE on to their
calves.

<h3>What can we conclude from this?</h3>

Basically two things. Firstly, almost 10 years after BSE was first
identified, expert knowledge is still virtually nil. And, as if to cover
this up, all the available evidence suggests that the government has
carefully manipulated the facts to avoid doing anything about it. The main
reason is to protect the huge vested interests of the meat industry - the
cost of compensation for replacing six million infected cattle could run
into billions of pounds. The bad international publicity from this would
endanger UK food exports, tourism and even much of our industry. Secondly,
there is a very real risk of mass infection in the human population. The
government has made sure of that. 
<p>
And while the time bomb of the twentieth century equivalent to bubonic
plague ticks away, we all have to take responsibility into our own hands.
The simple and safest answer of course is to stop eating animals. In the
absence of any accurate, reliable or simply truthful information coming
from 'the experts', the choice has to be yours.

Selective Quotations from the book...
compiled by Michael Greger<hr><p>


<b><a NAME="Government">Government</a> Inaction:</b><p>

78      The Tyrrell Report [was dated] just four months later [than the 
Southwood Report], but was not released until "January 9 1990, 7 months 
after it was printed."<p>
80      "the definitive proposal to study the human risk..." is to "check 
death certificates for CJD." over the next 20 years.  "This is just about 
the total sum of research done by the UK Department of Health."<p>
117     "I just cannot believe that a[n "honourable independent"] 
scientist will say: 'In order to find out how big the problem is we are 
going to see how many people die.'"<p>

97      "The whole story of the action (and inaction) by the [British] 
Government following the Southwood and Tyrrell Reports has been one of 
delays, obfuscation, and misinformation..."<p>
58      "As far as I can ascertain, none of [the members of the Southwood 
Committee]..., nor the chairman, had undertaken any research in the field 
of spongiform diseases."<p>
59      "What was quite extraordinary about the composition of the 
[Southwood] committee was the omission of experts of spongiform 
encephalopathies, and the failure of the committee, once appointed, to 
co-opt them."<p>
59      "What was quite extraordinary about the composition of the 
[Southwood] committee was the omission of experts of spongiform 
encephalopathies, and the failure of the committee, once appointed, to 
co-opt them."<p>
59      "the first confirmation of BSE [was] in late 1986..."<p>  After its 
6/20/88 meeting the chairman of the Southwood Committee urgently 
recommended that 'at least until more is known about BSE, the carcases of 
affected animals should be destroyed.'<p>

60      "It was not until August 8 1988 that compulsory slaughter and 
partial compensation was introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, and 
incredibly not for another four months (November 28 1988) in Northern 
Ireland."<p>
<hr>
<b>
Government <a NAME="Action">Action</a>:</b><p>

xx       "the British Government [beyond much reasonable doubt] has at all 
stages concealed facts and corrupted evidence in mad cow disease..."<p>
89      "The drop in price [of British beef due to the BSE scare] would 
have been greater but for the intervention buying of unwanted carcasses 
at this price.  These were subsequently stored deep frozen at 
considerable expense for the taxpayer."<p>
154     "It looks suspiciously as if the [British] Government has 
massaged the figures by back-dating deaths to earlier years."<p>
154     "[The Ministry of Agriculture's] Transferring [of] some 1993 
cases to previous years will very conveniently give a false impression of 
a recent decline in the epidemic."<p>
163     "First [the UK Ministry of Agriculture said] there would be only 
17000-20000 cases of BSE in total." Then it would "drop off in 1993.  
Then the disease would peak in 1991 and disappear in 1994.  Then it would 
peak in 1992.  Then...1993. " <p> 
176     "From April 1 1994, a new system of compensation to farmers was 
introduced..."which  "would discourage the reporting of BSE suspects."<p>
139     "in February 1992 [the Ministry of Agriculture changed]...the 
reporting and slaughtering procedures for BSE animals born after the feed 
ban."<p>  
140     "this change in procedure...will distort the number of BSE 
cases..." "the numbers of animals confirmed, that were born after the 
feed ban, will inevitably fall."<p>
58      "after publication of their report, Professor Southwood was 
promoted to Vice Chancellor of Oxford Universoty, Professor Epstein was 
knighted and Sir John became Lord Walton."<p>

<hr>
<b><a NAME="Organ">Organ</a> Infectivity:</b><p>

85      "no action [was] taken over products containing these [11/8/89 
banned offal] which were already available in retail outlets"<p>

85      "In late 1989, virtually nothing was known about the distribution 
of the BSE infection in the animal...as far as the range of organs was 
involved"<p>
  
17      "several cases of CJD spread by blood transfusions..."<p>
85      "The range of offals removed is not comprehensive.  What do 
brain, spinal cord, spleen, thymus, tonsils and the intestines of cattle 
have in common?"  "They are of little commercial value."<p>
86      "[scrapie] infectivity was found in the liver, kidney and bones, 
sometimes at high levels."<p>
86      "The greatest risk could come from bones because the procedures 
used to concentrate and purify gelatine could also create a potent source 
of the BSE prion."<p>
88      "the reason why researchers have found BSE infectivity in very 
few cattle organs...is that the mouse assay test that is used is too 
insensitive..."<p>
103     "There is little reason to believe that the agents responsible 
for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are found actually within 
or around muscle fibres."<p>
88      "with vertical transmission of BSE confirmed in 1993/1994, the 
infectivity of blood is implicit, at least as far as cattle are concerned."<p>
<hr>

<b><a NAME="Experiments">Experiments</a> Neglected:</b><p>

78      Despite the Tyrell committee recommendation, the experiments that 
"would have established the frequency of animals that were highly 
infectious, but not yet ill, that went into the food chain." have not 
been done.  <p>
79      "The official justification for not doing this research ["despite 
numerous requests in the UK Parliament that it be done"] was that it was 
too expensive...  Too expensive to know the scale of risk to the British 
public?" <p>

159     Also "Human PrP genes could be put into a mouse replacing its own 
PrP genes and the animal could be challenged with BSE prions."<p>
177     How about "feed[ing] milk from a BSE cow to a calf to see if any 
infectivity was transferable."<p>
34      "for nutritionally useful protein to be retained after the 
rendering process there will inevitably be contamination by the BSE agent 
if present initially."<p>
35      The "nearly 50%" solvent use decrease was due to the occupational 
hazard posed by the stuff.<p>

35      He is not convinced that "the cessation of solvent extraction was 
a major factor causing BSE."<p>
38      "it is reasonable to incriminate the rendering plants as one of 
the means of the dissemination of BSE, but the source of the infection 
was unknown, and other factors must have been involved in the development 
of the disease."<p>
57      "I still believe that there is a real possibility that BST could 
aggrevate BSE ..."<p>
120     On one hand the British government says that"very large doses are 
needed [using the oral route]", but on the other hand feels that "all BSE 
came from the feed..."<p><hr>



<b>The <a NAME="Risk">Risk</a>:</b><p>

27      "as many as 30% of BSE infected carcasses [are not incinerated 
and] end up in landfill sites..."<p>
69      All cattle 'known to be infected...' should be destroyed by law 
"but what about all those that are infected, but are not known to be 
because they are slaughtered before their terminal disease develops?"
96      There is a government initiative "to slaughter and destroy all 
affected cattle..."<p>  Notice that they don't use the word 'infected', 
which "would also include the countless cases still incubating the 
infectious agent, but not yet ill."<p>
104     There is no way to detect all such [cattle and cows that carry 
the infectious agent but appear clinically normal]..."<p>
118     The "...if our worst fears are realised, we could virtually lose 
a generation of people..." "was based on the well documented instances of 
almost 100% of all mink on a ranch succumbing from spongiform 
encephalopathy following eating contaminated feed."<p>
157     "the annual incidence of [CJD]...among [BSE herd] closely 
associated personnel cannot be calculated as 1 in 20,000 because of the 
long incubation period."<p>
157      [(discussing the two BSE herd dairy farmers 1993 CJD deaths in 
relation to the 40,000 personnel closely associated with BSE herds in 
1992)] "if these diseases were acquired in, say, 1983, there might have 
been as few as 20 BSE herds..."<p>
157     "the development of CJD in two dairy farmers attending BSE herds 
is therefore highly significant statistically..."<p>  "and deeply disturbing."<p>
180     "many sub-clinically infected cattle ...pass into the British 
food chain as meat every day."<p><hr>

<HR>
The German veterinary who was wrongfully terminated for blowing the whistle on BSE is  Dr. Margit Herbst in Bad Bramstedt. Although I know
her story from several talks with her, you should ask her personally to avoid
mistakes of transmission. Dr. Kari Koester-Loesche is also very familiar with
this proceedings.
The other case is that of a british veterinarian, who refused to manipulate
certificates. You can find the informations on Steven Dealler's site, who seems
to be very familiar with this case.
<HR>
 I have extrapolated from the known
data to the whole lifespan of cattle (about 22 years) with the assumption
that the BSE incidence would not decrease with the age of the cow. Then I
get a putative maternal transmission rate of 30-45%.
A transmission rate of 45% will normally result in more than one infected
female calf per cow, but only one of four of this infections will be lethal
within 7 years.
<HR>
The abrupt decrease is the consequence of the drastic reduction of the
main source of infetivity. The reduction is more than proportional to the
reduction of infectivity, because many infections fall under the threshold
of a within about 7 years lethal dosis.<P>

Manipulated are the mean incubation time and the rate of BSE infected animals
not with the intention of a manipulation, but simply because of the loss of
retainability of a cow with decreasing condition.
<HR>

A drop in milk production has 
been noted as typical first symptom of BSE. Dr. Beat Hoernliman, the Swiss BSE-
coordinator told me, that a drop of milk productifity as the first symptom has
been reported by the owners of about half of the swiss BSE cases. They only
have not had the idea to quantify this. Ray Bradley also stated in an answer
to my question, that a reduction of milk productivity is a well known symptom
of BSE.
<P>
The increase and decrease of the BSE epidemie is obviously caused mainly by
changes in the titer of infectivity within the ruminant food. This is a further
factor, totally independent from the possible factor milk productivity. You
should not mix them in the statistical analysis
<P>.
 
The maternal transmission study will not give us much more evidence with
respect to the BSE incidence of older cows, because they were killed when they
became 7 years old."
<HR width =45% >
Hans Anderson responds: 
<P>
Yes. Colin Whitaker, the vet that discovered the first cases of BSE, wrote
in his report regarding the first 10 cases at the same farm outside
Ashford, Kent:
<P>
 "Milk yield gradually drops and there is loss of condition in the later stages."
(Presentation at a meeting of the British Cattle Veterinary Association in
July 1987)
<P>
"In my paper I had a list of differential diagnosis, and the last one was
'a new scrapie-like syndrome'. The Ministry (MAFF) asked us not to use that
(at the meeting in '87) - or told us not to use the word 'scrapie-like'. I
think they were concerned that it would effect the sheep market." (Sept 23
1996)
<P>
The word was blacked out at the meeting. Colin Whitaker's report was published
one year later, in its original version.
<HR>

"The problem is that neither the UK or German government
 followed any Precautionary Principle. For example I can not see any
endeavour of the British government to wipe out scrapie, and in germany meat
bone meal is still made of this British sheep. Different to the new British
regulations in Germany this meat bone meal is still used in the food stuff of
pigs, chicken and fish and the fat of this partially scrapie infected sheep can
be still be used to feed german calves. 
<P>
It is legal to mix gelatine, fat from
all animals and even blood products into the milk substitute for German calves.
Furthermore meat bone meal does not have to be made with the famous German
method with 133 degree Celsius at 3 bar pressure for 20 minutes. It only has
to be dried if it comes from not obviously sick animals. I described that for
Germany but as we all know the British circumstances are not better.
<P>
Every governmet that has to tighten its standards because they didn't follow any
Precautionary Principle in the past."
<HR>
"The situation became much better since 1988, but the feeding of MBM to non
ruminant mammals has been stopped only  years later, while the production of the
infectious meat bone meal has not been stopped, there was no messure on gelatin
production, the export of sheep is going on and the British government did not
control whether the exported calves are from herds without BSE or at least from
mothers without BSE. If I were British, I would be very unhappy with this
governmet and the SEAC."
<HR>
"It is easy to find references to experimental results which
show that the sensitifity of the BSE-tests have been very low. D.M. Taylor mentioned the problem in his well
known paper (Veterinary Record 1995 137, 605-610) about rendering procedures.
<P>

Also remember the old article of Dickinson et al. in Nature 1975; 256
732-3. No test is sensitive only because of other less sensitive tests and tests
are much more sensitive if there is no species barrier and if the normal life
span of the inoculated animal is longer than that of mice. Cutlip et al. for
example only have to wait 14-18 months after ther the inoculation of new born
calves until the symptomes became visible (J.Inf.Dis. 1994; 169: 814-20). After
that minimum incubation time you can wait more than 20 years for the symptomes
if you are interested in a maximum of sensitivity with a biological functional
test."
<HR>
"Peer reviewing removes many mistakes from
scientific articles and even many articles that would only waste our time. This
is very important, if recipients are not familiar with the described experiments
and need the help of specialists. The specialists themselves do not need this
help so much because they are able to distinguish valuable data from glaring
gaff.<P>
 
On the other hand the specialists lost a lot of time because it takes months or
even years until an article has been accepted and finally published. This aspect
is less important for the broader publicum, which can wait for the qualitiy
proven articles. Therefor I do not want to replace the scientific journals, but
I only want to get an additional tool for the specialists of a field of
research, as physicists, chemicists, mathematicians and psychiologists have it.
If many specialists discuss an article, they will find even more mistakes and
erroneous ideas than only two reviewers.<P>
 
Scientists may view peer review as an invaluable resource to confirm, clarify
and substantiate research articles, but at the same time many of them suffer
from the described delay. The quality of research will not suffer from APADS,
because they do not replace the qualitiy check of scientific journals."
<HR>
"Possible roles and effects of the glycosylation of
the prion protein: it seems not to influence the conversion of the normal to the proteaseresistent form
(Kocisko,D.A.; Priola,S.A.; Raymond,G.J.; Chesebro,B.; Lansbury,P.T.;
Caughey,B. - Species-specificity in the cell-free conversion of prion protein
to protease-resistant forms - a model for the scrapie species barrier -
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
America 1995 Apr 25; 92(9): 3923-7). For me this article is the most
important of the last years and at the same time it is tragic, that they did
not see the chance to proof or disproof the Prion Theory with this simple
experiment within a few days. 
<P>
The Glycosylation influences the transport of
the cellular prion protein to the surface (Lehmann,S.; Harris,D.A. - Effect
of 2 pathogenic mutations on the cellular processing of the mouse prion
protein - Journal of Cellular Biochemistry 1995; 1995(S21B): 104). Incorrect
Glycosylation may cause artificial results of the Collinge experiments with
transgenic mice. The article of Kocisko et al. demonstrates, that glycosylation is not
required for the transmission of strain attributes to the normal prion
protein.

"There are mainly two problems with the Weybridge maternal transmission study:
<P>
 
1) The calfs of the negative control group came from the same herds as the
calfs from obviously BSE affected cows. Nobody knows whether the mothers of
the control group have been BSE infected or not. It is hard to believe, but they
 can even not exclude that their calves consumed infectious foodstuff. This
was a really poor experimental design.<P>
 
2) The shortened the time of observation from possible 20 years down to only 7.
In my oppinion they did this in order to reduce the total number of affected
animals and eventualy to hide an increase in the BSE incidence with the age of
the animals. As I mentioned before the British BSE statistic shows a decline of
the BSE incidence after the age of 6, which may be caused by a BSE driven drop
of milk productivity. The aborted experiment was a singular opportunity to
demonstrated  the true development of the BSE incidence without any covering
factor of selection. In eyes it was a crime against science and public health to
kill the remaining animals.<P>
 
What SEAC did with the Weybridge data was so stupid, that it not relly deserves
a comment. They subtracted the less than 5% of BSE in the control group from the
more than 15% in the other because allegedly 5% of all calves eat infectious
foodstuff and died of that. Does anybody wonder why they didn't see the
possibillity of infcted mothers in both groups? Than they concluded without data
that the risk of maternal transmission has to be 10% within the last 6 months
before the mother dies and 0% if this timespan is 1 day longer. Then they divided this 6 months by the never
experimentally proofed 60 months of mean BSE incubation time to get a risk of
only 1%. A cow gets its first calf after 27-30
months and that the BSE incidences are equally when they get their third,
fourth or fifth calve. Are the members of SEAC scientists or what?
<P>
How long did they live after they have born the control calves? Even if they
lived for additional 10 years this could not proof that they were not infected.
But I am sure they were killed much earlier. Can you tell us why this dams did
not live at least until the end of the study?
<P>
It is not possible to exclude BSE at early stages histopathologically. It is
much better do use immunological tests, but I do not know any experiment that
demonstrates the detection of early stages of BSE. Can you give us such a
reference?
<P>
The WKeybridge experiment has not proven that the calves must have
been infected by maternal transmission. Indeed it is impossible to proof
something with statistics, but you can calculate probabilities and it is very
likely that the reason for the difference of BSE incidences between both groups
is a difference of the effectivity of maternal transmission  in relation to the
stage of BSE of the mother.They did not compare calves from BSE cows with calves from not infected cows, but calves from late stage BSE cows with calves from non late stage BSE cows."
<HR>
"The whole
calculation of BSE transmission is very complicated because you have compensate for the shortened incubation time, the under-estimation of the BSE incidence and the mean
incubation time within the British BSE statistic, and the experimental
conditions.
<P>
I did that in July and sent my calculations to the British embassy in august.
They were not very happy with that"
<HR>
"In germany we have a lot of F1 generation cattle from UK, but whereas most of
their parents have been killed, our authorities do not want to think about the
F1 problem. There are also legal problems, because we are not allowed to
kill cattle without a good reason. Furthermore it is very hard to kill whole
herds and to destroy the breeding work of generations. There are herds which
represent the last samples of a race with special regional adaptations.<P>
 
If the incidence of BSE does only decline with the age of older cows because
of a selective slaughtering of cows with unsatisfactory milk production, than
the rate of maternal transmission is not 9-14%. If the real BSE incidence only
stays constant, then the rate of maternal tranmission is 30-45%. If I am right
and the BSE incidence increases with the age of a cow, then the rate maternal
transmission would be much higher."
<HR>
" sporadic CJD is also acquired
>from sheep, pigs, or cattle.
There have been transmissions from all "types" of Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases
to monkeys and rodents and statistically there were some slight differences.
I didn't care so much on this because in my oppinion the Gerstmann-Straeussler-
Scheinker-Syndrom, the fatal familiar insomnia and Kuru are only variants of
the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease beside others and the sporadic cases are nothing
else then Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease without a known reason. It is not
astounishing that the source of a disease with such a long incubation time is
not known in most of the cases. Even with the so called iatrogenic or familial
the reason is not really known. I don't believe that there is a remarkable
amount of cases which are not familial and not caused by an infection. I am
quit sure that at least in germany we are nearly all infected mainly by
british sheep and german pigs."
<HR>
"WHO experts do their job by far not as carfully as you seem to believe.
 
Do you remember that they concluded on 14-16 May 1996 from nine different
studies on the maternal transmission, that to date maternal transmission
could not be excluded but that, if it is occuring, it is at a level so low
as to be undetectable (http://www.who.ch/programme/emc/bse/14mayrep.htm).
Only 2 months later the SEAC came out with 10-15% maternal transmission and
by the way demonstrated the quality of some of the world's foremost prion
experts expertise.
 
Only a few months earlier the famous WHO experts and the EU scientific
veterinary commitee demonstrated their ability to read scientific reports.
They stated that the procedures of gelatin production destroys the TSE
infectivity. They did this because the european gelatin industry told them
that experiments of Inveresk Research International demonstrated that. Even
students can easyly see that the results of this study demonstrated no
inactivation of the scrapie agent at all. Your foremost prion disease experts
made fools of themselves as they already made many times before."
<HR>
"I am not familiar with the circumstances in the USA, but we have two cases
of dismissed veterinarians in Germany and UK. They had to go because they
didn't want to overlook BSE.
<P>
 In the USA Gibs et al. within the ministry of
agriculture inoculated cattle with scrapie as early as 1979 and knew about
the transmissibility of scrapie to cattle since 1980. Perhaps the british
BSE epidemy could have been minimized if they had published that result.
But they published it in 1990!"
<HR>
When now dose response transmission experiments are started, the BSE
infectivity in the cattle herds will have reached a relative negligible
level, before the results of the study will be available.
Probably more than 99% of the overall BSE infectivity will have been
consumed then. We don't know how many persons will die because of this
infectivity, but whatever we do now, it will change the situation only
slightly. With exception of the development of usable CJD and BSE tests
and a therapy. But also for this the monkey doasage test would come much
to late.
 
Therefore I ask you, do we really need this tests, that will cost the lives
of many, many monkeys?

<H4>Man with a mission - Is Harash Narang <A NAME="milking">milking</A> the mad cow crisis?</CENTER></H4>
20 Aug 1996 ... The Guardian ... Emily Green
<P><I>[A search on Emily Green's prior
output  found that she is a food correspondent (ex-Independent, now New
Statesman) - a big jump from nouvelle cuisine to scientific criticism!  -- correspondent comment]</I>
<P>


Dr Harash Narang claims to have beaten the international science community
in developing tests for BSE, the "mad cow" disease, and its human version,
CJD. Does he really have answers or is he just a self-promoter? <P>


IF BSE is in the news, so, like clockwork, is Dr Harash Narang.
Narang-watchers will have spotted him on the front page of the Observer on
August 4 described as the first scientist to warn about maternal
transmission from cow to calf. Scarcely a week earlier, he was claiming in
the Daily Mail that he had warned an agricultural select committee about
transference to sheep six years ago. <P>

Neither assertion is true but neither is central to the extraordinary role
he has played in the BSE crisis. His crowning claim is that he beat the
international science community to the development of two diagnostic tests
for BSE and its human analogue, CJD. Moreover, he seems to have done it from
the two-storey offices of Ken Bell International, a frozen fish distributor
in the Jesmond suburb of Newcastle. <P>

In normal times, it might seem ridiculous. However, these are not normal
times. Eleven young people have been stricken with a mysterious disease,
possibly related to the dairy and beef industry. Hundreds of thousands of
cattle are due to be slaughtered, pulped and incinerated lest a tiny
fraction of them incubate BSE. Three farmers have committed suicide. Anyone
who might have a solution has an eager audience and Dr Narang has been
quoted, or his theories cited, by several national newspapers. <P>

Media interest in the doctor dates back before the immediate crisis, to
1992, when he was the subject of a Close Up North programme on BBC TV. In
1995 he was guest expert on a World In Action documentary. Lately, his
presence on European television last spring prompted baffled French, German
and Italian farmers to send queries to the head of the UK Family Farmers
Association. His copious papers, digests and mini-digests also receive big
play on the Internet. <P>

It is doubtful that Narang would have made the May issue of Parliamentary
Review had he not lobbied the Prime Minister and every agriculture minister
since John Gummer. He has successfully enlisted the support of six Labour
MPs and moved one shadow agriculture minister to active campaigning on his
behalf. Yet his accusations have begun to worry at least two Labour MPs, one
of whom barked recently: "If he's a charlatan, why don't scientists just
rubbish him? Otherwise, if there is even a shadow of a chance his tests
work, we are duty bound to represent him." <P>

It is not so simple, not least because of the delicacy of his very public
relationship with many of the families of CJD victims. There he is on TV on
May 14, pictured with Ilja Andrews when she announced she was suing the
Government over her mother's death from CJD. There he
is the first week of July next to Frances Hall (whose son Peter died of CJD
last winter) leading the Campaign Group to lobby Parliament. <P>

It was in Parliament, on July 10, that Narang again threw down the glove to
government scientists before a selected audience of supporters, journalists,
MPs and European TV camera crews. "Right from the start of this crisis," he
said, <B>"the Government has not approached BSE as a matter of science but as a
matter of policy, viewing research as some kind of convenience store where
you can pick and choose the hypotheses that suit you."</B> <P>

The gist of the 12 pages that followed was that the Government should have
been shopping at Ken Bell International. Narang is subsidised by Ken Bell
himself, a prominent and generous local businessman. All that stands between
the tests and the people who need them, Narang claims, is a conspiracy
involving the University of Newcastle, the Public Health Laboratory Service,
the Ministry of Agriculture and London Hospital. <P>

This might sound far-fetched but, to anyone who has fought to save the life
of a loved one, a long shot sounds better than no shot. Last winter the
parents of Peter Hall spotted Dr Narang on TV and called him in as their son
lay dying in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. The symptoms were
atypical and the patient young so, at the time, the acting neurologist did
not think it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Narang took a urine sample and
concluded that, yes Peter had CJD. This was confirmed by a post mortem. <P>

Frances Hall now wants Narang's live urine test used on cattle across the
country as a matter of urgency. "I'm not a scientist," she told me, "but I
would think he's probably the most expert person on CJD." <P>

Narang encourages that view, yet the matter of expertise in the field is by
no means clear cut. The infectious agents for BSE and CJD are unknown. The
person who cracks it may also solve the riddle of a far more pernicious
killer, Alzheimer's. Microbiologists tend to think in terms of bacteria,
virologists of viruses, geneticists of inheritable disorders, and many
molecular biologists refer to "prion diseases" (prions are miniscule protein
particles, so small they have no DNA). Narang trained as a zoologist
studying plant parasitology. He began his career working from 1970-77 for
the Medical Research Council in Newcastle General Hospital, where he
developed an interest in spongiform encephalopathies. <B>As early as 1975, he
published a paper Virus-Like Particles in Creutzfeldt-Jakob Biopsy</B> material
in which he noted herpes-like material in biopsies from CJD victims. This
material turned out to be fragments of dying cells, a sort of biological
flotsam and jetsam. <P>

In August 1977, he joined the Pubic Health Laboratory Service. His employers
were intrigued by spongiform encephalopathies and encouraged visits to
various specialist research posts. One visit took him to the Edinburgh
Neuropathogenesis Unit, where Dr Alan Dickinson pioneered the strain-typing
of scrapie. Dickinson remembers Narang as a "harmless enthusiast" who
"didn't seem able to grasp the business of looking down the electron
microscope and seeing things, and then thinking scientifically about them". <P>

In 1985, the PHLS granted him leave to work briefly in the US laboratory of
Dr Daniel Carleton Gajdusek at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Maryland. Gajdusek received a Nobel prize for his pioneering work
on kuru - a spongiform encephalopathy found among cannibals in New Guinea.
It was during this and subsequent visits in 1988 and 1989 to the US that
Narang says he made a series of breakthroughs: "At this stage I found this
quick diagnostic method. You would touch the surface of the brain and
examine it in the electron microscope. <P>

This "touch impression technique", as he calls it, is what he and his
supporters insist is needed in British abattoirs to check if infected meat
is slipping through the system. In written evidence submitted to a House of
Commons select committee in 1990, Narang claims to have invented the
technique. To be precise, it was the discovery of Scottish scientist June
Almeida, working in Canada in the early sixties. It was abandoned because it
had limited diagnostic use. While it may pick up tell-tale plaque residues
from diseased brains, by the time these are present the animal would have
been teetering around so badly that it would have been spotted anyway. <P>

The work of American electron microscopist Pat Merz formed the core of
another of Narang's breakthroughs. In 1978, she spotted tiny fibres unique
to encephalopathies. These were dubbed "scrapie associated fibrils" (SAF).
Narang attached what he called "tubulofilamentous particles". These
fantastically named items bear an uncanny resemblance to his early tubules
which turned out to be biological litter. <P>

In yet another discovery, Narang spotted a single-stranded DNA. This is
unknown in human DNA, which has two strands. One strand means he thought he
saw a virus. However, Narang's single-stranded DNA broke down into a
repeating pattern of six bases, which is thought far too small to have a DNA
function. At any rate, Narang announced his unique DNA was wound around the
SAF and protected by a protein coat. The result he named a "nemavirus" and
deemed the root cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. <P>

ONE OF THE obstacles standing between Narang and a Nobel prize for this
nemavirus is that no one but he can isolate the single-stranded DNA. Another
is that drawings of it bear an uncanny resemblance to the tobacco mosaic
virus, a common plant disease and one of the first things spotted under an
electron microscope. Narang blames the lack of evidence, in part, on the
PHLS in Newcastle. <P>

Problems at the PHLS started in earnest when a 1989 application for a
Ministry of Agriculture grant to develop his "touch impression technique"
was denied. He published a letter in the Lancet about his diagnostic work
into BSE and CJD. This attracted the attention of David Clark, MP for South
Shields and then shadow agriculture minister. In the spring of 1990, David
Clark introduced Dr Narang to Ken Bell. <P>

Bell is a charismatic philanthropist whose good works include funding the
eighties campaign against the irradiation of food. He was interested in BSE
and CJD for two reasons: he comes from a long line of butchers and his
brother died of a dementing disease. He quickly put up (UK pounds) 20,000
for Narang's work. Working in tandem, the shadow agriculture minister laid
on political pressure. Within several months, Narang was invited to submit
evidence on BSE and CJD to a Commons select committee. He did this,
recommending his own research. <P>

With Bell's money, the work was begun at the PHLS that autumn. It went
badly. Horrified staff complained they had been given no safety protocols.
The Health and Safety Executive was called in and an eight-page report
issued a year later concluded that radioactive material had been left in
unauthorised areas, that there was inadequate sterilising of instruments
used on CJD and BSE material, that Narang's claims about how autoclaving had
been carried out were untrue and that he was conducting unlicensed genetic
manipulation of scrapie, the sheep equivalent of BSE, and E. coli bacteria. <P>

A disciplinary inquiry led to a written warning that "any work on spongiform
encephalopathy involving molecular biology or the presence of
single-stranded DNA" was not to be carried out "without peer review grant
support". This meant he would have to answer to scientists, not fishmongers
and politicians. <B>Narang claims that the experiment was stopped because "this
fear came that I am going to rock the boat".</B> <P>

But, again with the support of MP David Clark, by late January 1991 MAFF was
badgered into supplying 10 cattle brains, five BSE-negative, five BSE
positive, for Narang to demonstrate his "touch impression technique". He
managed to detect three of the BSE positive brains, two within the agreed
time limit. MAFF decided that 40 to 60 per cent accuracy was of no
diagnostic use. <P>

THIS did not defeat Narang. "The harder you hit him the higher he bounces,"
observed one of the Edinburgh scrapie researchers. This time Narang
conducted his own surveillance of northern hospitals for cases of CJD. After
complaints were levelled against him for impersonating a hospital doctor to
the bereaved family of a patient in a neuropathology ward, in the summer of
1992, he became the subject of yet a second disciplinary inquiry.<P>


Undeterred, by the autumn Narang dramatically upped the stakes. He revealed
in a Close Up North programme that he was developing a blood test for live
animals which would probe for his single-stranded DNA. There remained the
small matter of confirming its existence. Enter Professor John Oxford of the
virology department of the London Hospital, whose department has conducted
important Aids work and was then, as now interested in spongiform
encephalopathies.<P>

The potential diagnostic value and challenge in isolating DNA in the
infectious agent caught the professor's imagination. He admits he was also
impressed by Narang's association with a Nobel prize winner. "The question
was," Oxford says, "should we have Harash with us or not? I felt that it was
his idea, it's not up to me to take his idea, so I felt the proper thing to
do was have Harash with us. Also, scientifically, if you want to reproduce
someone's work it's better to have them around."<P>

Narang was invited to advise on a year-long trial in London starting in the
summer of 1993, while the PHLS agreed to cover his salary. Narang was still
under review for safety infractions and the unlicensed genetic manipulation,
so three scientists were interviewed to actually conduct the work. Dr Lynne
Bountiff, a molecular biologist with experience in scrapie work dating back
to 1973, was selected. The (UK pounds) 60,000 trial was jointly funded by
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC). It was overseen by Professor Jeffrey Almond, a
virologist at the University of Reading and member of the Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC).<P>

It found no DNA, single-stranded or otherwise. Narang now says he was forced
to go to London by the PHLS and dismisses the work as "a waste of time and
effort". He refers to the 44-year-old Dr Bountiff as a "girl" and says: "Her
job was to scream and shout."<P>

Narang was made redundant by the PHLS in November 1994. In 1995 he again
turned to the media, demonstrating his "touch impression technique" for a
World In Action programme and declaring that 30 per cent of cattle going
into British abattoirs were positive.<P>

The same year Narang and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease became household words.
On the May 21, 1995 19 year-old Stephen Churchill died in the Royal United
Hospital in Bath, the first of the young victims of the new variant of the
disease. On hearing about it, Narang travelled to the West Country.
Stephen's father David, recalls: "He was the only person who could offer any
explanation, who took the time and trouble to visit us and our son."<P>

Stephen died before Narang could get a urine sample. However, he did find
samples elsewhere (how many and from whom is undocumented) and the following
autumn it was announced in the media that he had developed an early
detection, noninvasive and quick urine test.<P>

According to Narang, it is patented and ready to go: "My urine test is
simple again. I have developed a simple kit which people can use and which
will concentrate the urine. And then one examines that urine specimen again
in the electron microscope. And if you see the same structures again, like
from the brain, then you call the specimen positive. Otherwise you call it
negative."<P>

Unfortunately, there is no way a test can be marketed that probes for an
infectious "nemavirus" whose scientific integrity is unproven. Still, its
hand forced by Narang's publicity, on December 4, 1995, SEAC wrote to Narang
requesting details of the urine test. Narang never responded. Rather, on
December 17, he emerged the BSE expert of choice in the Mail on Sunday. The
first of six sensationalist features referred to Narang's "once brilliant"
career and vilified the PHLS. "His urine test might well have been in use
already had he not, a year ago, been made redundant by the PHSL [sic] and
denied essential laboratory facilities ever since," reported the Mail.<P>

Last winter, the Halls did not demand scientific proof when Narang tested
Peter's urine. They had enough on their minds: their son was dying. So what
to scientists had a sleight of hand quality about it struck the Halls as
long overdue proof of a real expert.<P>

While avoiding scrutiny by SEAC, Narang has taken his test to farmers. Geoff
Nicholls, a beef producer in Cheshire, has lost five of his herd to BSE.
Since meeting Narang, he has perfected how to dodge around cows collecting
urine specimens. He is also keen that beef tested by the "touch impression
technique" receive a "Harash Narang logo" and recommends such a scheme to
supermarkets. He says that when he is sure it is safe, he plans to sell off
the four generations of livestock built up by his father and leave the
business.<P>

The only thread remaining between Narang and the world of accredited science
is his relationship with Dr Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, the 73-year-old Nobel
prize-winning kuru expert. Indeed, in 1987-88, Gajdusek did sign three
papers with Narang - a seemingly weighty validation. Yet, according to his
entry in Who's Who, Gajdusek has also signed at least another 997 papers.
Repeated recent requests to Gandusek's office for verification of the work
with Narang have met with polite stalling.<P>

On April 6 of this year, Gajdusek was arrested and charged with child abuse.
No doubt Narang will vault over this credibility problem, bouncing from
invention to invention amid the desolation.<P>

This article is absolutely excellent. It describes
the way in which infection could take place, how it may pass into
a pathogenic phase, how it could spread around the body, how it
could develop into a clinical disease. A list of essential factors
and key questions is put forward and he explains that we simply
know quite inadequate amounts at present to know what is going on
with the new vCJD.</I>
<P>

The continuing toll of British cattle due to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is worrying. From time to time, there are clamorous demands to the authorities to reconsider the position and to do something about it. A brief review of the facts now might help to make the point that there is no complacency, that the action taken is rational, and that it is still not unreasonable to wait for matters to improve. Recapitulation  The agent of BSE in cows, which is thought to be identical with the agent of scrapie in sheep, has some of the characteristics of a slow virus. However, it is unlike a virus in its pronounced resistance to heat and to chemicals such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, and in its moderate resistance to ultraviolet and ionising radiation. The occurrence of infectious protein particles, known as prions, has been invoked (1,2) to account for some of the paradoxes of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which include kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) (and its variants) and fatal familial insomnia in man, scrapie in sheep, and BSE in cows, Other transmissible encephalopathies affecting mink and deer and some other species have been recorded.<P>

The known genetics of scrapie makes it difficult to accept that the causative agent lacks nucleic acid. The agent has not been isolated, cultured, or visualised (unless scrapie- associated fibrils, seen in preparations of affected brain, are a form of the infectious agent). The agent does not seem to provoke an important cellular reaction in the host or to generate an immune response, but it causes the accumulation of an abnormal proteinase-resistant form of a host protein (PrP) in the brain. Scrapie or BSE can be transmitted from an infected animal to another susceptible animal by inoculation of preparations of infected tissue, usually brain. Feeding experiments with highly infected preparations show that the oral route of infection, though possible in some cases, in very inefficient.<P>

Scrapie is endemic in British sheep. In 1988, work by Wilesmith and colleagues (3) strongly indicated that the agent of BSE was transmitted to British cattle via contaminated feedstuffs in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The vehicle of infection was protein supplements derived from animal carcasses that included sheep processed in rendering plants. There had been a considerable increase in the sheep population in Britain in the 1970s, changes in the rendering process in the 1970e included the use of lower temperatures and the omission of organic-solvent extraction methods that were used when the tallow industry was flourishing. 
<P>
Thus, the protein feed supplements produced in Britain by these altered methods transmitted high-challenge doses of the scrapie agent to cattle in circumstances that somehow broke a species barrier that had apparently resisted less severe natural challenges for more  than 200 years. The evidence suggested that this was an extended common- source outbreak, but that the contaminated feedstuff was widely distributed across the country and thus challenged very large numbers of cows at or about the same time. (4) The incubation period of BSE ranges from 1  to 8 years or more. Existing data suggest a mean of 4 to 5 years. The disease was first recognised in late 1986 and retrospective studies showed that cases had occurred in 1985, That dairy herds were predominantly affected is thought to reflect the greater use of feed supplements for dairy herds than for beef suckler herds. 
<P>
We do not understand why BSE appears to affect only a very small proportion of the animals in a challenged herd. Mechanism of microbial pathogenicity  When a pathogen successfully establishes disease in a new host species and is then transmitted sequentially (passaged) from one host to another of the same species, our present teaching is that the strain becomes adapted to the new host and generally becomes more easily transmitted (ie, infcctivity, and sometimes virulence, is enhanced). Thus, successively smaller challenge doses are required to cause an infection. An epidemic may ensue as more hosts succumb, though various other controlling factors ultimately operate. This is the way in which a new variant of the influenza virus attacks man, or measles virus attacks a non-immune community; it is also the way foot and mouth disease virus wreaks havoc in cattle from time to time. These viruses are highly transmissible among their susceptible hosts when large numbers of susceptibles are close together,<P>

BSE has not followed this pattern. The disease has a very long incubation period and seems to have established a clinically evident infection in only a small proportion of the cows that have been challenged. This observation may be attributable to an uneven distribution of the agent in batches of contaminated feedstuff, but we are uncertain. There is no evidence that a cow can pass the infection laterally to another cow in the same herd. Accordingly, the cow was said to be a dead-end host for the scrapie agent. Of course, if the carcass of a cow that is incubating BSE were ground up into meat and bone-meal protein supplement, this might well transmit the infection to another cow--and it seems likely that this happened before we were aware of this possibility and set up the various safeguarding regulations that are now law. 
<P>
Thus, we think that the BSE agent, in the form of several strains of the agent infecting different cows, were recycled so that boosted doses might have been widely distributed before legislation broke the cycle. At that time, the sheep component of the inoculum would also be contributing to the pool until the flow was stopped. Whether the BSE variant is truly bovine adapted, or whether the successful break across the species barrier was merely the result of the very high challenge doses is debatable. The latter explanation is currently preferred. Some experts continue to warn that as yet unknown and unexplained factors must have operated to create such ad unusual breakthrough. Let us then be cautious. There are unconfirmed suggestions that vertical transmission may occur rarely. If, in the fullness of time, there is evidence that lateral (cow to cow) or vertical (cow to calf) transmission of BSE occurs regularly, predictions that we have now amended to meet the bad-case scenario will have to be radically revised for a worst-case scenario, but this seems to be most unlikely. 
<P>
Number of cows affected  The table shows the numbers of confirmed cases by year of onset of the disease from 1986 to 1992. The plotting of cumulative numbers of cases produces sensational figures that appear to be even more alarming. The total (cumulative) numbers of confirmed cases is approaching 100 000 cows on about 25 000 farms in Britain by mid-1993. Switzerland has notified 31 cases, and France has had 5 or 6 known cases.

As a precaution for man, the sale of bovine offal products for human consumption was prohibited in England and Wales from November, 1989, and in Scotland end Northern Ireland from February, 1990.<P>

The Southwood Report in 1989 predicted that the numbers of cases of the disease in cows would peak in 1993 with a cumulative total of 17 000 - 20 000, and a subsequent decline in numbers of new cases. Since recycling of the infection via rendered protein presumably occurred before the ban on ruminant-derived supplements came into operation, the original assessments of the likely size and time-course of the BSE outbreak were underestimates and have had to be revised. (The Southwood Committee envisaged this possibility.) The recent press report of 87 175 confirmed cases and the slaughter of more than 100 000 cattle (6) makes alarming reading, but these figures can still be explained on the basis of the recycled challenge and the incubation period. If the vehicle of transmission has been truly excluded by the ban on ruminant-derived protein supplements, we can expect to see the numbers of new cases reducing within a year or two, while the numbers of cases occurring in young animals should rapidly decrease.<P>

Assuming that lateral or vertical transmission does not generally occur, and evidence so far largely supports this, we can still base a hopeful prediction as follows. Cases of BSE initiated in 1987-88 (before the ban) will be clinically evident in the years 1989-95 or beyond, but most will have occurred by 1994-95-ie, after the average 4-5 year incubation period has elapsed in 1993. However, there will be many cases after the average is passed, so plots of cumulative data should be interpreted cautiously. Numbers of cases occurring in young animals less than 5 years old (ie, at the mean incubation period after the latest possible time of challenge by contaminated feedstuff) should now be decreasing. 
<P>
Allowances must be made for cases that could occur from contaminated feed that was already in the pipeline when the ban was imposed; this, and other intentional or inadvertent slippage, will account for cases, that could arise in animals younger than 4 years old in 1993. Further thoughts  In 1991, I wrote that, in view of the data available at the time, the Southwood Report was not very wide of the mark and that the hope was that the anticipated but postponed reduction in the number of cases of BSE in cattle would be evident later in this decade.(7) This remains largely true, though the cumulative numbers are worrying. Have we taken account of all possible factors?<P>

It would be reckless to be complacent. One argument is that our present concept of the mean incubation period should be revised in the light of cases that might occur if cows were generally allowed to live longer, We might also envisage an extension of the mean if cases with smaller challenge doses run a slower and more extended course than those that were severely challenged, or if different strains of the BSE agent behave differently in cows. None of the existing evidence seems to suggest that these possibilities are operating significantly to alter present predictions. A further consideration -- that there is a genetic element influencing susceptibility to BSE and the observed incubation period in different breeds -- is relevant, Wilesmith (4) argues persuasively that, if such an influence operates, it does nor seem to favour the prevalence of long incubation period genotypes. 
<P>
Prion disease: CJD and BSE  The prion infectious protein theory presently holds sway, though it continues to be challenged. The work of Collinge (8) indicated that prion protein gene analysis is central to the definitive diagnosis of human spongiform encephalopathy including CJD, although it is important to note that the agent of CJD is different from that of BSE and scrapie. In this context, there is a possibility that immunological and molecular procedure will show that prion disease in man has been underestimated. It is essential that the finding of hitherto undiagnosed cases of human neurodegenerative diseases as prion disease (if this occurs) should not be lightly equated with a breakthrough of BSE into man. 

<P>
BSE was most unfortunately triggered in cows in the early 1980s with a mean incubation period of about 5 years. The index cases occurred in 1985-86. Recycling could have been occurring throughout the 1980s until 1988. Hence, the disease will be taking its heaviest toll now (ie, the early 1990s). Since we have no specific marker for BSE, we must take care not to attribute to it cases of human spongiform encephalopathy that now receive skilled and detailed laboratory investigation, Two relevant examples are those reported by Sawcer (9) and Davies (10) and their colleagues who described CJD presenting in two individuals occupationally exposed to BSE. 
<P>
About 120 000 individuals work in dairy farming in England and Wales, and Sawcer et al concluded that their case of CJD most likely occurred by chance in a dairy farmer who had 1 BSE-affected cow in his herd. Davies et al note that their case, a dairy farmer with 3 cases of BSE in his herd, still does not associate CJD and BSE on statistical grounds. Many investigators have made a good case for CJD and scrapie (and by inference BSE) being substantially different. Moreover, there is no evidence that farm workers, abattoir workers, butchers, or veterinary personnel in contact with scrapie-associated tissues are at special risk of contracting CJD (see Kimberlin (11)<p> 

With the renewed interest in prion disease, are we to be inundated with a great new harvest of prion dementias? (12) Some workers feel strongly that prion dementias are unlikely to belurking undetected within the larger landscape of neurodegenerative disorders,(13) and they have sparked off a spirited debate in The Lancet.(14-16) Against this background, and particularly for those of us with special interests in BSE as a theoretical risk to man, recent reports of electrochemical testing of urine for the diagnosis of scrapie and Alzheimer's disease (17,18) had us hurrying back to the library and telephoning scientific colleagues. The discovery of a specific marker for the BSE agent would be a great step forward, but it is not yet here,<p> 

Is time on our side? Perspectives and opinions differ, but I think that it is. Harrison and Roberts (19) considered in 1992 that the BSE outbreak wasan accidental experiment on the dietary transmissibility of prion disease between sheep and cows. In their view, a subsequentexperiment involving man probably occurred in 1986-89 because BSE-contaminated meat may have entered the human food chain during that period. They noted the range of protective factors that may operate and conceded that no conclusive evidence exists to revise the consensus view that the chances of BSE causing human disease are extremely small. These investigators certainly made a good case for our continuing support of relevant molecular biological, pathological, and epidemiological studies. Taylor (20) has set the scene admirably and reiterates his cautiously optimistic opinion on the putative health risk of BSE to man.(19)
<P>
 But can we be sure?  The short answer is no, we cannot be sure. Some researchers would take me to task for not considering  their arguments more seriously. (21,22)  Will (23) gives a carefully balanced response to that challenge, making the point that it is essential to minimise human exposure to the BSE agent in our food, and detailing the evidence that the consumption of bovine muscle (beef) is exceedingly unlikely to represent a risk. He properly calls attention to our anxiety that _inoculation_ of the agent may pose a greater risk, and that this relates to aspects of occupational exposure or parenteral administration or implantation of medicinal products that incorporate bovine material or have been associated with bovine material in their preparation. Such products would include vaccines and non-synthetic sutures.<p> 

The British authorities acted almost as promptly to counter this latter theoretical challenge as they did to control the putative dietary challenge posed by BSE. Meanwhile, in addition to the intensive research currently in hand, as outlined in the Tyrrell Report, (24) the epidemiology of CJD in the UK is being monitored by  R G Will and his team at Edinburgh. They have the advantage of the previous surveys of teams recruited by Matthews (25,26) in Britain and other important epidemiological investigations into the distribution of CJD overseas -- for example, that of Brown and co-workers in France.(27) In all of this, it is important to distinguish between assumed risk factors that have been postulated in uncontrolled studies and significant risk factors for CJD that have been identified in controlled studies. The work of Harries-Jones and colleagues in 1988 (28) is very relevant and should be read in conjunction with the accounts of other international workers.(29-32) Will's reassurance in 1991 (23) thatthere is no evidence to suggest that medicines, blood products or occupational exposure to scrapie are associated with an increased risk of CJD still stands.<p> 

 What about the transmissibility of the CJD agent? The disease occurs sporadically throughout the world. Some clusters are attributed to a genetic trait that enhances susceptibility, but the mechanisms of spread of the disease in most cases remain unknown. There are at least 62 recorded cases of iatrogenic CJD in which there was clear transmission by implantation or inoculation, (33) but there is no consistent evidence of case-to-case transmission of non-iatrogenic CJD. (34) We also have to take into account alternative theories (fairly considered by Kimberlin (34) ) that non-iatrogenic CJD may be more commonly carried and transmitted in non-expressed form and isswitched on by as yet unknown factors. Such factors might include a chance mutation of the latent agent to neurovirulence within the host, and host genetic susceptibility.<p> 

 We will not be certain for a very long time because we are dealing with diseases with such extended incubation periods. The work of Masters and colleagues (35) and many others strongly indicate: that CJD is not scrapie in man,(34) and the intensive investigations and analyses of the past decade strongly link scrapie with BSE. These data suggest that the numbers of cases of CJD recorded by our improved surveillance systems in the present decade are unlikely to be influenced by the theoretical challenge of BSE to man, except insofar as each of these diseases has stimulated awareness, speculation, and laudable inquiry into the exciting subject of the spongiform encephalopathies.<p> 

 The alternative hypotheses is that BSE is a primary disease of cattle and is not scrapie in cows; that it has been here, enzootically, before it was unnaturally boosted; that its special potential for transmissibility has already been demonstrated naturally in cows, elk, mule-deer, mink, exotic ungulates, and cats, and experimentally in a range of animals from mice to a pig; and that it is a real threat to man. A proposed very long incubation period allows virtually endless speculation, while complex arguments can confuse facts observed specifically for scrapie or BSE or CJD. 
<P>
Cautious scientific opinion does not fly in the face of these facts, while the hawks hover well against the prevailing wind. It is wise to bear their counterarguments in mind, if only to test the validity of the views that are presently held by the majority, but it is important to appreciate the extent of the observations and the quality of the analysis on which the majority view is based. I am greatly indebted to many colleagues for their generous  help. Mr John Wilesmith and Mr Ray Bradbury [?] of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Central Veterinary Laboratory Weybridge, gave me updated data and valued advice. I was further guided by discussions with Dr D M Taylor, Dr R G Will,  Dr W B Martin, Prof Anne Ferguson, and Prof  J P Duguld.

<I>According to Collee, to doubt the scrapie_BSE_link is  to take the hawks position; it is scaremongering leading to: Conjectured high risk to humans.   Collee's position in this article is calm, cautious  blahblah based on available evidence, with due mention of uncertainty,  yet taking account of opponents  views etc if not for anything  to mmm confirm the validity of one's own mmm majority vote of the  scientific community  mmm based on careful analysis:  Acknowledged extremely small risk.  But that was then, in 1993 :-) Now...   Torsten Brinch</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

**<A HREF="/~tom/gibbs_principle.html"> Expanding on the Gibbs Principle:</A>  According to  C.J. Gibbs, all mammals are endemic for TSE at some low level.  Scrapie cannot be bred out of sheep, there are no BSE-free countries, and BSE cannot be eradicated.  The quantitative case for this is examined and the principle expanded to the paralogous situation.  Transmissability does not recapitulate phylogeny.  
<P>
As with genes and proteins, human genetic diseases are organized into superfamilies.  By pulling back to the gene doubling event that gave rise to the prion gene in the lower vertebrates, then pushing the paralogue forward, we may find other human diseases mechanistically similar to CJD.  High priority organisms to sequence are listed;  anticipated benefits range from a better-cheaper-faster experimental organism to better understanding of prion domain function and evolution.  <FONT COLOR="996633">Posted 12.23.96; last revised 12.26.96</FONT>

**<A HREF="/~tom/chickens.html"> Chicken prion:</A>  The prion sequence from chickens presents some anomalies.   Indeed, highly inbreed, long-domesticated chickens may inadvertently harbor a TSE-causing mutation of the prion gene. It is aligned here by clamping techniques to marsupial and Jurassic placental mammal, in so far as possible: the chicken gene may only be paralogous to mammalian prion.  The hexapeptide repeat region seems to have originated from a short palindrome, with a different but nearby nucleotides than mammalian octapeptide being amplified.  Chicken structural domains are compared to the variations found in 34 mammalian species.<FONT COLOR="996633"> Three tables. Posted 12.24.96; revised 1.1.96.</FONT><p>

** <A HREF="/~tom/nearly_neutral.html">Nearly-neutral mutations from primates:</A>The principle of secondary polymorphisms is applied to human prion protein to predict  six neutral polymorphisms.  Hot spots for prion mutations (including the octapeptide repeat region) have different structural origins and different disease induction mechanisms.  Identical mutations are turning up repeatedly in unrelated human families, even though the genetic map is far from saturated.  Sporadic CJD is diminishing as cases once said to be non-familial are yielding to improved DGGE gel methods, sequencing of the promoter region, more extensive interviewing of families, and parallels to ALS. Two tables. <FONT COLOR="996633"> Posted 12.23.96; revised1.1.97.</FONT>

** <A HREF="/~tom/prion_evol_rate.html">Prion evolution:</A> Prion protein is unusually  conserved evolutionarily -- mutational rates are estimated.  The prion gene can be deleted with non-catastrophic impact, yet the sequence is more strongly conserved than hemoglobin.  Selective pressure can be componentized between nucleic acid and protein by examing silent codon change. 
<P>
Aligned prion sequences from diverse organisms have given non-standard  phylogenetic trees.  Is this attributable to a paradox in prion evolution or just mis-use of homology software?  By clamping homology software to the correct tree and applying only between anchors, fine details of prion evolution can be more reliably ascertained.  <FONT COLOR="996633"> Posted 12.24.96; revised1.3.97.</FONT><p>

** <A HREF="/~tom/prion_dipoles.html">Prion dipoles and conformation:</A>  Prion surface charge is asymmetrically distributed, giving rise to positive and negative halves to the 3D protein disk. The positive face may bind to membrane phospholipid bilayer, orienting the negative face outwards.  Alternatives are explored, involving the large dipole moment produced by the coherent separation of charge interacting with the usual dipoles associated with the alpha helices (major color graphic).  An earlier helix predicted from theory is speculatively positioned to interact with helix H2.  The net result could stabilize the 3D structure and/or influence binding and catalysis of small ligands at a predicted binding site.  Chaotropic salts may mimic quaternary structure 'salting out' by scrapie isoform. Beautiful color graphic. <FONT COLOR="996633">Posted 12.22.96; last revised 1.1.97</FONT><p>

<CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="990099">Web Publishing -- How Legitimate is it?</FONT><p></H3>
</CENTER><I>The most frequent objections are lack of peer-review; on-going revisions;  lack of a fixed final  permanent product;  and no weeding out of the insignificant.
<P>
Our responce is that  (1) somehow this has not caused a problem for other disciplines  such as physics, and (2) peer-reviewing is a great concept -- but when was the last time a  peer-reviewed journal really peer-reviewed something?  Consider three flagship biology journals, Nature, Cell, and PNAS:
<P>
In order to compete with The Lancet and Science, Nature has accepted and rapidly published a number of highly dubious articles on prion biology that sexhibit no signs of peer-review, while sitting on and eventually refusing to publish better articles submitted earlier from less-favored authors and institutions.  One might specifically include here the Krakauer et al. article on cow-human species barrier, three notes on "anti-prions", and the Anderson et al. article on BSE epidemiology (while refusing publication of a better, earlier but more controversial article from Dealler's group).
<P>
Ask yourself how Nature's reviewers could sign off on internal consistency of the mouse prion NMR structure without looking at structural coordinate.  Did the hydrophobic residues pack properly as asserted or spatially interfere?
<P>
Cell's  senior editor approaches scientists speaking at meetings promising a very rapid two-week publication cycle on flashy topics featuring "soft" peer review from people never known to reject anything.  PNAS is has the potential for being a vanity press for its (often ancient) members and favored colleagues.
<P>
Still, most of the articles are quite good, the incidence of fraud is low, and we continue to read and enjoy our favorite journals.   And likewise we  continue to visit our favorite Web sites  during this transitional period. Web sites are like journals --  ultimately they sink or swim based on  content quality, not  on process.-- webmaster</I>

 <H3><A NAME="">Relative</A> rates of nuclear DNA evolution in human and Old World  monkey lineages</H3>  Herbert G; Easteal S<BR> Mol Biol Evol 1996 Sep;13(7):1054-7 <P> Rates of substitution were compared between humans and Old World  monkeys for sequences in or adjacent to 19 genes. The comparison  of 21,299 sites in noncoding regions indicates that the  substitution rate is approximately 43% greater in the Old World  monkey lineage. However, 83% of the compared sites are in the  region of the beta-globin gene family. Outside this region there  is no consistent pattern of rate difference between the two  lineages. 
<P>
Comparison of the coding regions of 16 genomically  dispersed genes, involving 1,592 synonymous sites and 5,275  nonsynonymous sites, showed a faster rate of substitution in the  human lineage at the nonsynonymous sites of the <B>prion</B> gene, but  otherwise no evidence of rate difference between the two  lineages. <P>  It is concluded that rate differences between these two  lineages may be specific to certain regions of the genome rather  than being a general phenomenon. This conclusion needs to be  confirmed by comparison of a larger number of genomically  dispersed sequences. It is, however, consistent with the results  of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, which show no difference in  evolutionary rate between the two lineages.

  <H3>Three-exon <A NAME="">structure</A> of the gene encoding the rat prion protein and its expression in tissues</H3>  Saeki K; Matsumoto Y; Hirota Y; Matsumoto Y; Onodera T <br> Virus Genes 1996;12(1):15-20 <br> <br> The prion protein (PrP), encoded by a chromosomal gene, is associated with development of the neurodegeneration of prion-induced diseases. Since determination of the complete structure of the gene encoding PrP is important for understanding gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS), the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the isolated whole gene encoding rat PrP (raPrP) was determined. The rat PrP gene (raPrP) spans 16 kilobases (kb) of the rat genome and contains three exons of 19-47 base pairs (bp), 98 bp, and 2 kb separated by two introns of 2.2 kb and 11 kb. The first and second exons are noncoding, while the third exon contains a short 5' untranslated region, the entire 762-bp open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region. The putative raPrP promoter in the 5' flanking region contains putative Sp1, AP-1, and AP-2 binding sites without a consensus TATA box. This TATA box-deficient feature, coupled with the presence of a high G+C content and Sp1-binding sites in the raPrP promoter, characterizes it as a housekeeping gene. Analysis of the raPrP cDNA 5'-end showed that raPrP mRNA transcription was initiated at multiple sites. Northern blot analysis showed that the levels of raPrP mRNA varied among rat tissues, with the highest levels found in the brain and placenta. This determination of raPrP nt sequences, including the introns and the 5' and 3' flanking regions, may make it possible to elucidate cis-acting elements that regulate the expression of this gene in different tissues and cell lines. <hr>


  <H3><A NAME="5">Analysis</A> of PrPc mRNA by in situ hybridization in brain, placenta, uterus and testis of rats</H3>  Tanji K; Saeki K; Matsumoto Y; Takeda M; Hirasawa K; Doi K; Matsumoto Y; Onodera T<BR> Intervirology 1995;38(6):309-15 <P> An amyloid-like isoform of a 33- to 34-kD glycoprotein, termed as  the scrapie prion protein (PrPsc), plays a critical role in  transmissible spongiform encephalopathies of animals and humans.  It has even been suggested to present the responsible infectious  agent. This protein is a posttranslationally modified form of the  cellular isoform of prion protein (PrPc). Hitherto, little has  been known about the functions of PrPc. In order to examine the  localization of PrPc mRNA in rat tissues, the in situ  hybridization technique was performed. In rat brain, PrPc mRNA  was predominantly localized within pyramidal cells of the  hippocampus, large neurons of the thalamus and neocortex, and  Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In the placenta, not only PrPc  mRNA was localized to a subpopulation of decidual cells at the  highest levels, it was also expressed in the amnion and  mesodermal layer of the yolk sac. Furthermore, PrPc mRNA was also  expressed in the myometrium of the uterus and seminiferous tubule  in the testis. However, signals were not obtained in the lung,  spleen, liver of prenatals and other fetus tissues. The  distribution of rat PrPc mRNA portrayed the levels which were  different among the various types of cells, suggesting that its  expression may be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. <hr>

 <h3>Is there a human  version of the <A NAME="8">yeast</A> psi?  </h3> Jean-Jean O; Le Goff X; Philippe M <br> C R Acad Sci III 1996 Jun;319(6):487-92 <br> <br> The yeast Sup35p protein which is responsible for the [psi] phenotype, is a GTP-binding protein involved in translation termination. It was suggested recently that the [psi] determinant has prion-like properties that were localized in the 114 N-terminal amino acids of the protein. In this study, we show that the 5' end of the human SUP35 gene open reading frame is longer than previously reported by 138 codons. This N-terminal sequence presents similarities with the N-terminus of S. cerevisiae Sup35p protein, involved in [psi] maintenance. By transfection of human cells and Western blotting, we demonstrate that translation is initiated at the first AUG encountered at the 5' end of the human SUP35 gene. The longest form of the protein, which contains the N-terminal extension, is the major form of Sup35p protein in non transfected cells. Moreover, an analog of the long form of Sup35p protein is found in various mouse tissues. We suggest that the protein encoded by SUP35 gene could have, at least in human, the properties described for the yeast [psi] element. <hr>

 <h3>Prion disease associated with a novel <A NAME="88">nine</A> octapeptide repeat insertion in the PRNP gene  </h3> Krasemann S; Zerr I; Weber T; Poser S; Kretzschmar H; Hunsmann G; Bodemer W <br> Brain Res Mol Brain Res 1995 Dec 1;34(1):173-6 <br> <br> Some cases of spongiform encephalopathies are linked to mutations within the prion protein gene (PRNP). Repetitive octapeptide insertions of variable length in the PRNP gene are also associated with spongiform encephalopathies, mostly familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In this study we report on a novel insertion mutation comprising nine extra octapeptide repeats between codons 51 and 91 of the PRNP gene. The affected patient showed a slowly progressive dementia of at least 6 years duration and ataxia. <hr>

 <H3>A <A NAME="1">Japanese</A> case of CJD with a point mutation in the prion protein gene at codon 210</H3>  <BR> Furukawa H; Kitamoto T; Hashiguchi H; Tateishi J<BR> J Neurol Sci 1996 Sep 15;141(1-2):120-2 <P> We screened 111 cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  and 75 healthy control subjects in Japan to detect possible  polymorphisms in their prion protein gene (PRNP). We identified a  G-to-A point substitution at codon 210, leading a  valine-to-isoleucine change, in a 69-year-old CJD patient. This  substitution was not seen in 75 healthy control subjects.  <hr>

<H3>Prion protein <A NAME="77">genotype</A> and pathological phenotype studies in  sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</H3> MacDonald ST; Sutherland K; Ironside JW<BR> Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol 1996 Aug;22(4):285-92 <P> A comparative semi-automated morphometric study was performed on  the distribution of prion protein, spangiform change and  astrocytosis in the brains of nine cases of sporadic  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of differing genotype at the  methionine-valine polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion protein  gene. Custom-designed image analysis software was used to produce  objective figures for each of the different pathological features  throughout 13 different areas of the brain used for analysis. A  significant positive correlation was observed between prion  protein deposition and astrocytosis in all cases and no  significant correlation was observed between spongiform change  and prion protein deposition. Different patterns of pathology  were found to relate to codon 129 genotype; valine homozygosity  favoured the targeting of pathology to deep grey matter  structures, while methionine homozygosity favoured cortical  targeting of pathology. These results provide evidence that prion  protein deposition is closely associated with an astrocytic  reaction and suggest that codon 129 genotype may influence the  pathological phenotype. <hr>

  <H3><A NAME="9">Partial</A> unfolding and refolding of scrapie-associated prion protein: evidence for a critical 16-kDa C-terminal domain</H3>    Kocisko DA; Lansbury PT; Caughey B <br> Biochemistry 1996 Oct 15;35(41):13434-42 <br> <br> The conversion of the normal form of prion protein (PrPC) to a disease-specific form (PrPSc) is a central event in scrapie and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. PrPSc is distinguished from PrPC by its insolubility and its resistance to proteolysis. PrPSc is also capable of converting 35S-PrPC, in vitro, into a form which is indistinguishable from PrPSc with respect to its protease-sensitivity.  <P> Both the "converting activity" and the protease-resistance of isolated hamster PrPSc can be at least partially eliminated by denaturation and recovered by renaturation, provided that the concentration of denaturant does not exceed a threshhold. This study was undertaken in order to localize the regions of native PrPSc structure that must remain intact to allow refolding. Proteinase K was used to digest exposed, denatured PrPSc sequences, and the residual fragments were characterized using anti-PrP antibodies directed toward four PrP epitopes. A 16-kDa fragment marked by an epitope within residues 143-156 remained protease-resistant under conditions which at least partially unfolded epitopes within residues 90-115 and 217-232.  <P> However, dilution of denaturant restored protease-resistance to these epitopes. This reversible unfolding was observed with both purified PrPSc and PrPSc in crude brain homogenates. Size fractionation of partially GdnHCl-solubilized PrPSc revealed that only the insoluble aggregates retained the ability to refold, consistent with the hypothesis that native PrPSc is an ordered aggregate. When the threshold denaturant concentration was exceeded, both protease-resistance of the 16-kDa C-terminal domain and converting activity were irreversibly destroyed. These results suggest that the in vitro converting activity requires ordered, protease-resistant PrPSc aggregates and that a critical aspect of the PrPSc structure is the folding of a particularly stable approximately 16-kDa C-terminal domain. <hr>


  <H3>A model for prion protein <A NAME="2">dimerisation</A> based on alpha-helical packing</H3> <A HREF="mailto:james.warwicker@bbsrc.ac.uk">Warwicker J</A>; Gane PJ <br> Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1996 Sep 24;226(3):777-82 <br> <br> Residues 109-122 of the human prion protein (PrP) are highly conserved across species, and are predicted to be alpha-helical in PrPc, the cellular form. A computational search of the potential for alpha-helical dimerisation has been made for residues 109-122. The conformation which consistently scores highest in terms of burying non-polar surface area is a tight association involving alanine, glycine and valine residues. A model of heterodimerisation for PrPc and PrPSc (the misfolded form) is presented in which species barrier mutations would arise from interaction specificities that would follow, at least in part, the same framework as formation of a putative homodimer. <hr>

<h3><A NAME="6">Differential</A> effects of a new amphotericin B derivative, MS-8209, on mouse BSE and scrapie: implications for the mechanism of action of polyene antibiotics </h3> </h3> Adjou KT; Demaimay R; Lasmezas CI; Seman M; Deslys JP; Dormont D<br> Res Virol 1996 Jul-Aug;147(4):213-8 <br> <br> Mice were infected intracerebrally with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or the scrapie agent and treated during 8 weeks postinfection to test the protective effect of a new amphotericin B (AmB) derivative, MS-8209, in experimental transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The results show that (i) the treatment prolonged the incubation period of both BSE-infected and scrapie-infected mice, (ii) MS-8209 and AmB were much more efficient in delaying the onset of scrapie than that of BSE, and (iii) a delay in Prp-res (proteinase K-resistant prion protein) and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) accumulation was observed in the brains of scrapie-infected mice, but was not significant in BSE-infected mice. The analysis of the molecular and clinical results strongly suggests a common mechanism of action of this category of drugs on the different transmissible spongiform encephalopathy strains. This could be due to an interaction with the PrP transconformation process leading to the formation of PrP-res. <hr>

 <H3>A <A NAME="3">neurotoxic</A> prion protein fragment enhances proliferation of microglia but not astrocytes in culture</H3>  Brown DR; Schmidt B; Kretzschmar HA<BR> Glia 1996 Sep;18(1):59-67 <P> The scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) induces  pathological changes in the central nervous system including  neurodegeneration and gliosis. A synthetic prion protein (PrP)  peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 106-126 has been  shown to be toxic to neurons that express PrPC, the cellular  isoform of PrP. Here we show that in mixed glial cultures  PrP106-126 induces astroglial proliferation that is dependent on  cellular PrPc expression. In purified cultures of glial subtypes  only microglia proliferated in response to PrP106-126. This  effect was independent of PrP expression. Destruction of  microglia in mixed glial cultures by L-leucine methyl ester  (LLME) treatment abolished enhanced proliferation caused by  PrP106-126. This proliferative effect can be restored by  co-culturing LLME-treated astrocytes with microglia. Microglia  therefore seem to mediate the proliferative effect exerted by  PrP106-126 on astrocytes.

<H3><A NAME="4">Amyloid</A> in Alzheimer's disease and prion-related encephalopathies: studies with synthetic peptides</H3>  Forloni G; Tagliavini F; Bugiani O; Salmona M<BR> Prog Neurobiol 1996 Jul;49(4):287-315 <P> Deposition of amyloid-beta protein (beta A) in brain parenchyma  and vessel walls is a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's  disease (AD). In prion-related encephalopathies (PRE), too, an  altered form of prion protein (PrPsc) forms amyloid fibrils and  accumulates in the brain. In both conditions the amyloid  deposition is accompanied by nerve cell loss, whose pathogenesis  and molecular basis are not understood. Neuropathological,  genetic and biochemical studies indicate a central role of beta A  in the AD pathogenesis. Synthetic peptides homologous to beta A  and its fragments contribute to investigate the mechanisms of  beta A deposit formation and the role played by beta A in AD  pathogenesis. The physicochemical studies on the beta-sheet  conformation and self-aggregation properties of beta A peptides  indicate the conditions and the factors influencing the formation  of beta A deposits. 
<P>
The neurotoxic activity of beta A and its  fragments support the causal relationship between beta A deposits  and the neuropathological events in AD. Numerous studies were  performed to clarify the mechanism of neuronal death induced by  exposure to beta A peptides. A similar approach has been used to  investigate the role of PrPsc in PRE; in these diseases, the  association between accumulation of PrPsc and neuropathology is  evident and numerous data indicate that PrPsc itself might be the  infectious agent responsible for disease transmission. Thus, PrP  peptides were used to investigate the pathogenic role of PrPsc in  PRE and the conformational change responsible for the conversion  PrPc to PrPsc that makes the molecule apparently infectious. In  particular, we synthesized a peptide homologous to residues  106-126, an integral part of all abnormal PrP isoforms that  accumulate in the brain of subjects' PRE. This peptide is  fibrillogenic, has secondary structure largely composed of  beta-sheet and proteinasc-resistant properties, is neurotoxic and  induces astrogliosis. In this review, we summarize and compare  the data obtained with beta A and PrP peptides and anlyze the  significance in terms of amyloidogenic proteins and  neurodegeneration.  <hr>

Brain Res Mol Brain Res 1996 Apr;37(1-2):249-58</PRE>
 
The cellular <B>prion</B> protein (PrP) binds to the C-terminus
of Bcl-2 but not Bax. Therefore, we examined whether the
C-terminus of Bcl-2 was important for other homomeric
and heteromeric protein-protein interactions. Using the
yeast two hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation,
three sites of homomeric interactions were identified
within Bcl-2. 
<P>
The carboxy terminal 37 amino acids
selectively homodimerized. Two additional regions of
Bcl-2 (residues 1-129 and 126-200) interacted with
each other, but not themselves permitting both intra- and
intermolecular association. 
<P>
In addition, we analyzed
heteromeric interactions of Bcl-2 with <B>PrP</B> and two
Bcl-2 related proteins, Bax and A1. The domain
requirements for binding of those three proteins to Bcl-2
were different from one another. Bax binding required
almost the entire Bcl-2 molecule, while A1 bound to the
amino terminal region (residues 1-82). <B>PrP</B> associated
with the carboxy terminus of Bcl-2 (amino acids
200-236). 
<P>
These data suggest configurational models for
Bcl-2 containing complexes. First, Bcl-2 may exist as
both heterodimers and heteromultimers. Second,
molecules such as Bax and A1 may serve to cap chains of
Bcl-2 homodimers by interacting with dimerization
domains in the extramembrane region. <B>PrP</B> may disrupt
chains of Bcl-2 molecules at the homomeric association
site in the transmembrane region.

The Bcl-2 protein is a suppressor of programmed cell death that homodimerizes with itself
and forms heterodimers with a homologous protein Bax, a promoter of cell death.  Functional analysis of deletion
mutants of human Bcl-2 in yeast demonstrated the presence of at least three conserved
domains that are required to suppress Bax-mediated cytotoxicity, termed domains A (amino
acids 11-33), B (amino acids 138-154), and C (amino acids 188-196). 
<P>
In vitro binding
experiments using GST--2 fusion proteins demonstrated that Bcl-2(delta B) and
-2(delta C) deletion mutants had a markedly impaired ability to heterodimerize with Bax
but retained the ability to homodimerize with wild-type Bcl-2. In contrast, Bcl-2(delta A)
and an NH2-terminal deletion mutant Bcl-2(delta 1-82) retained Bax binding activity in
vitro but failed to suppress Bax-mediated cytotoxicity in yeast. Sequences downstream of
domain C in the region 197-218 also were shown to be required for Bax-binding in vitro and
anti-death function in yeast. 
<P>
Analysis of Bcl-2/-2 homodimerization using both in vitro
binding assays as well as a yeast two-hybrid method provided evidence in support of a
head-to-tail model for Bcl-2/-2 homodimerization and revealed that sequences within the
NH2-terminal A domain interact with a structure that requires the presence of both the
carboxyl B and C domains in combination. In addition to further delineating structural
features within Bcl-2 that are required for homo-dimerization, the findings reported here
support the hypothesis that Bcl-2 promotes cell survival by binding directly to Bax but
suggest that ability to bind Bax can be insufficient for anti-cell death function.

Biochem Cell Biol 72: 463-9 (1994) </PRE>


-2 alpha is a mitochondrial or perinuclear-associated oncoprotein that prolongs the life
span of a variety of cell types by interfering with programmed cell death. How Bcl-2 confers
cell survival is unknown, although antioxidant and antiprotease functions have been proposed.
In addition, protein structures of Bcl-2 that are crucial for its survival activity are still
ill-defined. Bcl-2 can occur as Bcl-2 alpha or Bcl-2 beta, two alternatively spliced forms
which solely differ in their carboxyl termini. The finding that Bcl-2 alpha is active and
membrane bound, but Bcl-2 beta is inactive and cytosolic, indicates that the carboxyl
terminus contributes to the survival activity of Bcl-2. This region contains two subdomains,
a domain X with unknown function and a hydrophobic stretch reported to mediate membrane
association of Bcl-2 alpha. Recently Bcl-2-related proteins have been identified. These
include Bax that heterodimerizes with Bcl-2 and, when overexpressed, counteracts Bcl-2.
Bax contains two highly conserved regions of sequence homology with Bcl-2, referred to as
-2 homology 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2) domains. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have
revealed that both domains are not only novel dimerization motifs for the interaction of Bax
with Bcl-2 but also crucial for the survival activity of Bcl-2. Interestingly, the C-terminal
end of BH2 encompasses the Bcl-2 alpha/beta splice site, as well as part of domain X in Bcl-2
alpha.

<H4>A peptide sequence from <A NAME="Bax">Bax that converts
Bcl-2 into an activator of apoptosis</A>. </H4>
<PRE>Hunter JJ; Parslow TG 
J Biol Chem 271: 8521-4 (1996)</PRE> 
Bcl-2 and Bax are members of a family of cytoplasmic proteins that regulate apoptosis. The
two proteins have highly similar amino acid sequences but are functionally opposed: Bcl-2
acts to inhibit apoptosis, whereas Bax counteracts this effect. The antagonism appears to
depend upon dimerization between Bcl-2 and Bax, but its mechanism is otherwise unknown.
<P>

Here we report that overexpressing Bax induces apoptosis in a mammalian fibroblast cell
line, and we identify a novel, short "suicide domain" in Bax that is required for this effect.
Inserting this domain in place of the corresponding, divergent sequence in Bcl-2 converts

region in Bax confers an active propensity for apoptosis in mammalian cells and support the
view that Bcl-2 may block death primarily by suppressing Bax activity.

Most members of the Bcl-2 protein family of apoptosis regulating proteins contain two
evolutionarily conserved domains, termed BH1 and BH2. Both BH1 and BH2 in the Bcl-2
protein are required for its function as an inhibitor of cell death and for heterodimerization
with the proapoptotic protein Bax. 
<P>
In this report, we mapped the region in Bax required for
heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and homodimerization with Bax, using yeast two-hybrid and in
vitro protein-protein interaction assays. Neither the BH1 nor the BH2 domain of Bax was
required for binding to the wild-type Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. Moreover, Bax (deltaBH1) and
Bax (deltaBH2) mutant proteins bound efficiently to themselves and each other, further
confirming the lack of requirement for BH1 and BH2 for Bax/Bax homodimerization. Bax/Bax
homodimerization was not dependent on the inclusion of the NH2-terminal 58 amino acids of
the Bax protein in each dimerization partner, unlike Bcl-2/-2 homodimers which involve
head-to-tail interactions between the region of Bcl-2 where BH1 and BH2 resides, and an
NH2-terminal domain in Bcl-2 that contains another domain BH4 which is conserved among
antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. 
<P>
Similarly, heterodimerization with Bcl-2
occurred without the NH2-terminal domain of either Bax or Bcl-2, suggesting a tail-to-tail
interaction. The essential region in Bax required for both homodimerization with Bax and
heterodimerization with Bcl-2 was mapped to residues 59-101. This region in Bax contains a
stretch of 15 amino acids that is highly homologous in several members of the Bcl-2 protein
family, suggesting the existence of a novel functional domain which we have termed BH3.
Deletion of this 15-amino acid region abolished the ability of Bax to dimerize with itself and
to heterodimerize with Bcl-2. The findings suggest that the structural features of Bax and
-2 that allow them to participate in homo-and heterodimerization phenomena are
markedly different, despite their amino-acid sequence similarity.

The Bcl-2 gene was originally cloned because of its involvement in B-cell lymphomas and
encodes a 25-kD integral membrane protein that has been shown to inhibit programmed cell
death (also termed apoptosis) in a wide variety of circumstances. The Epstein-Barr Virus
(EBV) also has been implicated in B-cell malignancies and interestingly contains an open
reading frame (BHRF-1) predicting a 19-kD protein with 22% homology to Bcl-2. these data demonstrate that despite marked differences in their
predicted amino-acid sequences, the human, chicken, and EBV versions of Bcl-2 have retained

Expression of the protooncogene Bcl-2 inhibits both apoptotic and in some cases necrotic cell
death in many cell types, including neural cells, and in response to a wide variety of inducers.
The mechanism by which the Bcl-2 protein acts to prevent cell death remains elusive. One
mechanism by which Bcl-2 has been proposed to act is by decreasing the net cellular
generation of reactive oxygen species. To evaluate this proposal, we measured activities of
antioxidant enzymes as well as levels of glutathione and pyridine nucleotides in control and
Bcl-2 transfectants.

Endogenously generated or exogenously supplied nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptotic cell death
in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Apoptotic signaling caused an early
accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53 prior to DNA fragmentation. Contrary to the notion
of specific activating signals, inhibitory transduction mechanisms largely remain unknown.
Therefore, RAW 264.7 macrophages were stably transfected with human Bcl-2, an
anti-apoptotic protein. Bcl-2 transfectants showed substantial protection from cell death
induced following the exposure to NO donors such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and
spermine-NO.

<CENTER><H3>Prion Repeats and tri-nucleotide repeat neurological diseases</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><I>Adapted from McLaughlin, B et al Am.J.Human Genetics 59:561-569 1996</I></CENTER>

<P>
Quite a few neurological disorders [see <A HREF="#Condition">table</A> below] are turning out to have a bizarre genetic basis consisting of variations in a short region that is repeated a few to hundreds of times.  If in a coding open reading frame (ORF), the repeat is translated; if in a leader or trailer sequence (untranslated reading frame, UTR) it is not.  The disease condition is associated with increasingly long repeats.  Disease onset can be earlier in subsequent generations if the repeat length has increased.   
<P>
<A HREF="/~tom/Recent_Science.html">Recall</A> that prion protein contains a repeat region, typically a highly conserved octapeptide repeated 5-6 times [e.g., PQGGGGWGQ PHGGGWGQ PHGGGWGQ PHGGGWGQ PHGGGWGQ PHGGGGWGQ].  Furthermore, there are numerous instances where increased length (from 1 to 9 additional repeats) leads to familial CJD.  The function of this domain in prion protein is not understood, but it is worth exploring whether it has anything in common with  (tri-nucleotide and longer) repeat neurological conditions.
<P>
McLaughlin et al describe the situation in Huntington Disease, a condition associated with a simple CAG tri-nucleotide repeat (giving poly-glutamine) that is innocuous at the level of 11-34 repeats but becomes a serious neurological disorder when 37-180 repeats in length.  Three models are considered by way of explanation:
<OL>
<LI>An RNA binding protein interacts with the repeat and alters the amount of Huntington protein produced.
<LI>An RNA chaparone protein affects the subcellular distribution of the Huntington mRNA ( causing polarized translation to take place, i.e., locally at a dendritic synapse).
<LI>An RNA binding protein is titrated away by all the extra repeats [sink theory] from other important mRNAs, causing a subtle imbalance of their production that leads to the disease state.
</OL>

These models have some attractiveness for the spongiform encephalopathies.  Like many of the 14-15 known conditions, it is a neurological disorder.  Prion protein has a repeat region to which it  is difficult to assign a function at the protein level, suggesting a role for regulation of transcription or translation, that is, the repeats are mostly significant at the nucleotide level.  A disease condition is known to result when the length of the repeat increases.  <A HREF="/~tom/octapeptide_analylsis.html">Genetic changes in the octapeptide region</A> have always been insertions or deletions of one or more repeat units, never just a single amino acid.  It is hard to see how inserting 72 additional amino acids could still allow a functioning product if it were in a domain integral to prion end function or how such a massive alteration could parallel subtle conformational effects of point mutations. Prion protein can be strongly localized at synapses [Neuroscience Letters v159 p111 1994] so could benefit from chaperoning for the purpose of local synthesis).  The sink model is not unlike theories proposed for a perturbed equilibrium of prion and heat shock protein 60.

<H4>Mapping of prion gene on chromosome 20:</H4>

              The <B>human</B> gene for prion-related protein has been mapped to 20p12-pter by a
              combination of somatic cell hybridization and in situ hybridization (Sparkes et al.,
              1986) and by spot blotting of DNA from sorted chromosomes (Liao et al., 1986).
              Robakis et al. (1986) also assigned the PRNP locus to 20p by in situ hybridization. <P>
                    

             By analysis of interstitial 20p deletions, Schnittger et al. (1992) demonstrated the
              following order of loci: pter--PRNP--SCG1 (118920)--BMP2A
              (112261)--PAX1 (167411)--cen. Puckett et al. (1991) identified 5-prime of
              the PRNP gene a RFLP that has a high degree of heterozygosity, which might serve as a
              useful marker for the pter-p12 region of chromosome 20.<P>

The structural gene for <B>mouse</B> prion (Prn-p) has been mapped to mouse chromosome 2. A
              second murine locus, Prn-i, which is closely linked to Prn-p, determines the length
              of the incubation period for scrapie in mice (Carlson et al., 1986). Yet another gene
              controlling scrapie incubation times, symbolized Pid-1, is located on mouse
              chromosome 17.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Creutzfeld-Jacob <A NAME="disease">disease</A> and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome are rare degenerative
disorders of the nervous system which have been genetically linked to the prion protein
(PrP) gene. The PrP gene encodes a host glycoprotein of unknown function and is located on
the<B> short arm of chromosome 20, a region with few known genes </B>or anonymous markers. The
complete structure of the PrP gene in man has not been determined despite considerable
interest in its relationship to these unusual disorders. We have determined that the human
PrP gene has the same simple genomic structure seen in the hamster gene and consists of two
exons and a single intron. In contrast to the hamster PrP gene the human gene appears to have
a single major transcriptional start site. The region immediately 5' of the transcriptional
start site of the human PrP gene demonstrates the GC-rich features commonly seen in
housekeeping genes. Curiously, the genomic clone we have isolated contains a 24-bp deletion
that removes one of five octameric peptide repeats predicted to form a B-pleated sheet in this
region of the PrP. We have also identified 5' of the PrP gene an RFLP [ Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms] which has a high degree
of heterozygosity and which should serve as a useful marker for the pter-12 region of human
chromosome 20. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Pax-1, a member of a murine multigene family, belongs to the paired box-containing class of
developmental control genes first identified in Drosophila. The Pax-1 gene encodes a
sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with transcriptional activating properties and has
been found to be mutated in the autosomal recessive mutation undulated (un) on mouse
chromosome 2 with vertebral anomalies along the entire rostrocaudal axis. By radioactive in
situ hybridization (ISH) using a fragment from the murine Pax-1 paired box that is almost
identical to the respective sequences from the cognate human gene HuP48 and fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) using a complete mouse Pax-1 cDNA, we have assigned the human
homologue of murine Pax-1, the PAX1 locus, to chromosome 20p. The map position of PAX1
after FISH (FL-pter value of 0.34 +/- 0.04) corresponds to band p11.2. These results
confirm the exceptional homology between human chromosome 20 and the distal segment of
mouse chromosome 2, extending from bands F to G, and add PAX1 to the group of genes on 20p
like PTPA, PRNP, SCG1, BMP2A, which are located in proximity on both chromosomes. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

Burri et al. (1989) isolated and
sequenced 3 human genes that contained paired domains with strong homology to those in genes
in Drosophila involved in programming early development. One of these genes, called HuP48,
had a paired domain similar to that of the Drosophila gene P28 and nearly identical to that of
the Pax-1 gene of the mouse.  <P>


At least 8 paired box genes containing a paired box homologous protein domain have been
identified in the murine gene family and numbered Pax-1 through Pax-8. The mouse Pax-1
gene encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding-protein with transcriptional activating
properties (Deutsch et al., 1988; Chalepakis et al., 1991). The expression pattern of Pax-1
during mouse embryogenesis indicates that it may play an important role in the development
of the vertebral column. The autosomal recessive mutation 'undulated' (un) in the mouse
exhibits vertebral anomalies along the entire rostrocaudal axis and is associated with a point
mutation (G-to-A transition) at position 15 leading to a gly-to-ser replacement in a highly
conserved region of the paired box of Pax-1. <P>

The mouse Pax-1 gene was mapped by linkage
analysis to distal mouse chromosome 2 in close proximity to 'undulated,' between the
beta-2-microglobulin and 'agouti' loci. This segment of mouse chromosome 2 exhibits
homology to human chromosome 20. Segmental trisomy (Francke, 1977) and monosomy
(Schnittger et al., 1989; Anad et al., 1990) for chromosome 20p is associated with anomalies
of intervertebral discs. Schnittger et al. (1992) demonstrated that the human PAX1 locus is
situated on 20p. The map position of PAX1 after fluorescence in situ hybridization FL-pter
value of 0.34 +/- 0.04 corresponds to band p11.2. (FL-pter = fractional length-pter
(Lichter et al., 1990).) The mean FL-pter value for the centromere of the same chromosome
20 identified by Q-banding was 0.46 +/- 0.04. By PCR analysis in somatic cell hybrids, Pilz
et al. (1993) confirmed the assignment of the PAX1 gene to chromosome 20. By analysis of
somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stapleton et al. (1993)
mapped PAX1 to 20p11.  <P>

Helwig et al. (1995) reported that mice who are doubly heterozygous for the mutants
'undulated' and 'Patch' have a phenotype reminiscent of an extreme form of spina bifida occulta
in humans (see 182940). The unexpected phenotype in double-mutant and not single-mutant
mice showed that novel congenital anomalies such as spina bifida can result from interaction
between products of independently segregating loci. This is an example of digenic inheritance.
(The 'undulated' mutation is sited in the Pax1 gene in mice, and the 'Patch' mutation is
associated with deletion of the mouse Pdgfra gene (PGDFRA; 173490).)  
<HR>

<A NAME="Transforming">Transforming</A> growth factor-beta (TGFB) superfamily encodes at least 12 members,
including TGFB1 (190180), TGFB2 (190220), TGFB3 (190230), Mullerian inhibitory
substance (600957), the bone morphogenetic proteins 2A, 2B, and 3, and the VG-1-related
gene product. Wozney et al. (1988) <B>purified bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2A</B> and
BMP-3 from demineralized bone on the basis of their ability to induce the formation of
ectopic cartilage when implanted subcutaneously. Wang et al. (1990) showed that when
BMP-2A produced by recombinant DNA techniques was implanted into rats, bone formation
occurred by day 14. 

<P>
Dickinson et al. (1990) demonstrated that in the mouse the Bmp-2a gene
is located on chromosome 2 in a segment that shows homology of synteny with human 20p.
They suggested, therefore, that the human BMP2A gene may be located on 20p. They pointed
out that in the mouse 5 of the 8 loci (Tgfb-1, Bmp-2a, Bmp-2b1, Bmp-2b2, and Vgr-1)
map near mutant loci associated with connective tissue and skeletal disorders, raising the
possibility that at least some of these mutations result from defects in TGFB-related genes.
The Bmp-2a gene is situated close to the tight skin (Tsk) locus (see 184900), raising the
question that this gene may be the site for the mutation in 'tight skin.' Using cDNA probes for
the analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines, Tabas et al. (1991) confirmed the assignment of
BMP2A to chromosome 20. By both in situ hybridization and FISH, Gopal Rao et al. (1992)
assigned BMP2A to 20p12.  <P>

Tabas et al. (1991) stated that 'BMP2A has been suggested as a reasonable candidate for the
human condition fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva (FOP, 135100), on the
basis of observations in a Drosophila model (Kaplan et al., 1990).'

<A NAME="Chromogranin">Chromogranin</A> B (secretogranin I or Scg-1) is a tyrosine-sulfated secretory protein found in a wide

from a cDNA library of human pheochromocytoma. Chromogranin B is a 657 amino acid long
polypeptide of 76 kilodaltons and is preceded by a cleaved end-terminal signal peptide of 20
residues. Chromogranin B was assigned to chromosome 20 by Craig et al. (1986). Craig et al.
(1987) showed by in situ hybridization that the CHGB locus is on 20pter-p12. Jenkins et al.
(1991) mapped the murine gene, symbolized Scg-1, to chromosome 2 by in situ
hybridization and by interspecific backcross analysis.

From a human tumor cDNA library, Houssaint et al. (1990) isolated a gene encoding a
putative receptor-like protein-tyrosine kinase that they called TK14. The amino acid
sequence was closely related to that of the mouse protein bek (bacterially expressed kinase),
and more distantly related to the sequences of a chicken basic fibroblast growth factor
receptor (73% sequence homology) and its presumed human equivalent, the FLG protein
(136350). Overexpression of the TK14 protein by transfection of COS-1 cells led to the
appearance of new cell-surface binding sites for both acidic and basic fibroblast growth
factors.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>There are 8 known point variations in the prion gene for sheep.  The frequency of these depends on breed and flock.  The susceptibility to scrapie is influenced in a complex way by which alleles are present.  Sheep and human amino acid sequences are easily aligned in the region of variant sheep alleles.  None of the  8 known sheep alleles are known human variants (and vice versa for the 13 known human alleles). 
<P>
Only the R211Q variant in sheep would impact prion secondary structure (middle of helix H3), assuming the 3D NMR structure from mouse threads to the 3D sheep structure.  This is in marked contrast to human CJD point mutation situation. Sheep, being highly inbred, could have fixed quite a few neutral alleles, more than in a wild species and that these wouldn't necessarily cause scrapie in and of themselves.  However, the change from arginine to glutamine at codon 211 in the middle of a key structural alpha-helix has some chance of being causative.<p>

On the one hand, it could be argued that this arginine would be solvent-exposed, that glutamine is very polar and so a fairly innocuous substitution; both residues are good helix-formers.  CJD-causing mutations have tended to be in hydrophopic interior residues, one supposes disruptive of packing (and so conformation).<p>

On the other hand, there has been a loss of positive charge and of 41 cubic angstroms in volume.  This could affect not only conformation but also binding to other proteins.  When the refined 3D structure appears, it would be worth taking a closer look at this arginine (as well as the other changes in sheep.) -- webmaster</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We investigated the relationships between amino acid polymorphisms of the prion protein
(PrP), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the PrP gene and the incidence
of natural scrapie in Japan. Six variant alleles of the PrP gene were found in healthy sheep.
Based on the substitutions at codons 112, 136, 154 and 171, these allelic variants were
designated, by amino acid at these codons, PrPMARQ, PrPTARQ, PrPMVRQ, PrPMAHQ, PrPMARR and PrPMARH. Each RFLP
haplotype (e1h2, e1h2 or e3h1) consisted bo multiple alleles including PrPMARQ. Three of
these variant alleles were found in scrapie-affected Suffolk sheep. PrPMARQ was associated
with high disease incidence, PrPTARQ and PrPMARR were associated with low disease
incidence. We found that one scrapie-affected Suffolk was homozygous for PrPMARR and four
PrPSc-positive Suffolks carried PrPMVRQ. Both of two scrapie-affected Corriedales and two
out of three scrapie-affected cross-breeds between Suffolk and Corriedale carried PrPMARH,
suggesting that this allele associates with high incidence of scrapie in Corriedale and its
cross-breeds. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Current models of the virus-like agents of scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) have to take into account that structural changes in a host-encoded protein (PrP
protein) exhibit an effect on the time course of these diseases and the survival time of any
man or animal exposed to these pathogens. We report here the sequence of different forms of
the bovine PrP gene which contain either five or six copies of a short, G-C-rich element
which encodes the octapeptide Pro-His-Gly-Gly-Gly-Trp-Gly-Gln or its longer variants
Pro-Gln/His-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Trp-Gly-Gln. Out of 12 cattle, we found eight animals
homozygous for genes with six copies of the Gly-rich peptide (6:6), while four were
heterozygous (6:5). Two confirmed cases of BSE occurred in (6:6) homozygous animals.

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is one of a family of scrapie-like diseases which
affect various mammals. Polymorphisms and mutations of the PrP gene have been associated
with the incidence of experimental and natural scrapie in other animals and this study of the
bovine PrP gene was undertaken to discover whether there was a similar association with PrP
genotype in cattle with BSE. There are two known polymorphisms of the coding region of the
bovine PrP gene, a silent HindII restriction site polymorphism and a difference in the number
of an octapeptide repeated sequence (either five or six copies). An analysis of 370 cattle in
Scotland revealed no difference between the frequencies of these PrP genotypes in healthy
cattle and cattle with BSE.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The only component of the infectious scrapie prion identified to date is a protein designated
PrPSc. A posttranslational process converts the cellular PrP isoform (PrPC) into PrPSc.
Denatured PrPSc was digested with endoproteases, and the resulting fragments were isolated
by HPLC. By both mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing, the primary structure of PrPSc
was found to be the same as that deduced from the PrP gene sequence, arguing that neither RNA
editing nor protein splicing feature in the synthesis of PrPSc. Mass spectrometry also was
used to search for posttranslational chemical modifications other than the glycosylinositol
phospholipid anchor attached to the C-terminus and two Asn-linked oligosaccharides already
known to occur on both PrPSc and PrPC. These results contend that PrPSc molecules do not
differ from PrPC at the level of an amino acid substitution or a posttranslational chemical
modification; however, we cannot eliminate the possibility that a small fraction of PrPSc is
modified by an as yet unidentified posttranslational process or that PrPC carries a
modification that is removed in the formation of PrPSc. It seems likely that PrPSc differs
from PrPC in its secondary and tertiary structure, but the possibility of a tightly bound,
disease-specific molecule which purifies with PrPSc must also be considered. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Neurodegenerative diseases of animals and humans including scrapie, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are caused by unusual infectious pathogens
called prions. There is no evidence for a nucleic acid in the prion, but diverse experimental
results indicate that a host-derived protein called PrPSc is a component of the infectious
particle. Experiments with scrapie-infected cultured cells show that PrPSc is derived from a
normal cellular protein called PrPC through an unknown posttranslational process. We have
analyzed the amino acid sequence and posttranslational modifications of PrPSc and its
proteolytically truncated core PrP 27-30 to identify potential candidate modifications that
could distinguish PrPSc from PrPC. The amino acid sequence of PrP 27-30 corresponds to
that predicted from the gene and cDNA. 
<P>
Mass spectrometry of peptides derived from PrPSc has
revealed numerous modifications including two N-linked carbohydrate moieties, removal of an
amino-terminal signal sequence, and alternative COOH termini. Most molecules contain a
glycosylinositol phospholipid (GPI) attached at Ser-231 that results in removal of 23 amino
acids from the COOH terminus, whereas 15% of the protein molecules are truncated to end at
Gly-228. The structure of the GPI from PrPSc has been analyzed and found to be novel,
including the presence of sialic acid. Other experiments suggest that the N-linked
oligosaccharides are not necessary for PrPSc formation. Although detailed comparison of
PrPSc with PrPC is required, there is no obvious way in which any of the modifications might
confer upon PrPSc its unusual physical properties and allow it to act as a component of the
prion. If no chemical difference is found between PrPC and PrPSc, then the two isoforms of
the prion protein may differ only in their conformations or by the presence of bound cellular
components. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Acquisition of protease resistance by prion proteins in

<BLOCKQUOTE>The scrapie and cellular isoforms of the prion protein (PrPSc and PrPC) differ strikingly in
a number of their biochemical and metabolic properties. The structural features underlying
these differences are unknown, but they are thought to result from a posttranslational
process. Both PrP isoforms contain complex type oligosaccharides, raising the possibility that
differences in the asparagine-linked glycosylation account for the properties that distinguish
PrPC and PrPSc. ScN2a and ScHaB cells in culture produce several PrP molecules with
relative molecular masses of 26-35 kDa and proteinase K-resistant cores of 19-29 kDa.
When the cells were treated with tunicamycin, this heterogeneity was eliminated and a single
PrP species of 26 kDa was observed. 
<P>
Several hours after its synthesis, a fraction of this
protein became insoluble in detergents and acquired a proteinase K-resistant core, thus
displaying two of the biochemical hallmarks of PrPSc. Synthesis in the presence of
tunicamycin restricted the proteinase K-resistant cores of PrP to a single species of 19 kDa.
No proteinase K-resistant PrP was found in uninfected cells. Expression of a mutated PrP
gene lacking both asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in ScN2a cells resulted in the
synthesis of 19-kDa proteinase K-resistant PrP molecules. We conclude that
asparagine-linked glycosylation is not essential for the synthesis of proteinase K-resistant
PrP and that structural differences unrelated to asparagine-linked oligosaccharides must
exist between PrPC and PrPSc. Whether unglycosylated PrPSc molecules are associated with
scrapie prion infectivity remains to be established. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Diversity of oligosaccharide structures linked to

Biochemistry 28: 8380-8 (1989) [90105353] </PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prion proteins from humans and rodents contain two consensus sites for asparagine-linked
glycosylation near their C-termini. The asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of the scrapie
isoform of the hamster prion protein (PrP 27-30) were released quantitatively from the
purified molecule by hydrazinolysis followed by N-acetylation and NaB3H4 reduction. The
radioactive oligosaccharides were fractionated into one neutral and three acidic
oligosaccharide fractions by anion-exchange column chromatography. All oligosaccharides in
the acidic fractions could be converted to neutral oligosaccharides by sialidase digestion.
<P>

Structural studies on these oligosaccharides including sequential exoglycosidase digestion in
combination with methylation analysis revealed that PrP 27-30 contains a mixture of bi-,
tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains with Man alpha 1----6(GlcNAc beta
1----4)(Man alpha 1----3)Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4-(Fuc alpha
1----6)GlcNAc as their core. Variation is produced by the different combination of the
oligosaccharides Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----, Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha
1----3)GlcNAc beta 1----, GlcNAc beta 1----, Sia alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc
beta 1----, and Sia alpha 2----6Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1---- in their outer chain
moieties. When both asparagine-linked consensus sites are glycosylated, the diversity of
oligosaccharide structures yields over 400 different forms of the scrapie prion protein.
Whether these diverse asparagine-linked oligosaccharides participate in scrapie prion
infectivity or modify the function of the cellular prion protein remains to be established. </BLOCKQUOTE>

</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>Post-translational modification of the scrapie prion protein (PrP) is thought to account for
the unusual features of this protein. Molecular cloning of a PrP cDNA identified two potential
Asn-linked glycosylation sites. Both the scrapie (PrPSc) and cellular (PrPC) isoforms were
susceptible to digestion by peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) but resistant to
endoglycosidase H as measured by migration in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. PNGase F digestion of PrPC yielded two proteins of Mr26K and 28K;
however, the 26-k species was only a minor component. In contrast, PNGase F digestion of
PrPSc yielded equimolar amounts of two proteins of Mr26K and 28K. The significance of this
altered stoichiometry between the 26- and 28-kDa deglycosylated forms of PrP during
scrapie infection remains to be established. 
<P>
Both isoforms as well as PrP 27-30, which is
produced by limited proteolysis of PrPSc, exhibited a reduced number of charge isomers after
PNGase F digestion. The molecular weight of PrP 27-30 was reduced from 27K-30K by
PNGase F digestion to 20K-22K while anhydrous hydrogen fluoride or
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid treatment reduced the molecular weight to 19K-21K and
20K-22K, respectively. Denatured PrP 27-30 was radioiodinated and then assessed for its
binding to lectin columns. PrP 27-30 was bound to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) or lentil
lectins and eluted with N-acetylglucosamine or alpha-methyl-mannoside, respectively.
Digestion of PrP 27-30 with sialidase prevented its binding to WGA but enhanced its binding
to Ricinus communis lectin. 
<P>
These findings argue that PrP 27-30 probably possesses
Asn-linked, complex oligosaccharides with terminal sialic acids, penultimate galactoses, and
fucose residues attached to the innermost N-acetyl-glucosamine. Whether differences in
Asn-linked oligosaccharide structure between PrPC and PrPSc exist and are responsible for
the distinct properties displayed by these two isoforms remain to be established. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPC) is a sialoglycoprotein bound almost
exclusively on the external surface of the plasma membrane by a glycosyl
phosphatidylinositol anchor. The deduced amino acid sequence of Syrian hamster PrPC
identifies two potential sites for the addition of Asn-linked carbohydrates at amino acids
181-183 (Asn-Ile-Thr) and 197-199 (Asn-Phe-Thr). We have altered these sites by
replacing the threonine residues with alanine and expressed the mutant proteins transiently
in CV1 cells utilizing a mutagenesis vector with the T7 promoter located upstream from the
PrP gene. The T7 RNA polymerase was supplied by infection with a recombinant vaccinia
virus. 
<P>
The 3 mutant proteins (PrPAla183, PrPAla199 and PrPAla183/199) have a reduced
relative molecular weight compared to wild-type (wt) PrP. Deglycosylation as well as
synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin reduced the relative molecular weight of all the PrP
species to that of the double mutant PrPAla183/199. Our results indicate that both
single-site mutant prion proteins are glycosylated at non-mutated sites and they suggest that
both potential sites for Asn-linked glycosylation are utilized in wt PrPC. Immunofluorescence
studies demonstrate that while wt PrPC localizes to the cell surface, all the mutant PrP
molecules accumulate intracellularly. The site of accumulation of PrPAla183 is probably
prior to the mid-Golgi stack since this protein does not acquire resistance to endoglycosidase
H. Whether the intracellular locations of the mutant PrPC species are the same as those
identified for the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) remains to be established.</BLOCKQUOTE>

modified PrP isoform (PrPSc) is a component of the infectious particle causing scrapie and
the other prion diseases. mAb have been raised against the protease-resistant core of Syrian
hamster (SHa) PrPSc designated PrP 27-30. To map the epitopes within PrP reacting to
these antibodies, we have expressed wild-type, chimeric mouse (Mo)/SHa and mutant MoPrP
genes using recombinant vaccinia virus systems. The fidelity of the expression of recombinant
PrPC was examined using vaccinia viruses expressing SHa-PrPC. It is full length, possesses
Asn-linked carbohydrates and is attached to the external surface of the cell membrane by a
glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor that is sensitive to cleavage by
phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. 
<P>
We have tested 18 mAb for their ability to
bind to chimeric prion proteins on immunoblots. Three distinct epitopes were identified that
mapped to amino acid differences between SHa and MoPrP sequences. The first epitope,
recognized by three of the antibodies tested, was defined by methionines at amino acids 108
and 111 in the mouse protein. The second epitope was dependent upon the presence of
asparagines at positions 154 and 174 in MoPrP and was recognized by four of the antibodies
tested. The third epitope mapped to a single amino acid substitution at residue 138 in MoPrP.
mAb raised against SHaPrP 27-30 specific for this epitope are able to bind MoPrPC which
has a single amino acid change (Ile to Met) at position 138. Eleven of the 18 antibodies tested
mapped to this immunodominant epitope. It is located within a postulated amphipathic helix, a
structure associated with immunodominant Ag. Inasmuch as PrPC, in its native form on the
cell surface, is detected by the mAb 13A5 (a prototypic antibody of the immunodominant third
epitope class), it is likely that this epitope is accessible in the native conformation of this
protein. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Scrapie PrP 27-30 is a sialoglycoprotein.</H4>

J Virol 53: 596-606 (1985) [85108153] </PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The major scrapie prion protein, designated PrP 27-30, exhibited both charge and size
heterogeneity after purification from infected hamster brains. Eight or more discrete charge
isomers of PrP 27-30 with isoelectric points ranging from approximately pH 4.6 to 7.9
were found by using non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis in the first dimension
followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second
dimension. The charge isomers were detected by silver staining as well as by radioiodination.
The procedures used to disaggregate PrP 27-30 before electrophoresis in the first dimension
do not appear to be responsible for the charge heterogeneity. However, heating PrP 27-30 to
100 degrees C for 15 min in 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N HCl resulted in modification of the protein
and alteration of its electrophoretic pattern. A PrP 27-30 fragment (molecular weight,
17,100 to 21,900) obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage also exhibited charge and size
heterogeneity. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of PrP 27-30 electrophoresed into sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that carbohydrate residues are attached to
the protein. Digestion of PrP 27-30 with neuraminidase and
endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H resulted in significant changes in the isoelectric pH of
PrP 27-30 isomers, whereas digestion with alkaline phosphatase had no effect. Our results
demonstrate that PrP 27-30 is a sialoglycoprotein; this is consistent with several properties
of this protein and of the scrapie prion. </BLOCKQUOTE>

 Reuter Information Service    Oct 17, 1996
<P>

TOKYO  - A group of Japanese virologists has claimed success in culturing cranial nerve cells devoid of the protein believed to cause mad cow disease and similar infectious brain illnesses, Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday.


    A team at the University of Tokyo Agriculture Department would announce the results of an experiment to culture nerve cells free of prion at a meeting of the Society of Japanese Virologists on October 25, Kyodo quoted team members as saying.<P>

    Infection with abnormal prions has been associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow disease, its human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, and its sheep equivalent scrapie, the report said.<P>

    The researchers said by adding serum from cow embryos to nerve cells derived from mouse brains they succeeded in isolating nerve cells whose prion-producing functions had been lost.<P>

    Outbreaks of mad cow disease -- and suspected links to the human version -- earlier this year in Britain roiled world beef markets, costing millions of dollars in lost beef trade and triggering economic tension between Britain and its European Union trade partners.

An abstract has just appeared (October 1996) whose title suggests a new v-CJD vicitm has been found in Ireland.  There were earlier reports, later questioned, of a few case in Germany and France.

Listserve 10.10.96
<P>

Strain typing of some UK farmers that have died of CJD is currently being
done at the Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh. It is unknown if brain tissue from all four farmers that
had BSE affected herds has been passaged in mice, or if brain tissue from
the abattoir worker who died in February 1996 is being similarly studied.
-----<BR>
The 3D pattern of TSE pathology in mice can  possibly be used
to distinguish different strains of CJD, but all mice and the method
of inoculation have to be identical. According to the prion theory each passage
to a non identical animal creates a new strain. The passage of BSE through
humans with different prion proteins should tead to different pattern in mice
after a second passage.

</PRE>

The abnormal form of the prion protein (PrPSc), a synthetic prion protein peptide fragment
(PrP106-126) and fragments of the Alzheimer's protein precursor, APP, have been shown to be cytotoxic in vitro. We have used synchronous, clonal cell models originally developed to study the toxicity of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid peptide, A beta 25-35, to investigate the actions of PrP peptides. We found that the cytotoxicity of the PrP106-126 depends on its
state of aggregation and the cellular expression of PrPc, and is independent of a loss of MTT
reduction activity in the absence of cell death associated with the cellular effects of A beta
25-35. These factors may play a role in the lesion specificity of different pathological

 Stephen F Dealler  Bloomsbury, Soho, UK ISBN 0 7475 2904 3
<P>

 Dr Stephen Dealler's book "Lethal Legacy" is of hybrid genre-- imagine a cheerful and determined Franz Kafka had written "The Double Helix."  In other words, a personal biological research odessey in an area controlled by a large and dark bureaucracy.  The tone is mild, optimistic, and popular scientifice oriented.  It covers the early days through to April, 1996 and includes a hilarious tour of US labs  and personalities [all working in negative-pressure fume hoods, of course].<P>

'Lethal Legacy ' contains, among other things, a to me fascinating and original unpublished proposal [Chapter 6, pages 112-132] on AGIs  (alkaloidal glycosidase inhibitors from grazed forage)  and scrapie, never funded for the usual MAFFka-esque reasons.  <P>

After considering anisotropic growth of unblocked prion multimers, Dealler addresses the molecular origin and biogeography of scrapie strains, proposing that forage AGIs affect prion asperagine glycosylation patterns.  Dealler saw possibilities for treatment as well with these alkaloids.  The author notes swainsonine causes a neurological disease of cattle  and deoxynojirimycin from mulberries inhibits glycoprotein turnover.  Australia and New Zeeland are [supposedly] scrapie free despite UK breed origins because the AGI-producing plants are missing, in Dealler's scenario.  After getting the runaround and his brain picked by Searle-Monsanto's man at Oxford, Dealler gets a friendly reception from castanospermine expert Rob Nash (GC-mass spec man) at Kew Botanical Gardens and Winchester from RCH.  With Eileen Lees given space in Bradford's lab, the search is on to identify AGIs in the British countryside.  Some 250 plant species were collected, and most surprising to me, common plants like Bellis perennis [Asteraceae], which our scrapie-laden sheep in Oregon eat with great gusto,  and bluebells were found to be quite strong AGIs in sheep brain assays.  Nothing could be tested in sheep flocks because the Central Veterinary Lab In Weybridge wouldn't give permission.<P>

It is discouraging to read about billions spent unproductively on the cull while not tuppence went to research.  The US has a much better system with NIH and NSF: scientists evaluate grant proposals, not a secretive and unaccountable clique of agency bureaucrats.  Little good science has come out of the UK, considering that it is their problem; they remain largely dependent on foreign researchers for answers, as many a committee has noted.

<CENTER><H3>Milk production <A NAME="drop">drop</A> as a sign of BSE</H3>
</CENTER>Listserve 10.5.96
<P>
 Most of the european dairy cattle are slaugthered only because of a reduction
in their milk productivity. This happens when they have had only 1 or 2 calves
in the Netherlands, after 3 or 4 calves in Germany or perhaps a bit later in the
UK. When a cow becomes suffering from any disease, the milk productivity drops.
In the case of BSE this will happen most probably slowly but pronounced and
often with the consequence of the slaughtering of a infected cattle only a few
weeks before other symptoms become detectable.
<P>

Therefor it is very important to know the quantitative correlation between the
time point before they are killed because of BSE and the quantity of milk, they
produced. It is very strange, that this correlation has never been published.
If my hypothesis is correct and many older dairy cattle are killed because of an
unrecognized BSE infection, then the britsh calculations of the mean incubation
time of BSE, the frequence of maternal transmission and the duration of the BSE
epidemy in the future are badly underestimated.
<PRE>- The observed number of cases in UK annual birth cohorts
  peaked consistently (since 1986) at age 4-5 years.
 
- The within-herd incidence correlates with herd size.
 
- Unsatisfactory milk production, easy to observe,  has not been
  noted as typical 'first symptoms'.
 
- A very abrupt decrease in incidence in birth month cohorts appeared
  in the autumn 1988.
 
- A very large proportion of UK cases appeared in a few annual cohorts
  1986-88.</PRE>
 
We know that calves from BSE-dams had higher BSE incidence
than calves from non-BSE dams. The observed increased risk could be consistent with a
10-15 % (but not much higher) maternal transmission rate,
and it _could_ be a  result of genetic selection for
susceptibility coupled with exposure to contaminated food.
Were not the calves for the study 
selected from the 1988 as well as from the 1989 birth cohorts?<P>
 
Maternal transmission would be consistent with _equal_ incidences in
the 1988- and 1989 calves in the study.
 And genetic susceptibility coupled with food exposure would
result in a difference: a lower incidence in the 1989-calves,
as they were less exposed to contaminated food.
<HR width = 25%>
A reduction of milk productivity is a well known symptom
>of BSE.. Colin Whitaker, the vet that discovered the first cases of BSE, wrote
in his report regarding the first 10 cases at the same farm outside
Ashford, Kent:
<P>
 
"Milk yield gradually drops and there is loss of condition in the later stages."
(Presentation at a meeting of the British Cattle Veterinary Association in
July 1987).&nbsp; Later:
<P>
 
"In my paper I had a list of differential diagnosis, and the last one was
'a new scrapie-like syndrome'. The Ministry (MAFF) asked us not to use that
(at the meeting in '87) - or told us not to use the word 'scrapie-like'. I
think they were concerned that it would effect the sheep market." (Sept 23
1996)
 
The word was blacked out at the meeting. Colin Whitaker's report was published
one year later, in its original version.
<HR width = 25%>

As the cows of the study have not been subject to selective
milk production related culling :-), the study should at least resolve
whether the incidence peaks before age 7 year, or as you have
suggested as a possibility, simply increases with age within that period.
The Weybridge experiment and (mainly) the observation
that the feed ban had an immediate dramatic influence on the
incidence in birth month cohorts.<P>

 
The Weybridge experiment was designed to be able to preclude
the possibility of maternal transmission. In this it failed.
The Weybridge experiment does _not_ preclude a maternal transmission
rate at 30-45 % (although a much lower rate was observed under
the conditions of the experiment) --  but at such a rate the
decrease in UK incidence after the beef ban would have been
less abrupt than observed.
 <P>

With a 45 % maternal transmission rate
(alert: back-of the-envelope-calculation!) we would be close
to the point where each BSE case would reproduce itself
in one of its female calves. The available data
do _not_ indicate that this has happened!
<P>
 
A genetic selection for
increased susceptibility to food exposure in the calves from BSE dams
would still need food exposure to express itself as disease.
This food exposure was less in 1989 than in 1988.
 Unfortunately, the number of 1989 calves in the experiment is
(I think) quite small. If it is, it may be impossible to
detect a difference.

<P>
    Concerning slide and tissue importations for training
          veterinary pathologists in the US in the diagnosis of BSE,
          what are the legal implications involved?
          I am under the impression that, even in diagnostic labs, it
          is illegal to possess infectious materal for what is termed
          a "foreign animal disease."  If this is true, then histology
          slides containing BSE would certainly fit into this
          category.  We have some actual BSE training slides here at

<P>Response:
All recipients of histological slides containing brain sections of
BSE affected cattle received and are required to abide by an import
permit that limits the types of procedures that can be done with the

Abstract of a paper just published by V. Jones, T.C. Martin, P. Keyes & M.
Dawson (CVL, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 3 NB, UK [1996 Vet Rec
Oct 12, 139, 360-363]:
<P>

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to analyse CSF from 75
suspect cases of BSE, 61 of which were confirmed by PM brain
histopathology, and 38 normal cattle.   CSF samples were also examined
from cattle killed at periodic intervals through the incubation
period following experimental challenge. Consistent changes were
recorded in all CSF samples from the confirmed cases of natural BSE
and also from cattle showing early signs of experimental disease. 
<P>
The
changes consisted of an increased intensity of staining of
apolipoprotein E and the presence of two protein spots , as yet
unidentified, of molecular weights 35 and 36 kDa, both with a pI of
5.5. 
<P>
These changes were absent in the CSF samples from the normal
cattle, from the clinically suspect cattle which were not confirmed
as BSE and from the experimentally challenged cattle in the
preclinical phase of infection.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Why">Why</A> does 14-3-3 protein work in new CJD test?</H3>
</CENTER>

Does it interact or bind specifically to prion protein, either in situ on
the cytoplasmic membrane, possibly modulating a function, or bind to rogue
conformer?  The other option is that 14-3-3 appears in CSF [only in CJD
dementias] merely as a result of generalized neuronal breakdown and has no
specific interaction with prion protein or plaque.  [This fits 14-3-3 in
recent stroke and viral encephalopathy CSF but not too well with other
dementias.]<P>
The 14-3-3 protein is highly unusual in structure with a alpha-helical
large channel.  It is ubiquitous [homologues in yeast, plants, etc] and
has an activating role in other systems, nothing to do with prevention or
repair of neuronal oxidative damage.

<HR><CENTER><H3>Kuru -- What <A NAME="really">really</A> happened?</H3>
</CENTER>Listserve 10.6.96
<P>

On the subject of cannibalism, which has
become deeply entrenched in this topic and which has little basis in
recorded observation. Collinge's new version is certainly one of the most detailed
I have seen:<P>
 
"Kuru was a disease mainly of young children and young women. But it was
women and children who were involved in the cannibalistic feasts and their
preparation. The men ate muscle rather than brains.
"The pathogenicity of the agent is extremely high in this situation.
Everybody who sits down at one of those feasts dies of kuru."<P>
 
In reality, these feasts were not observed (by Gajdusek or any other
visitor), but surmised. The nature of the feasts, lists of participants and
other details were not collected. Despite this lack of any first hand
evidence, these feasts are recorded in numerous scientific papers with a
level of detail that increases with each repetition. They can not be relied
on as accurate evidence of CJD risk factors.<P>
 
What WAS observed was the ritual preparation of deceased tribal members. The
skin, flesh and contents were removed from the skull with a range of stone
and wooden (bamboo?) implements. By custom this was carried out by women and
pre-pubescent boys. The gruesome black-and-white footage I have seen shows
the process in some detail on what appears to be a disinterred corpse, not a
fresh corpse, and in a manner that is not in the least reminiscent of food
preparation - the object of attention was the skull, whilst the flesh and
brain fell unheeded to the ground.<P>
 
It is clear that women and children (both shown in the footage) were exposed
to raw brain through lacerations to their hands, inhalation of spray and
ingestion from their hands. It appeared to me that the flesh was re-interred
and the bones taken elsewhere, as is common in Swat, Tibet, Venice or Greece
(all of which I have also observed) and any number of other contemporary
burial customs. Whilst it is possible that cannibilistic rituals took place,
there is no hard evidence for it and none whatsoever of the "men ate the
flesh and women at the brain" variety.
 <P>
It is my belief that this is a misinterpetation of burial custom and nothing
more. As this is not an area I have any particular expertise in, I will add
that there is a growing body of literature that disputes the existence of
any ritual human cannibalism, some of which details this particular example.
Reports of cannibalism (viz. Ceausescu, Idi Amin, the Aztecs, Native
Americans) tend to serve a political purpose.<P>
 
The last sentence, "everybody who sits down at one of these feasts dies of
kuru" is unsupportable. Rates of kuru were high, but it was not the leading
cause of death. Precise epidemiological evidence linking kuru to particular
forms of exposure is not available, but certainly indicates that the
majority of those exposed to ritual preparation did NOT die from kuru.<P>
 
Regarding the question of whether the Fore engaged in ritual cannibalism, I
think the people who have objected to that statement have done so more
because of the negative image this gives to indigenous New Guineans than
because the evidence of cannibalism is lacking. Shirley Lindenbaum and Robert
Glasse collected detailed anthropological information about the practice,
based on interviews with the Fore. <P>Vincent Zigas, the physician who first
observed Kuru before Gajdusek's arrival on the scene, tells a number of
stories in his memoirs, titled "The Laughing Death," including an instance in
which he claims to have personally witnessed an instance of cannibalism, and
a conversation with a Fore native who matter-of-factly describes eating an
enemy and complains that he didn't taste very good. He also describes an
occasion when he was entertaining a foreign visitor and served a meal of
sheep's brain. According to the story, Zigas's native cook ran out of sheep
brain and took an autopsied human Kuru brain, sliced it up and was ready to
start frying the pieces when Zigas happened to step into the kitchen and
stopped what was happening!<P>
 
When questions were raised regarding whether cannibalism occurred, Gajdusek
reacted with anger and irritation, and pointed out that the people who raised
the questions were people who were not on the scene to observe and had no
basis for questioning what he considered to be incontrovertibly established
fact. Furthermore, the fact that Kuru started to die out a decade after the
New Guinean authorities began enforcing a ban against cannibalism provides
strong evidence that the practice was occurring.<P>
 
That said, however, Gajdusek has maintained for a long time that the actual
ROUTE of exposure was probably not through oral ingestion but through
handling of infected tissue, cuts in the hands, etc.

<CENTER><H3>Collinge <A NAME="on">on</A> risk to British population</H3>
</CENTER>

London Observer Service (Oct 12, 1996) -- John Collinge's mice are doing
nicely....
But... Collinge's message has a startingly gloomy content.  [Survival of
the mice] would
simply mean that the species barrier between cow and human is sufficiently
strong to prevent
that transmission happening within the average lifetime of a mouse. It may
still occur over a
longer period.
 
This is almost certainly the case, adds Collinge. "The new cases of CJD in
humans have a
startlingly uniform pathology: early age of onset, psychiatric disturbances
and a relatively
long period before death occurs, about 14 months. This indicates a single
cause -- BSE --
though we cannot yet say whether it will lead to 20 or 100,000 deaths a year."
 
Collinge says his research has revealed that about half the British
population has a genetic mix of
brain prions that should enable them to resist BSE. "Of course, that leaves
out half the
population who do not have the right brain prion mix, and they will be the
ones who provide
the pool of victims."
-----
Listserve Commentary 10.8
96
<P>

I disagree with the conclusions of last paragraph, which I take as saying
met/val or val/val or some such at codon 129 won't be in "the pool of
victims."  Collinge was just trying here to get a little of the bad news in
the open while still offering some hope, so as not to throw the populace
into a panic.<P>

 
Instead, I think we are simply seeing progressive CJD (early age of onset,
rapid decline) at the start of the epidemic in the most susceptible genetic
background.   Other populations would be looking at later onset, different
symptoms, and slower progression of the disease.  For example, they could
look like cases of sporadic CJD rather than v-CJD.<P>

 
 As I read the middle-ground scenario in Table 30 in Dealler's "Lethal
Legacy", 142,000,000 individual meals were eaten in which 10,000 or more
lethal infectious units (IU)were present in that serving.  As I read Table
29, again the middle-ground scenario, 18,000,000 people would have been
exposed to a cumulative dose of 1,000,000 IUs or more.  I also see in Table
5 significant numbers of under-2 calves showing BSE whereas Anderson et al
quote an experiment with cows receiving 330 grams intra-cerebrally first
showing symptoms at 40 months.<P>

 
I would expect codon 129 to only modulate some parameters of the illness,
not be all or none: For example, D178N  M129 has a mean age of onset of 49 years, mean duration
of 15 months, and presents in decreasing frequency dementia, ataxia,
myoclonus, spongiform cerebral cortex, ...
 
whereas  D178N  V129  has a mean age of onset of 45 years, mean duration of
22 months, and presents in decreasing frequency insomnia, dysautonomia,
ataxia, myoclonus, and thalamic nuclei atrophy.
 
Sporadic and iatrogenic CJD are similarly enhanced, but by no means
exclusively so, I recall in homozygotes over heterozygotes.

<CENTER><H3>CJD Therapy with anti-sense prion <A NAME="mRNA">mRNA</A>?</H3>
</CENTER>Listserve 10.9.96
<P>

This is a good therapeutic proposal that could easily be tested in mice. The experiment may be under way as we speak.  Promising results have been published with other diseases.  There is no technical problem is producing anti-sense oligonucleotides in quantity.

A variation on this is to permanently knock out _one_  copy, more or less,  of the prion gene (ie on one chromosome).<P>


On the hopeful side, anti-prion mRNA, meaning mRNA complementary to the normally transcribed strand, would be expected to accomplish down-regulation of prion mRNA promoter and lower prion production itself and so abnormal prion.   Gene dosage experiments, such as the 7x experiments of Prusiner, suggest that higher prion levels lead to exaggerated susceptibility and more rapid course of disease.  Transfection under the control of a friendly promoter might produce a steady flow in situ of the desired oligonucleotides.  Prion turnover is fairly rapid so buildup might be slowed.  Even a total absence of prion takes some years to bring symptoms, so knocking back to half the steady-state level might be the best of both worlds.<P>


On the less hopeful side,  Collinge noted that prion mRNA is produced constitutively in adults; however, this is not true in neurodevelopment, as Prusiner discusses in the AnnRevMicrob 48 1994.  In other words, cells have the potential to respond by some feedback mechanism to curtailment of prion production by trying harder (ie, more transcription starts, more translations per mRNA, etc), maybe resulting in the same end levels of production, especially over time.  Then there is the matter of the blood/brain barrier, establishing the safety of any intervention, and early identification of people who might benefit.<P>


Remember that while the prion gene is present in only one copy per chromosome, some other gene of unknown function is already producing mRNA rather complementary to the prion anti-sense strand. Your  prion anti-sense oligonucleotides might interfer with this gene by binding to its anti-sense strand, with unkown effects.

<P>

No cow data.  From Dealler's 'Lethal Legacy', mouse and sheep spleen were at 100% final infectivity [800,000,000 and 10,000 IU, resp.] and steady (flat) 30% of the time into the incubation period for displaying overt symptoms. <P>
 
Mouse brain: infectious titre increased steadily beginning at 40% of the incubation period but peaked and flattened at 75% at 10,000,000,000 lethal infectious units injected to the same species [IU] per gram.  <P>

Sheep brain: increased steadily with flatter slope with the earliest data point shown 65% of incubation period, so from 10,000 IU per gram to 120,000.  Mink, goat, hamsters data is given as well.<P>

In the UK, 142,000,000 individually lethal meals have been served (each over 10,000 IU) as per Table 30, page 299.
<P>

We don't eat mouse brain or spleen in the US but I hope they are disposing of these animals properly (incinerating under controlled conditions).  One asymptomatic mouse has enough units to kill every mammal on the planet.

<CENTER><H3>Controversy over HSP <A NAME="binding">binding</A> to prion 180-2I study</H3>
</CENTER>
<I>A recent paper (J. Virology July 1996) used the prion gene fused to glutathione transferase as bait in a yeast reporter system, recovering against a human clone library the heat-shock protein 60.  A Swiss expert responds to questions on this paper.</I>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Q1.  The authors suggest that fusion to a highly soluble and over-expressed carrier protein may overcome problems of insolubility and quantity; one hopes the intact prion would hang off this as an independent and native domain.  Do you see good prospects for this?
<P>

Q2.  The authors then look at a set of deletion mutants of the prion protein, still fused, concluding that 180-210 was the binding recognition region for heat-shock protein 60.  I doubted whether some of the deletion fragments would retain much in the way of native 3D structure.  Do you think from your work that 180-210 alone would retain the relation between the alpha-helical structures?
<P>

<B>Answer: </B>The J. Virol. paper will cause a lot of confusion; the hsp60/PrP interaction is a pure artifact. Hsp60 is a typical
cytoplasmic protein and does not occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, where
PrP folds and is processed (The authors give a strange reference for the
occurrence of Hsp60 in the ER, but I have talked to several experts in the
field and everybody has confirmed that there is no hsp60 in the ER).
Therefore, Hsp60 will never be in contact with PrP in the living cell.
<P>

Moreover, heat shock proteins such as hsp60 are often found as unspecific
binding proteins during screening with the yeast two-hybrid system.
I do not believe that the GST-fusion protein strategy will provide a useful
tool to obtain large quantities of the whole PrP protein for its structure
determination, since efficient cleavage and further purification of cleaved
PrP will presumably be at least as difficult as trying to express PrP
alone.
<P>
With regard to the native structure of the PrP segments in the GST fusions,
it is not at all clear whether PrP's disulfide bond was formed in the
constructs. However, the disulfide is absolutely essential for the native
fold of the protein. Finally I do not believe that the segment 180-210 can
fold to a native-like conformation, since 50 % of the last helix and the
essential disulfide are lacking.
<P>
Coexpression of Hsp60 in conjunction with PrP in the cytoplasm will also
never lead to native PrP, since disulfide bonds cannot form in the
cytoplasm of any cell due to the reducing conditions in the cytosol.

<CENTER><H3>The transgenic mouse experiment: what does it <A NAME="mean">mean</A>?</H3>
</CENTER>
Survival of Collinge's transgenic  mice would simply mean that the species barrier between cow
>and human is sufficiently strong to prevent that transmission happening within
>the average lifetime of a mouse. It may still occur over a longer period.
<P>

The toxic effect of the infectious agent is
greatly modified by the amino acid sequence of the normal prion protein. This
sequence of the normal prion protein clearly influences not only the species
barrier, but also the pattern of damage. Therfore the incubation times of the
transgenic Collinge mice depends not solely on the cattle-human species barrier,
but also in the interaction of the normal but foreign human prion proteins with
other components of the mouse.
<P>
 Because the influence of the species barrier is
only important at the beginning of the exponential process, it may be of minor
importance for the incubation time. This was exactly, what John Collinge and
many others overlooked with the interpretation of his results with BSE infected
transgenic mice with prion proteins of human and mice origin.
<P>
 It is very
important to differentiate between the probabilities of heterologue or homologue
conversion reactions. We will be unable to interpretate the running Collinge
experiment because we do not know the influence of the second interaction, as
it was impossible to interpretate the first Collinge experiment as he does,
because not the species barrier but instead the homologue conversion reactions were the
determining factors.
<P>

On the possible roles and effects of the glycosylation of
the prion protein: it seems to not influence the conversion of the normal to the protease-resistent form
Incorrect glycosylation may cause artificial results of the Collinge experiments with
transgenic mice.   Glycosylation influences the transport of
the cellular prion protein to the surface. Key references:

***  Harrington published his 3rd paper in two weeks on the 14-3-3 test
[formerly protein 190, 191] for CJD and BSE, using cerebralspinalfluid, in
the Oct 3  [?} Lancet.  First author was RG Will.  They looked at last at
CSF from v-CJD, getting satisfactory diagnostic results especially for CSF
samples that had been stored properly.  The test is likely to be a useful
diagnostic adjunct but is probably not going  to work too early on (nor be
suitable for mass screenings).<P>
 
Harrington has looked at CSF from cows with TSEs {test works quite well]
but not from cows with specifically BSE.  Oddly the test was first
published in 1986 [no anti-14-3-3 then].  I don't know what is normally
done in a slaughterhouse with CSF or whether it would be practical to take
samples on the farm.<P>
 
A week earlier, also in Lancet, a German group reported similar work on
14-3-3 and also used NSE, neuron specific enolase as a marker of CJD.
Enolase is a boring cytoplasmic enzyme from glycolysis; evidently there is
some isozyme specific to neural tissue.  It wasn't quite as useful as
14-3-3.  The great thing about NSE enolase is that there is a simple
commercial test kit already out there, from Sandoz[?]<P>
 
The presence of both proteins in CSF is attributed in all papers to brain
cell death, not to speciific association with prion protein.  Somehow,
their presence is quite specific to CJD.<P>
 
*** Prusiner's group has knocked apoE and GAFT in mice and found no impact
on the course of TSE.  This is progress.  Apolipoprotein E has a big role
in Alzheimer's and the e4 allele was also supposed to presuppose towards
CJD.  Glial fibrillary acidic protein has to do with astrocytic gliosis,
also proposed in CJD pathogenicity.  August 96 Neurolgy pg 449.<P>
 
***Japanese group sequenced prion gene promoter in rat.  Some exons outside
the ORF.  They say normal role of prion protein must be that of a
"house-keeping" gene, from binding sites for Sp-1, AP-1, and AP-2  but no
TATA, ie, the gene is consitutively expressed.<P>
 
Measuring prion mRNA in varying tissues, brain and placenta came out on
top.  Hmmm.<P>

*** Yet another octapeptide insertion family has been found in a
Ukranian-US family.  Here it is a penta-repeat R2 R2 R2 R2 R3  _without_

Genes Dev 10: 1736-50 (1996)

Transgenic mice overexpressing approximately eightfold the mouse (Mo) prion
protein
(PrP) gene carrying the P102L mutation of GSS developed neurodegeneration
between 150
and 300 days of age, while controls expressing the wild-type MoPrP-A
transgene at the same
level remained healthy. Mice overexpressing the wild-type MoPrP-A transgene
were highly
susceptible to inoculated mouse prions, exhibiting abbreviated scrapie
incubation times of 45
days.
<P>
 After crossing the mutant transgene onto a null (Prnp 0/0)
background, the resulting
Tg(MoPrP-P101L)Prnp 0/0 mice displayed a highly synchronous onset of
illness at 145
days of age, which was shortened to 85 days upon breeding to homozygosity
for the transgene
array. Besides occasional PrP plaques and modest spongiform degeneration,
Tg(MoPrP-P101L) mice suffered from a myopathy and a peripheral neuropathy.
Disruption
of the wild-type MoPrP gene increased the number of PrP plaques and the
severity of
spongiform degeneration. 
<P>
Brain extracts prepared from spontaneously ill
transgenic mice
transmitted disease to Tg196/Prnp 0/0 mice, expressing low levels of the
mutant transgene.
Our results demonstrate that the presence of wild-type PrP genes, the level
of PrP transgene
expression, and the sequence of the transgene can profoundly modify
experimental prion
disease.

<I>As of Oct. 1996, Prof Budka  does not  have a web page. He has kindly rpovided a
referenced review of TSE research in Austria, cmainly oncerning neuropathology in human.s.</I>
<HR WIDTH="50%">


Research in Austria on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs,
prion diseases) is centered at the Department of Neuropathology and
Neurochemistry, Institute of Neurology, University of Vienna, in Professor
Herbert Budka's group. According to the background of this group, their
research concerns mainly the characterisation and pathogenesis of tissue
lesions in human TSEs.<P>

Prof. Budka leads an EU Biomed-1 <B>Concerted Action</B> (CA) on "The human prion
diseases: from neuropathology to pathobiology and molecular genetics" <SUP>1,2</SUP>
begun on Oct.1, 1994, and to expire on Dec.31, 1996.
<P>
 It
networks almost 100 European neuropathological and basic research
laboratories dealing with neuropathologic diagnosis of, and tissue-based
research in, human TSEs. Two CA meetings were held in Vienna in Oct. 1995<SUP>3</SUP>
and in May/June 1996<SUP>4,</SUP> respectively; the latter meeting addressed the
highly topical issue of phenotypic variation in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in Europe. A final CA meeting will be held Dec.6-7, 1996, in Vienna.<P>

In two consensus reports, the CA has succeeded in defining criteria for
neuropathological diagnosis<SUP>5 </SUP>of, and tissue handling<SUP>6,7</SUP> in, human TSEs.
<P>

The first report  is important for diagnosing human TSEs under
generally accepted terms. The second  has greatly
contributed to alleviate fears about performing autopsies on patients suspected
to suffer from TSEs; autopsies are most important for a definite
diagnosis and are mandatory to identify the new variant of CJD recently
recognized in the UK and France. A subsequent similarly designed CA
proposal was submitted.<P>

In addition, Prof. Budka participates in the EU BIOMED-2 Shared Cost Action entitled 
"The study of prion propagation, pathogenesis, and intermammalian species
barriers in transgenic and other models" (Project Leader: Prof. J.
Collinge) which is in the process of starting; its first meeting will be
held in the second half of Oct. 1996.
<P>

Moreover, the Austrian Reference Center for Human Prion Diseases
(sterreichisches Referenzzentrum zur Erfassung und Dokumentation
menschlicher Prionen-Erkrankungen / RPE; head: Prof. H. Budka) was
recently established at the Institute of Neurology, University of Vienna 8.
It will coordinate surveillance of human TSEs in Austria. As first success,
we have identified the first Austrian case of CJD in a dura transplant
recipient, and one CJD family with a yet undescribed PRNP molecular genetic
constellation<SUP>9</SUP>.
<P>
Specific research topics investigated by Prof. Budka's group include the
following:
<P>

<B>1) CJD (human and experimental)</B>
<P>

An epidemiological study of CJD in Austria<SUP>10</SUP>, based on the nationwide
collection of neuropathologically diagnosed, i.e. definite CJD cases,
showed a gradual increase of diagnosed CJD in recent years; in 1995, the
mortality rate was 1.25 per million inhabitants which is the highest so far
observed in Europe. Moreover, an update for the first half of 1996 gives an
estimated rate for 1996 of 1.7 per million<SUP>9</SUP>. These data are important
because Austria is a BSE-free country; the high CJD incidence is attributed
to improved surveillance due to generally increased awareness of
neurologists and the high autopsy rate in Austria<SUP>11,12</SUP>.
<P>

The previously described conjugal occurrence of JCD in an Austrian couple
was not confirmed by modern immunocytochermical detection of the prion
protein (PrP)<SUP>13</SUP>. This is an important argument against speculations on a
possibility of environmental human-to-human transmission of CJD.
<P>

Several other studies have addressed, or are in progress to elucidate, the
development of tissue pathology in TSEs: neuropathological overviews<SUP>14-16</SUP>;
the presence of peculiar tubulovesicular structures which are specific to
TSEs<SUP>17</SUP>; the type and pattern of PrP deposition in a large series<SUP>18-20</SUP>
which is an important point of reference when considering comparison with
the newly recognised CJD variant in the UK; and the PrP deposition in the
brain stem which might give some hints on spread from a possible infectious
origin<SUP>21</SUP>. The distribution of parvalbumin positive neurons in brain
correlates with hippocampal and temporal cortical pathology in CJD<SUP>22</SUP>.
<P>
Studies on experimental CJD showed that neuroaxonal dystrophy is an
important part of the neuropathology of TSEs<SUP>23</SUP>. Another report on the
sequential development of tissue pathology correlated with PrP deposition
in experimental CJD is in preparation (Kordek et al).
<P>


<B>2) Gerstmann Strussler-Scheinker disease (GSS)</B>
<P>

The original Gerstmann family of Austria has been recently rediscovered and
agreed to pedigree updating and clinical, neuropathological, and
molecular genetic studies<SUP>24</SUP>. The classical P102L mutation was confirmed in
the PrP gene (PRNP)<SUP>25</SUP>. A change in phenotype from the classic ataxic to a
CJD-like dementing type was observed in a recent patient; comparative
molecular analysis showed that the PRNP genotype was identical at codon 129
(M/M homozygosity) in both phenotypes<SUP>24</SUP>. This means that additional
factors (other genes? environmental?) determine phenotypic expression in
this inherited TSE.
<P>

Another study described the ultrastructural neuropathology of GSS<SUP>26</SUP> which
includes also tubulovesicular structures<SUP>27</SUP>. Microglia has been found as an
important constituent of PrP plaques<SUP>28</SUP>.
As in Alzheimer's disease, paired helical filaments dissociate from amyloid
formation<SUP>29</SUP>.

<B>3) Kuru</B><P>

By cooperation with P. Brown's and D. C. Gajdusek's group at the NIH in
Bethesda, MD, USA, one of the apparently last sets of archival Kuru brain
specimens could be investigated with modern neuropathological methods
including immunocytochemistry for PrP<SUP>30,31</SUP>. This is important because the
new CJD variant in the UK and France has been considered to share
clinicopathological characteristics with Kuru.<HR>

</CENTER>Listserve comment 10.5.96
<P>

Cow and sheep herds in the US may
already distributing a form of TSE, chronic wasting disease,
 into wild, never-captive deer and elk in northern
Colorado and southern Wyoming, by local newspaper accounts at a
hard-to-believe 1% level.  It is absolutely imperative that hunters not use
these brains for hand-tanning of hide or sausage, whatever the origin of
the TSE. They have gotten really poor advice so far by Fish & Game and the
hunting season is underway.<P>

 This should not be confused with the older situation where unsupplemented
captive deer acquired a scrapie-like condition on fenced  former sheep
range in Colorado.  Nor should it be confused with the captive elk with CWD
from the Dakotas this year, which may have received bovine-based protein
supplements.   I have an additional concern about bison, being even closer
to cattle genetically, but have not heard any reports.<P>
 
I would personally speculate that CWD is cattle-to-deer/elk rather than
sheep-to deer/elk because sheep would not have had supplement prior to
turn-out.  CWD is a newly reported condition; US scrapie has been around
since the 1940's in many states.  Whatever the origin, many questions are
raised on horizontal and vertical transmission, vectors, and outdoor
stability of agent.<P>
 
This is a difficult situation for  APHIS, whether or not to conduct (much
less publish) lab animal _strain studies_  on CWD, as these have the
potential for affixing the origin to public land livestock, whether sheep
or cattle.<P>
 
I also forgot to mention Norway, which has taken draconian measures to
knock down the recent upsurge they have seen in scrapie (one supposes
contaminated UK meal).  There has been  grave concern that this will get
into reindeer from sheep  aggressively grazed on common public lands, which
has all sorts of racial overtones already with regards to native Lapp
people.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Relative">Relative</A> risk factors for sporadic CJD because of codon129. </H3>
</CENTER>Listserve comment 10.5.96
<P>
 A doubling is seen for met-met frequency. There is not necessarily any direct relevence for v-CJD here. Note that
"sporadic CJD" could actually lump, say, 3-4 separate causes [hypothetical
example: spontaneous conversion, somatic mutation, pig-CJD, scrapie-CJD].
These could each have their own very distinct allele statistics -- we are
only looking at the resultant sum.<P>
 
The data were from 1990-93 so now there could be enough new sporadic cases
for 1994-96 to perhaps look for any change to allele predisposition.<P>
 
There is another common polymorphism in Japanese, at codon 220, 6% level.
Not found at all in large series of Italians.  It is difficult to say
whether any polymorphism is truly non-disease causing.  These are all
genetic drift, not Darwinian-selected.<P>

The codon 129 paper is Hum Genet 98: 259-64 (1996):
<P>
 
Abstract: <BR>
...We have determined the frequencies of
predisposing mutations and allelic variants in PRNP and their relative
contributions to
disease. Systematic PRNP genotype analysis was performed on suspected CJD
cases referred to
the National Surveillance Unit in the UK over the period 1990-1993.
 
Inspection of 120
candidate cases revealed 67 patients with definite and probable CJD, based
on clinical and
neuropathological criteria. No PRNP mutations were detected in any of the
remaining 53
patients assessed as "non-CJD". A disease-associated mutation in the PRNP
gene was identified
in nine (13.4%) definite and probable cases of CJD, a reliable estimate of
the incidence of
PRNP-related inherited CJD based on a prospective epidemiological series.
<P>
 
Within the group
of sporadic CJD patients (lacking PRNP mutations), we confirmed that the
genotype
distribution with respect to the common methionine/valine (Met/Val)
polymorphism at codon
129 within PRNP was significantly different from the normal Caucasian
population. The
incidence of Met homozygosity at this site was more than doubled and
correlated with increased
susceptibility to the development of sporadic CJD. Unlike other recent
studies, Val
homozygosity was also confirmed to be a significant risk factor in sporadic
CJD, with the
relative risks for the three genotypes Met/Met: Val/Val:Met/Val being 11:4:1.

An algorithm for prediction of conserved secondary structure of single-stranded RNA is
presented. For each RNA of a set of homologous RNAs, optimal and suboptimal secondary
structures are calculated and stored in a base-pair probability matrix. A multiple sequence
alignment is performed for the set of RNAs. The resulting gaps are introduced into the
individual probability matrices. These homologous probability matrices are summed to give a
consensus probability matrix emphasizing the conserved secondary structure elements of the
RNA set. Thus the algorithm <b>combines the advantages of thermodynamic structure prediction
by energy minimization with the information obtained from phylogenetic alignment of
sequences. </b>   
<p>
The algorithm is applied to three examples. The REV-responsive element of HIV,
the structure of which is well known from the literature, was chosen to test the algorithm.
The second example is the 3' terminal segment of genomic single-stranded RNAs of cucumber
mosaic viruses; a structure similar to that of the related brome mosaic virus was expected
and was confirmed. The third example is the prion-protein mRNA from different organisms;
the structure of this mRNA is not known. <b>By application of the algorithm highly conserved
hairpins were found in the prion-protein mRNA. </b>


<B>Introduction</B>
<P>

<P>
PrP is the major component of prions (for review see Prusiner, 1994), which cause several neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals, including scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in man. During prion infection, an abnormal isoform of PrP, in the case of scrapie designated PrP Sc , is produced from the cellular isoform of PrP C , which is encoded by a chromosomal gene, by an unknown process. In spite of intensive studies, differences between the chemical compositions of PrP C and PrP Sc could not be found (Stahl et al., 1993). Thus, a mere conformational change as the origin of the transformation of PrP C into PrP Sc is an attractive model (for review see Prusiner, 1994). It might be that putative structural elements in the PrP mRNA influence the kinetics of sequential folding of the protein during translation, and that the process of infection acts via those structural elements. A potential stemloop structure in one PrP mRNA, i.e. that of man, has been discussed (Wills & Hughes, 1990). 
<P>
If, however, structural elements of the PrP mRNA are considered as functionally relevant for the development of all prion diseases, this feature must be found in every species that is susceptible to this class of disease. Therefore the new algorithm will be applied to check PrP mRNA for evolutionarily conserved secondary structures.

<P>
<B>Prediction of structural elements in mRNA of prion protein</B>
<P>

From the EMBL data bank, 23 PrP mRNA sequences of the following species were available: three rodents (mouse, hamster, rat), two ruminants (cattle, sheep), the human and 17 non-human primates consisting of four apes (gorilla, chim-panzee, gibbon, orangutan), seven old-world mon-keys (colobus, presbytis, baboon, mandrill, rhesus macaque, Macaca arctoides, African green monkey), and six new-world monkeys (spider, squirrel, capuchin, aotes, marmoset, titi). Calculations of individual secondary structures of these molecules with the programs RNAfold and LinAll revealed that thermodynamically stable elements of sec-ondary structure are located mainly in the 5' region including the ORF. In contrast, the 3' UTR with a lower G + C content (41% G + C versus 53% G + C in the ORF of the hamster sequence) is mainly single stranded. As examples, the calculated secondary structures of human and hamster PrP mRNAs are shown in Figure 5.
<P>
 Alignment of the 23 sequences with CLUSTAL V (Higgins & Sharp, 1988; Higgins, 1994) showed considerable homology in an 1100 nt fragment (individual sequences starting between nt -42 and -10 and ending at nt 788 to 1039; numbering relative to the start of the ORF). These fragments that contain the ORF were chosen for further studies. They have a length of 735 to 795 nt and showed a high degree of homology (74 to 97%). The secondary structure distributions of the individual fragments were calculated with RNAfold at 50C. With the alignment mentioned above, the consensus base-pair probability matrix was calculated and is presented as dot plot in Figure 6.    
<P>
Surprisingly, the dot plot shows that PrP mRNAs contain conserved structural elements at only very few positions despite both the high degree of sequence conservation and the high degree of base-pairing as predicted for the individual PrP mRNAs (Figure 5). From this dot plot we identified as candidates of conserved structural elements five hairpins (HP A to E); their occurrence in the different organisms is listed in Table 1. Only HP C is present in all sequences and shows a high probability of base-pairing in most sequences. Owing to nucleotide exchanges the detailed structure of the HP C stem differs between the groups of species (Figure 7); a tendency exists, however, to preserve or to restore all base-pairs. In particular the loop of HP C is highly conserved and has the sequence 5'-ACCHCA-3' with H being a pyrimidine, except in the capuchin and the marmoset sequences. HP C is located at nt 140 to 165 (nt 149 to 174 for the ruminants) relative to the start of the ORF. <B>On the amino acid level the triplet 5'-CCH-3' of the HP C loop represents the first amino acid of the octarepeat region</B>, which consists of five nearly perfect tandem repeats of eight amino acids.

Figure 6. Consensus dot plot of 23 PrP mRNA fragments including the ORF. The individual base-pair dot plots were calculated with RNAfold at 50C and overlaid according to the alignment produced by CLUSTAL. Size of dots is proportional to the cubic power of the base-pair probability (a = 3, b = 1); thus helices of low probability are suppressed. Hatched areas show the gaps in the alignment; with increasing darkness gaps are present in an increasing number of sequences. Hairpins marked HP A to E have a high probability of base-pairing and are conserved.

According to the widely accepted prion hypothesis (Prusiner, 1982), formation of the isoform PrP Sc
from the cellular form PrP C is the basic event for prion infectivity and pathology. The molecular mechanism for the formation of PrP Sc is not known. There is no evidence for the existence of a specific nucleic acid essential for prion infectivity (for review see Riesner, 1991; Kellings et al., 1992), and no chemical difference between the two isoforms could be found (Stahl et al., 1993). Thus, it was suggested that the two PrP isoforms differ only in protein conformation (for review see Prusiner, 1994). Although the measurable differences in conformation between PrP C and PrP Sc are generated in a slow post-translational process, the possibility was never excluded that the nucleus for such a transition, which could comprise only a few PrP molecules, had already been formed during the translation process and that the PrP mRNA structure might have an influence on protein structure formation. 
<P>
In particular, a conservation of structural motifs among the PrP mRNAs of susceptible species may point to a potential biological function for these motifs. Even if PrP mRNA structure were not involved in the mechanism of infection or pathogenesis of prions it could play a part in the regulation of PrP C expression. In either case, this problem seemed attractive to us for the application for the new algorithm. The minimal energy foldings of the individual PrP mRNAs revealed a high degree of structure formation inside the ORF and a much less structured 3' UTR as a consequence of the higher A + U content. In contrast to both the high degree of secondary structure in the individual mRNA sequences and the high degree of sequence homology, only a very few structural elements were found to be conserved in the ensemble of PrP mRNAs. This feature appears remarkable if the properties of PrP mRNA are compared with those of CMV RNA. 
<P>
Although the sequence homology of all CMV RNAs was only 72 (213)%, a highly conserved over-all structure could be derived; nothing comparable was found in PrP mRNA in spite of 86(26)% homology in the ORF. Therefore, <B>we have to conclude that a detailed PrP mRNA structure like those shown in Figure 5 is not of biological importance, and only the evolutionarily conserved hairpin structures (HP A to E) should be considered.</B> Three of them (HP A to C) are located in the ORF in a cluster 5' of the octarepeat region, and two (HP D and E) are further downstream close to the stop codon.
<P>
 In earlier studies of the human PrP mRNA sequence (Wills & Hughes, 1990; Wills, 1992), it was proposed that the octarepeat region contains structural elements with possible relevance for development of prion diseases, and binding of cellular proteins to this region was reported (Schro der et al., 1994). In the context of evolutionary conservation these structures could not be confirmed. Therefore it is unlikely that those elements act as structural targets at the RNA level. While investigating RNA secondary structure conservation inside the coding region of mRNA, one has to take into account the influence of amino acid conservation. Is a conserved mRNA structural motif a mere coincidence of codon usage for the amino acid sequence? This could be tested either by looking for compensatory base exchanges in stem regions or by comparing the general codon usage of an mRNA with the codons used in the structural element. 
<P>
While conserving the amino acid sequence, compensatory base exchanges in a structural element are only possible if certain base-pairs are formed between wobble positions of codons. This is not the case with HP C (see symbols in Figure 7). An investigation of codon usage in HP C revealed that in the 5' part of the stem common codons are mostly used. In contrast, the 3' part of the stem, which contains three glycine codons, uses GGU in 70% of all codons although this codon is generally used below 30%. In addition, there is an obvious selection pressure for the wobble base in the first proline codon of the loop. It is coded by CCA in all 23 sequences despite approximately 20 % codon usage, whereas in the adjacent proline CCU, CCC and CCA are used. Therefore, we conclude that the conserved nucleic acid structures in the ORF are not a coincidence from the codon usage but are a product of selection for a nucleic acid structure. 
<P>
Among the five conserved hairpins, HP C is present with a high base-pairing probability in most of the studied sequences. In contrast to the slight variability of the HP C stem, its loop region is formed by the highly conserved sequence 5'-AC-CHCA- 3'. Thus the stem of HP C might be responsible only for exposing the conserved loop region from the global molecular structure, as was suggested for stem 1 of RRE (see above). The loop may serve as the essential target element for binding to cellular proteins or even to the infectious isoform of PrP. Another potential function of HP C (and of the other conserved hairpins) during the develop-ment of prion diseases and the formation of infectious PrP Sc might be correlated to the general influence of mRNA secondary structure on protein conformation.
<P>
 The in vivo folding of a polypeptide chain into its native three-dimensional structure is a sequential process (for review see Jaenicke, 1993). It was argued that the conformation of some proteins depends on the rate and kinetics of translation, which is influenced by the presence and stability of structural elements of the translated mRNA (Purvis et al., 1987). Translation initiation is most sensitive to structures close to the entry site of ribosomes (Kozak, 1989), but also structures located further 3' in the coding region still reduce translation efficiency (Liebhaber et al., 1992). A modulation of protein folding by translational pauses resulting from mRNA secondary structure and codon usage has been proposed for the MS2 coat protein of Escherichia coli (Guisez et al., 1993).The examples mentioned from the literature suggest that the conserved secondary structure elements in PrP mRNA might well affect translation and thereby the conformation of PrP.

<STRONG>Abstract</STRONG> 

Conformational changes in the prion protein (PrP) seem to be responsible for prion diseases. We have used
conformation-dependent chemical-shift measurements and rotational-resonance distance measurements to analyze the
conformation of solid-state peptides lacking long-range order, corresponding to a region of PrP designated H1. This region
is predicted to undergo a transformation of secondary structure in generating the infectious form of the protein. Solid-state
NMR spectra of specifically 13C-enriched samples of H1, residues 109-122 (MKHMAGAAAAGAVV) of Syrian hamster PrP,
have been acquired under cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning conditions. Samples lyophilized from 50%
acetonitrile/50% water show chemical shifts characteristic of a beta-sheet conformation in the region corresponding to
residues 112-121, whereas samples lyophilized from hexafluoroisopropanol display shifts indicative of alpha-helical
secondary structure in the region corresponding to residues 113-117. Complete conversion to the helical conformation was
not observed and conversion from alpha-helix back to beta-sheet, as inferred from the solid-state NMR spectra, occurred
when samples were exposed to water. Rotational-resonance experiments were performed on seven doubly 13C-labeled H1
samples dried from water. Measured distances suggest that the peptide is in an extended, possibly beta-strand,
conformation. These results are consistent with the experimental observation that PrP can exist in different conformational
states and with structural predictions based on biological data and theoretical modeling that suggest that H1 may play a key
role in the conformational transition involved in the development of prion diseases.

<STRONG>Introduction</STRONG>

Prion diseases arise through a posttranslational change to the prion protein, PrP (Borchelt et al., 1990; Prusiner, 1992).
These neurodegenerative illnesses are novel in that they can be transmitted by prions, proteinaceous agents apparently
devoid of nucleic acids (Meyer et al., 1991; Kellings et al., 1992), and because they are manifest in sporadic, inherited,
and infectious illnesses. The function of the normal cellular protein (PrPC), which is expressed ubiquitously on the surface
of neurons, is unknown. Gene-targeted mice in which the PrP gene has been disrupted appear to develop and live normally
(Beler et al., 1992), except that, unlike normal mice, they are resistant to infection by prions (Beler et al., 1993;
Prusiner et al., 1993). In contrast, transgenic mice expressing a mutant PrP transgene encoding a proline to leucine
substitution known to cause Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker disease in humans spontaneously develop a transmissible
prion disease (Hsiao et al., 1990, 1994).

PrPC is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein found mostly at the cell surface, from which it can be released by
phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (Stahl et al., 1987), unlike the pathogenic isoform (PrPSc), which accumulates
within the cell (Taraboulos et al., 1990). Many lines of evidence have converged to suggest that the conversion of PrPC into
PrPSc does not involve a covalent change (Stahl et al., 1993), but is conformational in nature (Pan et al., 1993; Cohen et
al., 1994). This posttranslational event gives rise to different physical properties (Borchelt et al., 1990). PrPC is soluble
in nonionic detergents and is protease sensitive. PrPSc is insoluble and proteolysis cleaves only the N-terminal third of the
sequence, leaving a protease-resistant core termed PrP 27-30, which retains infectivity; in the presence of Sarkosyl, this
rearranges into amyloid rods that stain with Congo red and show green-gold birefringence (Prusiner et al., 1983;
McKinley et al., 1991). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and CD have demonstrated that PrPC is rich in
alpha-helices and virtually devoid of beta-sheet (Pan et al., 1993), unlike PrPSc and PrP 27-30, which have a high
beta-sheet content (Caughey et al., 1991; Pan et al., 1993; Safar et al., 1994).

Secondary structure analysis based on sequence homology and molecular modeling predicted that PrPC contains four
alpha-helices, designated H1-H4. Biological data suggest that it is the first two of these helices that convert to beta-sheet in
PrPSc (Huang et al., 1994, 1996). When peptides corresponding to these four regions were synthesized, three of them
were found to have very low solubility in H2O, and FTIR, CD, and electron microscopy showed that they formed beta-sheets
and polymerized into fibrils (Gasset et al., 1992; Nguyen et al., 1995a). However, CD and solution NMR studies in organic
solvents, such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), or detergents, such as SDS, have shown that H1 and H2, as well as peptides
corresponding to longer segments of PrP containing these regions, can form alpha-helices (Zhang et al., 1995). Thus, these
synthetic peptides seem to be able to model some aspects of the conformational pluralism that are exhibited by PrP.

To date, both the cellular and scrapie isoforms of PrP have proven intractable to high-resolution spectroscopic or
crystallographic study. PrPSc is particularly problematic because it is insoluble and forms aggregates lacking long-range
order (Nguyen et al., 1995b). Solid-state NMR is one of the few techniques able to answer specific structural questions
about peptides or proteins in immobile states, such as aggregated peptides and membrane proteins, through the use of
chemical-shift information and specific distance measurements. We have used solid-state NMR to gain structural
information about an aggregated form of the first of the predicted structural regions, H1 (residues 109-122 of the Syrian
hamster PrP sequence).

It has been shown that 13C chemical shifts are highly correlated with peptide secondary structure in the solid state
(Kricheldorf & Muller, 1983; Saito, 1986). We have employed cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CPMAS)
techniques (Pines et al., 1973; Schaefer & Stejskal, 1976) to determine chemical shifts of specifically 13C-labeled H1
peptides, and used this information to gain insight into the overall secondary structure of these peptides. 13C CPMAS spectra
can yield isotropic chemical shifts with relatively high accuracy. These chemical shifts predominately reflect the local
conformations of the peptides and are largely independent of the identity of neighboring residues. Conformations of
alphaR-helix, alphaL-helix, omega-helix, 310 helix, and beta-sheet can be distinguished on the basis of chemical shift.
Chemical shifts of amino acid carbons in the solid state in a beta-sheet conformation differ by as much as 8 ppm from those
in an alpha-helix (Saito, 1986). Similarly strong correlations have been seen in solution (Spera & Bax, 1991; Wishart &
Sykes, 1994), and reproduced in recent theoretical work (de Dios et al., 1993). By using CPMAS to determine isotropic
shifts, meaningful information about secondary structure of aggregated proteins can be gained.

We have also used internuclear distance-measurement techniques with doubly 13C-labeled peptides to determine specific
distances. Types of secondary structure can be distinguished and structural details discovered best through the measurement
of a large number of distances. Strong homonuclear dipolar couplings in solids prevent the use of solution-state proton NMR
experiments, such as NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979) and TOCSY (Braunschweiler & Ernst, 1983; Davis & Bax, 1985). Thus,
alternative techniques must be employed to determine distances in solids, and recently many such techniques have been
designed (Raleigh et al., 1988; Gullion & Schaefer, 1989; Tycko & Dabbagh, 1990; Ishii & Terao, 1995).
Rotational-resonance (R2) magnetization exchange (Raleigh et al., 1988; Levitt et al., 1990) is a homonuclear
distance-measurement technique that has been applied to several biological systems (Creuzet et al., 1991; Smith et al.,
1994b), including one amyloid system (Lansbury et al., 1995). For carbon labels, the technique can be used to measure
distances of about 7 , with no R2 effects indicating that the distance between a pair of 13C labels is greater than about 7 .

<STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG>

From our distance measurements and chemical-shift data, it appears that H1 forms an extended, primarily beta-sheet-like
conformation when lyophilized from AcN/H2O or dried from pure H2O. When lyophilized from HFIP, incomplete conversion
to the second conformation and overlapping residues make distance measurement more difficult. However, the
chemical-shift data from the HFIP form are consistent with the presence of an alpha-helix. This alpha-helical conformation
appears to be only metastable, and reverts to an extended conformation when exposed to water vapor. The observed
conversion is consistent with earlier FTIR data for the peptides (Gasset et al., 1992). Additionally, the present study
defines the specific residues involved in secondary structure, and, interestingly, shows that the same sequence of residues
is involved in the alpha-helical or beta-sheet conformation. Structural predictions for the protein from molecular
modeling (Huang et al., 1994, 1996), and the hypothesis that the infectivity of PrP is the result of a conformational change
in H1 and surrounding regions of the protein (Cohen et al., 1994), are also consistent with the present study. Clearly,
caution is required when comparing results from this isolated peptide to the corresponding region of the entire PrP
molecule.

It may also be of interest to note that our results are similar to those of a solid-state NMR study of a portion of the Abeta
peptide found in amyloid deposits in the brains of patients of Alzheimer's disease. Data on the Abeta peptide residues 34-42
suggested a beta-sheet or bent beta-sheet conformation around a Gly-Gly bond (Lansbury et al., 1995).

The physical properties of the beta-sheet-rich PrPSc make it unlikely that high-resolution structural data will be
obtained by conventional crystallographic or solution NMR approaches. Thus, there is considerable promise for a method
such as solid-state NMR, capable of defining the local environment of individual atoms in a solid lacking long-range order
and measuring interatomic distances. At present, the major disadvantage of this approach to defining the structure of a
complex entity such as large peptide or protein is the substantial number of specifically labeled peptides required. Despite
this limitation, further studies of longer PrP peptides incorporating multiple putative sites of secondary structure, such as
peptide 90-145, containing both H1 and H2 (Zhang et al., 1995), are in progress. Eventually, it should be possible to
extend these investigations to the entire PrPSc molecule.

THE 'protein only' hypothesis' states that a modified form of normal prion protein triggers infectious neurodegenerative diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.  Prion proteins are thought to exist in two different conformations: the 'benign' prpc form, and the infectious 'scrapie form', PrPSc. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of prpc is essential for understanding the transition to PrPSc. <P>

The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the autonomously folding PrP domain comprising residues 121-231 (ref. 6) contains a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and three a-helices. This domain contains most of the point-mutation sites that have been linked, in human PrP, to the occurrence of familial prion diseases. The NMR structure shows that these mutations occur within, or directly adjacent to, regular secondary structures. The presence of a beta-sheet in PrP(121-231) is in contrast with model predictions of an all helical structure of prpc (ref. 8), and may be important for the initiation of the transition from prpc to PrPSc.<P>

	The NMR structure of PrP(121-231)  contains three a-helices and a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The approximate lengths of the helices are from residues 144 to 154, 179 to 193, and 200 to 217, and the lengths of the p-strands are from residues 128 to 131, and 161 to 164. The first turn of the second helix and the last turn of the third helix are linked by the single disulphide bond in the protein. The twisted V-shaped arrangement of these two longest helices forms the scaffold onto which the short beta-sheet and the first helix are anchored. At the present stage of refinement, all regular secondary-structure elements and the connecting loops are well defined, with the sole exception of residues 167 to 176. <P>

The polypeptide fold is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions in a core that contains side chains of the second helix (residues 179,180 and 184), the third helix (residues 203, 206,209, 210, 213 and 214), the beta-sheet (Val 161), the first, mostly hydrophilic, helix (Tyr 150), and three loop regions (residues 134, 137, 139, 141, 157, 158 and 198). With the exceptions of Ile 139, Ile 184 and Val 203, the residues of the hydrophobic core are invariant in the known mammalian prion protein sequences9 (Fig. 3a). Hydrophobic surface patches in PrP(121-231) are located near the ,B-sheet and the loop preceding the first helix. The surface of PrP(121231) is otherwise characterized by a markedly uneven distribution of positively and negatively charged residues.<P>

	Mature mouse prpc is a glycosylated 208-residue protein (codons 23-231, with deletion of codon 55 (ref. 9)) that is attached to the cell surface by means of a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchor at its carboxy-terminal Ser 231 (ref.10). It seems to be necessary for normal synaptic functionit (but see ref. 12), longterm survival of Purkinje neuronsi3, and the regulation of circadian activity rhythms and sleep. <P>

The segment of residues 109 - 218 was predicted to form a four-helix-bundle with helices at residues 109-122, 129-141, 178-191 and 202-218 (ref. 8), whereas prediction algorithms did not yield conclusive results for the segment 23-108, which contains the prior-characteristic octapeptide repeats. Attempts to express PrP(108-231) in the periplasm of Eschenchia coli resulted in proteolytic cleavage after residues 112, 118 and 120, whereas PrP(121-231) is stable against degradation in E. coli, folds cooperatively and reversibly at pH 7 , and is soluble at 1 mM concentration in distilled water between pH 4.0 and pH 8.5 (ref. 6). <P>

This segment also contains six of nine point-mutation sites in mature PrP that have been associated with familial prion diseases, as well as both glycosylation sites of PrP and its single disulphide bond. We therefore chose to use PrP(121-231) for the present NMR structure determination. This choice was also supported by the demonstration that the segment 81-231 of mouse PrP is sufficient for propagation of the prion disease in vivo i5, indicating that the C-terminal part of PrP is of special functional importance.
	In the context of the structure predictions for prpc (ref. 8), the beta-sheet in the NMR structure of PrP(121-231) is an unexpected feature. Evidence for the identification of the beta-sheet is shown in



<B>METHODS</B>. For the production of uniformly 15N-labelled and
15N/l3C-doubly iabeiled PrP(121231), cells of E coli containing plasmid pPrP-C3 were grown at room temperature.

Interstrand nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) connectivities are the <B>most direct NMR identifiers of antiparallel pieated-structure.</B> Considering the proposed increase of the beta-sheet content in PrP shown in transition from prpc to PrPs~ (refs 5,17), it is tempting to speculate that the short beta-sheet might be a <B>'nucleation site' for a conformational transition</B> that could include the loops connecting the beta-sheet to the first helix, which is predominantly hydrophilic and does not show amphipathic character. <P>

A systematic search of the Brookhaven data bank did not lead to the identification of other proteins with folds similar to PrP(121-231), and the relative orientation of the three helices in PrP(121-231) is clearly different from the proposed four-helix-bundle models.<P>

	Mapping onto the three-dimensional structure of PrP(121231) of sequence variability in mammalian prion proteins of residues important for the species barrier of prion disease transmission and for predisposition to familial prion diseases, and of biochemical properties of the prion proteins shows the following:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Invariant residues in mammalian prion protein sequences are not clustered within the regions of regular secondary structure, but form an important part of the hydrophobic core. 

<LI>The two glycosylation sites at Asn 181 and Asn 197 and the solvent-exposed, single Trp 145 are located on the negatively charged surface of the protein. 

<LI>All six residues of PrP(121231) for which mutation is believed to be associated with inherited prion diseases or predisposition to prion diseases are located in regular secondary structure elements or immediately adjacent to them, but none of these residues is located in the relatively isolated first helix. Three of these residues are part of the hydrophobic core, and three are located on the surface. They may therefore either destabilize the three-dimensional protein structure, or influence its ligand-binding properties. 
<LI>
As is generally observed for functionally related proteins from different species, residues in PrP(121-231) that are variant in mammalian prion protein sequences are solvent accessible. 

<LI>The disulphide bond 179-214 is highly shielded from solvent contact in the core of the protein.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


It has been proposed that the species barrier of prion disease transmission between mice and humans is caused by an altered prpSC binding site in PrPC, which involves residues from the segment 96-167 (ref. 20). There are eight sequence differences between mouse and human PrP within this segment, of which five are contained in PrP(121-231). Four of these differences are located within or adjacent to the first helix, which might thus be part of a single binding site for prpSC (Fig. 3a, b). <P>

The <B>dipolar character</B> of PrP(121-231) (Fig. lb, c) might stabilize an orientation of prpc with its positively charged surface, which also includes hydrophobic surface patches, towards the cell membrane. Both glycosylation sites, as well as the aforementioned species barrier related potential binding site for PrPsC, would then be located on the opposite, negatively charged surface. Further to these initial observations on possible structure-function correlations, we believe that the NMR structure of PrP(121-231) will provide a basis for more rational design of future in vitro and in vivo
	experiments on prion proteins and prion diseases.<HR>

<h4><center>A 3-D <A NAME="clue">clue</A> to mad cows<br>
</center></h4>
 Roger Highfield ... July 18 ... Daily Telegraph<P>

THIS IS the three-dimensional atomic structure of the brain protein
linked to CJD and mad cow disease that will provide important clues to
the cause of these and other spongiform diseases. <P>

Two professors at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology unveil in
the current issue of Nature the structure of an important part of the
mouse variety of the "prion" protein, thought to be necessary for the
disease to take grip. Profs Kurt Wthrich and Rudi Glockshuber have
discovered the twists and turns in the atomic structure of the prion
protein by the use of a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. <P>

"Discovering the structure provides a new basis for biological and
medical research into prions and prion diseases," said Prof Glockshuber.
The prion idea is controversial, since it marks a biological heresy - an
infective agent without any genetic material. Proponents believe that a
normal prion protein can be converted, irreversibly, into an abnormal
prion protein, and that this might happen when an abnormal protein comes
into contact with a normal one. <P>

Brain damage results from a molecular domino effect, when this single
abnormal molecule can convert normal versions to the abnormal -
insoluble - form, leading to the build-up of deposits. The Swiss study
will cast light on this puzzle, in particular help scientists find the
structural differences between the different forms of the protein. <P>

The investigators took a close look at part of the ubiquitous, cellular
form of the protein thought to be converted to the abnormal form in
disease. They showed that this domain contains a structure, known as the
beta-sheet, in addition to the expected structure called an alpha-helix,
which is linked with the development of the infectious form. <P>

Disease-causing mutations lie within the regions of regular structure or
directly adjacent to them, suggesting that the mutations may destabilise
the benign form of the prion protein, aiding its conversion to the
infectious agent.  <HR>


<blockquote><h3><center>3D <A NAME="Structure">Structure</A> of Normal Prion Protein Reported</center></h3>Deseret News Web 11 July 1996<p>

ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuters) -- Swiss scientists said Wednesday they had made a major breakthrough in research into causes of mad cow disease by discovering the three-dimensional shape of prions, a protein found in nerves and the brain. [This could allow strukctural and functional roles to be assigned to individual amino acids and alleles in the prion protein.]

<p>

The chemical structure of prions, one of more than 100,000 different proteins in the human body, has been known for some time but the physical form remained a mystery until now.


Scientists at Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) said mapping prions would allow researchers to hunt for changes in the structure of the proteins that may cause the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and a related brain-wasting disease in humans.

<p>

''Discovering the structure provides a new basis for biological and medical research into prions and prion diseases,'' biophysics professor Kurt Wuethrich told a news conference. 

Wuethrich and molecular biology professor Rudolf Glockshuber, who headed the research at ETH, said their findings would appear in a letter to the science journal Nature due for publication Wednesday. 

<p>

The two researchers said their work was based on a widespread hypothesis that a mutated type of prion causes BSE in cows, its human form Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and related diseases.

<p>

The ETH researchers were able to map the twisting shape of prions by using nuclear magnetic resonance, a technology that pinpoints the position of separate compunds making up the prion and therefore allows a composite picture to be drawn.

<p>

The prions mapped were normal ones taken from mice and are believed to be nearly identical to human prions. Abnormal prions were not examined because of technical barriers. 

However, Wuethrich and Glockshuber said having an accurate map of a normal prion would allow researchers to replace or alter each of its segments to discover whether a change produces disease. 

<p>

''Further research could then possibly show what kind of medicines would have to affect what part of a prion in order to treat the disease,'' Wuethrich said.


''Maybe this could lead to designing molecules to replace prion defects,'' Glockshuber added.
Both scientists said it was too early to say whether their findings would lead to a breakthough in treatment of degenerative brain diseases.<hr>

                                         Spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and
                                          Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are thought to be caused by a modified pathological form of a 'prion
                                          protein' present in normal individuals. Point mutations in certain parts of the prion protein
                                          may accelerate the conversion process. Riek et al. have taken a close look at the domain in

Prion diseases are assumed to be caused by the infectious isoform, PrP Sc , of a single cellular surface protein, PrP C . PrP Sc is an insoluble form of PrP C  and is believed to possess a different three-dimensional fold. It may propagate by causing PrP C to adopt its own infectious conformation by an unknown mechanism. Studies on folding and thermodynamic stability of  prion proteins are essential for understanding the processes underlying the conversion from PrP C to PrP Sc , but have so far been hampered by the low solubility of prion proteins in the absence of detergents. Here, we show that the amino-terminally truncated segment of mouse PrP comprising residues 121 to 231 is an autonomous folding unit. It consists predominantly of a-helical secondary structure and is soluble at high concentrations up to 1 mM in distilled water. PrP(121-231) undergoes a cooperative and completely reversible unfolding/refolding transition in the presence of guanidinium chloride with a free energy of folding of -22 kJ/mol at pH 7. The intrinsic stability of segment 121-231 is not in accordance with present models of the structure of PrP C and PrP Sc.  PrP(121-231) may represent the only part of PrP C with defined three-dimensional structure. 
<P>
The protein only hypothesis (Griffith, 1967) has turned out to be the most suitable working hypothesis for investigating the processes involved in the development and transmission of prion diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies). It proposes that the infectious agent, the prion, is a single protein, termed PrP Sc . PrP Sc appears to represent a modified form of a natural cellular surface protein of the host, PrP C (Prusiner, 1982). PrP Sc is likely to be chemically identical with PrP C (Stahl & Prusiner, 1991), but may possess a different three-dimensional structure (Pan et al., 1993). It may multiply by a PrP Sc -catalyzed conformational transition from PrP C to PrP Sc
(Prusiner, 1991). A large body of evidence including in vivo as well as in vitro experiments has been accumulated in the last few years supporting the protein only hypothesis (Prusiner, 1991; Weissmann, 1994, 1995). The known sequences of mammalian prion proteins are strikingly similar and pairs of sequences are generally more than 90% identical (Schatzl et al., 1995). The mature form of murine PrP C consists of 209 amino acids (Westaway et al., 1987) (corresponding to residues 23 to 231 in hamster PrP) and appears to be necessary for normal synaptic function (Collinge et al., 1994) and long-term survival of Purkinje neurons (Sakaguchi et al., 1996). PrP C has a single disulfide bond between residues 179 and 214, two N-glycosylation sites at residues 181 and 197 and is attached to the cellular surface via a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor at the carboxy-terminal serine 231 (Stahl & Prusiner, 1991)
<P>
<H4>Reversible Folding of N-terminally Truncated PrP 615</H4>

Attempts to model the three-dimensional structure of mammalian PrP C (23-231) revealed that numerous algorithms failed to predict secondary structures within the amino-terminal part of the protein (residues 23 to 108) including its characteristic, fivefold octapeptide repeat (Huang et al., 1994). However, plausible three-dimensional models for the carboxy-terminal segment of PrP comprising residues 108 to 218 could be elaborated (Huang et al., 1994, 1996; Kazmirski et al., 1995). These models predict that the segment 108-218 in PrP C is a four-helix bundle domain  whose first two helices are rearranged to a four-stranded, anti-parallel b-sheet in PrP Sc (Huang et al., 1994; Huang et al., 1996). A prerequisite for understanding the processes underlying the conversion of PrP C to PrP Sc is the knowledge of the thermodynamic stability of PrP C and the reversibility of PrP C folding. 
<P>
To study folding of the predicted four-helix bundle domain 108-218 of PrP C , we recombinantly expressed two segments of mouse PrP comprising residues 95 to 231 and 107 to 231 in Escherichia coli. Both segments were fused to the bacterial OmpA sequence for secretory periplasmic expression to allow formation of the single disulfide bond. Expression yielded large amounts of soluble protein in the periplasmic fraction. However, Edman sequencing revealed that the segments 95-231 and 107-231 were amino-terminally degraded in vivo. All cleavage sites were found within the predicted first helix of PrP C (amino acids 109 to 122) after residues 112, 118, and 120.

Positions within the predicted helix 1, where proteolytic cleavage of the segments 93-231 and 107-231 occurred in vivo, are marked by vertical arrows. In contrast to segments 93-231 and 107-231, the segment comprising residues 121 to 231 was stable against degradation. The disulfide bond (SS) between cysteine residues 179 and 214, both N-glycosylation sites (CHO) at residues 181 and 197, and the glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchor (GPI) at the carboxy-terminal residue 231 of natural PrP C are indicated. For efficient cleavage of the OmpA signal sequence by leader peptidase, a serine residue was inserted at the aminoterminus of the recombinant PrP fragments. To avoid a negative charge at the carboxy-terminal residue (Ser231), which is not present in natural PrP C due to the attachment of the GPl anchor, an additional serine residue was inserted before the stop codons, which is also present in unprocessed PrP. Recombinant PrP (121-231) thus contains an additional serine at the amino and carboxyterminus.<HR>

This suggested that the segment 121-231, which is resistant to degradation in the periplasm of E. coli, represents an intrinsically stable domain and that residues 108 to 120 are not part of this domain. When PrP(121-231) was directly fused to the OmpA signal sequence, expression yielded a soluble 13.3 kDa protein with homogeneous amino terminus. PrP(121-231) was purified to homogeneity in the absence of any detergents by anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography and gel filtration (Figure 2). HPLC analysis before and after reduction of purified PrP(121-231) with dithiothreitol revealed that the single disulfide bond was quantitatively formed (data not shown). PrP(121-231) is soluble at high concentrations up to 1 mM in distilled water and stable against aggregation between pH 4 and 8.5. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of puri-fied PrP(121-231) revealed two minima at 208 and 222 nm and a mean residue ellipticity of -15,600 deg cm 2 /dmol at 222 nm.
<P>
The data were evaluated by a six-parameter fit and normalized as described (Santoro & Bolen, 1988).intrinsically stable folding unit PrP(121 to 231) is not in accordance with the proposed three-dimensional structure of the PrP C segment 108-218 (Huang et al., 1994) as it lacks the first helix (residues 109 to 122) of the predicted four-helix bundle. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the main and possibly the only part of PrP C with defined three-dimensional structure is represented by residues 121 to 231, and that most of the proposed structural changes linked to the transition from PrP C to PrP Sc may occur within this segment:
<P>
(1) Amino- or carboxy-terminal secondary structure elements being part of a single, small protein domain generally cannot be deleted without loss of protein stability and cooperativity of folding, since one-domain modules appear to fold in a concerted, cooperative mechanism and not in a hierarchical process (de Prat Gay et al., 1995a,b). 
<P>
(2) It was demonstrated that peptide fragments comprising isolated helices of myohemerythrin, a four-helix bundle protein, spontaneously form helical structures (Dyson et al., 1992). However, a synthetic peptide spanning the first, predicted a-helix (residues 106 to 126) did not exhibit a-helical structure in aqueous solution and appeared to be a mixture of b-sheet and random coil structure (de Gioia et al., 1994). 
<P>
(3) Proteolytic cleavage of a protein domain should occur mainly at exposed loop regions rather than within secondary structure elements (Price & Johnson, 1993). The experimental evidence thus indicates that the fold of PrP(121-231) is incompatible with the structure previously proposed for PrP C . It was recently shown that transgenic mice exclusively expressing a PrP variant lacking residues 32 to 80 are still susceptible to infection by mouse PrP Sc and capable of propagating the infectious agent, which means that all residues required for the conversion to PrP Sc are located within segment 81-231 (Fischer et al., 1996). PrP(121-231) represents 74% of this segment and contains ten of the 13 codons in human PrP, where point mutations are assumed to be associated with inherited prion diseases (Schatzl et al., 1995; Prusiner, 1993). The polymorphism at residue 129 in human PrP, which appears to influence susceptibility to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Palmer et al., 1991), also lies within PrP(121-231). Therefore, it will be most interesting to see whether transgenic mice exclusively expressing the autonomously folding fragment PrP(121-231) will still be susceptible to scrapie.
<P>
 The reversibility of PrP(121-231) folding raises principle questions on the folding pathways of PrP C
and PrP Sc . When we neglect an autocatalytic mechanism for formation of monomeric PrP Sc and simply assume that formation of insoluble, protease-resistant PrP Sc -oligomers ((PrP Sc )n )is an irreversible process an oligomerization-competent PrP Sc monomer may be: (1) by an on-pathway or (2) by an off-pathway folding intermediate of PrP C
(both of which could be molten globule-like; Safar et al., 1994); or (3) the final product of PrP folding, protein and difference in accessible surface area between the unfolded and folded state (Myers et al., 1995), has a value of 8.6 (20.5) kJ mol -1 M -1 GdmCl and is in the range expected for a 13.3 kDa protein (Myers et al., 1995). We have shown that the amino-terminally truncated segment of the mouse prion protein (residues 121 to 231) is an isolated domain with tertiary structure and high intrinsic stability, whose folding and solubility does not require N-glycosylation at residues 181 and 198. Most importantly, refolding of chemically denatured PrP(121-231) is cooperative and reversible and yields a molecule indistinguishable from the native recombinant protein which would mean that PrP C is a kinetically trapped folding intermediate of PrP Sc .
<P>

All models predict that the kinetics of formation of PrP Sc -oligomers are strongly dependent on protein concentration, which is consistent with the observation that transgenic mice overexpressing the natural prion protein exhibit a strong increase in susceptibility to infection by prions (Bu eler et al., 1993; Fischer et al., 1996). Since examples for protein folding reactions under kinetic control are extremely rare and have so far only been reported for polypeptides with pro-sequences (Baker et al., 1992; Eder et al., 1993a,b), model (3) appears to be most unlikely, and the conformation of recombinant PrP(121-231) may indeed be identical with its three-dimensional fold in the natural PrP C protein. We believe that the high stability and solubility of PrP(121-231) over a wide range of conditions provides the basis to investigate its kinetics of folding and unfolding, to identify the nature of possible folding intermediates of PrP experimen-tally (Baldwin, 1996), and to solve the three-dimensional structure of the folded part of PrP C , which is of central importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the trans-mission of prion diseases.

<PRE>A conformational change seems to represent the major difference between the scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) and its normal
cellular isoform (PrPC). We recently proposed a set of four helix bundle models for the three-dimensional structure of
PrPC that are consistent with a variety of spectroscopic and genetic data. We report a plausible model for the
three-dimensional structure of a biologically important fragment of PrPSc. The model of residues 108-218 was
constructed by an approach that combines computational techniques and experimental data. The proposed structures of this
fragment of PrPSc display a four-stranded -sheet covered on one face by two -helices. Residues implicated in the prion
species barrier are found to cluster on the solvent-accessible surface of the -sheet of one of the models. This interface
could provide a structural template that would assist the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and hence direct prion
propagation.Molecular models of the PrP isoforms should prove very useful in developing structural hypotheses about the
process by which PrPC is transformed into PrPSc, the mechanisms by which PrP gene mutations give rise to the inherited
human prion diseases, and the species barrier that seems to protect humans from animal prions. It seems likely that PrPC
represents a kinetically trapped intermediate in PrP folding. 

<STRONG>Introduction and background</STRONG>

Prions cause a group of human and animal neurodegenerative diseases that are now classified together because their etiology
and pathogenesis involve modification of the prion protein (PrP) [1] [2]. Prion diseases are manifest as infectious, genetic
and sporadic disorders. These diseases can be transmitted among mammals by the infectious particle designated 'prion' [3].
Despite intensive searches over the past three decades, no nucleic acid has been found within prions [4] [5] [6] [7]; yet, a
modified isoform of the host-encoded PrP, designated PrPSc, is essential for infectivity [1] [8] [9] [10] [11]. In fact,
considerable experimental data argue that prions are composed exclusively of PrPSc. Earlier terms used to describe the
prion diseases include transmissible encephalopathies, spongiform encephalopathies and slow virus diseases [12] [13]
[14].

The quartet of human prion diseases are frequently referred to as kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD),
Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Kuru was the first of the human prion
diseases to be transmitted to experimental animals and it has often been suggested that kuru spread among the Fore people of
Papua New Guinea by ritualistic cannibalism [13] [15]. The experimental and presumed human to human transmission of
kuru led to the belief that prion diseases are infectious disorders caused by unusual viruses similar to those causing
scrapie in sheep and goats. Yet, a paradox was presented by the occurrence of CJD in families, first reported almost 70
years ago [16] [17], which appeared to be a genetic disease. The significance of familial CJD was unappreciated until
mutations were discovered in the protein-coding region of the PrP gene on the short arm of chromosome 20 [18] [19]
[20]. The earlier finding that brain extracts from patients who had died of familial prion diseases inoculated into
experimental animals often transmit disease posed a conundrum that was resolved with the genetic linkage of these diseases
to mutations of the PrP gene [21] [22] [23].

The most common form of prion disease in humans is sporadic CJD. Many attempts to show that the sporadic prion diseases
are caused by infection have been unsuccessful [24] [25] [26] [27]. The discovery that inherited prion diseases are caused
by germline mutation of the PrP gene raised the possibility that sporadic forms of these diseases might result from a
somatic mutation [22]. The discovery that PrPSc is formed from the cellular isoform of the prion protein, PrPC, by a
posttranslational process [28] and that overexpression of wildtype PrP transgenes produces spongiform degeneration and
infectivity de novo [29] has raised the possibility that sporadic prion diseases result from the spontaneous conversion of
PrPC into PrPSc.

The fundamental event in prion diseases seems to be a conformational change in PrP [30]. All attempts to identify a
posttranslational chemical modification that distinguishes PrPSc from PrPC have been unsuccessful to date [31]. PrPC
contains about 45% -helix and is virtually devoid of -sheet [32]. Conversion to PrPSc creates a protein that contains
about 30% -helix and about 45% -sheet. The mechanism by which PrPC is converted into PrPSc remains unknown but
PrPC appears to bind to PrPSc to form an intermediate complex during the formation of nascent PrPSc. Transgenic mouse
studies have demonstrated that PrPSc in the inoculum interacts preferentially with homotypic PrPC during the propagation
of prions [33] [34].

Elucidating the three-dimensional structure of both PrPC and PrPSc is central to understanding the molecular mechanism
of prion diseases. An approximate tertiary structure of PrPC was proposed recently that is rich in -helical structures
consistent with available spectroscopic data [35]. As the insoluble aggregated nature of PrPSc complicates X-ray and NMR
studies of its three-dimensional structure, we have utilized an approach that combines computational techniques and a
synthesis of available data from genetic, molecular biological, and spectroscopic experiments. Our approach includes
secondary structure prediction, a combinatorial search of all plausible arrangements of these secondary structure elements
to form tertiary structures, and an analysis of the putative tertiary structures to identify those candidates that are
consistent with a variety of pieces of experimental and theoretical information. In an effort to simplify this task, we chose
to focus on a biologically relevant fragment of PrPSc. PrP includes three regions: an N-terminal leader sequence (residues
1-23); the octarepeats, a sequentially regular region with a pattern of amino acid side chains that is not easily related to
other known periodic structures (residues 24-90); and the 27-30kDa infectious fragment, PrP 27-30, that remains
after proteinase K digestion of PrPSc (residues 90-240), which includes two potential glycosylation sites and a
glycophosphoinositol anchor near the C terminus. Although polymorphisms in the octarepeat region have been associated
with inherited disease, a comparison of the octarepeat regions of primate PrP sequences demonstrate that these are normal
polymorphisms [36]. We have chosen to focus on the third region because of the connection to infectivity, the fact that the
vast majority of disease-associated mutations and disease-modifying polymorphisms occur in this region, and because of
the demonstration that peptides chosen from this region (e.g. 90-145 and 108-141) undergo an -helix to -structure
transition in vitro that is reminiscent of the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc [37]. The fact that a Japanese patient with a
missense mutation at codon 145 developed a neurodegenerative illness argues that the crux of the conformational change
must occur between residues 90 and 145 [38].

<STRONG>Results and discussion</STRONG>

The secondary structure of PrPSc was predicted with specific biases introduced to accommodate data from circular
dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic experiments. CD and FTIR studies indicate that
approximately half of the -helical structure in PrPC is converted into -sheet in PrPSc [32] [39]. Results from various
secondary structure prediction methods and spectroscopic studies of PrP peptide fragments argue that the four structural
regions corresponding to the helices in PrPC are most likely to undergo a conformational change from -helix to -sheet in
PrPSc [35] [40]. These findings suggest that two of the four helices of PrPC are converted into -sheet structure in
PrPSc. We therefore systematically assigned two of the four putative helical regions to -sheet conformations.

The tertiary structures of PrPSc were generated by examining the plausible hydrophobic packing between secondary
structures. A combinatorial packing approach developed for / proteins [41] [42] was employed to predict tertiary
structural models for PrPSc. All possible strand arrangements and relative pairing of the component strands to form a
-sheet were studied. Briefly, each of the four strands could occupy one of 4! orders (1234, 2143, etc.) and there are two
possible orientations for each -strand. Strand alignments are shifted to create four distinct hydrogen bonding patterns for
each strand. Thus, a large number of structures are generated with unique strand topologies and hydrogen bonding patterns,
including parallel, antiparallel, and mixed -sheets. The separation between the axes of the -strands was 4.25  to
facilitate hydrogen bonding and the angle between neighboring strands was -20 to create the twisted -sheet that is
commonly observed in protein structures [41]. The -helices were then placed onto the hydrophobic surface of the -sheet
structure so that a constellation of non-polar residues on the surface of each -helix could interact with the hydrophobic
surface of the -sheet. Helices were placed antiparallel to the preceding secondary structure element 10  above the plane
of the sheet. This organization is typical of / and + protein structures. Structures were eliminated if their -sheets
failed to create a hydrophobic surface suitable for subsequent helix-sheet packing or if the -sheet topology created steric
problems for the loops that would ultimately join the -strands. For example, if two six-residue strands were joined by a
four-residue turn, they could not run parallel to one another in a -sheet without breaking the chain. Structures were also
eliminated if they failed to form the experimentally determined disulfide bond between Cys179 and Cys214 [43]. From an
initial list of about 106 structures, six families of structures were considered viable [Fig. 1]. These six structural models
were validated by a three-dimensional profile method [44]. The profile scores are presented in [Table 1]. Although
self-profiling methods cannot guarantee the accuracy of a given model structure, they are useful in identifying errant folds
and alignments.

The generated three-dimensional model structures were examined in order to select the models that were most consistent
with experimental data. Genetic experiments indicated that a specific interaction between PrPSc and PrPC is important for
prion propagation [33] [34]. A small number of residues were found to be central to the prion species barrier, a
phenomenon that depends upon the homotypic interaction of PrPSc with PrPC [36]. Each of the six plausible structures
[Fig. 1] was analyzed with respect to the residues implicated in the PrPSc-PrPC interaction (Asn108, Met112, Met129,
and Ala133). One of the models was most intriguing with respect to the spatial clustering of these residues. As shown in
[Fig. 2a], this model displays a four-stranded -sheet with one face covered by two -helices. The -strand arrangement in
the -sheet is similar to that observed in the structure of the immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G (GB1) [45],
and the overall packing topology between the -sheet and two -helices is similar to that observed in the structure of the
RNA-binding domain of the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C protein [46]. The four residues
implicated in the species barrier, and thus the PrPSc-PrPC interaction, are clustered on the solvent-accessible surface of
the -sheet of model II. In addition, a number of hydrophobic side chains are located on this surface. These observations
suggest that the solvent-accessible surface of the -sheet provides a plausible interface for a specific interaction of PrPSc
with PrPC that could promote the conformational change of PrPC to PrPSc. Mutations at this interface would alter the
incubation times associated with different inocula of prions in different hosts. This suggests that the prion species barrier
results from the changes in the conformation and stability of the PrPSc-PrPC complex. Transgenic experiments are
underway to create new and abrogate existing species barriers based on this model. Although we currently favor model II of
PrPSc, it is important to remember that each model is emblematic of a family of protein topologies, and that formal
experimental or theoretical constraints prevent one from excluding the other five plausible models.

The model of the PrPSc-PrPC complex may provide a structural basis for observations from genetic experiments.
Transgenic studies of the transmission of prions from Syrian hamster to mouse indicate that five residues (109, 112,
138, 154, and 169) are important for the homophilic interaction between PrPSc molecules within the inoculated prion
and PrPC synthesized by the host [34]. It is interesting to note that three of these five residues (109, 112, and 138) are
located at or near the hypothesized PrPSc-PrPC interface [Fig. 2a], while the remaining two residues (154 and 169) are
located in the S2b-H3 loop connecting the fourth strand in the -sheet and helix 3. This suggests that, in addition to the
-sheet being the primary site for interaction, the loop following the -sheet might also be involved in molecular
recognition during prion replication. This would be consistent with model II for PrPSc, in which this conformationally
flexible loop could come into contact with PrPC during the formation of the PrPSc-PrPC complex [Fig. 2a]. Such a model
also provides a consistent explanation for the recent studies of the transmission of CJD from humans to transgenic mice.
Mice expressing a chimeric PrP gene containing nine substitutions were susceptible to prions from CJD patients [47].
Eight of these nine substitutions are located either in the putative -sheet region of model II or the S2b-H3 loop region of
the PrPSc model. Analyses of PrP genes among various primates indicated that mutations at residue 177 and a
polymorphism at residue 168 are implicated in the prion species barrier [36] [48]. These findings provide further
evidence for the possible structural or functional role of the putative S2b-H3 loop.


                                                                                                          

                                                                                                          
  Fig. 2. Plausible models for the tertiary structures of PrPSc and PrPC. (a) The proposed three-dimensional structure
  of PrPSc. This structure was chosen from the six penultimate models of PrPSc [Fig. 1] because it appeared to correlate
  best with genetic data on residues involved in species barrier. It contains a four-strand mixed -sheet with two -helices
  packed against one face of the -sheet. Strands 1a and 1b (in red) correspond to the helix 1 in PrPC while strands 2a and
  2b (in green) correspond to the helix 2 (b). Helices 3 and 4 in this model remain unchanged from the PrPC model (b)
  [35]. Four residues (Asn108, Met112, Met129, and Ala133) implicated in the species barrier [36] are shown in the
  ball- and-stick model. They cluster on the solvent-accessible surface of the -sheet, which might provide
  a plausible interface for the PrPSc-PrPC interaction. The S2b-H3 loop connecting the -sheet and helix 3 is implicated
  in the species barrier and is shown in yellow. This conformationally flexible loop could come into contact with PrPC
  during the formation of the PrPSc-PrPC complex. Therefore, the specific molecular recognition during prion replication
  might involve both the -sheet as the primary binding site and the S2b-H3 loop as an additional site for interaction. (b)

  helices 1 and 2 are converted into -sheet structure during the formation of PrPSc (a). The H2-H3 loop corresponding
  to the S2b-H3 loop in PrPSc is shown in yellow. Four residues (Asn108, Met112, Met129, and Ala133) implicated in
  the species barrier as noted above are shown in the ball-and-stick model.

Recently, other authors raised the issue that overall sequence homology might not be a determining influence for prion
transmissibility [49]. This hypothesis was based on the finding that, despite the sequence similarity to humans, Old World
rhesus monkeys exhibit a lower transmission rate of human prions than either of the more evolutionarily distal New World
spider or squirrel monkeys. Examination of these results in the context of the proposed model for the PrPSc-PrPC
interaction reveals that PrP from Old World rhesus monkey contains a substitution at codon 108 (AsnSer) at
the solvent-accessible surface of the putative -sheet, a primary site of PrPSc-PrPC interface [Fig. 2a]. This substitution
might decrease the stability of the PrPSc-PrPC complex and hence lower the transmission rate of human prions. Thus, our
structural model for prion replication suggests that the sequence, or more precisely structural similarity, at the
PrPSc-PrPC interface, rather than the overall sequence homology, may be the major determinant for prion
transmissibility.

The proposed structural model of PrPSc is consistent with the mutation data in familial prion diseases. 18 mutations in the
PrP gene have been identified that segregate with the inherited prion diseases [19] [50]. Although octarepeat inserts at
codons 67, 75, or 83 of the N-terminal region are either genetically linked to or associated with familial CJD, all other
disease-associated point mutations occur in the C-terminal region, in which the -sheet and -helical structures are
predicted to occur. As the deletion of the N-terminal region of PrPSc before residue 90 by limited proteolysis does not alter
prion infectivity, this suggests that the N-terminal region is not required for the propagation of prions. Point mutations in
the C-terminal region may affect the structure of either PrPC or PrPSc and promote the conformational change featured in
prion diseases. It was found, for example, that 10 mutations are located within or near the four putative -helices and five
mutations cluster around a central hydrophobic core that seems essential for the structural stability of PrPC [Fig. 2b]
[35]. It is noted that a nonsense mutation at codon 145 was found in a Japanese patient dying of CJD [38]. This finding
suggests that residues 90-145 might be essential for the transmission and pathology of prion diseases. This would be
consistent with the proposed model of PrPSc in which residues 90-145 form the region involved in the conformational
change of two -helices into a four-stranded -sheet. This same region contains the clustering of residues implicated in the
species barrier for prion transmission [Fig. 2a,b].

The proposed structure of PrPSc is also consistent with results from structural studies of PrP peptides. Spectroscopic
studies have shown that the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 109-122 (-strands 1a and 1b) or 128-141
(-strands 2a and 2b) of model II of PrPSc adopts a -sheet structure and forms amyloid [40] [51] [52] [53]. Further
structural studies using NMR, FTIR and CD spectroscopy of peptides containing both the first and second putative hairpin
structures (e.g. residues 90-145) suggest that this region can adopt two distinct conformations: one that contains a pair of
helices and a second that is entirely -structure [37]. All of these findings seem to be in agreement with the structural
features revealed in the models of PrPSc and PrPC [Fig. 2] and of the formation of a complex between PrPC and PrPSc
which seems to occur during prion propagation.

<STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG>

The models for PrPSc proposed here extend earlier studies in which computational models were developed for PrPC [35].
Both the PrPC and PrPSc models were developed while considering numerous constraints posed by the physical, genetic and
amino acid sequence data available for these two PrP isoforms. These models should prove very useful in posing hypotheses
about the process by which PrPC is transformed into PrPSc, the mechanisms by which PrP gene mutations give rise to the
inherited human prion diseases, and the species barrier that seems to protect humans from animal prions. In the absence of
more definitive structural information, we believe that these models provide a useful platform for designing genetic and
biophysical experiments to probe the unique biology of prion diseases.

<STRONG>Materials and methods</STRONG>

The computational procedures used for the prediction of the three-dimensional structures of PrPSc involved four major
steps: (i) alignment of a family of homologous sequences, (ii) prediction of secondary structures, (iii) packing of
secondary elements to generate all plausible tertiary structures, and (iv) selection and refinement of final structural
models. PrP amino acid sequences from one avian and 11 mammalian sources, including chicken, cow, sheep, rat, mouse,
hamster, mink, and human, were used. The alignment of these sequences was reported previously [54]. Methods for
secondary and tertiary structure prediction were applied independently to all 12 PrP sequences using the statistical
methods of Chou and Fasman [55] and Garnier et al. [56]; the neural networks of Kneller et al. [57] and Rost and Sander
[58]; and the pattern-based method of Cohen et al. [59]. These methods gave rise to a consistent prediction of secondary
structure location, but a confusing picture of the local preference for -helical or -sheet structure. We systematically
assigned two of the four helical regions in PrPC [Fig. 2b] [35] to -sheet conformations and thus obtained six different
sets of secondary structure for PrPSc, i.e. S1a1bS2a2bH3H4, S1a1bH2S3a3bH4, S1a1bH2H3S4a4b, H1S2a2bS3a3bH4,
H1S2a2bH3S4a4b, and H1H2S3a3bS4a4b. The boundaries of the -strands and the -turns of the hairpins were predicted
using a turn-prediction algorithm for / proteins [59]. The predicted boundaries of the plausible -strands in PrPSc are
Asn108-Ala113 for S1a, Ala116-Val122 for S1b, Tyr128-Ser135 for S2a, Ile138-Asp144 for S2b, Asp178-Ile184 for
S3a, His187-Thr191 for S3b, Asp202-Val210 for S4a, and Met213-Tyr218 for S4b. The predicted boundaries of the
-helices in PrPSc remain unchanged from the PrPC model (Met109-Val122 for H1, Met129-Phe141 for H2,
Asp178-Thr191 for H3, and Asp202-Tyr218 for H4) [35]. Thus, the models attempt to describe the structure for the
111-residue PrP fragment from residue 108 to residue 218. The predicted secondary structure corresponds to 64% of the
fragment for which 36% is -structure (24% intramolecular hydrogen bonds within a PrPSc monomer and about 12%
intermolecular hydrogen bonds between -strands in PrPSc monomers that form a multimeric state) and 28% is -helical.
These figures modestly underestimate the values expected from the FTIR studies and could easily reach the experimental
values if the extent of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding is larger. The tertiary structures of PrPSc were generated by
examining the plausible hydrophobic packing between secondary structure elements [41]. Specifically, we sought -sheets
that created an appropriate hydrophobic surface to support helix-sheet packing and identified hydrophobic clusters on the
surfaces of putative -helices to interact with the hydrophobic regions of the -sheet. Finally, a series of experimental and
theoretical constraints were applied to select plausible structural models. For example, the existence of a disulfide bridge
between residues 179 and 214 constrains the separation of the predicted locations for the and  carbons for these two
residues. Also, the separation between the end of one piece of secondary structure and the beginning of the next should not
exceed a length that could be spanned by the intervening residues.

<p>The disturbing link between the prions that cause Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy 

(BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans comes from a study of the 

evolutionary relationships of prions in a wide variety of mammals. The normal prion found in 

cattle shares two biochemical features with the prion found in humans and apes. 

Crucially, neither of these features are found in the prion of sheep -- the prion which, when mutated, 

causes the disease called 'scrapie'. These biochemical features -- changes in the amino-acid 

sequence of the prion protein -- occur in a part of the protein thought to be involved in the 

onset of prion-mediated diseases such as CJD and BSE. <P>


The discovery is a shattering blow for the evolutionary argument that because humans seem 

unable to contract prion diseases from sheep infected with scrapie, they would be unlikely to 

contract CJD from contaminated beef. The study, published in the 25 April issue 

of<i>Nature</i> comes from a team of researchers based in Oxford, in the UK, including 

Professor T. R. E. Southwood, a former advisor to the British Government on BSE.<P>


Prions are proteins that occur in the brains of all mammals so far studied. The normal 

function of prion proteins is not understood, but recent research on mice that lack the PrP 

gene -- which encodes the prion protein -- suggest that it protects the brain against dementia 

and other degenerative problems associated with old age. Sometimes, 'rogue' prions are 

produced by genetic mutations. This explains why some cases of CJD in humans are 

inherited. <P>
Another inherited human prion disease is so-called Fatal Familial Insomnia. There 

is some evidence that this results from a deficiency of the normal prion protein, a deficiency 

that occurs because mutant prions are unable to fulfil their normal functions.<P>
 

In addition to causing disease through inherited genetic mutations, mutant prions are capable 

of turning into 'rogue' disease agents. Transmitted from an infected animal or human to a new 

host, they convert any 'normal' prions they encounter into copies of themselves. This 

conversion process eventually results in spongiform encephalopathies such as BSE and CJD.<P>
 

The transmission of disease depends on the rogue prion being similar enough to the host 

prion to be able to 'lock in' to its structure and convert it. Transmission works best between 

animals of the same species. For example, a prion disease called 'kuru', found in the Fore tribe 

of New Guinea, is spread by ritual cannibalism, in which mourners eat the brains of their 

dead relatives. This practice has since ceased.  But there is some evidence that rogue prions 

can jump the barrier between species, provided that the prions of donor and host are similar 

enough for the conversion process to occur.<P>


Cattle and sheep are extremely close evolutionary relatives. They 

belong to the family Bovidae, and share a common ancestor that lived probably no more than 

20 million years ago. So it is no surprise -- in hindsight -- that cattle could contract a prion 

disease when fed with offal from sheep contaminated with scrapie, a spongiform 

encephalopathy endemic to sheep. That hundreds of thousands of cattle have been slaughtered 

since the initial contamination shows just how easy it is for prion proteins to be transmitted 

from sheep to cattle.<P>


But human beings are extremely distant relatives of bovids such as cattle and sheep. Our most 

recent common ancestor was alive around 70 million years ago, when mammals all looked 

like rats, and dinosaurs still ruled the Earth. Because of this evolutionary separation, human 

prions are unlikely to be similar to those of either sheep or cattle. This distance seems to be 

borne out by experience -- sheep have had scrapie for more than 200 years, and yet there is no 

known association between scrapie in sheep and CJD in humans. Given these arguments, 

there seems no compelling reason why humans should contract CJD from beef, either.<P>


The evolutionary 'family tree' (above) seems, at first glance, to support this view. Prions from 

cattle (<i>Bos taurus</i>) and sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>) are similar to each other, and to 

prions from other ungulates such as goats (<i>Capra hircus</i>) and deer (<i>Odocoileus 

hemionus</i>). They are quite different from those found humans (<i>Homo</i>), gorillas 

(<i>Gorilla</i>), chimpanzees (<i>Pan</i>) and a wide range of monkeys.<P>


But this family tree was based on general features of the prions -- an overall consensus of 

similarity. It does not account for the significance of any particular detailed similarity or 

difference. Therein lies the interest of the similarities between human (and ape) prions and the 

prion of cattle -- similarities which occur nowhere else in the family tree, and significantly, 

not in sheep.<P>
 That the chance of these two similarities being shared by cattle and humans is 

extremely remote, should give scientists and politicians pause for thought. That these two 

unlikely similarities happen to occur in a part of the prion thought to be connected with 

disease transmission -- presumably, the conversion of normal prions into rogues -- can only 

be interpreted as worrying.<HR>

<CENTER><H3>Rogue Prion Protein</H3>
</CENTER>

Research into BSE and its 

human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) continues apace as Britain and Europe 

struggle to save their embattled beef industry. The latest insight into these diseases may even 

have repercussions for understanding other brain-wasting diseases, such as Alzheimer's and 

Parkinson's disease.<P>


Spongiform encephalopathies are spread by a rogue form of a protein called a 'prion'. The 

normal form of the protein is produced naturally in the brains of all mammals, and is 

harmless -- but altered forms adopt the role of an infectious agent. Like a rotten apple, once 

inside the brain, the mutant form of prion protein turns the native protein into more copies of 

the deviant, infectious form. The end result is a characteristic loss of motor coordination, 

dementia and death, and a brain full of holes, like a sponge. Nobody understands the 

connection between prions and the particular pattern of symptoms that seem to be associated 

with them, nor why the brains of infected people or animals become spongy. 
<P>

As all mammals produce prion protein, it would seem likely that it serves some useful 

purpose but, to everyone's surprise, mice without the prion-producing gene seem to grow up 

normally into healthy adult mice. Only after seventy weeks (which is late middle-age for a 

mouse) do things start to go wrong, according to Dr Suehiro Sakaguchi and his colleagues 

from the Nagasaki University School of Medicine in Japan, who report their findings in the April 11, 1996 Nature.<P>




The prion-free mice were resistant to scrapie, the sheep equivalent of BSE. Just as a single 

rotten apple can do no harm in an empty barrel, a brain without prion protein cannot be taken 

over by the rogue form. But no-one could guess why these mice should live for so long 

without feeling the deficiency of the normal prion protein. Now, Dr Sakaguchi and his 

colleagues believe they have an explanation.

The researchers noticed that their seventy-week-old prion-free mice were not as healthy as 

they first seemed. They developed an odd, uncoordinated gait. Their back legs began to 

tremble as they tried to walk, they took short tentative steps and were unable to keep a 

straight path. As they got older, their coordination became progressively worse, and they 

frequently collapsed. By ninety weeks, the mice had deteriorated even further. Hardly able to 

stand, most had developed spasmodic arching of their backs.<P>

<P>

These crippling symptoms are similar to those of BSE and CJD, leading the researchers to 

suppose that the loss of  the natural form of prion protein is to blame -- and may be the cause 

of at least some cases of these diseases, even in the absence of an infectious agent. There are 

two main ways in which the progressive take-over of the brain by the rogue prion might cause 

disease -- either the rogue prion itself causes damage, or the loss of normal prion means its 

usual beneficial function is not felt. Given the effect on these mice, it seems that we produce 

prion to avoid the wasting away of our brains that would otherwise come about.
<P>

Closer examination of the brains of the afflicted mice gives a good indication of what prion 

protein would normally be doing when there is plenty of it in the brain. The cerebellum, the 

part of the brain responsible for movement and coordination, had shrunk by almost one-third 

in the specially bred, prion-free mice. 
<P>

One particular type of brain cell was particularly notable by its absence -- the Purkinje cells. 

Young mice, which had not yet succumbed to illness, had healthy numbers of these cells, so 

Dr Sakaguchi and his colleagues venture that prion prevents these cells from dying. After all, 

old people, whose brain cells are gradually dying off, also become progressively less 

coordinated in their movements. And loss of coordination is typical of many brain-wasting 

diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These Purkinje cells, it seems, can 

survive for a while without any help, but they will soon die without the support of prion. 

Even with it they will eventually die, but prion certainly prolongs that inevitable moment.
<P>

This latest research may also shed some light on the inherited form of CJD, a persistent 

(though rare) disease. The recent frenzy in Europe came only after the reporting of several 

cases of a new form of CJD. The latest victims are young people, with apparently no family 

history of the disease, raising fears that the disease had been caught by eating beef infected 

with BSE. But the inherited form of CJD has long been known, affecting about one in every 

million people each year. One possibility might be that those susceptible to the disease have a 

faulty prion gene, so that they either do not produce enough prion, or produce it in a less 

effective form.
<P>

But Dr Sakaguchi is cautious. His mice were not the first to be bred as prion-free, and those 

first mice were still healthy at 93 weeks of age. Slightly different breeding techniques may 

account for these differences, but until further analysis is brought to bear on prion-free mice, 

researchers cannot be confident in their understanding of the prion protein. Whatever the 

outcome, it will be too late to have any effect on the current economic crisis gripping Europe.

<li>Spacing analysis:

 The spacings between consecutive residues of the same type (all  20  amino
 acids,  +  and - charge, and combined charge *) are evaluated for signifi-
 cantly large or small maximal and minimal spacings. The output is  ordered
 by  the beginning point of the significant spacing. Entries are identified
 by the residue type, spacing (number of amino acids between the identified
 positions),  rank  of  the  displayed  spacing  (e.g.,  50 alanines in the
 sequence induce 51 spacings, ranked by decreasing length from  1  to  51),
 and  p-value  (probability  of exceeding the displayed spacing).. If the  first
 maximal  spacing  (rank  1)  of a residue is significantly large or small,
 then also the second maximal spacing (rank 2) is evaluated. Large  maximal
 and small minimal spacings indicate clustering effects, whereas small max-
 imal and large minimal spacings indicate excessive evenness in the distri-
 bution of the residues.

This <A NAME="re">REPRO</A> output is a result of a sequence self comparison.
Just the subsequences with highest similarity scores (top non-overlapping
pairwise alignments) are listed (numbered sequentially under 'repeat'
followed by residue length, score and score per residue).
This is followed by a list of repeat sets deduced from the top alignments
(called 'repeat set').
<P>
The sets are ordered on the numbers of repeating fragments they obtain.
Finally, for each set the repeat segments are multiply aligned.
The repeat fragments in different sets can be similar but reflect different
sequence site ranges (i.e. the repeats are shifted with one to a few residues).

Proposed but not done yet:  Run homology search on prion anti-gene, the large open reading frame of unknown function found on the anti-sense gene in all animals except mink and marsupial, on the theory that a duplicated anti-gene could have had the original function and the prion gene evolved from it later.

The apoform of <B>neurocuprein, the copper protein from brain and chromaffin granules</B>, was found to be a potent inhibitor of the hydroxylating activity of dopamine beta-monooxygenase, whereas the holoform of neurocuprein has no effect on the activity of the enzyme. The inhibiting capacity of neurocuprein may be due to the property of the apoprotein to chelate copper from the enzyme. A role of neurocuprein as an endogenous protein regulator of dopamine
beta-monooxygenase is suggested.

Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM; EC 1.14.17.3) is a multifunctional protein containing two enzymes that act sequentially to catalyze the
alpha-amidation of neuroendocrine peptides. Peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) catalyzes the first step of the reaction and is dependent
on copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen. Peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL) catalyzes the second step of the reaction. Previous
studies demonstrated that alternative splicing results in the production of bifunctional PAM proteins that are integral membrane or soluble proteins as well as
soluble monofunctional PHM proteins. Rat PAM is encoded by a complex single copy gene that consists of 27 exons and encompasses more than 160 kilobases (kb)
of genomic DNA. The 12 exons comprising PHM are distributed over at least 76 kb genomic DNA and range in size from 49-185 base pairs; four of the introns
within the PHM domain are over 10 kb in length. Alternative splicing in the PHM region can result in a truncated, inactive PHM protein (rPAM-5), or a
soluble, monofunctional PHM protein (rPAM-4) instead of a bifunctional protein. The eight exons comprising PAL are distributed over at least 19 kb genomic
DNA. The exons encoding PAL range in size from 54-209 base pairs and have not been found to undergo alternative splicing. The PHM and PAL domains are
separated by a single alternatively spliced exon surrounded by lengthy introns; inclusion of this exon results in the production of a form of PAM (rPAM-1) in
which endoproteolytic cleavage at a paired basic site can separate the two catalytic domains. The exon following the PAL domain encodes the trans-membrane
domain of PAM; alternative splicing at this site produces integral membrane or soluble PAM proteins. The COOH-terminal domain of PAM is comprised of a short
exon subject to alternative splicing and a long exon encoding the final 68 amino acids present in all bifunctional PAM proteins along with the entire
3'-untranslated region. Analysis of hybrid cell panels indicates that the human PAM gene is situated on the long arm of chromosome 5.

Abstract
The peptidylglycine alpha-amidating enzyme catalyzes a reaction that transforms a carboxyl-terminal glycine-extended precursor into a carboxyl-terminal
alpha-amidated peptide. We purified an alpha-amidating enzyme from equine serum by simplified steps including substrate affinity chromatography. With the
purified enzyme, we detected an intermediate of the alpha-amidating reaction by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The production of the
intermediate required copper, oxygen, and ascorbate and increased linearly with incubation time. The structure of the intermediate was determined to be a
hydroxyl derivative at the carboxyl-terminal glycine by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and by proton NMR. The intermediate was readily converted
into an alpha-amidated product in alkaline conditions in a nonenzymic fashion. The nonenzymic conversion required no cofactor but was extremely accelerated by
the addition of copper ion or at higher temperature. Our data suggest that the direct product of the alpha-amidating reaction is not an alpha-amidated peptide but a
hydroxyl derivative at the alpha-carbon of the carboxyl-terminal glycine.

Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating activities from rat pituitary, brain and small intestine were compared, utilizing C-terminal analogues of vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP), D-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Gly and D-Tyr-Asn-Gly, and C-terminal analogue of alpha-MSH, D-Tyr-Val-Gly. The three tissues had enzymic activities
capable of converting the glycine-extended peptides to the corresponding alpha-amidated ones.. The activities were stimulated in the presence of copper and ascorbate.
The alpha-amidating
enzymes from these tissues in common have a recognition site for the C-terminal glycine of the glycine-extended precursor regardless of the length and nature of
the sequence. No fundamental differences were observed between the catalytic properties of the alpha-amidating activities from these three tissues, raising the
possibility that similar enzymes, which may or may not be a single species, are functioning in tissues that produce alpha-amidated polypeptides in vivo.

The conversion of C-terminal glycine-extended peptides to C-terminal alpha-amidated peptides occurs in two distinct reactions, both of which are catalyzed by
bifunctional peptidylglycine alpha-amidating enzyme. The first step is the alpha-hydroxylation of the C-terminal glycine residue and the second step is the
dealkylation of the alpha-hydroxyglycine-extended peptide to the alpha-amidated peptide and glyoxylate. We show that the bifunctional enzyme requires 1.9 +/-
0.2 mol of copper/mol of enzyme for maximal dansyl-Tyr-Lys-Gly amidation activity<HR>

The biosynthesis of C-terminal alpha-amidated peptides from their corresponding C-terminal glycine-extended precursors is catalyzed by peptidylglycine
alpha-amidating enzyme (alpha-AE) in a reaction that requires copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen. We have shown
that O2 is the source of th

In many peptide hormones and neuropeptides, the carboxyl-terminal alpha-amide structure is essential in eliciting their biological activity. In the present
study, an enzymatic activity capable of converting 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-sulfonyl-Gly-L-Phe-Gly(Dabsyl-Gly-Phe -Gly) to
4-dimethylaminoazo-benzene-4'-sulfonyl-Gly-L-Phe-NH2(Dabsyl- Gly-Phe-NH2) was investigated in bovine hypothalamus. Two molecular forms of amidating activity were identified by size-exclusion chromatography and the molecular weight of the
two enzymes were estimated to be 49 kDa and 69 kDa.

The production of alpha-amidated peptides from their glycine-extended precursors is a two-step process involving the sequential action of two catalytic domains
encoded by the bifunctional peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) precursor. The NH2-terminal third of the PAM precursor contains the first
enzyme, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), a copper, molecular oxygen, and ascorbate-dependent enzyme. The middle third of the PAM
precursor contains the second enzyme, peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL). The COOH-terminal third of the PAM precursor encodes a
transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain that may form a cytoplasmic tail.<HR>

A novel system for heterologous expression of prohormones based on transient transfection of the HIT beta-cell line was established using human progastrin as a
model. Progastrin was expressed at high levels compared to other gene transfer systems in endocrine cells, and the processing pattern was similar to that of
normal antral gastrin cells. Thus, gastrin was partially tyrosine O-sulfated and carboxyamidated. . Glucose increased both the level of gastrin gene expression and
maturation to carboxyamidated peptides, indicating that glucose influences the activity of the amidation enzyme complex, <B>peptidylglycine alpha-amidating
mono-oxygenase (PAM)</B>, in insulin cells. The mutant peptides displayed sulfation-dependent processing, supporting our recent suggestion that tyrosine sulfation increases

<STRONG>Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating enzyme</STRONG> (alpha-AE) and dopamine beta-monooxygenase (D beta M), two copper-dependent monooxygenases that have catalytic and structural similarities, are irreversibly inactivated by sodium sulfite. . Sulfite inactivation of alpha-AE is specific for the monooxygenase reaction of this bifunctional enzyme and amidated peptides provide protection against the inactivation. Consequently, the sulfite-mediated inactivation of alpha-AE and D beta M most likely results from the transition
metal-catalyzed oxidation of sulfite to the sulfite radical, SO3-.

Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, remains the topic of many unanswered questions.
We isolated DBH cDNA clones from a bovine adrenal medulla. The longest cDNA had an open reading frame encoding an
entire mature DBH 578 amino acid (64,808 dalton) polypeptide chain, though lacking a portion of the signal peptide. Additional 5' clones, obtained by the
polymerase chain reaction, established the sequence of a 19 amino acid signal peptide. The mature protein sequence was 84% homologous to that of human
pheochromocytoma DBH, including preservation of four potential copper ligand sites (HH or HXH) and substrate binding domains. There were no hydrophobic
(putative membrane spanning) domains, other than the signal peptide. All available DBH peptide and protein sequence data can be accounted for by the
cDNA-deduced 578 amino acid mature protein primary structure. Prokaryotic DBH expression yielded a 65-kilodalton DBH-immunoreactive peptide that
differed from eukaryotic adrenal DBH only in <B>N-linked, endoglycosidase F-sensitive glycosylation</B> in the latter.  Comparison of the DBH primary structure with other reported sequences did not indicate that DBH is a member of any known gene family. The results suggest that a single DBH gene encodes a message specifying a single DBH polypeptide chain.

The carbon monoxide complex of ascorbate-reduced dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been prepared identifying the CO-binding site as the O2-binding site. Analysis of extended x-ray absorption spectroscopy data is most consistent with an average coordination per Cu of 2-3 histidines, 0.5 CO, and 0.5 S atoms as ligands, and absorption edge comparisons indicates pseudo-4 coordination as the most likely geometry at each Cu(I)center. The results can be interpreted by a model involving inequivalent 4-coordination at each Cu(I) center in the CO adduct with CuA His3S...CuB His2 CO-X as the coordination most consistent with all of the data.

Results suggest a lower limit of ca. 7 A for the separation between the two copper ions per subunit and thus rule out a type 3 site in the oxidized
enzyme. The data are most consistent with Cu(II) sites consisting of two or three N (imidazole) and one or two O donor ligands in the coordination sphere. The
similarity in EPR spectra and power saturation of 8- and 4-Cu derivatives suggests that the difference in Cu-binding constants may be due either to differences
in the identity of an axial ligand or to solvation effects in the active site.

Although classically characterized as a Type II copper protein, recent work has shown that D beta H requires two coppers per subunit for optimal activity. A
major challenge has been to elucidate the relationship of these copper sites to one another, specifically whether there exists a single binuclear copper site or
distinct metal sites catalyzing separate functions. The data support separate binding sites for reductants and product/substrate and hence, separate functions for each copper per subunit. A detailed catalytic mechanism for D beta H is discussed.

Mechanism-based inhibitors for dopamine beta-hydroxylase have been used as probes of the mechanism of catalysis. The variety of such inhibitors that have
been developed for this enzyme can be divided into three groups: (i) those in which the inactivating species is formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom to form a
radical intermediate; (ii) those in which the inactivating species is formed by abstraction of an electron to form an epoxide-like intermediate; and (iii) those in
which the product is the inactivating species. A mechanism consistent with inactivation by all three groups of inhibitors which proposes that hydroxylation of
dopamine by dopamine beta-hydroxylase involves <STRONG>formation of a benzylic radical</STRONG> has been developed. The benzylic radical is formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by a high-potential copper-oxygen species.

Prion proteins from all species investigated have a rather mysterious section early on -- an octapeptide repeated 4-5 times.  Mutations with extra repeats can cause CJD.  News of tight and specific copper binding to mammalian and chicken prion repeats, despite the sequence dissimilarity, opens new possibilities for understanding the structure of this region and a catalytic function for the prion protein itself.  This page collects data on all known copper proteins.  Homology to known copper proteins or domains may suggest a 3D structure and enzymatic function for the octapeptide repeat region.

<P>Copper in protein generally has to do with oxidation, except for receptors, storage, transport, and regulation. Bound copper can be ligated to 4 (approximately planar) histidines or to cysteine sulfur or in other ways.  I propose that the histidine scenario is applicable the prion protein repeat region, because this fits perfectly -- and explains -- the highly conserved histidine and tetra-repeat found in all prion proteins.   The highly invariant adjacent proline provides rigidity, and the nonapeptide is perhaps a spacer on a pseudo-pentamer.  If verified, this suggests an oxidative capability for prion protein (that can get out of hand if conformally deregulated, damaging neurons in BSE and CJD).
<P>
The abundant glycine in the octapeptide mammalian repeat avoids steric hinderance but may not be especially significant.  For example, chickens are PHNPGY x 9 and closer to home,  a marsupial is PHPGGSSWGQ.  For mammalian genetics, the issue is the DNA's high GC content and apparently consequent slipping and back-hybridizing  of newly synthesized DNA during replication, which results in a wide varity of CJD-causing repeat insertions and deletions.  -- webmaster

Using CD spectroscopy we have investigated the effect of Cu2+ on the secondary structure of synthetic peptides Octa4 and
Hexa4 corresponding to tetra-repeats of the octapeptide of mammalian PrP and the hexapeptide of chicken PrP. In addition,
fluorescence spectroscopy was used to estimate the dissociation constants (Kd), of Cu2+ binding by both peptides. Both
peptides exhibited unusual CD spectra, complicated by the high proportion of aromatic residues, revealing little secondary
structure in aqueous solution. Addition of Cu2+ to Hexa4 induced an increase in random coil to resemble Octa4. The
fluorescence of both peptides was quenched by Cu2+ and this was used to calculate <B>Kd's of 6.7 microM</B> for Octa4 and 4.5 microM for Hexa4. Other divalent cations showed lesser effects on the fluorescence of the peptides.

High affinity fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors contain a cluster of acidic amino acids in their extracellular
domains that is reminiscent of the calcium binding domains of some cell adhesion molecules. Based on this observation, we
used a calcium blotting technique to show that FGFR-1 binds calcium and that calcium binding is not observed in a
mutagenized form of the receptor that lacks the acidic box region. <B>The acidic box also binds other divalent cations, including copper.</B> This latter interaction appears unique since the binding of copper to FGFR-1 mediates the binding of the receptor
to immobilized heparin. While this observation may help explain the angiogenic properties of copper, divalent cation
binding to FGF receptors may also mediate the interaction between FGF receptors, cell adhesion molecules and other
proteoglycan components of the extracellular matrix. </PRE>

The spectroscopic and mechanistic properties of the Cu-containing active site of azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
investigated by the construction of a mutant in which one of the ligands of the metal, His46, was replaced by a glycine.
Although the mutation creates a hole in the interior of the protein, the 3D structure of the protein does not change to any
appreciable extent. However, the spectroscopic (optical, resonance Raman, EPR) properties of the mutant protein are
strongly affected by the mutation. In the presence of external ligands, the properties of the original wild-type protein are
restored to a smaller or larger extent, depending on the ligand. It is concluded that the hole created by the mutation, even
though it is completely buried inside the protein, can be filled by external ligands, often resulting in the creation of a
mixture of so-called type-1 and type-2 copper sites. Also, the redox properties (midpoint potential, kinetics of
reduction/oxidation) appeared to be strongly affected by the mutation and the presence of external ligands.

homology search and disruption of maoA on the chromosome led to the conclusion that MaoB is a transcriptional activator of
maoA but not an amine oxidase. The maoA gene is regulated by tyramine and MaoB and  the expression of the maoB gene is subject to catabolite repression.

Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is a <B>secreted Cu and Zn-containing glycoprotein.</B> While EC-SOD from most
mammals is tetrameric, rat EC-SOD  is apparently dimeric. 
Analysis of a series of chimeric and point mutated EC-SODs showed that the N-terminal region contributes to the
oligomeric state of the EC-SODs, and that a single amino acid, a valine (human amino acid position 24), is essential for the
tetramerization. This residue is replaced by an aspartate in the rat. Rat EC-SOD carrying an Asp --> Val mutation is
tetrameric. Thus, the rat EC-SOD dimer is converted to a tetramer by the exchange of a single amino acid. These results
also suggest that tetrameric EC-SODs are not symmetrical tetrahedrons, but composed of two interacting dimers, further
supporting an evolutionary relationship with the dimeric cytosolic Cu and Zn-containing SODs.

The N-terminal metal-binding domains of the copper-activated yeast transcription factors, ACE1 and AMT1, <B>bind to
specific DNA sequences in a Cu-dependent fashion</B>. Recombinant AMT1 and ACE1 metal-binding domains are isolated as
Cu4 Zn1-protein complexes. Site-directed mutagenesis of AMT1 was used in this study to map the ligands of the Cu(I) and
Zn(II) ions. The results are consistent with the N-terminal halves of AMT1 and ACE1 consisting of two independent
submodules, one binding a single Zn(II) ion and the second binding the tetracopper cluster. The basis of this conclusion is,
first, that mutations of two cysteinyl codons and a histidyl codon in the first 42 residues of AMT1 do not alter DNA binding.
In contrast, serine substitutions at four cysteine positions at codons 43, 61, 90, and 98 abolish DNA binding. We
demonstrated previously that population of the Zn(II) site in AMT1 does not alter the ability of the protein to bind DNA but
bound Cu(I) ions are essential for DNA binding [Thorvaldsen, J. L., et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 9566-9577]. Second,
mutations in the N-terminal 42 residue segment reduce the Zn(II) content of purified mutant AMT1 molecules. The divalent metal site consists of ligands provided by three cysteinyl thiolates and a single histydyl
imidazole.  Thus, AMT1 and likely ACE1 consist of two contiguous modules,
residues 1-42 forming an independent Zn(II) module and <B>residues 43-110 enfolding a tetracopper cluster</B>.

The metal ion specificity of most 'zinc-finger' metal binding domains is unknown. The human estrogen receptor protein

evaluate directly the 71-residue ERDBD which showed a
high affinity for Cu and was <B>completely occupied with 4 Cu bound</B>; each Cu ion was evidently bound to only two ligand residues (net loss of only 2 Da per bound Cu). The Cu binding stoichiometry was confirmed by atomic absorption. These
results (i) provide the first direct physical evidence for the ability of the estrogen receptor DNA-binding domain to bind
Cu and (ii) document a <B>twofold difference in the Zn- and Cu-binding capacity</B>. Differences in the ERDBD domain structure with bound Zn and Cu are predicted.

J Mol Biol 206: 531-46 (1989)</PRE> 

Investigation of the copper-binding centre of Panulirus interruptus haemocyanin led to the discovery of a pseudo 2-fold
axis relating two helical pairs surrounding and co-ordinating the two copper ions. The pseudo 2-fold symmetry relating
one helical pair, co-ordinating Cu-A, to the second helical pair co-ordinating Cu-B is quite precise with 31 equivalent C
alpha atoms having a root-mean-square deviation of only 1.47 A. The 2-fold consists of a rotation of 174.6 degrees and a
translation parallel to the rotation axis of 0.7 A. After superposition of the helical pairs, the two copper ions are within
1.1 A and the three C alpha atoms of the histidine ligands of Cu-A are within a root-mean-square deviation of 1.0 A from
the C alpha atoms of the histidine residues co-ordinating Cu-B. Of the superimposed residues, 26% are identical in
sequence. These data suggest that the current oxygen-binding centre of arthropodan haemocyanins is the result of
dimerization, gene duplication and gene fusion of an <B>ancestral mono-copper-binding helical pair</B>.In the sequence of functional domains of molluscan haemocyanins only amino acid
sequence homology with the arthropodan Cu-B helical pair has been found and no evidence for similarity with a Cu-A
binding helical pair was observed. This provides strong evidence that a mono-copper-binding helical pair has been the
ancestor of both the arthropodan and molluscan haemocyanins. Haemerythrins  are less similar to each other than the two Cu-binding helical pairs in arthropodan haemocyanins.
Nevertheless, the Fe-B haemerythrin helical pair superimposes well onto the Cu-A helical pair of Panulirus haemocyanin.
A root-mean-square deviation of 1.9 A for 24 equivalent C alpha carbon atoms is obtained, while Fe-B deviates 1.4 A from
Cu-A after superposition of the helices. Moreover, the three histidine ligands of the Cu-A helical pair are equivalent with
three histidine ligands of the Fe-B pair. The structural similarity and correspondence in metal-binding ligands suggests
that both haemocyanins and haemerythrins have originated from an ancestral mono-metal-binding helical pair having two

Nitrous oxide reductase, Pseudomonas stutzeri, catalyses the 2 electron reduction of nitrous oxide to di-nitrogen.
The enzyme has 2 identical subunits (Mr approximately 70,000) of known amino acid sequence and contains
approximately <B>4 Cu ions per subunit</B>. The enzyme contains <B>2 distinct copper centres </B>of which one is assigned to an
electron-transfer function, centre A, and the other to a catalytic site, centre Z. The latter is a binuclear copper centre
with at least 1 cysteine ligand and cycles between oxidation levels Cu(II)/Cu(II) and Cu(II)/Cu(I) in the absence of
substrate or inhibitors.

The structural comparison of copper-containing proteins has provided a new dimension to the relationships suggested by
sequence similarities. Ryden (1988) summarized the putative relationships, suggesting that a primordial single-domain
cupredoxin evolved into the multidomain copper oxidases. The structures have revealed the fact that the differences reside
primarily in insertions and deletions at junctions between secondary-structure elements. The mechanism of evolution
(e.g., integration of new sequences into regions not essential to the Greek key fold) remains unknown.
<P>
 Which of the
properties of a cupredoxin fold are necessary for function is the subject of site-directed mutagenesis studies. Can two of
the ligands be interchanged (e.g., the upstream histidine and partially answered by the multidomain copper oxidase
structure. The Tyr-Cys-Thr sequence in plastocyanin (in which threonine is a member of the hydrogen-bonding pair) is
homologous with the His-Cys-His sequence in ascorbate oxidase. In the latter electron transfer is believed to flow from the
type I copper (bound by the cysteine) to the trinuclear cluster, probably via these histidine residues. Hence, one might
infer that the tyrosine and threonine have some role in electron transfer. 
<P>
Tyr-83 has been previously implicated in NMR
studies as a primary site of electron transfer. The multi-copper protein structures have revealed interesting new
features. The extra coppers are bound at domain interfaces, and can be single metals or the novel trinuclear cluster,
depending on the availability of liganding histidines. A structural model of ceruloplasmin suggests that it will have at least
two type I sites and, possibly, a third type I site such as stellacyanin (no methionine ligand), as well as a binding site for a
trinuclear cluster. 
<P>
The similarity of the sequences of N2O reductases and a domain of cytochrome oxidase to the sequences
of proteins with known structures suggests that these, too, will have Greek key domains. Galactose oxidase and hemocyanin
do not have Greek key folds in their functional domains, although each does have a Greek key domain. The need for a Greek
key fold remains obscure. The apoproteins are clearly stable without metals; there are examples other than
immunoglobulins of Greek key folds. So far <B>copper seems to be found in a very limited subset of structures</B>; zinc and iron have a much wider variety of environments in proteins. It may be
that the copper-containing Greek key proteins represent a very small evolutionary niche.<HR>

The prion protein PrPc is a glycoprotein of unknown function normally found in neurons and glia. It is involved in diseases
such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. PrPSc, an altered isoform of
PrPC that is associated with disease, shows greater protease resistance and is part of the infectious agent, the prion. Prion
diseases are characterized by neuronal degeneration, gliosis and accumulation of PrPSc. Mice devoid of PrPC are resistant
to scrapie. A fragment of human PrP consisting of amino acids 106-126 that forms fibrils in vitro is toxic to cultured
neurons. Here we show that this toxic effect requires the presence of microglia which respond to PrP106-126 by
increasing their oxygen radical production. The combined direct and microglia-mediated effects of PrP106-126 are toxic
to normal neurons but are insufficient to destroy neurons from mice not expressing PrPC.

Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a copper-binding protein in vertebrate plasma. It is the product of an <B>intragenic triplication</B> and is
composed of three homologous domains.. Two clones, CP-1 and CP-2, differed from each other by the

On the basis of the spatial structure of ascorbate oxidase [Messerschmidt, A., Rossi, A., Ladenstein, R., Huber, R.,
Bolognesi, M., Gatti, G., Marchesini, A., Petruzzelli, R. & Finazzi-Agro, A. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 206, 513-529], an
alignment of the amino acid sequence of the related blue oxidases, laccase and ceruloplasmin is proposed. This strongly
suggests a three-domain structure for laccase closely related to ascorbate oxidase and a six-domain structure of
ceruloplasmin. These domains demonstrate homology with the small blue copper proteins. The relationships suggest that
laccase, like ascorbate oxidase, has a mononuclear blue copper in domain 3 and a trinuclear copper between domain 1 and 3
and ceruloplasmin has mononuclear copper ions in domains 2, 4 and 6 and a trinuclear copper between domains 1 and 6.

protein.  The amino acid sequence of the light chain is homologous (40%) with
the carboxyl-terminal fragment (Mr, 73,000) of human factor VIII. Both fragments have a similar domain structure that
includes a single ceruloplasmin-related domain followed by two C domains. The carboxyl terminus of the connecting region,
however, shows no significant amino acid sequence homology with factor VIII. It is very acidic and contains a number of

The amino acid sequence of the copper-containing nitrite reductase (EC 1.7.99.3) from Achromobacter cycloclastes  has been determined. The subunit contains <STRONG>340
amino acids</STRONG>. The identity of the first seven amino acids is tentative. The sequence has been instrumental in the X-ray
structure determination of this molecule; in conjunction with the X-ray structure, ligands to a <STRONG>type I copper atom</STRONG> and a
<B>type II copper atom (one of each per subunit</B>) have been identified. Comparison of the sequence to those of multi-copper
oxidases such as ascorbate oxidase, laccase, and ceruloplasmin [Messerschmidt, A., & Huber, R. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem.
187, 341-352] reveals that each of two domains seen in the X-ray structure is similar to the oxidases and also to the
small blue copper-containing proteins such as plastocyanin. The combination of sequence and structural similarity to
ascorbate oxidase and sequence similarity to ceruloplasmin leads to a plausible model for the domain structure of
ceruloplasm.

J Clin Invest 97: 884-90 (1996) </PRE>

Oxidation of lipids and lipoproteins by macrophages is an important event during atherogenesis. Activation of monocytic
cells by zymosan and other agonists results in the release of multiple oxidant species and consequent oxidation of LDL. We
now show evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing acute phase reactant, is secreted by zymosan-activated U937
monocytic cells, and that the protein has an important role in LDL oxidation by these cells. In one approach, ceruloplasmin
has been shown to exhibit oxidant activity under the appropriate conditions. Exogenous addition of purified human
ceruloplasmin stimulates U937 cell oxidation of LDL to nearly the same extent as activation by zymosan. In contrast to
previous cell-free experiments (Ehrenwald, E., G.M. Chisom, and P.L. Fox. 1994. Intact human ceruloplasmin oxidatively
modifies low density lipoprotein. J. Clin. Invest. 93:1493-1501.) in which ceruloplasmin by itself (in PBS) oxidizes
LDL, under the conditions of the current experiments (in RPMI 1640 medium) ceruloplasmin only oxidizes LDL in the
presence of cells; the mechanism by which cells overcome the inhibition by medium components has not been ascertained.
 In summary, these
results are consistent with a mechanism in which cell-derived ceruloplasmin participates in oxidation of LDL. The data also show that <B>cellular factors in addition to ceruloplasmin, possibly active oxygen species and/or
lipoxygenases, are essential and act synergistically with ceruloplasmin to oxidize LDL</B>.

tissue-specific, with <B>no evidence of expression in brain</B>, heart or other extrahepatic tissues.  Biosynthetic studies indicated that the ceruloplasmin mRNA in mammary gland tissue was translated into a 132
kDa protein qualitatively similar to that synthesized in liver. By in situ hybridization, ceruloplasmin gene expression was
localized to the epithelium lining the mammary gland alveolar ducts, without evidence of expression in the surrounding

Rat ceruloplasmin was found to be more resistant to <B>plasmin-mediated
proteolysis</B> than was human ceruloplasmin. Both proteins were cleaved initially to products with apparent
molecular weights of 116,000 and 20,000 Da. Primary structure differences could account for the different relative
stabilities between the two enzymes. Kinetic analysis of rat ceruloplasmin produced a biphasic v vs v/s plot with apparentKm's of 40 and 1.5 microM for iron. Rat ceruloplasmin showed about one-fourth
the <STRONG>ferroxidase activity</STRONG> and had a much broader pH profile than that of human ceruloplasmin. Rates of <STRONG>p-phenylenediamine

The incorporation of tritiated thymidine into CCL-39 cells grown in the absence of fetal calf serum or other growth factors
is greatly increased by low concentrations of ceruloplasmin. The stimulation is greater than observed with serum or
thrombin. Addition of serum decreases the thymidine incorporation with ceruloplasmin to the level with serum alone. As
with serum, the response to ceruloplasmin is high at both 20% and 1% oxygen, which is consistent with the action of
<B>ceruloplasmin as an oxidant with a high affinity for oxygen</B>. Since transplasma membrane electron transport increases cell
growth and thymidine incorporation, <B>ceruloplasmin may act as a terminal oxidase for ferrous iron or ascorbate</B> to

The <B>CCC2 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is homologous to the human gene</B>s defective in Wilson disease and
Menkes disease. A biochemical hallmark of these diseases is a deficiency of copper in ceruloplasmin and other copper
proteins found in extracytosolic compartments. Here we demonstrate that disruption of the yeast CCC2 gene results in
defects in respiration and iron uptake. These defects could be reversed by supplementing cells with copper, suggesting that CCC2 mutant cells were copper deficient. However, cytosolic copper levels and copper uptake were normal. Instead, CCC2
mutant cells lacked a copper-dependent oxidase activity associated with the <B>extracytosolic domain</B> of the <B>FET3-encoded protein, a ceruloplasmin homologue</B> previously shown to be necessary for high-affinity iron uptake in yeast. Copper
restored oxidase activity both in vitro and in vivo, paralleling the ability of copper to restore respiration and iron uptake.

one another. At the same time, in Golgi vesicles of the kidney, <B>brain</B> and liver the mature molecular forms of CP differ not

CP, contain only one isoform of CP</B>. The secreted form of CP was found to be tissue-nonspecific. The third molecular form

much more powerful protective effect on RBC in copper-induced lysis. It was found, however, that CP2 (native CP devoided
of CP1) protected RBC as well as CP despite its inability of binding to RBC membrane. CP and CP1 in a similar way
decrease copper concentration in RBC. It was shown that copper accumulation and GSH decrease in RBC are two independent
and concurrent processes; the copper and GSH concentrations are not the factors determining RBC resistance to hemolysis.
CP inhibits the <B>reaction of superoxide radicals generation as a result of Cu interaction with -SH groups</B> of RBC membrane;
the <B>effect is more pronounced than the effect of catalase or superoxide dismutase</B>. CP and CP1 preparations equally inhibit
this reaction. Apparently CP reception on RBC leads not only to <B>membrane protection from superoxide and hydroxyl
radicals but represents a more complex process</B>.

The dimeric Vinca alkaloid vinblastine (VLB) undergoes metabolic transformation to three products in a reaction <B>catalyzed
by the human serum copper oxidase ceruloplasmin</B>. The enzyme reaction requires chlorpromazine as a shuttle oxidant, and
the course of the oxidation reaction appears to be subject to the nature of the shuttle oxidant used. Preparative-scale
incubations have resulted in the isolation of three products, which were characterized by chemical and spectral analyses.
The metabolites were identified as the ring fission product catharinine, obtained by oxidation of the Iboga ring system; an
enamine/ether derivative obtained by oxidation of the Aspidosperma portion of VLB; and a metabolite embodying the same
structural changes in both parts of the vinblastine dimeric structure. Catharinine is identical with the product of VLB
oxidation obtained by peroxidase oxidation. The other two products are new metabolites and are derivatives of VLB.

A processed <B>pseudogene</B> for human ceruloplasmin has been isolated that contains DNA corresponding to the functional gene
sequence encoding the <B>carboxy-terminal 563 amino acid residues</B> and the 3' untranslated region. The pseudogene appears to
have <B>arisen from a processed RNA species</B>, since intervening sequences coincident with those of the functional gene have
been removed, with the exception of a short segment of intronic sequence which denotes the 5' boundary of the pseudogene.
The nucleotide sequence of the pseudogene is <B>highly homologous</B> (97% sequence identity) with that of the wild-type gene,
suggesting that pseudogene formation was a relatively recent evolutionary event. In addition to single base substitutions,
there is a large 213 base pair (bp) deletion in the pseudogene sequence which corresponds to the location of an
intron-exon junction in the functional gene. A 4 bp duplication that occurs at amino acid residue 683 of the wild-type
coding sequence results in a frameshift mutation and introduces a premature translational termination codon at this point.
This is concordant with the inability to detect a human liver transcript corresponding to the pseudogene by nuclease S1
mapping analysis. The 3' end of the pseudogene is characterized by a 62 bp segment composed mainly of repeated TC
dinucleotides. On the basis of genomic Southern blot analysis performed under high-stringency conditions, the pseudogene
that we have identified<B> seems to comprise the only sequence in the human genome that is closely related to the wild-type
gene</B>. Using somatic cell hybridization, we have mapped the pseudogene to human chromosome 8.

To correlate genotype with response to <B>early copper histidine therapy</B> in Menkes disease, an X-linked disorder of copper
transport, we performed mutational analysis in 2 related males who began treatment at the age of 10 days and prenatally at
32 weeks' gestation, respectively. A G to T transversion at the -1 exonic position of a splice donor site was identified,
predicting a glutamine to histidine substitution at codon 724 of the Menkes copper-transporting ATPase gene. The Q724H
mutation disrupts proper splicing and generates <B>five mutant transcripts that skip from one to four exons</B>. None of these
transcripts is predicted to encode a functional copper transport protein. <B>Copper histidine treatment normalized circulating
copper and ceruloplasmin</B> levels but did not improve the baseline deficiency of <B>dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, a

Wilson's disease: a new gene and an animal model for an

J Investig Med 43: 323-36 (1995) 

<B>Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive, inherited disorder of copper metabolism</B>. In normal individuals, copper
homeostasis is controlled by the balance between intestinal absorption of dietary copper and hepatic excretion of excess
copper in bile. In Wilson's disease, hepatic copper is neither excreted in bile nor incorporated into ceruloplasmin and
copper accumulates to toxic levels. The Wilson's disease gene (WND)<B> encodes a putative copper-transporting protei</B>n that
is expressed almost exclusively in the liver. The predicted structure of the protein product is that of a <B>P-type ATPase with
striking homology to bacterial copper transporters and the gene product of another inherited disorder of copper
metabolism, Menkes' disease</B>.  Clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease  indirectly after the release of copper from the liver
with subsequent damage to the brain (neuropsychiatric presentation) and other organs. 
<P>
.
Management of Wilson's disease involves decreasing excess levels of copper accumulated in the liver, brain, and other
organs. Copper chelation therapy, to increase urinary excretion of copper, is the mainstay of treatment. In addition, oral
zinc therapy may be useful at decreasing absorption of dietary copper and rendering tissue copper nontoxic, by increasing
the formation of complexes with copper-binding proteins. Liver transplantation can be necessary for individuals with
acute hepatic failure or complications of cirrhosis. Gene therapy may evolve in the future; however, medical management
is effective in most patients.

for 3 glycoproteins, human ceruloplasmin, human and rat transferrin. Radiolabeled glycoproteins were chased through
purified rat liver endothelium and then fractionated by lectin affinity chromatography. Endothelium processed
glycoproteins were fractionated by RCA120 chromatography into sialylated and desialylated components. The latter was

triantennary chain of glycan. Desialylation was minimal in the case of human transferrin which contains mostly
biantennary branching pattern. Thus, it appears that a <B>single triantennary glycan chain is necessary and sufficient to

Copper-64 studies are presented of 2 patients with non-Wilsonian movement disorder and with abnormal copper handling.
Both patients differed from the usual phenotype of non-Wilsonian low copper movement disorder as they had choreiform
movement disorders with an onset in the first decade; one patient lacked significant intellectual impairment. Both patients
had reduced serum total copper and marginal free copper and caeruloplasmin levels, and both patients were capable of
incorporating 64Cu2+ into caeruloplasmin but the second case did so at markedly reduced level. Both showed slightly
increased basal and stimulated urinary copper loss compared to normal controls with the rate in patient 1 being capable of
leading to copper depletion. Liver copper content was normal in both cases. These 2 patients add to the reports of cases with

We report two brothers with complete caeruloplasmin deficiency. The brothers presented with dementia and diabetes
mellitus. Twelve relatives have partial caeruloplasmin deficiency. There is no copper overload. Transmission is autosomal
recessive. DNA analysis showed genetic linkage between the deficiency and various polymorphic markers flanking the
caeruloplasmin gene on chromosome 3q25. This is consistent with a mutation of the caeruloplasmin gene. Caeruloplasmin
catalyses the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron. Both brothers have low serum iron and increased liver iron. The
index patient was given caeruloplasmin-containing, fresh-frozen plasma. A dose of 2.6 mg caeruloplasmin increased
serum iron from 5 microM/l to 10 microM/l. A dose of approximately 72 mg increased serum iron from 5 microM/l to
19 microM/l. The abnormal serum and liver iron levels, and the caeruloplasmin-induced rise in serum iron, confirm a
previous suggestion that caeruloplasmin maintains the normal rate of flow of iron from store to transferrin. Dementia and
diabetes mellitus have been described in only one other homozygote. The absence of copper overload, and the linkage of the
deficiency with chromosome 3q25, distinguish this condition from Wilson's disease.

also displayed an iron-dependent increase in O2 consumption. Treatment of spheroplasts with trypsin or affinity-purified
antibodies directed against the putative external ferroxidase domain of Fet3 had no effect on basal O2 consumption but
inhibited the iron-dependent increase in O2 consumption. Anti-peptide antibodies directed against the cytosolic domain of
Fet3 had no effect on O2 consumption. These studies indicate that Fet3 is a plasma membrane ferroxidase required for high

Biochemistry 31: 3777-85 (1992) 

Activated factor V (Va) serves as an essential protein cofactor for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa.
Analysis of the factor V cDNA indicates that the protein contains several types of internal repeats with the following domain
structure: A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of genomic DNA coding for
human factor V. The factor V gene contains 25 exons which range in size from 72 to 2820 bp. The structure of the gene for
factor V is similar to the previously characterized gene for factor VIII. Based on the aligned amino acid sequences of the two
proteins, 21 of the 24 intron-exon boundaries in the factor V gene occur at the same location as in the factor VIII gene. In
both genes, the junctions of the A1-A2 and A2-A3 domains are each encoded by a single exon. In contrast, the boundaries
between domains A3-C1 and C1-C2 occur at intron-exon boundaries, which is consistent with evolution through domain
duplication and exon shuffling. The connecting region or B domain of factor V is encoded by a single large exon of 2820 bp.
The corresponding exon of the factor VIII gene contains 3106 bp. The 5' and 3' ends of both of these exons encode sequences
homologous to the carboxyl-terminal end of domain A2 and the amino-terminal end of domain A3 in ceruloplasmin. There
is otherwise no homology between the B domain exons.<HR>

The first analysis of the secondary structure of human factor VIII light chain was performed by c.d. spectroscopy. The
purification process described in this paper allowed us to obtain the large amounts of purified factor VIII light chains
required for c.d. experiments. Since this 80 kDa protein is non-covalently associated with a heavy chain to form the active
molecule, isolated factor VIII light chains were obtained after immunoadsorption and dissociation of the immobilized active
complexes by EDTA. Furthermore, factor VIII light chains were discriminated from the residual active complexes and the
free heavy chains by a final ion-exchange-chromatography step. This f.p.l.c. analysis showed that factor VIII light chains
were less electronegative than the active complexes. The results of conformational analysis by c.d. show that the protein
possesses a high degree of regular secondary structure (58%) with approx. 22% of alpha-helix and 36% of beta-strand
structures. The protein was completely unfolded by 3 M-guanidine hydrochloride. The results obtained from the analysis of
c.d. spectra were compared with those predicted from three different statistical methods based on amino-acid sequence. The
secondary structure information obtained from these methods was in good agreement with the c.d. results. These results
were comparable with the secondary structure prediction of ceruloplasmin, a protein known to show sequence identity to
factor VIII.

Biochim Biophys Acta 1128: 211-9 (1992) 

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is oxidized by cellular and noncellular mechanisms, both leading to an increased binding to
collagen. We have investigated the effect of serum on lipid peroxidation, apoprotein oxidation and the binding of oxidized
apoprotein to collagen. During noncellular oxidation, lipoprotein-deficient serum strongly inhibited all three processes.
The serum fraction of M(r) > 100,000 was equally inhibitory; this effect was not due to alpha 1 or gamma globulins,
alpha 2 macroglobulins, haptoglobins or ceruloplasmin. The serum fraction of M(r) 30,000-100,000 stimulated the
binding of oxidized apoprotein but the albumin in this fraction inhibited lipid peroxidation and apoprotein oxidation. Serum
ultrafiltrate (M(r) < 1000) inhibited lipid and protein oxidation, and binding; the inhibitory effect was abolished by
deionization which removed histidine. The effects of lipoprotein-deficient serum and its fractions on cellular oxidation
were similar but weaker than those on noncellular oxidation, HDL inhibited noncellular oxidation as well as binding of
oxidized apoprotein. VLDL also inhibited oxidation; this could not be accounted for by its content of apo B. If present in vivo,
these inhibitory effects would completely suppress both cellular and noncellular oxidation of LDL and its subsequent
binding to collagen. <HR>

The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells contains an <B>NADH oxidase</B> which can transfer electrons across the membrane.
This oxidase is controlled by hormones, growth factors and other ligands which bind to receptors in the plasma membrane.
Oncogenes also affect activity of the oxidase. Natural serum components such as diferric transferrin and ceruloplasmin
which stimulate proliferation also stimulate membrane oxidase activity. Additional growth factors can be required to
complement the proliferative effect. Electron transport across the plasma membrane can be measured by the reduction of
impermeable electron acceptors, such as ferricyanide, which also stimulate cell growth. The oxidants activate
growth-related signals such as cytosolic alkalinization and calcium mobilization. Antiproliferative agents such as
adriamycin and retinoic acid inhibit the plasma membrane electron transport. <B>Flavin, Coenzyme Q and an iron chelate on

<H4>Evolution of blue copper proteins. </H4>

Prog Clin Biol Res 274: 349-66 (1988) </PRE>

The <B>evolutionary relationships of blue copper proteins</B> are reviewed. Five homologous families of small blue proteins are
recognized. Despite differences in length their peptide chains can all be accommodated into the eight-stranded fold of
plastocyanin with some adjustments at three of the loops and the two termini. The C-termini of the blue oxidases
ceruloplasmin and Neurospora laccase also fit into this fold and they are suggested to be homologous to the small blue
proteins. The alignment of their amino acid sequences suggest some of the histidines to be binding active site copper. A
superposition of the structures of poplar plastocyanin and bovine Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed that 68 out of
99 alpha-carbons in plastocyanin overlapped with corresponding atoms in SOD with a rms distance of 2.99 A. In addition
three of the histidine residues that were proposed to be copper-binding in laccase and ceruloplasmin aligned with ligands to
the Cu-Zn pair in a SOD. Thus also <B>SOD might be related to the blue proteins</B>.

The physiological function of the prion protein (PrP) is unknown, but there is strong evidence that the infec ious agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (the prion) consists at least in part of PrPsC, a mod)fied form of the normally occurring cellular PrP (PrPC)~. Both forms of PrP are encoded in a single exon of the PrP gene.
<p>
 Goldgaber in his Scientific Correspondence noted a large open reading frame (ORF) on the antisense strand of the coding regions of mammalian PrP genes. Several genetic traits influencing spongiform encephalopathies in humans and animals have been linked to the PrP gene. If an 'anti-PrP' existed it could be responsible for the properties formerly ascribed to the prion protein. In support of this hypothesis, Hewinson and colleagues detected a 4.5-kilobase RNA in bovine brain which hybridized to PrP sense riboprobes, and which was thus expected to represent a PrP antisense transcript. 
<p>
We have found a similar 4.5-kb mRNA in normal and scrapie infected hamsters and in mice; however, our results show that this presumed 'anti-prior protein' RNA is not derived from the antisense strand of the PrP gene.  We detected a 4.5-kb 'antisense'  RNA in brains of normal and scrapie infected hamsters at approximately the same level, as judged by northern analysis. The 4.5-kb RNA was polyadenylated and was <b>not found in tissues other than brain</b>. The fact that the 4.5-kb RNA was detected under stringent hybridization conditions initially suggested that the 'anti-PrP' RNA was transcribed from the opposite strand of the hamster PrP gene.
<p>

If indeed the 4.5-kb RNA were an antisense transcript of the PrP gene, then it should be absent or at least altered in mice homozygous for partially deleted PrP genes (Prn-p0~0)6. Using the above hamster probe A, which was shown to cross-hybridize to 'anti-PrP RNA from wild-type mouse brain, we detected the 4.5-kb RNA also in mice with Prp genes . Because probe A extended beyond the partial deletion in the PrP gene of PrP mice, we used an additional probe which lies entirely with in the deleted region. It de tected the same 4.5-kb RNA in both types of mice . These results unequivocally show that the 4.5-kb RNA is <b>not derived from the opposite strand</b> of the murine PrP gene; however, <b>it appears to share considerable homology with the antisense strand</b> of the PrP gene.
<p>
Our results confirm the presence of the 4.5-kb 'anti-PrP' RNA in two additional species, show that its concentration is not greatly altered after scrapie infection, and demonstrate that the RNA is not derived from the PrP gene. If the 4.5-kb mRNA, despite its being
derived from a locus other than the PrP gene, encoded an 'anti-prior protein', this might have intriguing implications. It has recently been described for four independent proteins that peptides encoded by antisense sequences correspond structurally to binding proteins or receptors. Thus, a putative 'anti-prion protein' may be pertinent to the normal function of the prion protein.

<p>
A host-encoded prion protein (PrP) is crucial in the pathogenesis of transmissible  spongiform encephalopathies, such as scrapie, produce changes in complementary scrapie and scrapie-like diseases in man and PrP and anti-PrP mRNAs. The PrP gene is highly conserved in protein evolution and contains a single open reading. Several mutations in the human homologue prospective encoded protein, especially in PRNP gene were found in patients with view of its potential role in transmissible familial Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker's syndrome (GSS) and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD). While analysing PrP complementary DNA sequences with the DNA Strider computer program,  I found a large overlapping ORF in the DNA strand opposite to the PrP transcriptional unit. The deduced amino acid sequence of the prospective encoded protein was unique. Its hydropathy plot is almost a mirror image of that of the PrP. For simplicity the name of anti-PrP is used in reference to this putative protein. 
<p>
This ORF may be of biological importance first, because it is as large as the PrP ORF. Second, none of the differences in PrP  sequences found in patients or animals resulted in additional stop codons in this ORF. It should be noted, however, that mutations found in GSS patients in codons 102 and 117 of the PRNP gene produced amino-acid changes in the anti-PrP, whereas mutations found in CJD patients in codon 178 and 200 did not. Third, there are ATG or CTG codons at the beginning of this ORF which could serve as translation initiation codons. Fourth, existing data on PrP gene expression do not exclude expression of the anti-PrP gene because only double-stranded DNA probes were used to detect PrP messenger RNA. 
<p>
Obviously, only direct experimental analysis of infected and uninfected cells and tissues with single-stranded probes will show whether the anti-PrP gene is expressed.The expression of the anti-PrP gene would introduce a new player, present a different view of scrapie infection, and raise new and important questions. Do PrP and anti-PrP proteins interact in infected cells? Do RNA unwindases capable of modifying double-stranded RNA...  Do GSS mutations, which, unlike CJD mutations, result in amino-acid changes in both proteins, explain the differences between the two? In conclusion, the existence of a long anti frame (ORF) located within a large exon. PrP ORF clearly warrants a search for the

<p>
The normal function of the pathogenicity-related protein, PrP (or prion protein), is
unknown. We have characterized a candidate
marsupial PrP gene.A particular feature of the marsupial[and mink] gene is the lack of a continuous ORF on the antisense strand, as is found in most eutherian PrP. We propose that antisense ORFs found in other species are artefactual.
<p>
<i>[The authors argue in the body of the paper that 5% of eukcaryotic genes have these open reading frames in the anti-gene, that this is a consequence of low useage of anti-codons to the stop codons to speed synthesis, that the hydrophobicity reversal is a simple property of the genetic code, and that all known long ORFs are in phase.  -- webmaster]</i>

<H3><CENTER>Results of search for <A NAME="homology">homology</A> with <A HREF="http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/blastepfl.pl">Blastx</A></CENTER></H3>
This amazing free and fast online search tool compares a submitted nucleotide sequence, here bovine prion, to a huge database of known protein sequences ( 184,520 sequences; 57,747,617 total letters, updated daily) in all six reading frames.  This searches for holmology in the sense strant, the anti-sense strand, and various frame-shifts.  No significant homology  to any known sequence was found, leaving the origin of the prion gene family as mysterious as ever.
Puzzling, because prions are quite conservative -- it is easly to align bovine with marsupial, lines that diverged 135,00,000 years ago.  Chickens have a hexapeptide repeat instead of an octapeptide but align fairly well later.  Going back farther, nothing homologous was found in nematode, fruit fly, or yeast, despite some false alarms.  Better tools such as hidden markov matrices might find homology in the 'twilight zone' of sub-25% alignments.  
<P>
Taken at face value, this leaves prions emerging more or less with the appearance of the vertebrates and not being part of any protein super-family.  Normally, proteins appear from diverging gene duplications or domain assembly, but if so here, the orginal gene cannot yet be found.  So we are left without the usual clues as to the biological function of normal prion protein or its domain.

The structural gene for prion (Prn-p) has been mapped to mouse chromosome
2.
A second murine locus, Prn-i, which is closely linked to Prn-p, determines
the length of the incubation period for scrapie in mice (<A HREF="#Reference10">Carlson
et al., 1986</A>).
Yet another gene controlling scrapie incubation times, symbolized
Pid-1, is located on mouse chromosome 17.
<A HREF="#Reference91">Scott et al. (1989)</A> demonstrated that transgenic
mice harboring the prion protein gene from the Syrian hamster, when
inoculated with hamster scrapie prions, exhibited scrapie infectivity,
incubation times, and prion protein amyloid plaques characteristic
of the hamster.
<A HREF="#Reference45">Hsiao et al. (1994)</A> found that 2 lines
of transgenic mice expressing high levels of the mutant P101L prion
protein developed a neurologic illness and central nervous system
pathology indistinguishable from experimental murine scrapie.
Amino acid 102 in human prion protein corresponds to amino acid 101
in mouse prion protein; hence, the P101L murine mutation was the equivalent
of the pro102-to-leu mutation
which causes Gerstmann-Straussler disease in the human.
<A HREF="#Reference45">Hsiao et al. (1994)</A> reported serial transmission
of neurodegeneration to mice who expressed the P101L transgene at
low levels and Syrian hamsters injected with brain extracts from the
transgenic mice expressing high levels of mutant P101L prion protein.
Although the high-expressing transgenic mice accumulated only low
levels of infectious prions in their brains, the serial transmission
of disease to inoculated recipients argued that prion formation occurred
de novo in the brains of these uninoculated animals and provided additional
evidence that prions lack a foreign nucleic acid.

<P>
Studies on PrP knockout mice have been reported by <A HREF="#Reference8">Bueler
et al. (1994)</A>, <A HREF="#Reference58">Manson et al. (1994)</A>,
and <A HREF="#Reference88">Sakaguchi et al. (1996)</A>.
<A HREF="#Reference88">Sakaguchi et al. (1996)</A> reported that the
PrP knockout mice produced by them were apparently normal until the
age of 70 weeks, at which point they consistently began to show signs
of cerebellar ataxia.
Histologic studies revealed extensive loss of Purkinje cells in the
majority of cerebellar folia.
Atrophy of the cerebellum and dilatation of the fourth ventricle were
noted.
Similar pathologic changes were not noted in the PrP knockout mice
produced by <A HREF="#Reference8">Bueler et al. (1994)</A> and by
<A HREF="#Reference58">Manson et al. (1994)</A>.
<A HREF="#Reference88">Sakaguchi et al. (1996)</A> noted that the
difference in outcome may be due to strain differences or to differences
in the extent of the knockout within the PrP gene.
Notably, in all 3 lines of PrP knockout mice described, susceptibility
to prion infection was lost.
<P>
Based on their studies in PrP null mice, <A HREF="#Reference19">Collinge
et al. (1994)</A> concluded that prion protein is necessary for normal
synaptic function.
They postulated that inherited prion disease may result from a dominant
negative effect with generation of PrP-Sc, the posttranslationally
modified form of cellular PrP ultimately leading to progressive loss
of functional PrP (PrP-C).
<A HREF="#Reference98">Tobler et al. (1996)</A> reported changes in
circadian rhythm and sleep in PrP null mice and stressed that these
alterations show intriguing similarities with the sleep alterations
in fatal familial insomnia.
<P>
<A HREF="#Reference11">Chapman et al. (1996)</A> demonstrated fatal
insomnia and significant thalamic pathology in a patient heterozygous
for the pathogenic lysine mutation at codon 200 
and homozygous for methionine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene.
They stressed the similarity of this phenotype to that associated
with mutations in codon 178 
<P>
<h3><A NAME="ALLELIC VARIANTS">ALLELIC VARIANTS</A></h3>

<A HREF="#Reference71">Owen et al. (1989)</A> demonstrated an insertion
in the open reading frame of the prion gene that tracked with Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in a family.
This was identified by an MspI polymorphism.
With this restriction enzyme, controls and unaffected family members
showed a single band; similar analysis of DNA from lymphocytes or
postmortem brain tissue of affected individuals showed 2 bands.
Restriction mapping suggested that the atypical band resulted from
an insertion of about 150 bp in the open reading frame of the PRNP
gene.
Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), <A HREF="#Reference71">Owen
et al. (1989)</A> confirmed the presence of the insertion.
<A HREF="#Reference15">Collinge et al. (1989)</A> used the polymerase
chain reaction to screen DNA samples from 12 unrelated persons with
various familial dementias and ataxias for mutation in part of the
prion protein gene.
In a family in which GSD was not previously suspected, 2 members were
found to have a 0.15-kb insertion similar in size to that found in
another kindred with pathologically proven spongiform encephalopathy.
<A HREF="#Reference16">Collinge et al. (1990)</A> reported further
on the family with presenile dementia in which GSD had been diagnosed
on the basis of prion protein gene analysis which showed the 144-bp
inframe insertion in the open reading frame previously identified
by Owen et al. (<A HREF="#Reference71">1989</A>, <A HREF="#Reference70">1990)</A>.
Extensive histologic examination of the brain of an affected individual
showed no characteristic features of either GSD or Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
This indicates that spongiform encephalopathy cannot always be excluded
on neuropathologic grounds in a person dying of a dementing condition,
and, therefore, that the true prevalence of these diseases is likely
to be underestimated.
From genealogic and molecular studies in 4 families in which early-onset
dementia was inherited as an autosomal dominant, <A HREF="#Reference78">Poulter
et al. (1992)</A> demonstrated that the 4 families derived from 4
sibs whose parents were born in the late 18th century in southeast
England.
The disease was closely linked to a 144-bp insertion in the open reading
frame of the PRNP gene; maximum lod = 11.02 at theta = 0.
In the general population, the PRNP gene is polymorphic at codon 129
where approximately 30% of the population have valine and 70% methionine.
The insertion in this extended family was always within a methionine-129
allele.
<A HREF="#Reference78">Poulter et al. (1992)</A> found that the age
of death of affected individuals whose normal allele also encoded
methionine at codon 129 (<A HREF="#AllelicVariant0005">176640.0005</A>)
was significantly lower than those whose normal allele encoded valine.
The clinical features were highly variable; the neuropathologic findings,
as described by <A HREF="#Reference14">Collinge et al. (1992)</A>,
sometimes included spongiform encephalopathy.
At various times family members had carried diagnoses of Alzheimer
disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, myoclonic epilepsy,
atypical dementia, Pick disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Straussler
syndrome.

<P>
In a family with affected members in 3 generations and a second family
with affected members in 4 generations, <A HREF="#Reference42">Hsiao
et al. (1989)</A> showed that a change in codon 102 of the prion protein
gene is linked to the putative gene for GSD.
Furthermore, substitution of leucine for proline at codon 102 may
play a pathogenic role in the etiology of the disease.
The pro-to-leu change resulted from substitution of thymine for cytosine
in the second position of codon 102, creating a DdeI restriction site.
On the basis of clinical and pathologic criteria, <A HREF="#Reference42">Hsiao
et al. (1989)</A> classified the Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome into
3 forms: an ataxic form, for which the pro-to-leu substitution seems
to be characteristic; a dementing form; and a dementing form that
is accompanied by pathologic quantities of neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs).
If the leucine substitution at codon 102 arose independently in the
2 pedigrees studied, a likely possibility, it may represent more than
a linked genetic marker and may itself provoke the development of
GSD.
Although the composition of the GSD prion remained to be determined,
it is likely that it is composed largely, if not entirely, of an abnormal
isoform of the human prion protein.
The pro102-to-leu substitution was found in none of a random sample
of 100 Caucasian persons.
<A HREF="#Reference39">Goldgaber et al. (1989)</A> found the same
mutation in a family with 3 persons affected with GSD.
The base substitution responsible for the change in codon 102 may
have involved deamination of a methylated cytosine situated 5-prime
to guanine, a CpG mutation.
The proline at codon 102 seems to be highly conserved, as all rodent
proline genes sequenced to date also encode a proline at the equivalent
codon.
<A HREF="#Reference23">Doh-ura et al. (1989)</A> reported that the
leu102 mutation was found in all 11 Japanese GSD patients studied.
<A HREF="#Reference93">Speer et al. (1991)</A> added to the evidence
that the pro102-to-leu mutation is responsible for GSD; in a large
German family they found a peak lod score of 1.15 at a recombination
fraction of 0.00 for linkage between the mutation and the disease.
Combined with previous data, the peak lod score of 4.52 at theta =
0.0 was obtained with no evidence of linkage heterogeneity in the
combined data.
Three asymptomatic members of the German family carried the substitution;
their ages, 41, 42, and 42, were below the mean for age of onset (47
years) for GSD in this family.
<A HREF="#Reference40">Goldhammer et al. (1993)</A> described an Ashkenazi
Jewish family living in Israel in which Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome
was due to the pro102-to-leu mutation in the PRNP gene.

<P>

In a study of mutations in PRNP in patients with GSD, <A HREF="#Reference42">Hsiao
et al. (1989)</A> identified a PvuII polymorphism at codon 117 resulting
from a 'silent' adenine-to-guanine substitution at the third position
of alanine codon 117.
This polymorphism was present in 1 of 2 families with a pro102-to-leu
substitution.

<P>

A French patient was found by <A HREF="#Reference23">Doh-ura et al.
(1989)</A> to have a change from alanine to valine in codon 117.
The patient with the val117 mutation was a member of an Alsatian GSD
family that had at least 8 affected individuals spread over 4 generations.
Although the Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome in Doh-ura's family presented
with a dementia, so-called 'telencephalic Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome.'
<A HREF="#Reference60">Mastrianni et al. (1995)</A> presented a family
in which heterozygotes for the identical mutation at codon 117 but
presented with ataxia rather than dementia.
No additional mutations were found at the polymorphic codon 129.
Valine was encoded by both alleles in the proband.
There was an additional silent GCA-to-GCG mutation at codon 117 on
the normal allele.
The authors suggested that other factors must be responsible for the
ataxic presentation in this family rather than the telencephalic presentation
in the previous families described for the same mutation.

<P>
The proband in the French family with GSD and the ala117-to-val substitution
<A HREF="#Reference23">Doh-ura
et al., 1989</A>) was heterozygous for the PvuII polymorphism listed.
Clones from the PvuII(-) allele were found to have 2 new nucleotide
changes: a C-to-T transition at the second letter of codon 117 leading
to the alanine-to-valine change, and an A-to-G transition at the first
letter of codon 129 resulting in a methionine-to-valine substitution.
Since the val129 change was found in subjects unrelated to GSD, <A
HREF="#Reference23">Doh-ura et al. (1989)</A> concluded that it represented
a polymorphic change that is found in higher frequency in Caucasians.
<A HREF="#Reference70">Owen et al. (1990)</A> confirmed the conclusion
and suggested that the met129-to-val polymorphism might be useful
for genetic linkage studies of transmissible dementias in which mutation
in the PRNP gene had not yet been identified.
On the basis of studies in 36 Caucasians, they estimated that the
met129 allele had a frequency of 0.68 and the val129 allele 0.32.
They referred to these alleles as A1 and A2, respectively.
<P>
In a study of all patients in the United Kingdom who developed CJD
following treatment with human cadaveric pituitary hormone, <A HREF="#Reference17">Collinge
et al. (1991)</A> found a significant excess of val129 homozygotes.
In a further study, <A HREF="#Reference75">Palmer et al. (1991)</A>
found that 21 of 22 sporadic CJD cases and a further 19 of 23 suspected
sporadic CJD cases were homozygous at the polymorphic amino acid residue
129; 51% of the normal population was heterozygous at this site.
They interpreted these findings as suggesting that dimerization of
the prion protein is an important element in the pathogenesis of CJD
and that this is more likely to occur in homozygotes than in heterozygotes.
<A HREF="#Reference20">De Silva et al. (1994)</A> examined 29 cases
of sporadic CJD and found amyloid plaques in only 7.
In those patients with amyloid plaques, val/val at position 129 was
present in 0.43, met/val in 0.29, and met/met in 0.29.
These figures contrasted with the frequencies found in all sporadic
CJD cases that they reviewed: val/val in 0.9, met/val in 0.9, and
met/met in 0.83.
<A HREF="#Reference22">Doh-ura et al. (1991)</A> suggested that either
homozygosity or heterozygosity for the val129 mutation could result
in CJD in Japanese patients and that it usually took the form of Gerstmann-Straussler
disease.
<P>
<A HREF="#Reference33">Goldfarb et al. (1992)</A> reported the interesting
observation that when the val129 allele was present on the same chromosome
as the asp178-to-asn mutation, the phenotype was that of CJD,
whereas the met129/asn178 allele segregated with fatal familial insomnia.
The primary event in the pathogenesis of sporadic prion diseases is
thought to be an acquired conformational change of the normal prion
isoform that acts as a template, engendering the formation of insoluble
aggregates (<A HREF="#Reference5">Brown et al., 1991</A>; <A HREF="#Reference79">Prusiner,
1991</A>).
In inherited prion diseases, mutant isoforms would spontaneously assume
conformations depending on the mutation.
An interaction between methionine or valine at position 129 and asparagine
at position 178 might result in 2 abnormal isoforms that differ in
conformation and pathogenic consequences.
<P>
<A HREF="#Reference67">Monari et al. (1994)</A> provided an explanation
for the difference in phenotype of the asp178-to-asn mutation depending
on whether methionine or valine was present as residue 129.
They found that the abnormal isoforms of the prion protein in the
2 diseases differed both in the relative abundance of glycosylated
forms and in the size of the protease-resistant fragments.
The size difference was consistent with a different protease cleavage
site, suggesting a different conformation of the protease-resistant
prion protein present in the 2 diseases.
These differences were thought to be responsible for the type and
location of the lesions that characterized the 2 disorders.
Therefore, the combination of the mutation at codon 178 and the polymorphism
at codon 129 determines the disease phenotype by producing 2 altered
conformations of the prion protein.
See review of <A HREF="#Reference28">Gambetti et al. (1993)</A>.
<P>

In 2 patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from the same family,
<A HREF="#Reference39">Goldgaber et al. (1989)</A> found a substitution
of lysine for glutamic acid at residue 200, resulting from a G-to-A
transition changing GAG to AAG.
Studying an unusual cluster of cases of CJD in rural Slovakia, <A
HREF="#Reference37">Goldfarb et al. (1990)</A> found the codon 200
mutation in all 11 tested cases of 'focal CJD,' in 12 of 40 healthy
first-degree relatives, and in 6 of 23 other relatives.
By contrast, no extrafocal cases or their relatives had the mutation;
nor did any unrelated individuals within or outside the cluster regions.
One of the healthy individuals with the codon 200 mutation was the
75-year-old mother of one of the patients.
The unusually high incidence of CJD in the Orava and Lucenec regions
of Slovakia appears to be of recent origin.
<A HREF="#Reference37">Goldfarb et al. (1990)</A> interpreted this
as indicating that the mutation is a necessary but not sufficient
factor in the disease.
Another factor such as scrapie-infected sheep was proposed.
<A HREF="#Reference66">Mitrova et al. (1990)</A> described the familial
occurrence of 3 definite and 2 possible cases of CJD with temporal
and spatial separation in the area of focal CJD accumulation in Slovakia.
The incubation period appeared to be about 51 years, judging by the
interval between the death of the affected mother and the clinical
onset in the first affected child.
Affected offspring tended to die at the same time, not at the same
age.
Due to separation of the affected children, a possible common exposure
to CJD infection was limited to approximately 7 years during their
childhood.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference34">Goldfarb et al. (1991)</A> found the glu200-to-lys
mutation in 45 of 55 CJD-affected families studied at the NIH laboratory.
The families contained a total of 87 patients and originated from
7 different countries: Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Tunisia, Greece,
Libya, and Chile.
Neuropathologic verification was available in 47 patients, and brain
tissue from 14 patients transmitted disease to experimental primates.
All the patients originating from the cluster areas carried the mutation
but it was seen in only 1 of 103 unrelated control individuals from
the same areas and in none of 102 controls from other areas.
Branches of some families migrating from cluster areas to other countries
continued to have CJD over several generations.
<A HREF="#Reference27">Gajdusek (1991)</A> suggested that the glu200-to-lys
mutation may be frequent in Sephardic Jews and the descendants of
converted Sephardic Jews.
They found the mutation in Greek CJD patients who were Sephardic Jews
and in Sephardic Jews who had come for diagnosis to France from Tunisia
as well as in Sephardic Jews with CJD in Israel, both Libyan-born
and Israel-born.
Ashkenazic Jewish CJD patients did not have the codon 200 mutation.
<A HREF="#Reference27">Gajdusek (1991)</A> suggested that cases of
CJD in the Iberian Peninsula and perhaps those in Chile may represent
the codon 200 mutation inherited from Jewish ancestors converted to
Catholicism.
In reporting further on familial CJD in Chile, <A HREF="#Reference4">Brown
et al. (1992)</A> again suggested that Jewish migration from Spain
may have brought the mutation to South America.
<A HREF="#Reference13">Chapman et al. (1992)</A> reported the first
transmission of spongiform encephalopathy to a primate inoculated
with material from a Libyan Jew with the codon 200 mutation.
The incubation period was 6 years, but the authors commented that
even longer incubation periods have occasionally been observed.
<A HREF="#Reference26">Gabizon et al. (1993)</A> reported that the
lys200 mutation in Libyan Jewish patients is genetically linked to
CJD with a lod score of greater than 4.8.
No linkage was found between the development of familial CJD and the
polymorphism encoding either met or val at residue 129.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference31">Goldfarb et al. (1994)</A> estimated the penetrance
of the glu200-to-lys mutation to be 0.56.
<A HREF="#Reference12">Chapman et al. (1994)</A> estimated age-specific
penetrance of CJD among Libyan-Tunisian Jews carrying the glu200-to-lys
mutation, by performing lifetable analysis of 52 individuals with
definite or probable CJD and 34 clinically unaffected carriers of
the mutation.
The cumulative penetrance reached 50% at age 60 years and 80% at age
80.
If they included 7 elderly individuals with possible CJD, the penetrance
approached 100% by age 80.

<P>
In a study of the largest kindred yet studied, of German ancestry
with 368 members, 9 of whom were known to have died from CJD, <A HREF="#Reference1">Bertoni
et al. (1992)</A> identified a GAG-to-AAG transition in codon 200
resulting in substitution of lysine for glutamic acid.
Clinically, the CJD in this kindred was atypical with early supranuclear
gaze palsy but without myoclonus or characteristic electroencephalographic
periodicity patterns.
<P>
In a Finnish family with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, <A HREF="#Reference32">Goldfarb
et al. (1990)</A> described a GAC-to-AAC mutation at codon 178 of
the scrapie amyloid precursor gene.
<A HREF="#Reference68">Nieto et al. (1991)</A> found the same mutation,
which resulted in substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid, as
the cause of transmissible CJD in an American family of Dutch descent,
an American family of Hungarian descent, and a French family from
Brittany.
The Finnish family was the only familial CJD identified in that country
(<A HREF="#Reference41">Haltia et al., 1991</A>).
The pedigree included 15 affected members in 4 generations in a pattern
consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.
The mean age at onset was 47, periodic EEG activity was not observed,
and the mean duration of illness of 27.5 months was longer than usual
in either familial or sporadic CJD.
Neuropathologic examination of brain biopsy and autopsy specimens
showed spongiform change without amyloid plaques, and brain tissue
from 1 patient transmitted disease to a capuchin monkey.
<A HREF="#Reference33">Goldfarb et al. (1992)</A> identified the codon
178 mutation in 7 unrelated families of western European origin, among
which a total of 65 members were known to have died from CJD.
The mutation was detected in each of 17 tested patients, including
at least 1 affected member of each family, and in 16 of 36 of their
first-degree relatives, but not in affected families with other mutations,
patients with the nonfamilial form of the disease, or 83 healthy control
persons.
Linkage analysis in informative families yielded a lod score of 5.30,
which, because no recombinants were found, strongly suggests that
the codon 178 mutation is the cause of the disease.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference4">Brown et al. (1992)</A> compared a group of
43 patients from 7 families affected by CJD caused by the asp178-to-asn
mutation to a group of 211 patients with the sporadic form of the
disease.
In general the patients with the codon 178 mutation had an earlier
age of onset of illness (almost always presenting as an insidious
loss of memory), a longer duration of illness, and an absence of periodic
EEG activity.
Transmission of the disease to primates was accomplished using brain
tissue homogenates from 6 of 10 patients, resulting in significantly
shorter incubation periods than those due to sporadic CJD inocula.
These findings were interpreted as indicating an accelerated induction
of polymerized amyloid protein by its mutationally altered template
precursor.
<A HREF="#Reference4">Brown et al. (1992)</A> suggested that the earlier
age of onset in patients with the codon 178 mutation than in the sporadic
patient group may reflect differing rates at which normal host precursor
protein is converted into amyloid polymer.
If one accepts that an altered protein molecule may serve as a nucleating
template to initiate and sustain the conversion process, a 1-per-million
probability of its random occurrence would equal the worldwide incidence
of sporadic CJD.
Precursor protein that has a primary structure already altered by
the codon 178 mutation can be presumed to have a correspondingly altered
3-dimensional structure, and this structure may facilitate (by a millionfold)
its conversion to the beta-pleated sheet configuration of amyloid
fibrils.

<P>
An exception to the phenotypic rule of early onset found by <A HREF="#Reference4">Brown
et al. (1992)</A> was described by <A HREF="#Reference52">Laplanche
et al. (1992)</A> in a man who was well and professionally active
until the age of 57 years when he had onset of loss of memory, vertigo,
and disorientation, leading to professional disability 9 months later.
The presence of periodic EEG activity also distinguished him from
others carrying this mutation.
Multiple genetic or environmental factors may modulate the clinical
presentation of CJD associated with the codon 178 mutation.
<P>
The same asp178-to-asn mutation has been found as the cause also of
fatal familial insomnia;
the reason for the difference in phenotype was at first not clear.
<A HREF="#Reference38">Goldfarb et al. (1992)</A> demonstrated that
the particular allele in the met129-to-val polymorphism
was responsible for the difference.
CJD was associated with val129 in all 15 affected members of 6 kindreds,
whereas met129 was associated with FFI in all 15 affected members
of 5 kindreds.
<P>
Familial CJD was first described in the Backer family living in northern
Germany (<A HREF="#Reference65">Meggendorfer, 1930</A>).
Further clinical and neuropathologic details were reported by others.
Autopsies were performed on 3 members of this family in the 1920s
and 1940s.
<A HREF="#Reference50">Kretzschmar et al. (1995)</A> presented DNA
sequencing data from brain tissue that had been embedded in celloidin
72 years previously.
PCR amplification of DNA showed a GAC-to-AAC substitution at codon
178 of the prion protein gene.

<P>
The PRNP gene has an unstable region of 5 variant tandem octapeptide
coding repeats between codons 51 and 91.
Searching for the presence of extra repeats in this region, <A HREF="#Reference34">Goldfarb
et al. (1991)</A> screened 535 persons, including patients with sporadic
and familial forms of spongiform encephalopathy, members of their
families, other neurologic and nonneurologic patients, and normal
controls.
They identified 3 CJD families (in each of which the proband's disease
was neuropathologically confirmed and experimentally transmitted to
primates) that were heterozygous for alleles with 10, 12, or 13 repeats,
some of which had 'wobble' nucleotide substitutions.
They also found 1 person with 9 repeats and no nucleotide substitutions
who had no evidence of neurologic disease.
These observations, together with data on British patients with 11
and 14 repeats (Owen et al., <A HREF="#Reference71">1989</A>, <A HREF="#Reference70">1990</A>;
strongly suggested
that the occurrence of 10 or more octapeptide repeats in the encoded
amyloid precursor protein predisposes to CJD.
In an American family of English origin with an unusually early-onset
and long-duration form of CJD, <A HREF="#Reference4">Brown et al.
(1992)</A> found a heterozygous insert mutation in the region of repeating
octapeptide coding sequences between codons 51 and 91 of the PRNP
gene.
Affected members were 23 to 35 years old at the onset of the illness
which lasted from 4 to 13 years; yet experimental transmission of
disease from the proband, whose illness had gone on for 11 years,
produced a typically brief incubation period and duration of illness
in each of 3 inoculated primates.
Also, the PrP amyloid protein that accumulated in the brain of one
case with massive spongiform change was only barely detectable in
extracted brain tissue and was undetectable in another case with no
spongiform change.
The insert in this case consisted of 7 extra copies of the octapeptide
coding sequence.
Other families with extra octapeptide coding repeats showed similar
atypical features.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference49">Krasemann et al. (1995)</A> found heterozygosity
for an insertion mutation predicting 9 octapeptide repeats between
codons 51 and 91 in a 34-year-old woman with a 6 year history of progressive
dementia and ataxia.
The alignment of the insertion in this patient differed from that
reported previously.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference9">Campbell et al. (1996)</A> demonstrated a novel
4-octarepeat insertional mutation in a sporadic case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
The authors stated that since only 2 octarepeats are seen in the wildtype
allele and the mutant consists of four R2 repeat elements, the mutation
presumably evolved over several meioses.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference62">Medori et al. (1992)</A> used antibodies to
prion protein to perform dot and Western blot analyses, with and without
proteinase K, on brain tissue obtained at autopsy from 2 patients
with FFI, as well as 3 patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
and 6 control subjects.
Protease-resistant PrP was found in both patients with FFI, but the
size and number of protease-resistant fragments differed from those
in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
<A HREF="#Reference62">Medori et al. (1992)</A> found that in the
family with FFI, all 4 affected persons and 11 of the 29 unaffected
persons had a point mutation (GAC to AAC) in codon 178 resulting in
the substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid.
The mutation abolished a normal Tth111-I restriction site, permitting
the identification of the mutation in heterozygous state in other
members of the family.
Linkage analysis showed a close relation between the point mutation
and the disease (maximum lod score = 3.4 at theta = 0.0).
Precisely the same mutation had been described in families with the
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease phenotype .
The 3 families previously reported with the asp178-to-asn mutation
and the CJD phenotype were Hungarian-Romanian, Finnish, and French,
respectively.
The family with FFI was of Italian ancestry.
<A HREF="#Reference38">Goldfarb et al. (1992)</A> suggested that the
difference in phenotype resulting from the same mutation, asp178-to-asn,
was the consequence of the particular allele at the met129-to-val
polymorphism; all
FFI cases were met129.
In a French family with the asp178-to-asn mutation in the PRNP gene,
<A HREF="#Reference63">Medori and Tritschler (1993)</A> concluded
that the FFI phenotype was not influenced by polymorphic site 129
and that the variation in phenotype may reflect the action of modifier
loci or environmental influences.
They found that individuals with early or late onset had the met129-to-val
polymorphism.
Moreover, of 5 asn178 asymptomatic FFI persons, 2, aged 62 and 68
years, showed homozygous met129, while the other 3 had met129val.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference62">Medori et al. (1992)</A> identified the asp178-to-asn
mutation in another family with FFI.
The family was Italian.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference96">Tateishi et al. (1995)</A> reported the successful
transmission of fatal familial insomnia to experimental animals via
intercerebral injection of affected patient brain tissue, thus placing
FFI within the group of infectious cerebral amyloidoses.
The patient from whom brain tissue was obtained was thought to be
an isolated case but was later discovered to have ancestral ties to
a previously reported American FFI family (<A HREF="#Reference3">Bosque
et al., 1992</A>).
Illness began with episodic sensory, motor, and visual complaints
and thereafter followed a fairly typical course that included intractable
insomnia, with characteristic thalamic pathology, and the FFI genetic
'signature' PRNP genotype: asp178-to-asn and met129.
Like other affected members of the distantly related branch of his
family, he also had a 24-bp deletion between codons 51 and 91 (<A
HREF="#Reference84">Reder et al., 1995</A>).
Of the inoculated mice, 14 of 18 developed typical signs of spongiform
encephalopathy and died between days 397 and 506.

<P>

A variant form of Gerstmann-Straussler disease (GSD) was recognized
in a large Indiana kindred which was traced to the year 1792 (<A HREF="#Reference24">Farlow
et al., 1989</A>; <A HREF="#Reference29">Ghetti et al., 1989</A>).
In each of the generations since 1792, affected members have been
identified by either history or clinical examination.
The neuropathologic findings were unique in that unlike other GSD
patients with presenile onset of neurologic disability, all affected
subjects had widespread Alzheimer-type NFTs, composed of paired helical
filaments, in the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei.
The amyloid core of plaques was immunolabeled with antibodies raised
to PrP but not with antibodies raised to beta-amyloid.
There was an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.
A T-to-C transition in codon 198 leading to substitution of serine
for phenylalanine was demonstrated by <A HREF="#Reference44">Hsiao
et al. (1992)</A>.
<A HREF="#Reference21">Dlouhy et al. (1992)</A> showed absolute linkage
of the phe198-to-ser mutation to the clinical phenotype in this kindred.
Their studies suggested that methionine/valine heterozygotes at PRNP
codon 129 have a later age of onset of the disease than individuals
who are 129 valine/valine homozygotes.
<A HREF="#Reference30">Giaccone et al. (1992)</A> presented immunohistochemical
evidence that the major amyloid component in the GSD Indiana kindred
is an internal fragment of the prion protein and that full-length
abnormal isoforms of the prion protein and/or large prion protein
fragments accumulate in brain regions most affected by amyloid deposition.
The findings were considered supportive of the view that in this kindred
a stepwise degradation of PrP occurs in situ in the process of amyloid
fibril formation.

<P>
<A HREF="#Reference95">Tagliavini et al. (1994)</A> demonstrated that
in the Indiana family, the amyloid fibrils contained only mutant peptides.
The patients were heterozygous for the met-val polymorphism at PRNP
codon 129 (<A HREF="#AllelicVariant0005">176640.0005</A>).
In the amyloid of both patients, only val was present at position
129.
Since val129 was in coupling phase with ser198, the finding indicated
that only the mutant peptide was involved in amyloid formation.

<P>
In a Swedish family in which Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease
was associated with the development of both PrP amyloid plaques and
neocortical NFTs, similar to the findings in the Indiana kindred described
in  <A HREF="#Reference44">Hsiao
et al. (1992)</A> found a missense mutation resulting in the substitution
of arginine for glutamine at codon 217.
In this Swedish family, affected persons were heterozygous for the
met-val polymorphism at codon 129; as in the Indiana family, deposited
amyloid contained only val at position 129.
Since val129 was in coupling phase with arg217, the finding indicated
that only the mutant peptide was involved in amyloid formation.

<P>
In a 68-year-old woman with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, <A
HREF="#Reference77">Pocchiari et al. (1993)</A> described a G-to-A
transition in codon 210 resulting in the substitution of isoleucine
for valine.
In 4 of 22 patients with CJD whose recorded family history was negative
for demented illness, but in none of 103 healthy control subjects,
the same val210-to-ile mutation was found.
This and the finding that only the mutated protein accumulated in
the brain tissue of the proband supported the pathogenetic significance 
of the mutation.
However, 2 members of the proband's family were found to carry the
mutation without symptoms of CJD at ages 81 and 82 years.
Thus, environmental factors or reasons for incomplete penetrance may
be involved.

<P>
In a Japanese man, aged 53 years at the time of death, <A HREF="#Reference101">Yamada
et al. (1993)</A> related Gerstmann-Straussler disease to the presence
of heterozygosity for a CCA-to-CTA (pro-to-leu) change at codon 105.
It was accompanied by val at the codon 129 polymorphism .
The mother had died at age 78 after showing dementia for the last
3 years of her life but no other neurologic symptoms.
The propositus first noticed clumsiness of the right hand at age 42,
and then developed gait disturbance.
At age 49, he showed spastic paraparesis, ataxia, memory impairment,
and dysarthria.
He became bedridden at age 50 and underwent progressive decline and
intellectual function with death from ileus at age 53.

<P>
In a Japanese patient with CJD, <A HREF="#Reference47">Kitamoto et
al. (1993)</A> found a codon 180 mutation that resulted in a valine
to isoleucine change in the prion protein.
Clinical course was similar to that of the codon 178 mutation, in which the average
age of onset is about 9 years younger than that of CJD due to the
codon 200 mutation.

<P>
<a HREF="#Reference47">Kitamoto et al. (1993)</A> found a met232-to-arg
variant of the prion protein in combination with the val180-to-ile
mutation in 2 patients who had typical clinical and pathologic findings
of CJD.

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hydrophobicity graphic below shows where interior residues are likely to be located in the 3D prion structure; or alternatively, where a dimer or sticky surface patch might occur.  Known mouse prion secondary structure  overlies a colorized output of a SwissProt online tool for Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity, with a nine residue wide moving average window chosen as smoothing convolution.  The two-fold symmetry involving the 2nd and 3rd alpha helices does _not_ show up as an obvious sequence repeat, though it could reflect an ancient divergent internal duplication still visisble in the tertiary structure. 
<P>
Note the mysterious octapeptide repeat region has no prospects of either alpha helical structure or globular form, though periodicity in sequence must be reflected in periodicity in 3D structure.  Repeat residues are very strongly conserved back to the Devonian.  There is a 900% excess of tryptophan N-terminal over bulk protein; while these can't stack face to face without off-setting, they must be shielded from solvent. <FONT COLOR="663300">Posted 9.22.96; revised 1.2.96</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

The three helical regions reported for prion protein from NMR are generally conserved in length and sequence in homology alignment.  By assigning KD hydrophobicity values and averaging, a more representative picture of side chain use is obtained.  Note that helix H1 is rather anomalous in being consistently negative in the KD scale; this shows up in the associated <A HREF="/~tom/helical_wheel.html">helical wheels</A>.

</CENTER> <BLOCKQUOTE>Variability within each of the octapeptide repeat regions is tabulated for 28 species of placental mammals.  Thus, for the second repeat R2, three amino acid sequence variations occur with frequencies 26, 1, and 1.  It can be seen that the pre-repeat nonapeptide has the greatest variability (8 types) and the first repeat R1 the least (none).

Within a given species, repeats at the amino acid level are not always perfect.  However, beyond simple variations on the main theme, only a few other minor variants are found.  Using the key to read the table, we see that the line 1qg, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1g is interpreted as PQGGGGWGQ, PHGGGWGQ, PHGGGWGQ, PHGGGWGQ, PHGGGWGQ, PHGGGGWGQ for the bovine sequence.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We still wait  for Goldmann et al to post the cat prion sequence into Genbank (or publication) -- reported in 4 July 1996 Nature and used there to critique Southward's group. 
<P>
A better practise is to post newly sequenced species, as completed, into Genbank as this Dutch group has done.  Then scientists who have subscribed to SwissProt automatic alerting services, get the news in a timely fashion. The PNAS article has not come out, but the title suggests that prion evolutionary analysis supports the theory of punctuated equilibrium of Gould et al., that is, genes change most rapidly during times of rapid speciation and not during long lulls.  Whatever, it is good to have these new sequences...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Variations in the PrP gene sequences of apes</B>
<P>

DNA from six species of apes representing all four genera was amplified by PCR. As shown in Figure 1, of the five orang-utan specimens, two had one less octarepeat structure on one of the alleles. The two orang-utans with one less octarepeat seem to be unrelated, as one was born in captivity and the other in the wild. Nucleotide sequencing of the entire ORFs of the six ape species resulted in similarities in the nucleotide and amino acid level of 97.8 to 99.7% and 98 to 99.6%, respectively, when compared with the human PrP (Table 1, see Figure 2). The gorilla PrP gene was most similar to the human gene, followed by the chimpanzee and gibbon genes. While the gibbon and siamang species (Hylobates lar and H. syndactylus) exhibited much more variation on the nucleotide level (15 substitutions versus six for the chimpanzee), these 15 nucleotide changes resulted in only two amino acid substitutions. The orang-utan PrP gene is most distant from the human gene with 17 nucleotide exchanges and five amino acid substitutions. Allele-specific sequencing of the two variant orang-utan PrP alleles (Figure 1) was performed after excising the lower band from agarose gels; sequencing of these bands revealed that the deletion of one octarepeat had occurred at octarepeat 2 or 3. This difference from the classical phylogeny was confirmed by sequence-based phylogenetic trees. The orang-utans are more distant than the gibbon from the human, even when the octarepeat region was excluded from the analysis.<HR>

Variations in the PrP gene sequences of old-world monkeys<P>

The PrP genes of 12 species of old-world monkeys, representing five genera, were sequenced (Table 1). The degree of amino acid identity compared with the human PrP varied between 92.9 and 97.2%. The three genera of Papio (baboon and mandrill), Macaca (five species) and Cercopithecus (African green monkey; three species) were almost identical at the amino acid level with only minor differences on the nucleotide level (Table 1 and Figure 2). This contrasts with results from other genes where greater variability was found between and within these species (Goodman et al., 1990; Melnick et al., 1993). The genus of African green monkey contained the deletion of one octarepeat structure on both alleles (Figure 1). This deletion occurred between the third and fifth octarepeat. Almost all variations found in this group (except the missing octarepeat and positions 220 and 234) occurred between amino acid positions 97 and 168 (Figure 2) and are located almost exclusively outside the four predicted a-helical regions of PrP C (named H-1 to H-4: Figure 3). Characteristic variations were seen at positions 97 (S : N), 100 (N : H) and 108 (N : S). The substitution at codon 100 is unique in that other residues are present in new-world monkeys, domestic animals and rodent species. There are no Figure 1. PCR analysis of PrP genes from non-human primate species with variations in the octarepeat region. The internal primers HM-1 and HM-20 were used to emphasize the variations. On top the species are indicated, on the left a molecular size marker is given (100 base-pair ladder). Two out of 5 studied orang-utans (OU 1 to 5) revealed a missing octarepeat on one allele. AGM, spider and squirrel monkeys showed the deletion or insertion of 1 octarepeat on both alleles. Colobus monkey and gibbon ape represent normal PrP alleles.
amino acid variations in the N-terminal segment of the protein, codons 1 to 96 (Figures 2 and 3).
Variations in the PrP gene sequences of new-world monkeys<P>

For the seven new-world monkey species studied, 34 to 39 nucleotide exchanges were found resulting in seven to ten amino acid substitutions compared to humans (Table 1). Within this group, the PrP gene of the spider monkey showed the greatest sequence identity with human PrP when the deletions were not considered. It is noteworthy that fewer exchanges were present around the first putative helical region than in old-world monkeys, with the important exception of position 112 (M : V). Group specific variations were seen at codon 170, where the marmoset, tamarin and spider monkeys have an S : N substitution that is identical with that found in three subspecies of hamsters. At codon 182, the squirrel monkey has an I : V substitution that lies within the third putative a-helical region; at codon 205, the Aotes monkey has an M : I substitution that lies within the fourth putative a-helical region and is the same as that found in sheep.<P>

<B>Variations in octarepeat structures</B><P>

Variations in the number of octarepeats are of considerable interest since addition of two, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine octarepeats in humans results in an inherited prion disease (Goldfarb et al., 1991; Owen et al., 1989, 1992; Palmer et al., 1993; Poulter et al., 1992). One additional octarepeat has been reported in some cattle but it does not seem to alter the susceptibility of these animals to BSE (Goldmann et al., 1991; Prusiner et al., 1993). We
found an additional octarepeat for squirrel monkeys; it is present on both alleles and is located between the second and third octarepeat. Deletion of one octarepeat in humans occurs with a frequency of about 0.5% and is not associated with disease (Collinge et al., 1989; Goldfarb et al., 1991; Melnick et al., 1993; Owen et al., 1991; Puckett et al., 1991; Vnencak-Jones & Phillips, 1992). For the genera of African green monkey and spider monkeys we detected the identical deletion of one octarepeat located between the third and fifth octarepeat; this deletion occurs on both alleles. From two of five analyzed orang-utans there was a deletion for one octarepeat on one allele (Figure 1), which is located between the first and fourth octarepeat.
<P>

Clustering of non-human primate variations in the PrP gene<P>

Twenty-seven variant positions were detected when the translated sequences of the PrP genes of 25 non-human primates were compared with the human gene (Figures 2 and 3): 24 of these were single amino acid substitutions. In general, these exchanged residues represent conservative substi-tutions. Of note, the N-terminal signal peptide, the Asn-linked consensus sites for glycosylation, the two Cys residues that form a disulfide bond and the GPI anchor attachment site are invariant among the primates. Most of the variations among primates are located outside the four putative a-helical regions (Figure 3); the frequency with which amino acid substitutions occur is plotted on the ordinate. The residues that vary among the PrP genes of primates differ from the mutations that are linked to or segregate with inherited prion diseases (Figure 4A; and see Palmer & Collinge, 1993; Prusiner &DeArmond, 1994). These variations in the primate PrP genes also do not occur at sites known to be polymorphic in humans, i.e. codons 129 and 219 (Kitamoto & Tateishi, 1994; Owen et al., 1990; Palmer et al., 1991). Methionine was found at codon 129 in all 78 of the non-human primate samples. 
<P>
Variations in primate PrP genes were compared with the deduced amino acid sequences of PrP in ungulates and other domestic animals (Figure 4B). Ala133 is an invariant residue in primates. This corresponds to codon 136 in sheep, where an A : V polymorphism has been identified (Goldmann et al., 1990). In some breeds of sheep, susceptibility to scrapie seems to be governed by the amino acid encoded at this polymorphic site while in others it does not (Laplanche et al., 1993a,b). At codon 168, Glu is encoded in humans but Gln is found in all other primates. In sheep, the corresponding codon is 171 where the most frequently encoded amino acid is Gln; however this residue is polymorphic in sheep and Arg is often found in place of Gln. In Suffolk sheep, homozygosity for Gln at codon 171 was found to render these animals susceptible to scrapie (West-away et al., 1994). Amino acid substitutions at codons 108 and 189 of the murine PrP gene (Prn-p) have been found to be genetically linked to control of the scrapie incubation time (Figure 4C; and see Carlson et al., 1986; Westaway et al., 1987). The murine PrP allele designated a encodes Phe at residue 108 and Thr at 189, while the b allele encodes Ser at 108 and Val at 189. Among all the primates, at the corresponding positions Met (position 109) and Thr (position 190) were found.
PrP Genes in Primates 368<P>
<B>Phylogenetic relationships deduced from PrP sequences</B>
<P>

The sequence similarities for the ORF of the PrP gene within non-human primates differ from the previously reported molecular phylogeny of pri-mates (Brownet al., 1982; Goodman et al., 1989, 1990). Molecules exhibit (1) a high degree of sequence similarity between humans and the apes (Homi-noidae: Brown et al., 1982; Goodman et al., 1989; Ruvolo et al., 1991), (2) a substantial variability within the old-world monkeys (Melnick et al., 1993) and (3) that new-world monkeys are most distant from humans. The variations in the PrP molecules of primates violate these expectations. We compared phylogenetic trees generated by nucleotide analysis of the PrP genes with trees for mtDNA and b-globin genes (Figure 5 and see Brown et al., 1982; Goodman et al., 1990). The classical branching pattern within Hominoidea, represented in Figure 5B, is gibbon (Hylobatidae), orang-utan (Ponginae), and Homininae (human-chimpanzee-gorilla clade), with the chim-panzee as the closest relative to humans (Brownet al., 1982; Goodman et al., 1989, 1990). In our studies, gorilla PrP was most closely related to human PrP while chimpanzee and gibbon PrPs were next; whereas, orang-utan was the most divergent of the ape PrP molecules. To our knowledge, this phylogenetic pattern has not been reported for any other protein. The old-world monkeys showed an unexpectedly high degree of sequence similarity with many species possessing identical PrP<P>


<B>Distribution of variant amino acids</B><P>

Approximately one third of the residues in PrP were found to vary among mammals (Table 2). The distribution of variant amino acids was examined for different regions of PrP. Within the primates, most of the variation in the PrP sequence (18%) is within the N-terminal region (codons 1 to 90) while the variation in the C-terminal region (codons 221 to 253) was considerably lower (3%). In contrast, variations in the N and C-terminal regions for all species were 38% and 36%, respectively. The variation in the central region of PrP (codons 91 to 220) was 12% for residues in primates and 22% for all species. Combining the data for all species, 52% of the residues varied within the N-terminal (codons 1 to 22) and the C-terminal (codons 232 to 253) peptides that are cleaved off as mature PrP C is formed. The same peptides in primates varied at only 7% of the residues.<P>

<B>Transitions and replacement substitutions</B><P>

The nucleotide exchanges in the PrP gene account for about 85% of the transitions; this is lower than the number of transitions (92%) reported for mtDNA (Brown et al., 1982), but higher than the 70% found for b-globin cluster genes (Goodman et al., 1989). The ratio between silent and replacement substitutions was about 3:1. Within the apes, this ratio varied from 2:1 to 7.5:1. Within old-world monkeys, the ratio ranged from 3.2:1 to 3.9:1; for new-world monkeys, it varied from 3.8:1 to 4.9:1. These ratios are low.

The question of vertical and/or lateral transmission of TSEs is
unresolved.  Scrapie is almost certainly transmitted laterally
and vertically (Constantin 1994).<p>
</p>

MAFF workers (Bradley & Wilesmith 1993;  Bradley 1994;  Taylor
1994;  Wells & Wilesmith 1995) state that the feeding of
contaminated MBM was the only proven source of BSE in the UK and
that lateral or vertical transmission of BSE in cattle is not
proven.  However, in June 1995, the UK Subgroup on BSE (chaired
by Bradley) stated that "maternal and horizontal transmission
cannot be excluded".  
<P>
Lateral transmission may occur in some
species:  since 1970, a small herd of kudu at the London Zoo
derived from 3 individuals.  TSE was diagnosed in 5/8 kudu born
in this herd since 1987.  With the possible exception of the
first confirmed case, none of these is thought to have been
exposed to feeds containing ruminant-derived protein.  Greater
kudu are very susceptible to TSE and natural lateral transmission
may have occurred among them (Kirkwood et al 1993).  
<P>
Dealler &
Lacey (1994) suggested vertical transmission of BSE.  Ridley &
Baker (1995) disagree:  "The probability of maternal transmission
of TSE in any species should be viewed with the greatest
scepticism".  No maternal or paternal transmission of was found
in the progeny of mice inoculated with the agent of CJD (Taguchi
et al 1993).  However, research in MAFF (UK), released on Aug
10th 1996, has confirmed vertical (maternal, or cow-to-calf)
transmission rates of about 10%, or about 1% per infected cow per
year (Anon 1996).<p>

<blockquote>BSE is a new TSE of
       cattle resulting from consumption of a Scrapie-like agent
       in MBM of concentrate rations.  There is evidence of a
       decline in the epidemic following the introduction of a
       feed ban in July 1988.  Cow to cow transmission is not
       proven.  Scrapie is an endemic disease of sheep known for
       over 250 years where maternal and horizontal transmission
       are responsible for the difficulty in controlling the
       disease.  
<p>
Embryo transfer (ET) is a valued method of moving
       genetic material around the world with negligible risk of
       transmitting infectious diseases provided the International
       Embryo Transfer Society protocols are used.  Data on ET and
       the control of SE in sheep and cattle is being investigated
       in the USA and the UK.  In regard to sheep there are
       conflicting results.  Washed embryos from experimentally
       infected sheep in the USA have not transmitted Scrapie to
       recipients though no account was taken of the genetic
       susceptibility of the embryo or recipient.  
<p>
In contrast in
       the UK, using Sip and PrP genotyped experimentally-infected
       sheep and unwashed embryos, Scrapie resulted in the
       homozygous susceptible (sAsA) offspring within 979 d.  The
       question as to whether ET can be used to control natural
       Scrapie in sheep is thus unresolved.  Further studies to
       investigate the effect of washing embryos are in progress.
       In the UK, 1000 embryos have been collected from confirmed
       BSE cows and some have been transferred into 347 heifers
       imported from New Zealand as calves and subsequently held
       under quarantine conditions.  Some embryos and uterine
       flushings have been inoculated into susceptible mice.  No
       disease has resulted but the experiment will not be
       completed until 2001.</blockquote>

<blockquote> Sheep Scrapie, the archetype of
       TSSE, has been described for more than 200 years but the
       first scientific papers appeared 60 years ago.  The link
       between doctors and veterinary surgeons enabled our
       knowledge to develop.  First, a Slow Virus was evoked, then
       Hadlow DVM (USA) suggested using brain filtrates from
       deceased patients of Kuru in order to inoculate primates or
       small rodents; this was carried out by Gajdusek's team.
<p>

       The complete absence of an immune reaction has made the
       label "Slow Virus" give way to Unconventional Transmissible
       Agent (UTA).  The few human cases of TSSE have all been
       transmitted to mice, rats, hamsters.  Prusiner (San
       Francisco) has given us an enormous boost with the notion
       of prion, a protein molecule derived from an ordinary small
       membrane protein.  Having recourse to transgenic mice has
       enabled American and European teams to demonstrate the
       essential role of genetics in the formation of the UTA.
       Those responsible for the Health of Cattle in U.K.  will
       not contradict us.  Future Research will be fascinating and
       will open a new chapter in the Medical Science concerning
       Mammals.</blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A female Friesian-Holstein cow aged
       4 years with clinical signs suggestive of bovine spongiform
       encephalopathy (BSE) was slaughtered. Histological
       examination of the brain revealed findings typical of BSE
       with severe spongiform change. It is suggested that since
       the cow was born after the ruminant feed ban and since its
       dam had been a confirmed case of BSE the history is
       suggestive of vertical transmission of BSE.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<blockquote> He made it clear that various
       statistics in the epidemiology of BSE did not fit with the
       epidemiology that was expected for a disease that was
       passed purely through feed. What fitted much better was the
       model that it was the mothers that ate the infective
       material and they infected their offspring. The appearence
       of cattle in Portugal with BSE that were the offspring of
       exported UK cattle, the slow decay in the cases of BSE
       after the feed ban, the increased likelyhood of a herd that
       has had a case of BSE to have another compared with
       unaffected herd, the steady in-herd rate at approximately
       25% (why not 100%?), and the apparent 2 peaks in the age
       distribution of cattle developing BSE. 
<p>
A lot of ifs and
       buts were needed to fit the MAFF model to the epidemiology
       but it could be done. However, the vertical transmission
       model fitted it well. The added risk from BSE to a UK
       adult that continues to eat beef products is now less than
       5% of the risk that has already been taken. Dealler S and
       Kent J. When the difference in risk for people stopping
       eating beef at specific dates is compared with the risk for
       those continuing it is seen that there is little difference
       by the time we reach 1996. By this time little difference
       is seen but only applies for people that have eaten beef
       throughout the epidemic until that point. It is also made
       clear that the apparent difference was quite wide in 1989.
       The statistics only used the human diet as liver, kidney,
       meat (and the nerves they contain).</blockquote>

       Professor Lacey, University of Leeds He explains that the
       epidemiological models used by MAFF had one by one been
       shown not be be adequate to explain the huge number of
       cattle that have developed BSE after being born after the
       feed ban. He says that the recycling of remains would cause
       the rapid rise of the disease but could not be the only
       cause for the number of cases remaining so high.

IFST Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE): Position Statement,
       14 September 1996.</PRE>
<blockquote>       Placental transmission has been proposed
       as a likely route for vertical transmission for scrapie in
       sheep, although the existence of vertical transmission of
       scrapie has been disputed [Ridley and Baker (1995)]; but
       placental transmission has not been demonstrated with BSE
       in cattle. Until recently, there has been no evidence of
       maternal transmission in cattle. <p>

       
       A large-scale
       epidemiological study [Hoinville et al (1995)] should have
       brought to light the occurrence of vertical transmission if
       it occurred, but it did not, which was strongly suggestive
       of no significant occurrence. Preliminary results from the
       long-term experimental trials started in 1989, involving
       315 calves born to BSE-infected dams (nearly all born
       within 13 months and many within 5 months before clinical
       onset of BSE in the dams) and 315 controls born of healthy
       dams, were the subject of a MAFF announcement and a SEAC
       report on 1 August 1996 [when the research paper is
       published, the reference will be given in an Editorial
       Footnote]. 
<p>
Some 550 animals, having reached their seventh
       birthdays had already been slaughtered and their brains
       histologically examined. BSE occurred in 15% of the test
       animals and 5% of the controls [presumed to be due to
       exposure to infected meat-and-bonemeal feed in their early
       years]. SEAC assumed that this represented 10% risk of
       maternal transmission in the trials, and, by assuming
       further that the risk is negligible in calves born through
       the earlier part of the dams' incubation period, estimated
       a risk of 1% in the field. However, the latter is
       unsubstantiated speculation, based on an unverified
       assumption, although some support for it may or may not be
       implicit in the results of a subsequently-published
       computer study [Anderson et l (1996)] [see later]. 
<p>
What the
       trial showed was a statistically significant association
       between BSE-infected dams and occurrence of BSE in the
       calves, but, on information currently available, did not
       establish the cause of that association. That cause may be
       maternal transmission or, for example, inherited genetic
       disposition coupled with exposure to infected feed. If it
       is in fact maternal transmission, that would raise the
       question of the mode of transmission, as yet unanswerable
       in the light of current knowledge and methodology.
<p>
       Fortunately, whether the real risk was 10% or 1% or
       somewhere in between, will have no significant bearing on
       the continuing rapid decline in the number of new BSE cases
       and in the virtual eradication of the disease. Whatever the
       level of risk was, it has been operating throughout the
       period of rapid decline and is thus also, as the stock
       exchange analysts put it, already discounted in the
       epidemiological forecasts of further decline [e.g. Stekel
       et al (1996)]. Moreover, in the absence of horizontal
       transmission, of which there is no evidence, and in
       enforced absence of infected MBM feed, the effect found in
       this trial would be the only route for future infection.
<p>
       Taking the figure actually found in the trial, 10%, and
       assuming the worst case situation that it applied
       throughout the calving lives of the dams, it means
       occurrence in one in ten of the offspring of BSE cows in
       1989 (for the trial results are, of course, the belated
       findings on what actually happened in 1989).. Even assuming
       that, of that second generation (now 7 years old), all of
       the calves inheriting BSE survived and became dams for a
       full calving career (and it must be borne in mind that all
       are culled at 30 months, but even ignoring that), that
       means that there will have been occurrence in one in a
       hundred of the second generation's offspring. And in one in
       a thousand in the third generation's offspring, and so on.
       Of course, the geometric reductions in numbers of
       transmissions does not happen in large several-year-jumps
       like that, but in a smoother descending curve, because
       "generations" overlap and one must think in terms of annual
       cohorts, but over time the numbers must at least decline in
       that way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is a review of TSEs.  All animal and human
       SEs are slow-developing infectious diseases.  The current
       working theory links the origin of BSE to the feeding of
       cattle with MBM prepared from the remains of
       scrapie-infected sheep.  Recycling of cattle MBM
       essentially resulted in the selection of a single strain
       from the "wild type", a mixture of 20 strains.  The BSE
       agent is easily transmitted through ingestion, with some
       evidence of vertical transmission.  
<p>
Paradoxically, cattle
       have selected a major new strain which appears to be more
       virulent than an unselected strain found in scrapie sheep.
       The same strain of BSE agent is implicated in the
       occurrence of SE in domestic cats, tiger, and some exotic
       species of ruminants in zoos.  The properties of BSE and
       its spread into cattle are still disputed.  Since our
       understanding of the disease and its transmissibility in
       humans must await observations that will be made over some
       years to come, it is important to keep a reasonable
       perspective and ensure that any speculative comment is
       consistent with fact.  
<p>
In risk assessment in such
       circumstances, it is tempting give too much credence to
       persuasive parallels when direct relevant information is
       not available.  On the other hand, it would also be unwise
       to assume that the disease will die by itself and will have
       no effect on humans.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has long been accepted that
       the pattern of occurrence of Scrapie, the form of SE
       associated with sheep, is determined mainly by maternal
       transmission.  This view has had a profound influence on
       policy decisions in the control of BSE and on public
       concern over the risk to human health from this disease.
<p>

       The occurrence of maternal transmission is, however, not
       predicted by modern knowledge of the aetiology of SE, and
       even though claims of maternal transmission have been
       reiterated frequently in the literature, re-examination of
       the source data reveals that they are extremely scanty,
       unreplicated, and probably subject to ascertainment bias.
       The probability of maternal transmission of SE in any
       species should be viewed with the greatest scepticism.</blockquote>

Antibodies specific for GABA, glutamate and taurine were used to study the distribution of these amino acid neurotransmitters during the progression ofscrapie in hamsters. Immunohistochemical distribution of glutamate and taurine were unaffected in scrapie hamsters compared with controls, but thedistribution of GABA was altered by 21 days after inoculation. We found both a greater number of neurons showing GABA-like immunoreactivity and moreintense staining in those neurons in scrapie-inoculated hamster brains, particularly in the hippocampus, inferior colliculus, frontal cortex andcerebellum. The overall concentrations of aspartate, GABA, glutamate and taurine, measured in seven different brain regions by PITC-amino acid analysis,were not significantly different between normal and scrapie-affected hamsters. The subtle alteration in GABA metabolism detected in this scrapie modelsuggests that PrPSc interacts directly with a component of the GABA system.

Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) is responsible for the synthesis of nitric oxide which serves as a neural messenger in the central nervous system.
NOS activity was <B>markedly inhibited</B> in brains of mice and hamsters and neuroblastoma cells infected with scrapie (ScN2a). The decrease in
activity was in accordance with decreased NADPH-diaphorase-positive cells and decreased staining of NOS-positive cells demonstrated by specific anti-NOS antibodies. 
<P>
However, the specific nNOS mRNA in ScN2a was elevated when compared with normal neuroblastoma cells (N2a). Immunoblotting of fractions from these cell lines with an anti-nNOS monoclonal antibody revealed a band of nNOS from N2a and two bands with a
lower molecular weight in ScN2a cells. Furthermore, NOS in ScN2a cells was insoluble in nondenaturing detergents. This insolubility is one of the landmark properties of PrPSc. It is, therefore, possible that nNOS in scrapie-infected cells and brains is aberrantly folded, resulting in an
insoluble and inactive enzyme.

<H3>Atypical Neuronal <A NAME="Messengers">Messengers</A>: Focus on Nitric Oxide</H3>
UCSF lab of <A HREF="http://keck.ucsf.edu/neuroscience/bredt.htm">David S. Bredt, M.D., Ph.D.</A>, colleague of S. Prusiner<P>

Nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as one of the major neurotransmittersin the brain. Unlike traditional transmitters which interact withhigh affinity receptors in a &quot;lock-and-key&quot; manner, the free radical NO achieves signaling specificity by diffusing directly into a target neuron and binding to intercellular enzyme targets. Our laboratory is using molecular and genetic approachest o define the roles of NO in the functioning and development of the nervous system.<P>

In the adult brain nitric oxide is synthesized by a single gene product, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We find this gene to be expressed in a discrete population of interneurons in the brain which are uniquely resistant to the neurodegeneration of stroke, Huntington's disease, and excitotoxicity. Utilizing subtractive cloning as well as biochemical approaches we are defining novelt argets for NO in the brain and attempting to identify those factors which confer resistance to NO containing neurons.<P>

Another project is focused on understanding the role of nitric oxide in development. We find that NOS is transiently expressed in differentiating and regenerating neurons throughout the body.Pharmacologic blockade of NOS in the developing brain leads to an altered expression of specific neuronal markers, indicatingt hat NO functions as a neuronal differentiation factor. Utilizing molecular and transgenic animal models we are defining the elements that regulate NOS gene expression and working to understand roles for NO in neural development and regeneration.<P>

To characterize cellular mechanisms for NO signaling in excitable tissues we have turned our attention to skeletal muscle as a model tissue. Here, we find that NOS is tethered to a glycoprotein complex containing dystrophin, the gene product mutated in muscular dystrophy. On-going studies in this area focus on understanding the rolefor NO in neuromuscular development and disease associated with dystrophin.<P>

<H4>A 60-kDa Prion Protein with Properties <A NAME="of">of</A> Normal and Scrapie-associated Forms</H4>

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and other mammals in which disease appears to be caused by the accumulation of
an abnormal form of a host protein, prion protein (PrP), in the brain and other tissues. The process by which the normal protease-sensitive
form of PrP is converted into the abnormal protease-resistant form is unknown. Several hypotheses predict that <B>oligomeric forms</B> of either the
normal or abnormal PrP may act as intermediates in the conversion process. We have now identified a 60-kDa PrP derived from hamster PrP
expressed in murine neuroblastoma cells. Peptide mapping studies provided evidence that the 60-kDa PrP was composed solely of PrP and, based
on its molecular mass, appeared to be a <B>PrP dimer</B>. 
<P>
The 60-kDa PrP was not dissociated under several harsh denaturing conditions, which
indicated that it was <B>covalently linked</B>. It was similar to the disease-associated form of PrP in that it formed large aggregates. However, it
resembled the normal form of PrP in that it was sensitive to proteinase K and had a short metabolic half-life. The 60-kDa PrP, therefore, had
characteristics of both the normal and disease-associated forms of PrP. Formation and aggregation of the 60-kDa hamster PrP occurs in
uninfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, which suggests that hamster PrP has a predisposition to aggregate even in the absence of scrapie
infectivity. Similar 60-kDa PrP bands were identified in scrapie-infected hamster brain but not in uninfected brain. Therefore, a 60-kDa
molecule might participate in the scrapie-associated conversion of protease-sensitive PrP to protease-resistant PrP.

We have demonstrated the presence of a rat prion protein (RaPrP) gene promoter upstream of multiple initiation sites. A 0.1-kb fragment upstream ofthe 5'-untranslated region contains specific DNA motifs characteristic of promoter elements including an AP-1 binding site, an inverted CCAAT motif andthree inverted Sp-1 binding sites. This fragment directs transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) and rat gliomacells (C6), suggesting that it contains the promoter for the RaPrP gene. To more precisely localize the transcription regulatory elements in this region, aseries of 5'-deletion mutants were generated. Deletion analysis showed that an inverted CCAAt and adjoining Sp-1 binding sequences may play animportant role in transcription of the RaPrP gene.

Deposition of PrP amyloid in cerebral vessels in conjunction with neurofibrillary lesions is the neuropathologic hallmark of the dementia associated witha stop mutation at codon 145 of PRNP, the gene encoding the prion protein (PrP). In this disorder, the vascular amyloid in tissue sections and theapproximately 7.5-kDa fragment extracted from amyloid are labeled by antibodies to epitopes located in the PrP sequence including amino acids 90-147.Amyloid-laden vessels are also labeled by antibodies against the C terminus, suggesting that PrP from the normal allele is involved in the pathologicprocess. Abundant neurofibrillary lesions are present in the cerebral gray matter. They are composed of paired helical filaments, are labeled withantibodies that recognize multiple phosphorylation sites in tau protein, and are similar to those observed in Alzheimer disease. A PrP cerebral amyloidangiopathy has not been reported in diseases caused by PRNP mutations or in human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies; we propose to name thisphenotype PrP cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA).

Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) are caused by pointmutations or octarepeat insertions in the prion protein (PrP) gene. In the present work a method was established that is appropriate for a thoroughscreening for mutations in the PrP gene and is generally applicable to screenings of any given gene. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) wasmodified at two critical steps by UV cross-linking of the DNA strands and by replacing the spatial gradient with a temporal one. The shift of a DNA band intemporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tTGGE) due to a mutation can be calculated as a function of the position of the mutation in the sequence.Appropriate DNA fragments were selected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and analysis by tTGGE on the basis that the predicted bandshifts amount to more than 10% of the migration distance for all possible mutations. The accuracy of the prediction was tested experimentally with tenknown mutations in the human PrP gene, and quantitative agreement between theory and experiment was achieved. Thus, this screening method is also asuitable means to verify the absence of mutations in a given gene segment.

Neurodegeneration caused by the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is associated with the conversion of a normal host protein, PrP-sen, into anabnormal aggregated protease-resistant form, PrP-res. In scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells, mouse PrP-sen is converted into PrP-res butrecombinant hamster PrP-sen expressed in these cells is not. In the present studies, recombinant hamster/mouse PrP-sen molecules were expressed inthese scrapie-infected cells to define specific PrP amino acid residues critical for the conversion to PrP-res. The results showed that homology to theregion of mouse PrP-sen from amino acid residues 112 to 138 was required for conversion of recombinant PrP-sen to PrP-res in scrapie-infectedmouse cells. Furthermore, a single hamster-specific PrP amino acid at residue 138 could inhibit the conversion of the recombinant PrP-sen intoPrP-res. The data are consistent with studies in humans which show that specific amino acid residue changes within PrP can influence diseasepathogenesis and transmission of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies across species barriers.

Here we present a case of variant GSS disease with mutations in codons 105 and 129 in a
prion protein. The patient was a 54-year-old male, who developed weakness in the lower
limbs and spastic, wide-based gait at the age of 46 years. Subsequently he developed dementia
and spastic quadriplegia at the age of 49. He had marked pseudobulbar palsy at the age of 50
and became bed-ridden in decorticated posture at teh age of 53. CT and MRI examinations
revealed marked atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, but the occipital lobes and the
cerebellum were spared. His sister had been reported by Amano, et al. in 1992 as a case of
variant GSS syndrome, who had very similar clinical features, and had numerous prion
protein positive plaques in her cerebral cortex at the time of autopsy. His sister was
confirmed to have the same mutations in a prion protein as the present case in later genetic
studies.

We found novel variants in the open reading frame of the prion protein (PrP) gene in a family with Gerstmann-Strussler syndrome (GSS). Codon219Lys variant is a normal polymorphism which we found recently. Some GSS cases were identified with codon 102 mutation (proline to leucine) andcodon 219Lys polymorphism. While two families had a codon 102 mutation and codon 219Lys polymorphism in different alleles, 4 patients in one familyhad both in the same allele. The clinicopathological features of these 4 patients were clearly different from previously reported GSS patients with codon102 mutation. These cases should be reported as a new variant of GSS.

Scrapie is a transmissible degenerative disease of the central nervous system occurring naturally in sheep. It belongs to the group of prion diseases alsoaffecting man in which an abnormal isoform of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP) accumulating in the brain is responsible for neuronal death. Threemain polymorphisms have been described in the sheep PrP gene, at positions 136, 154 and 171. A strong association between susceptibility/resistance tonatural scrapie and a dimorphism at codon 136 of the ovine PrP gene has been reported in several breeds, including Romanov. This dimorphism, however,is not found in all scrapie-affected breeds. We have compared the PrP genotypes of Lacaune sheep obtained from enzootically affected flocks with those ofapparently healthy sheep. A third variant at codon 171 was also evidenced. The results were compared with those obtained in a single experimentalRomanov flock orally challenged with nematode parasites in which scrapie suddenly appeared and killed 80% of the sheep. We present evidence that, evenin different epizootological circumstances, the major genetic factor controlling the susceptibility/resistance to natural scrapie in sheep, is representedby codon 171 genotype of the PrP gene. We also suggest that a modification of the allelic effects of codon 136 can occur in heavily infected animals.

Sporadic inclusion-body myositis is the most common progressive muscle disease of older patients. The muscle biopsy demonstrates mononuclear cell
inflammation and vacuolated muscle fibers containing paired helical filaments and 6 to 10-nm fibrils, both resembling those of Alzheimer brain, and
Congo-red positivity. Hereditary inclusion-body myopathy designates patients cytopathologically similar but without inflammation. In both muscle
diseases, prion, and several proteins characteristic of Alzheimer brain--eg, beta-amyloid protein and hyperphosphorylated tau (which normally are
expressed mainly in neurons), and apolipoprotein E--are abnormally accumulated in vacuolated muscle fibers, by unknown mechanisms. We now
demonstrate in both muscle diseases that prion mRNA is strongly expressed in the vacuolated muscle fibers, which suggests that their accumulated prion
protein results, at least partly, from increased gene expression. This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration of abnormally increased prion mRNA
in human disease. Another novel finding is the increased prion mRNA in human muscle macrophages, and both increased prion protein and prion mRNA in
regenerating muscle fibers. The latter indicates that prion may play a role in human muscle development.

Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep that belongs to the group of prion diseases found in humans and animals. The host encoded prion
protein (PrP) plays a central role in the disease process. In the PrP genes of man, mice and sheep, polymorphisms have been found that are associated
with disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. We have used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to detect polymorphisms in the sheep PrP gene.
In addition to the already described polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171, we identified a hitherto unknown G --> T transition at codon 171. This
transition is responsible for a glutamine to histidine substitution. An arginine to glutamine substitution at this position has been described previously.
DGGE allowed us to identify five different combinations of these polymorphisms within the PrP gene representing five allelic variants, which were cloned
and sequenced. Based on the triplet sequences present at codons 136, 154 and 171 these allelic variants were designated PrPVRQ, PrPARR, PrPARQ,
PrPARH and PrPAHQ. To determine the association of these allelic variants with natural scrapie, we screened 34 scrapie affected and 91 healthy control
sheep of the Texel breed for the presence of these allelic variants. In these two groups, the five variants gave rise to 13 different genotypes. The
distribution of the allelic variants among both groups showed marked differences. The PrPVRQ variant was present with high frequency in scrapie affected
sheep, whereas the PrPARR variant was almost exclusively present in the healthy group. Two other variants, PrPARQ and PrPARH, were found in both
groups with equal frequencies. The data obtained suggest modulation of disease susceptibility in these Texel sheep by at least five different PrP allelic
variants, with the PrPVRQ and PrPARR alleles acting in a dominant, but opposite fashion over the PrPARQ and PrPARH alleles. The frequency of the
PrPAHQ variant was too low to draw any conclusions.

Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations including ataxia, spastic
paraparesis, extrapyramidal signs, and dementia. The patients present with symptoms in the third to sixth decade of life and the mean duration of illness
is five years. Mutations at codons 102, 105, 117, 145, 198 and 217 of the open reading frame of the prion protein gene have been associated with GSS
disease. As a result of the mutations, a substitution at the corresponding residues of the prion protein occurs, or as in the case of the STOP mutation at
codon 145, a truncated protein is produced. Neuropathologically, the common denominator is a cerebral prion protein amyloidosis; however, there is
significant variability in the pattern of amyloid deposition in regions of the central nervous system among reported families. Amyloidosis coexists with
severe spongiform degeneration in patients with the mutation at codon 102, and with neurofibrillary degeneration in the patients with mutation at codons
145, 198 and 217. The development of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in animals inoculated with brain tissue from affected subjects with
mutation at codon 102 suggests that in some forms of genetically-determined Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker disease, and particularly those
characterized by severe spongiosis, amyloidogenesis and production of an infectious "agent" occur concomitantly via mechanisms that are only partially
understood.

The normal function of the pathogenicity-related protein, PrP (or prion protein), is unknown. To shed light on functionally important domains, we have
characterized a candidate marsupial PrP gene. The deduced marsupial PrP has an overall identity of about 80% to eutherian PrP at the amino acid (aa)
level. This similarity is not equally distributed and two regions (aa 118-142 and 177-223) are particularly highly conserved. In contrast, a repeat
region in the N-terminal half of the marsupial PrP shows dipeptide inserts not described in other PrP. Another particular feature of the marsupial gene
is the lack of a continuous ORF on the antisense strand, as is found in most eutherian PrP. We propose that antisense ORFs found in other species are
artefactual. Comparison with all known PrP argues that the molecule characterised is the true marsupial PrP orthologue.

Scrapie is a transmissible degenerative disease of the central nervous system occurring naturally in sheep. It belongs to the group of prion diseases also
affecting man in which an abnormal isoform of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP) accumulating in the brain is responsible for neuronal death. Three
main polymorphisms have been described in the sheep PrP gene, at positions 136, 154 and 171. A strong association between susceptibility/resistance to
natural scrapie and a dimorphism at codon 136 of the ovine PrP gene has been reported in several breeds, including Romanov. This dimorphism, however,
is not found in all scrapie-affected breeds. We have compared the PrP genotypes of Lacaune sheep obtained from enzootically affected flocks with those of
apparently healthy sheep. A third variant at codon 171 was also evidenced. The results were compared with those obtained in a single experimental
Romanov flock orally challenged with nematode parasites in which scrapie suddenly appeared and killed 80% of the sheep. We present evidence that, even
in different epizootological circumstances, the major genetic factor controlling the susceptibility/resistance to natural scrapie in sheep, is represented
by codon 171 genotype of the PrP gene. We also suggest that a modification of the allelic effects of codon 136 can occur in heavily infected animals.

We investigated the relationships between amino acid polymorphisms of the prion protein (PrP), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of
the PrP gene and the incidence of natural scrapie in Japan. Six variant alleles of the PrP gene were found in healthy sheep. Based on the substitutions at
codons 112, 136, 154 and 171, these allelic variants were designated PrPMARQ, PrPTARQ, PrPMVRQ, PrPMAHQ, PrPMARR and PrPMARH. Each RFLP
haplotype (e1h2, e1h2 or e3h1) consisted bo multiple alleles including PrPMARQ. Three of these variant alleles were found in scrapie-affected Suffolk
sheep. PrPMARQ was associated with high disease incidence, PrPTARQ and PrPMARR were associated with low disease incidence. We found that one
scrapie-affected Suffolk was homozygous for PrPMARR and four PrPSc-positive Suffolks carried PrPMVRQ. Both of two scrapie-affected Corriedales and
two out of three scrapie-affected cross-breeds between Suffolk and Corriedale carried PrPMARH, suggesting that this allele associates with high incidence
of scrapie in Corriedale and its cross-breeds.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative neurological disorder of the central nervous system. AD is the fourth leading cause of death in
elderly persons 65 years or older in Western industrialized societies. The etiology of AD is unknown, but clinical, pathological, epidemiological, and
molecular investigations suggest it is etiologically heterogeneous. Mutations in the amyloid protein are rare and segregate with the disease in a few
early-onset familial AD (FAD) families. Similarities between AD and the unconventional viral (UCV) diseases, and between the amyloid and prion
proteins, implicate the human prion protein gene (PRNP) as another candidate gene. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used
to screen for mutations at this locus in 82 AD patients from 54 families (30 FAD), vs. 39 age-matched controls. A 24-bp deletion around codon 68 that
codes for one of five Gly-Pro rich octarepeats was identified in two affected sibs and one offspring of one late-onset FAD family. Two other affected sibs,
three unaffected sibs, and three offspring from this family, in addition to one sporadic AD patient and three age-matched controls, were heterozygous for
another octarepeat deletion located around codon 82. Two of the four affected sibs had features of PD, including one who was autopsy-verified AD and PD.
Although these deletions were found infrequently in other AD patients and controls, they appear to be a rare polymorphism that is segregating in this FAD
family. It does not appear that mutations at the PRNP locus are frequently associated with AD in this population.

The clinical features and disease course of six patients from a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of presenile dementia and a hypokinetic
syndrome are described. In the past, these patients have carried diagnoses of Pick's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson-dementia, and one patient
was described as suffering from a 'peculiar type of presenile dementia' in a case report. In the two cases examined, the most distinctive neuropathological
features were extensive globular deposits of periodic acid-Schiff plus diastase (PAS)-positive material, having tinctural properties of amyloid only to a
limited degree, in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. These globules stained positively with antibodies against prion protein. Southern blot of
MspI-digested genomic DNA showed an abnormal band of approximately 950 bp in all three patients from which material was available. Direct sequencing
of the abnormal allele revealed an insert consisting of eight extra 24-nucleotide repeats in the patients, which was absent in a healthy first degree
relative who was considered well beyond the age of onset of symptoms in this family. The nucleotide sequence of the abnormal insert of 192 bp was
different from that of a previously described insert of equal length. Adding to previous descriptions of mutations in the prion protein gene, this report
emphasizes the clinical, neuropathological and genetic heterogeneity of inherited prion disease.

</PRE>The molecular basis of strain variation in scrapie diseases is unknown. The only identified component of the agent is the posttranslationally modified host
prion protein (PrPSc). The biochemical and physical properties of PrP from two strains of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), called hyper
(HY) and drowsy (DY), were compared to investigate if PrP heterogeneity could account for strain diversity. The degradation rate of PrPTME digested
with proteinase K was found to be strain specific and correlated with inactivation of the TME titer. Edman protein sequencing revealed that the major
N-terminal end of HY PrPTME commenced at least 10 amino acid residues prior to that of DY PrPTME after digestion with proteinase K. Analysis of the
brain distribution of PrPTME exhibited a strain-specific pattern and localization of PrPTME to the perikarya of specific neuron populations. Our findings
are consistent with HY and DY PrPTME having distinct protein conformations and/or strain-specific ligand interactions that influence PrPTME
properties. We propose that PrPTME conformation could play a role in targeting TME strains to different neuron populations in which strain-specific
formation occurs. These data are consistent with the idea that PrPTME protein structure determines the molecular basis of strain variation

Abstract
              Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of the amyloid protein PrP in the CNS.
              Two coding polymorphisms of the PrP gene (PRNP) are a methionine (Met) to valine (Val) change at codon 129, and a deletion in the octapeptide coding
              region. In the United Kingdom, homozygosity at codon 129 appears to be associated with a predisposition to develop CJD. However, in Japan, where allelic
              frequencies and genotype distribution are significantly different, such an association has not been demonstrated. To determine whether such deletion(s) or
              codon 129 polymorphisms of PRNP predispose to the development of CJD in Italian patients, 31 sporadic CJD patients with no known PRNP mutations, and
              186 unrelated control subjects were studied. Genotypic frequencies at codon 129 in these Italian CJD patients revealed a significant excess of methionine
              alleles, and a different genotype distribution in comparison with the normal Italian population. Deletions of a 24-bp segment located in the PrP
              octapeptide coding region were found in two control subjects, but in none of the sporadic CJD patients. These data suggest that Met homozygosity at codon
              129 may contribute, with other environmental or endogenous factors, to CJD development.

Experimental infection of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) in two closely related mustelids, black ferret (Mustela putorius furo) and mink
(Mustela visa), revealed differences in their susceptibility to the TME agent. When challenged with the Stetsonville TME agent, a longer incubation period
was observed in ferrets (28 to 38 months) than mink (4 months). Western blot analysis of ferret and mink prion proteins (PrP) demonstrated no
detectable differences between the proteins. Northern blot analysis of ferret brain RNA indicated that PrP mRNA abundance is similar in infected and
uninfected individuals. We amplified the PrP coding region from ferret DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and compared the deduced amino acid
sequence of the ferret PrP gene with the mink PrP gene. This comparison revealed six silent base changes and two amino acid changes between mink and
ferret: Phe-->Lys at codon 179 and Arg-->Gln at codon 224, respectively. These changes may indicate the region of PrP that is responsible for the
species barrier effect between mink and ferret.

Chromosomal localization of the genes for gamma- and kappa-immunoglobulins (IGGC and IGKC, respectively), aldolase B (ALDB), prion protein (PRNP),
homeo box B (HOXB), and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) were determined with the use of mink-rodent hybrid cells. Analysis of segregation of
the mink markers and chromosomes in these hybrid cells allowed us to assign the gene for HOXB to Chromosome (Chr) 8, IGGC to Chr 10, PRNP and IGKC
to Chr 11, ALDB to Chr 12, and GPT to Chr 14 in mink. Furthermore, using a set of mink-mouse hybrid cells carrying fragments of mink Chr 8 of
different sizes, we assigned the gene for HOXB to the pter-p26 region of the short arm of Chr 8. Comparative mapping of the genes of mink, human, and
mouse, as well as other mammalian species, demonstrated that the mink genes HOXB, PRNP, ALDB, and IGGC are members of a conserved region shared by
many mammalian species in common; the IGKC gene is a member of a conserved region common to carnivores and primates, not rodents; the GPT gene is a
member of a syntenic gene group probably unique to the Mustelidae family or carnivores.

The major, and possible only, component of the infectious prion is the
scrapie prion protein (PrPSc); the protease resistant core of PrPSc is
PrP 27-30, a protein of approximately 142 amino acids. PrPSc is derived
from the cellular PrP isoform (PrPC) by a post-translational process in
which a profound conformational change occurs. Syrian hamster (SHa) PrP
genes of varying length ranging from the N- and C- terminally truncated
90-228 up to the full-length mature protein 23-231 were inserted into Escherichia coli deficient for proteases. 

Maximum
expression was obtained for a truncated SHaPrP containing residues
90-231, which correspond to the sequence of PrP 27-30;  from each liter of E. coli culture, approximately 50 mg of purified
rPrP was obtained.
<P>
 The
secondary structure of rPrP was determined by circular dichroism
and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. When rPrP was purified
under reducing conditions, it had a<B> high beta-sheet content and
relatively low solubility similar to PrPSc</B>, particularly at pH values &gt;
7. Refolding of rPrP by oxidation to form a disulfide bond between the
two Cys residues of this polypeptide produced a soluble protein with a
<B>high alpha-helical content similar to PrPC</B>. 
<P>
These multiple conformations
of rPrP are reminiscent of the structural plurality that characterizes
the naturally occurring PrP isoforms. The high levels of purified rPrP
which can now be obtained should facilitate determination of the
multiple tertiary structures that Prp can adopt.<HR>

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) with 129M/M, and iatrogenic
and familial CJD with E200K and M232R, showed similar clinicopathologic
features, a synaptic type deposition of PrPCJD, and high transmission
frequencies to mice. Sporadic patients with 129M/V or 129V/V, and
mutation cases with V180I, showed slightly different features and low or
null transmission frequencies to mice. Hereditary cases with P102L,
P105L, A117V, Y145stop, and insertions had different features but all
demonstrated a long clinical duration and the presence of PrP plaques.
<P>

The experimental transmission to mice of these mutant forms was
difficult, except for one-third of the cases with P102L. CJD and related
diseases, even those that are hereditary, may thus be divided into two
different groups, those that are easily transmissible and those that are
either difficult to transmit or nontransmissible.

There are coding mutations in the prion protein gene in familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
disease, and other phenotypes that make up the inherited prion diseases. Insertional mutations consisting of two, five, six, seven, eight, and
nine additional octapeptide repeat elements are seen in the inherited prion diseases and usually present as atypical dementias with
considerable intrafamilial phenotypic variability. A four-octarepeat insertion was reported previously in an individual without
neurodegenerative disease who died of hepatic cirrhosis.

We have demonstrated the presence of a rat prion protein (RaPrP) gene promoter upstream of multiple initiation sites. A 0.1-kb fragment
upstream of the 5'-untranslated region contains specific DNA motifs characteristic of promoter elements including an AP-1 binding site, an
inverted CCAAT motif and three inverted Sp-1 binding sites. This fragment directs transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in
pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) and rat glioma cells (C6), suggesting that it contains the promoter for the RaPrP gene. To more precisely
localize the transcription regulatory elements in this region, a series of 5'-deletion mutants were generated. <B>Deletion analysis showed that
an inverted CCAAt and adjoining Sp-1 binding sequences may play an important role in transcription of the RaPrP gene. </B>

Amyloid proteins are thought to derive from soluble precursors or fragments thereof, present
in biological fluids, which in the disease state undergo conformational change leading to
aggregation and deposition in target tissues. We report here that <B>platelets carry PrP mRNA
and release PrPC</B>, a sialoglycoprotein bound to the cell surface by a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. 
<P>
Soluble PrPC, and a N-terminal truncated PrPC
isoform starting at position 90 are secreted by resting and agonist-stimulated platelets and
are detectable after partial deglycosylation of releasates. N-terminal sequence analysis of the
soluble 27-30 kDa isoform, GQGGGTHSQ(W)NKP, revealed homology to scrapie PrP27-30,
the protease resistant core derived from PrPSc. These findings indicate that in addition to
PrPC, platelets process a soluble PrP27-30 isoform. Whether this isoform can be converted
in scrapie PrP27-30 remains to be determined.

A major component of the infectious particle causing spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases is an aberrant isoform (PrPSc) of a
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein, PrPC. The cellular processes involved in the formation of PrPSc are unclear but
involve the internalization of PrPC prior to conversion. Here, we demonstrate that PrPC is associated with caveolin, a structural protein component of
caveolae. We show that PrPC and caveolin share similar detergent characteristics and copurify in linear sucrose gradients. PrPC was protected from
proteinase K digestion in the caveolin fraction but solubilizing the caveolae prior to proteinase K digestion rendered PrPC susceptible to proteinase K
digestion. Our results indicate a physical association between PrPC and caveolin in N2a cells. The implication of these results in relation to prion
biogenesis is discussed.

The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a membrane sialoglycoprotein synthesized in the central nervous system and extraneural tissues. Its
post-translational modification produces an accumulation of abnormal isoform PrPsc found in brains of transmissible neurodegenerative disorders in
animals (scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and humans (Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker syndrome).
One major unanswered question relative to PrPc concerns its physiological role in brain neurons, depending largely on the limited knowledge of its
subcellular localization. Using a highly-sensitive immunogold electron microscopy technique, we reported that in the hamster dentate gyrus, the synaptic
boutons constituted the submicroscopic site where PrPc was observed. This detection was obtained with 2 highly-specific polyclonal antibodies for prion
protein. PrPc localization was assigned, both on structural basis and on its co-localization with synaptophysin. The presence of PrPc in synaptic
terminals should provide additional informations on its possible role in neuronal transmission and on the implication of synapses in the pathogenesis of
spongiform encephalopathies.

Well-characterized antibodies against beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) and prion protein (PrP), and specific cRNA probes, were used to
localize beta APP and PrP and their mRNAs in human muscle macrophages. Macrophages present in muscle biopsies of 51 patients with various
neuromuscular disorders showed accumulation of beta APP and PrP, and strongly expressed beta APP and PrP mRNAs. These were present in all muscle
macrophages unrelated to their localization within the muscle tissue or diagnosis. Our study provides the first demonstration that human muscle resident
macrophages synthesize and accumulate beta APP and PrP. We suggest that those proteins play a role in biology of muscle macrophages, including their
participation in inflammatory and immune responses.

neurological disease. In one albumin donor, possible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease developed 3 years later. The patient initially had cerebellar symptoms.
Neuropathology included "Kuru-type" plaques and prion protein (PrP) deposits involving the cerebellum predominantly. The patient was homozygote
valine at codon 129 of the PrP gene while the liver was homozygote methionine. This observation raises the possibility of transmission of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by the graft itself or the associated albumin transfusions and, on a wider extent, by nonneural tissue.

The neutral and phospholipid composition of mouse brain infected with scrapie prions was investigated. During the later stages of this disease, the level of
dolichol decreased by 30% whereas the level of dolichyl phosphate increased by 30%. In terminally ill mice, there was also a 2.5-fold increase in both
total ubiquinone and its reduced form. Furthermore, alpha-tocopherol was elevated at this stage by 50%. In contrast, no changes were observed in
phospholipid amount, in phospholipid composition, and in phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen content during the entire disease process. The fatty acid
and aldehyde composition of individual phospholipids remained unaltered as well. No modifications could be detected in cholesterol content. Thus, the
majority of membrane lipids in scrapie-infected mouse brain are modified in neither quantity nor structure, but specific changes occur to a few
polyisoprenoid lipids. This specificity indicates that, although prions accumulate in lysosomes, the infection process is not associated with a general
membrane destruction caused by lysosomal enzyme leakage.

There is a wealth of data supporting a central role for the prion protein (PrP) in the
neurodegenerative prion diseases of both humans and other species, yet the normal function of
PrP, which is expressed at the cell surface of neurons and glial cells, is unknown. It has been
speculated that neuropathology may be due to loss of normal function of PrP. Here we show
that in mice devoid of PrP there is an alteration in both circadian activity rhythms and
patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first null mutation that has been shown to affect sleep
regulation and our results indicat</center>e that at least one of the inherited prion diseases, fatal
familial insomnia, where there is a profound alteration in sleep and the daily rhythms of
many hormones, may be related to the normal function of the prion protein.

The scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) is an abnormal isoform of the cellular protein PrPc.
PrPSc is found only in animals with scrapie or other prion diseases. The invariable
association of PrPSc with infectivity suggests that PrPSc is a component of the infectious
particle. In this study, we report the identification of two proteins from hamster brain of 45
and 110 kDa (denoted PrP ligands Pli 45 and Pli 110) which were able to bind to PrP
27-30, the protease-resistant core of PrPSc on ligand blots. Pli 45 and Pli 110 also bound
PrPC. Both Pli's had isoelectric points of approximately 5. The dissociation rate constant of
the Pli 45/PrP 27-30 complex was 3 x 10(-6) s-1. Amino acid and protein sequence
analyses were performed on purified Pli 45. Both the composition and the sequence were
almost identical with those predicted for mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
Furthermore, antibodies to Pli 45 reacted with recombinant GFAP. The identification of
proteins which interact with the PrP isoforms in normal and diseased brain may provide new
insights into the function of PrPC and into the molecular mechanisms underlying prion
diseases.

Antisera to four synthetic peptides containing the substitutions between mouse and hamster
prion proteins (PrPs) were produced in rabbits. The synthetic peptides used represent two
mouse (Mo-I: residues 100-115 and Mo-V: residues 199-208) and two hamster PrP
subregion sequences (Ha-I: 101-116 and Ha-V: 200-209). All antisera reacted strongly
with homologous peptides but either not at all or poorly with heterologous peptides in
enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antisera to Mo-I and Mo-V recognized mouse
PrPSc but not hamster PrpSc in western blot analysis (WB) and ELISA. Antisera to Ha-I
contain antibodies specific to hamster PrPSc. The results indicate that these regions of PrPSc
constitute species-specific epitopes. In contrast to these antisera, the antiserum to Ha-V
recognized neither hamster nor mouse PrPSc. In this study, we identified mouse subregion-V
as a species-specific epitope.

</pre>Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease is a cerebral amyloidosis linked to mutations of the PRNP gene. We previously reported that the amyloid
protein in the Indiana kindred of GSS is an internal fragment of prion protein (PrP). To investigate whether this fragment originates only from mutant or
from both mutant and wild-type PrP, we have characterized amyloid proteins purified from patients of the Indiana and Swedish GSS families. These
patients were heterozygous for the Met-Val polymorphism at PRNP codon 129 and carried a mutation at PRNP codon 198 (Phe-->Ser) and codon 217
(Gln-->Arg), respectively. The smallest amyloid subunit was a 7 kDa peptide spanning residues approximately 81 to approximately 150 in the Indiana
patient and approximately 81 to approximately 146 in the Swedish patient. In both patients, only Val was present at position 129. Since Val-129 was in
coupling phase with Ser-198 and Arg-217, our findings indicate that only the mutant PrP is involved in amyloid formation in both kindreds.

Replication of prions is dependent on the presence of the host protein PrPc. During the course of disease, PrPc is converted into an abnormal isoform,PrPSc, which accumulates in the brain. Attempts to identify the cell type(s) in which prion replication and PrP conversion occur have reachedconflicting results. Although PrP mRNA is present in high amounts in neurons throughout the life of the animal, PrPSc initially accumulates in astrocytesand possibly other glial cells and, later in the course of the disease, spreads diffusely in the tissue, often in white matter. We report here that PrP mRNAis expressed not only in neurons but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout the brain of postnatal hamsters and rats. The level of glial PrpmRNA expression in neonatal animals was comparable to that of neurons and increased two-fold during postnatal development. A substantial portion ofbrain PrP mRNA is therefore contributed by glial cells. Our results provide an explanation for the accumulation of PrPSc in white matter tissue and inthe cytoplasm of glial cells and argue for a direct involvement of glia in prion propagation.

After the cellular prion protein (PrPC) transits to the cell surface where it is bound by a glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor, PrPC is eithermetabolized or converted into the scrapie isoform (PrPSc). Because most GPI-anchored proteins are associated with cholesterol-rich membranousmicrodomains, we asked whether such structures participate in the metabolism of PrPC or the formation of PrPSc. The initial degradation of PrPCinvolves removal of the NH2 terminus of PrPC to produce a 17-kD polypeptide which was found in a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction. Both the formationof PrPSc and the initial degradation of PrPC were diminished by lovastatin-mediated depletion of cellular cholesterol but were insensitive to NH4Cl.Further degradation of the 17-kD polypeptide did occur within an NH4Cl-sensitive, acidic compartment. Replacing the GPI addition signal with thetransmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse CD4 rendered chimeric CD4PrPC soluble in cold Triton X-100. Both CD4PrPC and truncated PrPCwithout the GPI addition signal (Rogers, M., F. Yehieley, M. Scott, and S. B. Prusiner. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 90:3182-3186) were poorsubstrates for PrPSc formation. Thus, it seems likely that both the initial degradation of PrPC to the 17-kD polypeptide and the formation of PrPSc occurwithin a non-acidic compartment bound by cholesterol-rich membranes, possibly glycolipid-rich microdomains, where the metabolic fate of PrPC isdetermined. The pathway remains to be identified by which the 17-kD polypeptide and PrPSc are transported to an acidic compartment, presumablyendosomes, where the 17-kD polypeptide is hydrolyzed and limited proteolysis of PrPSc produces PrP 27-30.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease is a transmissible encephalopathy manifesting with dementia and motor disturbances, which usually progresses rapidly and islethal within months. It occurs mainly sporadically, but it can also be transmitted by proteinaceous infective particles called prions. The diagnosis has torely on clinical symptoms, EEG and brain biopsy being the most suitable additional examinations. No therapy is yet known. "Naturally" occurringtransmission has not been observed: all transmitted cases reported so far have been iatrogenic and followed administration of cadaveric hypophysealhormones, transplantation of tissue from CNS or related organs, or brain surgery with contaminated instruments. Remarkable discoveries in the pastdecades with respect to the molecular and genetic characterization of the transmissible pathogen have led to a new understanding of the disease. Theinfective agent appears to be an abnormal isoform of a physiologically occurring protein: the cellular prion (PrPc). The crucial pathogenetic event is theconformational conversion of PrPc into its pathological isoform (PrPsc), an event thought to be triggered autocatalytically by the infectious agent itself.The disease can be elicited in experimental animals by inoculation of PrPsc. In the sporadic cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, PrPsc is thought to arisethrough spontaneous conversion of PrPc. A growing body of evidence indicates that specific alleles of the prion gene confer a genetic predisposition toCreutzfeldt-Jakob's disease and to related pathologies.

Transmissible subacute spongiform encephalopathies (TSSE), also known as prion diseases, are rare neurodegenerative disorders of both humans andanimals. The biochemical hallmark of these diseases is an accumulation in the brain of an abnormal form of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP). Thispathological accumulation could result from a protein conformational change under the influence of unknown factors. The normal function of PrP isunknown. The abnormal form is thought to induce neurodegeneration when experimentally or accidentally introduced in recipient hosts. Such a possibilitywould explain the transmissible character of these diseases illustrated in humans by iatrogenic contamination. Considerable attention has been focused onthe host PrP gene and its relation with the genetic susceptibility of humans and animals. Mutations in PRNP, the gene which encodes PrP in humans, arepresent in 16% of the patients and might be causative. In patients without any PRNP mutation, a coding polymorphism (129 Met/Val) defines apredisposing factor. Since few years, important progress in the molecular genetics of TSSE in both humans and animals have been performed and point outthat the development of different forms of these diseases, experimental, iatrogenic or spontaneous, are strongly dependent on the primary structure of thehost PrP.

Vascular dementia is usually sporadic and associated with definite risk factors. Several cases also occur in a familial fashion, and may affect middle-agedor even younger subjects. Recently, an autosomal dominant inheritance was demonstrated in two unrelated French families, the members of which wereaffected by stroke-like episodes culminating in progressive dementia. Genetic linkage analysis assigned the disease locus to chromosome 19q12. We reportan additional kindred of Italian origin in which at least 16 subjects presented leukoencephalopathic alterations. Recurrent strokes, psychiatricdisturbances, dementia, and in 2 members, tetraplegia and pseudobulbar palsy were the hallmarks of this syndrome. Notably, 5 asymptomatic individualshad neuroradiological signs of leukoencephalopathy. Pathological examination of 1 subject revealed a widespread vasculopathy of the perforatingarterioles, characterized by deposition of eosinophilic-congophilic material that did not immunostain with antibodies against prion protein,beta-amyloid, cystatin C, transthyretin, or heat-shock protein 70 and was similar to that described in the French families. Based on the maximum lodscore, the most likely location for the disease locus was also mapped to chromosome 19q12, and found to coincide with the CADASIL (cerebral autosomaldominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) locus. The present results confirm the existence of a nosologically distinct,autosomal dominant cerebrovascular disease, presenting with recurrent subcortical ischemic strokes independent of vascular risk factors.

A cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) is thought to be a substrate for an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) in scrapie. PrPC isabundant in tissues of the central nervous system, but little is known about the distribution of PrPC in non-neuronal tissues of sheep, the natural host ofscrapie. This study investigated the tissue distribution of PrPC in sheep. Although PrPC was abundant in neuronal tissues, it was detected in non-neuronaltissues such as spleen, lymph node, lung, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, uterus, adrenal gland, parotid gland, intestine, proventriculus, abomasum andmammary gland. Neither PrPC nor PrP mRNA was detected in the liver. The tissue distribution of PrPC appears to be inconsistent with the tissues whichpossess scrapie infectivity, suggesting that factor(s) specific to certain cell types may be required to support multiplication of the scrapie agent.

Neuronal loss is a salient yet poorly understood feature in the pathology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases). Cell cultureexperiments with neurotoxic prion protein fragments suggest that neuronal cell death in these diseases may be due to apoptosis. To test this hypothesis invivo we used the in situ end-labeling (ISEL) technique and electron microscopy to study cell death in an experimental scrapie system in the mouse. ISEL,which relies on the incorporation of labeled nucleotides in fragmented DNA by terminal transferase, showed labeled nuclei in the brains and retinae ofmice infected with the 79A strain of scrapie, whereas no labeling was observed in control animals. In the retina the highest numbers of labeled nucleiwere found in the outer nuclear layer 120 days post infection followed by massive cell loss in this layer. In the brain, labeled nuclei were mainly found inthe granular layer of the cerebellum of terminally ill mice. This corresponded to the presence of small dark nuclei with condensed and occasionallyfragmented chromatin at the light and electron microscopical levels. Our results support the hypothesis that neuronal loss in spongiform encephalopathiesis due to apoptosis. This may explain the almost complete absence of inflammatory response in prion diseases in the face of widespread neuronal cell death,and may also have therapeutic implications in the future.

In order to determine whether apoptosis contributes to the neuronal loss in scrapie, in situ end labeling was applied on brains of mice showing clinicalsigns of the disease. Positively labeled, apoptotic neurons were observed in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, areas known to showcharacteristic scrapie-related vacuolation, and were absent in the brains of control mice. We conclude that apoptosis plays a role in the neuronal loss thatoccurs in scrapie. The importance of apoptosis as a predominant cell death mechanism in scrapie, however, remains to be determined.

The prion protein PrPc is a glycoprotein of unknown function normally found in neurons and glia. It is involved in diseases such as bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. PrPSc, an altered isoform of PrPC that is associated with disease, shows greater proteaseresistance and is part of the infectious agent, the prion. Prion diseases are characterized by neuronal degeneration, gliosis and accumulation of PrPSc.Mice devoid of PrPC are resistant to scrapie. A fragment of human PrP consisting of amino acids 106-126 that forms fibrils in vitro is toxic to culturedneurons. Here we show that this toxic effect requires the presence of microglia which respond to PrP106-126 by increasing their oxygen radicalproduction. The combined direct and microglia-mediated effects of PrP106-126 are toxic to normal neurons but are insufficient to destroy neurons frommice not expressing PrPC.

<PRE><B>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and public health.</B>

Concerning the article in the J. Public Health Medicine. Volume 17 number 3, 1995, pages
261-268

              W. J. Patterson (Consultant in Public Health Medicine) 
              S. Dealler (formerly Senior Registrar at York District Hospital. now: 01282
              474292)

Symptomatic cases of BSE in British cattle now total more than 146,000. As BSE is one of a
group of transmissible and fatal spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) affecting both animals
and humans this has raised concern regarding possible risks to human health. The infective
agent in TSEs, thought to be a prion has not been clearly described. There are no early
diagnostic tests, incubation periods are prolonged (possibly up to 30 years in humans) and
the pathological process which leads to a rapidly progressive and fatal encephalopathy has yet
to be explained. 

It is not yet known if the BSE agent can cross the human species barrier to infect humans. It
has now been transmitted to 18 species and to 16 of these (possibly 17 if pigs are included)
by mouth. 

Given the importance of beef in the human diet, it is essential that control measures to protect
health are rigorous, comprehensive and objective. In this respect there are four factors which
are important in assessing risks. These are the likely magnitude of the species barrier
between cattle and humans, the dose (single or cumulative) that are needed to transmit the
disease, the method of exposure (oral or subcutaneous) and the likely period before
symptomatic disease appears. 

To assist knowledge and understanding in these areas we recommend the wider involvement of
public health professionals in the existing nationally co-ordinated multi-agency research
programme. We also recommend further studies into the oral transmissibility of the BSE
agent to primates, an acceleration of the search for diagnostic tools and treatments for
established prion infection and enhanced surveillance of neurological disease in humans. 

It is now clear that probably a large percentage of the population will have been exposed to
BSE in the UK. 

Humans will have eaten 1,800,000 infected cattle by 2001 and will have eaten tissues that
have been shown to be infective in other species, but inadequately tested in cattle. Humans
have already taken risks in eating bovine products that have now been banned. The recurrent
banning of foods or procedures by MAFF will not help the people that have been exposed before
the ban. It is possible that further action such as this by MAFF will seriously damage the
public's respect for its action.

The article's most important part is to show that the World Health Organisation's publicised
opinions on how to decide whether or not the exposure of a human to a specific amount of an
infective agent could not have been carried out as inadequate information was available with
which to decide the action. As a result of this it was important that Government action should
assume a tolerable level for human exposure to BSE to be very low indeed, possibly 10,000
times less then the amount felt acceptable by MAFF. Concerning the article in the British Food
Journal 1995, volume 97, 3-18. 

Review:

The most important aspect of the article seems to be the WHO directives as to how to decide
what levels of an agent should be considered non-toxic to humans. Clearly a wide error margin
is given by the WHO but still this would suggest the risk that is being taken with BSE as being
unacceptable in public health terms.

BSE: an update on the statistical evidence.

British Food Journal 1995, volume 97, p3-18 

              S. Dealler Medical Microbiologist, Burnley General Hospital, Burnley, UK BB10
              2PQ. 01282 474292 
              John Kent Professor of Statistics, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK. LS2 9JT. 0113
              2335102

The article explains that, as a fatal disease, with no method of treatment, inadequate methods
of diagnosis and no method of prevention in any animal afer infection has taken place, this
subject should be studied closely. Infectivity is presumed, if like in other TSEs, to be present
in many tissues and to not be destroyed by cooking. One of the major problems is in trying to
calculate the number of infected animals that are being eaten and at what point in their
incubation period this takes place. It seems that there is adequate data now available from
MAFF for this to found. The major findings of the article are: 

Cases of BSE are becoming severely under-reported. For instance only 40% of clinical cases
of BSE reached UK Government statistics in 1993. 

BSE may continue in the UK for many years, with cases born each year, showing symptoms 3
to 8 years later. 

BSE may not be derived from the disease of sheep, scrapie and if it is, we cannot rely on it to
carry the same properties as that disease. The UK Government used the idea that BSE was
scrapie originally to suggest that BSE would not infect humans although this was invalid at the
time. 

1,800,000 cattle incubating BSE will have been eaten before 2001 even if no cases are born
after 1991. This figure assumes that all cattle with BSE were always reported by farmers to
veterinary officers, that the VOs always accepted them, and that histological diagnosis was
always correct (up to 1991). It is therefore likely to be an underestimate of the true BSE
incidence. Many of the younger cattle incubating BSE would have been exported to Europe. 

The epidemiology of BSE in the UK is that of an infection passed down from the mother to the
offspring but where the mother would show symptoms later in life. It may be that BSE cases
that we see are derived from infections in their mother and it was the mother that ate infected
food. If this is true then the total number of infeced cattle eaten in the UK will be around
8,000,000 by 2001. 

UK Government advisors have suggested that there is little risk from eating liver, kidneys,
nerves and muscle from infected cattle. The article shows that this cannot be true if these
tissues contain the same amount of infectivity as is found in other species with a similar
disease. 

The acceptable levels (UK Government) of infectivity to found in food may be 10,000 times
the amount that could be seen as acceptable under WHO directives used for other potentially
fatal diseases. 

UK Governernment Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens reported in October 1994
showing that cattle that may be infected should be treated as if they are infective. They say that
some tissues should not be even touched (e.g. liver) that the UK Government continues to tell
its population as being acceptable to eat. 

The risk to humans in Europe from BSE is unacceptably high but cannot be stated precisely at
this time. The article states again that the cumulative amounts of BSE in our diet in the UK is
expected to be between 10,000 times and 100,000 times the amounts of scrapie that we
would be eating. 

No directions are given as to whether bovine tissue in the UK should be considered toxic. 


In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for
prion protein (PrP) in BSE

Graber, HU, Meyer, RK, Fatzer, r, Vandevelde, M, Zurbriggen, A. 

Zentralbl-Veterinarmed-A. 1995;42:453-9

In about 5% of the cows showing clinical signs of BSE the histopathological examination is not
conclusive (it is closer to 15% in the UK - Ed). In order to rule out BSE in these cases,
additional methods are necessary. For that reason, non-radioactive in situ hybridization
(ISH) was performed. In addition, for immunological testing a polyclonal antibody was raised
against a synthetic peptide derived from bovine PrP. These two techniques were used on 4
cows with clinically suspect but histologically negative cattle. It is not completely clear what
they found but it seems that the four cases were also shown to be negative by these new
techniques, allowing BSE to be ruled out. The immunological technique can also be used with
EM to look for SAF. 


Western blot mapping of disease-specific amyloid in
various animal species and humans with TSEs using a
high yeield purification method

Beekes, M, Baldauf, E, Cassens, S, Diringer, H, Keyes, P, Scott, AC, wells,
GA, Brown, P, Gibbs, CJ, Gajdusek, DC. 

J. Gen. Virol. 1995;76:2567-76.

A complex study in which a 20-100mg sample of tissue could be used to extract TSE-specific
amyloid, this would be concentrated and the material detected by Western blotting. It was
discussed as a potential method of diagnosis. 


Proposed link between transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies of man and animals.

Lancet November 4 1995, 1208-1209 

              Heino Diringer Robert-Koch Institute, Nordufer 20, D-13353, Berlin, Gemany
              030 4547 2214

It is suggested that scrapie is the source of all TSEs in animals and man but that, by passing
from one species to another the agent is either selected or changed in such a way as to alter the
range or type of disease that it might produce in a further animal species. 

For instance it is suggested that scrapie does indeed cause the endemic types of CJD that seem
to be present in some parts of the world (e.g. Slovakia) and partly associated with PrP gene
aberrations. However, when scrapie is transmitted to cattle, it then becomes more infective to
humans and is involved in the production of sporadic CJD in many parts of the world. 

The cases of GSS that are not fully penetrant may be because the genes are correct but the
agent (scrapie) is still required. In cases of fully penetrant GSS perhaps the agent also
remains with the infected person. 

Review: 

The argument is fairly reasonable in that it will be very difficult to find groups that have not
been exposed to meat at all, even though they think they have not. It will also take a long time
to be able to carry out statistical research to say if beef is involved in sporadic CJD or not
(because the controls will also eat a lot of beef and the difference between the groups will be
small). Diringer recommends research as the way to find out what is going on but the current
PrP research avalanche may only be of some use if animal inoculation studies are carried out
similarly.

Royal College of Pathologists Symposia.
CJD and health and safety in the autopsy
suite.

25th Jan 1996 JW Ironside, Univeristy of Edinburgh. He goes through the necessary
practices to avoid a risk to people following the death of someone with possible CJD.
(avoidance of penetrating injuries, minimal contamination of the mortuary environment,
traning and education fo staff, adequate decontamination of instruments and rooms. The major
thing that is not incluced is that we do know currently know which patients are infected and
which are not. While the number of humans currently incubating BSE is unknown, the
regulations in the mortuary suite must apply to all patients. 



Will BSE transmit to humans

BMJ 25th November 1995 p1415-6

Jeffrey Almond. School of animal and Microbial Sciences, University of Reading.

He says that although TSEs do transmit, we still do not have proof that BSE will transmit to
humans. He reviews the molecular biology of the PrP gene that may help us decide. 



The Jury is still out

Paul Brown. Lab of Central Nervous Studies NIH, Bethesda, MD

"In fact no one can say yet with any confidence whether the recent cases of CJD in adolescents
and farmers are the results of infection with BSE.". he states that really young cases have been
seen before and we should not assume that the new cases are anything to do with BSE. F
"Finally there does not seeem to be any need for new governmental hearings, committee
meetings or parliamentary debates about what more might be done because the precaustions
taken some yars ago to eleiminate potentiallly inecvtious products from commercial
distribution were both logical and thorough" (I hope he was right, but I doubt it-Ed)



More than happenstance: CJD in farmers and young
adults

BMJ 25th November 1995 1416-8 

Sheila Gore. MRC Biostatistics Unit, Inst of Public Health, Cambridge

She demonstrates that the chance of getting two teenagers 'back to back' and four farmers with
CJD in 4 years is so low that they could not have happened by chance. He work sparked off a lot
of debate and it was felt from this that something was happening that theydid not know about.



Who gets CJD?

Ros Ridley, Harry Baker. MRC Comparative Cognition Team, Department of Experimental
Psychology, Cambridge Univ

. They put forward the argument that the figures are simply not big enough for there to be any
great risk. Four cases of apparently idiopathic CJD have been reported in teenagers in Europe
and the USA. Obviously these were nothing to do with BSE. They felt that the CJD Surveillance
Unit led to a higher level of reporting of cases and that these cases were of little significance.

He explains that we simply cannot know. The data islong and hard and at the end of going
through it we still dit not end up being sure if BSE infected humans. He quoted the work of
Dealler and Kent showing that the number of people that would have eaten various doses of BSE
could be actually so variable as to be unhelpful but a worst case scenario would suggest a
dreadful result. He discusses the problems that changes in environmental factors, changes in
reporting levels, changes in many other factors may mislead us.



Risk of human exposure to BSE

. BMJ 25th November 1995 1420

Kenneth Tyler. University of colorado, Health Sciences Center, Denver VA medical Center,
Denver.

He looks at the inoculum size, the routes of inoculation the host factors (e.g. can humans be
infected at all), the genetics and the implications for disease prevention. In the end he does not
say if humans have caught CJD but says that really to avoid any risks we should avoid contact
with nervous and lymphoreticular tissue. He does not even make the same pretece that MAFF
does continually i.e. that there is no infectivity in any bovine tissue except brain and spinal
cord. He says that meat is not expected to harbour major amounts of infectivity. 



If BSE infects humans, when will we start to see
cases?

Federation of Infection Societies, Manchester Symposium, November 29th 1995

S. Dealler, Burnley General Hospital

By looking at other species and the incubation period that is produced by the transfer of
infectivity it is possible to estimate when a rise in BSE cases in humans as CJD2 cases would
be expectd to take place. This shows that we might be lucky to see any cases at all before the
year 2000 and that the peak may be 15 years later. The reason for this is that humans have a
very long life expectancy, BSE has been transmitted by mouth, and it has had to cross a species
barrier. If cases of CJD2 were to appear earlier than 2000 that might be an indication of the
size of the peak to come.

Diagnosis and incidence of prion (CJD) disease: a
tetrospective archival survey with implications for
future research

Neurodegeneration vol 4 1995;357-368.

CJ Bruton, RK Bruton, SM Gentleman, GW Roberts. Corsellis Collection Brain Bank,
Dept of neuropathy, Runwell Hosp, Wickford, Essex. etc. 

Reliable identification of CJD in the UX has become essential following the suggestion that
prion disease in cattle might transmit accidentally to humans who eat contaminated beef.
recent data suggest that some cases f CJD may be conically unrecognized; in order to examine
this proposal we reviewed all cases of dementia (n-1000+) collected between 1964 and
1990. We identified 19 cases of CJD of which only 11 were diagnosed before death. These 11
had a characteristic clinical history of CJD. Their brains showed little or no external
abnormality. In contrast only 2 of the 8 clinically unrecognized cases had characteristic
symptoms. The remaining six presented atypically; their illness lasted 3 years or more,
motor signs were much less evidnt and simple dementia was the most promminent feature. the
brains showed moderate or severe cereral atrophy. Our data indicate that only about 60% of
prion disease cases with pathologically typical SE were identified clinically during life. This
suggests that human prion disease may bemore common than previously supposed and that a
further review of the epidemiology is required. 



Inactivation of the BSE agent by rendering precedures

Veterinary Record. Dec 9. 1995. p605-8

DM Taylor, SL Woodgate, MJ Atkinson, Neuropathogenesis Unit, Edinburgh University

Bovine brain infected with the BSE was used to spike material processed in pilot scale
facsimilies of 12 rendering processes which are used within the EU and 3 which are not. the
raw material for experimental rendering represented those used inpractice, and consisted of
appropriateproportions of BSE infected brain tissue, bovine or porcine intestine and bovine
bone. Meat and bone meal and tallow were produced from the rendered tissue. Suspension sof
all the meat and bone meal samples were assayed in mice for BSE. Four of the 15 processes
produced MBM with detectable BSE infectivity. Neither of the tallow samples did. The problem
with the results was that they did not show any great effect for themethods of talow extraction
using solvents. This was the method that was blamed for rendering the MBM safe until the
process was stopped at the beginning of the 1980s in the UK. Presumably the change in
manufacturing cannot be now assumed to have had a specific effect.



CJD and BSE

BMJ 20 Jan 1996 p 180

Terence Featherstone of the Department of Radiology, Darlington Memorial Hosp suggests
that magnetic resonance imaging may be of value in diagnosis of CJD. 


Aetiology of scrapie in cetain circumstances is not
evidence against another aetiology in different
circumstances

BMJ 20 Jan 1996 p 180

Ros Ridley and Harry Baker, Dept of Exp Psychology University of Cambridge. This is the
continued argument that the findings of various groups that suggest vertical transmission of
scrapie can be explained in a genetic manner. 


BSE is being maintained by vertical and horizontal
transmisison

BMJ 20 Jan 1996 p 180

Professor Lacey, University of Leeds He explains that the epidemiological models used
by MAFF had one by one been shown not be be adequate to explain the huge number of cattle
that have developed BSE after being born after the feed ban. He says that the recycling of
remains would cause the rapid rise of the disease but could not be the only cause for the
number of cases remaining so high.

Secret Government: the Scott report

BMJ 24 February 1996 p455-6.

Martin McKee (Health Secvices Research Unit, London School of Hygience and Tropical
Medicine. Tim Lang

Links with industry cast doubt on the government's role in public health. The report said that
everyone that mislead the House of Commons, misled the media, mislead the people, lied to the
judges, and were determined to send arms to a country that had been banned from receiving
them for political reasons throughout the world, were in fact doing it with a clear heart. They
thought they were doing it for the best even when it came to allowing a group of men to go to
jail even though they carried out the exports with the OK of the Government. The report
suggests that the associaton between industry and Government may be too close to allow. The
meaning of this for BSE is important.



Message from Sir Kenneth Calman, chief medical
officer

A statement indicating to medical practitioners in the UK that in the last two weeks the CJD
Surveillance Unit has described a distinct variant of CJD in 10 cases, in people aged under 42
with dates of onset of illness in the last two years. He states that still the risk of CJD in the UK
is the same as in europe and hat it remains a rare disease. Patients presentig with the
non-specific symptoms are no more likely to be suffering from CJD than previously. There is
no reason for a change in referral patterns to neurologists or other specialist services.
Neurologtists are aware that they can obtain advice from the CJD Unit. 20 march 1995



BSE (Health) 

Mr Dorrell followed by Mr. Hogg speaking on the subject of BSE risk to humans. this was
following the weekend discussion by SEAC concerning risks to children and various others.
Hansard. 25th March 1996 3.31 pm.

Mr. Dorrell states that research into the subject would have to increase and that he had asked
Professor Swales (now at Richmond House, Whitehall, DofH) formerly Prof of Gen Med at
Leicester University, to produce a list of the research that would be required to be carried
out. 

Mr. John evans (St. Helens North) asks how Mr. Dorrell could accept advice from the same
group that had been telling him for years that nobody would die of CJD (p722)

Mr. Hogg (p724) gives out the data concerning the number of cattle that would be expected to
be slaughtered and what would be the sort of regulations that would be reqired. 



Message frm Sir Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer
25th March 1996

This is the report on the statement as to the risk to children concerning BSE in food products.
It concluded that there was no increases sceptibility to infection for pregnant women, hospital
patients, the immunosuppressed, or children. there is nothing to lead the committee to change
its advice on the sonsumption of milk andmilk products. SEAC also concluded that gelatin was
safe. Children are no morelikely to become infected than adults. He states that further
research isneeded and the WHO will organise an international seminar on the latest results
from the CJD unit as soon as possible. 



Lessons from BSE for public confidence

              Editorial

Nature 28 March 1996. 380;271

The scare in Britain over infections across species by rions was badly handled. whether the
research community can do more to prevent future public crises of confidence needs to be
examined in the light of the past influenceof interested parties. 

The article makes it plain that the population has difficulty believing what is told to it by
MAFF, which has too many vested interests in selling foods, no matter what the potential risk
to them. Prion research must now be strengthened, denial of information from the people must
be stopped, and external review will be essential.

Bovine CJD? 

              Sheila Gore. Senior Statistician, MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge

British Medical Journal. 30 March 1996. 312 p 791-3 

Failures of opidemiology must be remedied. The article makes it plain that the action so far
taken in epidemiology was inadequate in order to work out the risk that has been taken in the
UK. She calculates the chance of 10 cases developing CJD betwen the ages of 17 and 41 yrs and
whether that should have been thought of earlier as abnormal. she goes back on her own work
showing that there was excess risk to farmers and teenagers. With the amount of data
currently available she says that it is not possible to assess the risks being taken by people in
the UK by carrying out certain procedures (working on farms, eating beef, dringking milk)
purely because the data was not adequate at the time. Mistakes were made with other
epidemiological attempts e.g. with HIV and false reassurances were given (e.g. HIV and breast
milk). The main aim of the article is to put forward the data that would be required in order to
find out much more about the epidemiology of CJD2. One of the factors that is suggested is that
the disease be made 'notifiable'. This means that doctors seeing a case must report it to
officials and the data would be built up centrally. "Practically we do not have in vitro or in
vivo tests for infected cattle and so have continnued to play Russian roulette with no
information on the odds. Age specific prevalence of infected cattle has not even been monitored
by random pathology after slaughter for which there is now the stronges case". 

This is in the editorial section and is very aggressive in its demands

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and CJD

The risk is unproved but no better explanation is presently forthcoming.

              Paul Brown. Medical director, US PHS. Lab of central Nervaous System

British Medical Journal. 30 March 1996. vol 312. p790-1. 

He admits that the cases that have been seen have been different clinically from the sporadic
type of CJD and that the finding of neuropathology that is also different (but similar to each
other) would make BSE the most likely explanation. Ill defined early emotional behavioural
dymptoms of the new variant will obviously openthefloodgates to hundreds if not thousands of
suspected cases of CJD over the next few years and it will be a matter o enormous practical
importance that a screening test is produced. He says that a new test is soon to be reported
with a sensitivity of 97% and s specificityof 98%. "A good deal of work remains to be done i
order to esztablish the link between BSE and CJD, much of which has already been initiated.
None of it will be ofany help to htose who may have been exposed to the agent in the 1980s....
Nor will it remedy the possible failure of the scientific pudits (including me) to forsee a
potential medical catastrophe" (Ed-it was good of him to admit that he was wrong, as he had
been denying any risk to humans from BSE for many years)



CJD and BSE

BMJ Vol 312 30 March 1996. p 843

Ridley, RM and Baker H. MRC Comparative Cognition Team, Dept of Experimental
Psychology, Univ of Cambridge. Study so far shows no evidence for maternal and horizontal
transmission. This is an argument with the previous article from Lacey suggesting that there
was evidence. They quote the work of Hoinville and Wilesmith in which they compared the
likelihood of a cow developing BSE as to whether their mother did so. '94.4% of animals with
SE and 95.7% of controls were born to dams that did not subsequently develop BSE'. The
difference was not significant. (Ed-The problem with this is that it would be needed to work
out what percent were actually the offspring of infected mothers and in one of the major
epidemiological models including vertical transmission, there would not be expected to be any
difference between the groups, because such a high percentage of the dams in any herd were in
fact infected)



Cohort study of cows is in progress

BMJ Vol 312, 30 March 1996. p 843

John Wilesmith, Cenral Veterinary Lab

He says that the study will show if vertical transmission is taking place by comparing the
offsppring of cattle known to have BSE with those that are the offspring of other cattle from
the same herd. The results should be ready by the end of 1997. At the moment he denies any
evidence of vertical transmission.

(Ed-this has come under considerable discussion. It is not clear why it is a blind study, as this
should make no difference as to the diagnosis of the vet at the time. After all it is a fatal disease
and the cow cannot be making it up. Similarly the histopathologists looking at the slides in
diagnosis need not be told if they are looking at the slide of the dead cow or a control. A lot of
demands have been made to un-blind the study. Also many people have made it cleat that the
study cannot actually show if there is any vertical transmission or not as the control dam
would also be infected i.e. both the case and the control will have come from infected mothers)



Incidence of BSE is higher in cows born

M. Bennett. Environmental Technology Centre, Depf of Chemical engineering,

He shows that the epidemiology actually shows that the number of cases of BSE born after the
feed ban actually increased and it is not surprising that Lacey makes claims that the disease is
not going away.

Less beef, more brain

Editorial Lancet April 6 1996, 347; p915

Editorial. It explains the risks that have been taken and how the unfolding story of scrapie,
BSE and CJD underscores the weakness of separating agricultural and medical science and of
allowig one Government department to protect the intersts of both thefood consumers and the
farming industry. Morover the advice of independenet scientists and the creation of political
policy should not come from the same stable. this latest drama points to the need for a
separate, independent agency that reports to the public not to the policy makers. Such an
agency would be a forum for open scientific debate. the iformation andopinions proffered would
be pubicly subjected to critical evaluation. we would all then have the opportunity to
understand how expert opinion and recommendations are formed and politicians could begin at
last to build foresight into their policy responses rather than simply react in confusion and
haste to the latest scientific alarm." Excellent-ed.

histopathological factors that will separate them from CJD1. They make it clear that it would
be better to remain open minded about whether infection has been passed also to other species.
They describe the new condition and how to go about diagnosing it. A good article.



A dreadful challenge.

Lancet April 6 1996, 347; p917

JG Collee. Department of Med Micro, Univ of Edinburgh

Considering Collee wrote a major article in the Lancet in around 1990 indicating that the
risks from BSE to humans, although possible should not be considered to any great degree, this
article is absolutely excellent. It describes the way in shcih infection could take place, how it
may pass into a pathogenic phase, how it could spread around the body, how it could develop
into a clinical disease. A list of essential factors and key questions is put forward and he
explains that we simply know quite inadequate amounts at present to know what isgoing on
with the new CJD2. 



A new variant of CJD in the UK

Lancet April 6 1996, 347; p921-25

RG Will, JW Ironside et al . CJD Surveillance Unit, Edinburgh.

Summary: Background. Epidemiological surveillance of CJD was reinstituted in the UK in
1990 to identify any changes in the occurrence of the disease after the epidemic of BSE in
cattle. Methods. Case ascertainment of CJD was mostly by direct referral. Death certificates
onwhich CJD wa menthioned were also obtained. Clinical details were obtained for all referred
cases and information on potential risk factors for CJD was obtained by a standard
questionnaire administered to patients relatives. Neuropathological exam was done on 70% of
cases. Findings. Ten cases of CJD have beenidentified in the UK in recent months with a new
neuropathological profile. Other consistent fewtures that are unusual include the yong age of
the cases, clinical findings and the absense of the EEC features typical of CJD. Similar cases
have not been identified in other countries in the Eurlpean Surveillance system.
Interpretation. These cases appear to represent a new variant of CJD, which may be unique to
the UK. this raises the possibility that they are causally linked to BSE.

Scrapie theory fed BSE complacency

New Scientist. 13 April 1996 p4.

A journalistic news item. investigating why MAFF in the UK failed to carry out the
experiments to find out if BSE was derived from scrapie and yet continued to claim that 'as
BSE came from scrapie, therefore we wont catch BSE either'. Robert Rohwer who studies
spongiform encephalopathies at the veterans affairs Medical Centre in Baltiore Md said that
the xperiment should have been simple. You just feed scrapie to cows. Iain Pattison suggested
that happen in the UK but Wilesmith simply dismissed this and said it would only tell us what
we knew already. In 1994 18 calves were injected with scrapie. The cows became sick after
14-18nmonths and died within 5 months. But the cattle did not die of BSE, as could be seen by
post mortem study. Mark Robinson of the Animal Disease Research Unit in Pulman,
Washington said "The pathology in the brain did not resemble BSE at all" No strain of scrapie
to date produces a disease incows that resembles BSE. MAFF continue to say that it could jsut
be from a strian that they have not tried. Rohwer agrees that the MAFF scientists explanation
for the origin of BSE is plausible 2but it doesnt excuse the fac thay they have not doen the
experiment2 He suggests that BSE is in fact a new disease that first arose in a few British
cows. because cattle carcasses were also rendered into animal feed, the agent would get to
further cattle. Other influential scientists share Rohwer's criticism that the Brit Govt were
too eager to accept the vfiew based on limited scientific understanding"

Potential transmisisonof BSE via
medicinal products

BMJ 312, 20 April 1996 p988-9

E Anne Wickham. Hox 246, Canterbury CT4 5YY

Editorial saying that patients can be reassured that measures are in place to reduce risk.
Measures aimed at minimising exposure to TSEs via medicinal products were intoduced soon
after the report of the Southwood committee in 1988 in guidelines for manufacturers issued
by Britain's Comjittee on Safety of Medicines in 1989 and essentially adopted by the European
Committee for Propriatary Medcinal Products in 1992. Materials were to be sourced from
cattle under the age of 6 months, from countries fee of BSE or where low number of cases had
been reported. The guidelines included a classification of various tissues and body fluids
according to potential risk of infectivity based on expoerimental data from scrapie in sheep
and goats. Notably they did not use information from other species e.g. mice, hamster, mink.
She talks about specific products that had been derived from cattle. Notably heparins derived
from lung (lung was found to be highly infective in mice), insulin from the pancreas, and
various sources for gelatins, and serum and lactose. The guidelines recommended purification
procedures known to remove or inactivate agents causing TSEs: autoclaving or treatment with
sodium hydroxide, these being more effective than other methods. The Assn of British
Pharmacutical Industry declare their products to be safe.
She admits that people may well have been at risk from products from before the regulations,
that there may be a risk in the produts still at a low level but stopping the product may be a
greater risk, and the SEAC were happy that the guidelines were satisfactory to protect ..human
health. 
She does ot seem to be able to show that any methods of assay of infectivity in the produts has
been carried out, she suggests that assays in mice would be adequate when this is very
unlikely (only a very small amount can be inoculated into a mouse), and does not provide any
calculations as to the number of infected cattle that would have been used for manufacture (or
the point in their incubation period at which this would have taken place), even though this
data could now be calculated from MAFF data. This editorial is calming but does not put
forwards risk analyses, which are what is required.



France wakes up to mad cow risk

New Scientist 20th April 1996

France ignored a warning 4 years ago abou tht erisks of BSE passing to humans the minister
Francois d'Aubert said last week. The previous government dragged its feet apparently. In
1992 the Govt commissioned Dominique Dormont of the Atomic Energy Commissionto write a
report on human and animal forms of TSE. The report was never made public but according to
the research ministry it warned of the "existence of risks from BSE". Marc Cesbron who
studied TSE at Pasteur Inst in Lille says he wrote to the Government in 1991 warning them of
the possibility that BSE could pass to humans. the letter was forwarded to the European
Commission but little happened. D'Aubert said that an extra 5 million franks (650,000
pounds) would bee earmarked for research in 1996 and that next year spending would
increase to 69 million francs (more than in the UK). D'Auberts said he was also launching an
action plan to improve surveillance.

A role at last for mad cow protein

New Scientist 20th April 1996 p18

Shigeru Katamine a virologist at Nagasaki University and geneticist Tetsuo Noda showed that
when the entire PrP gene was removed specific damage appeared to happen to the mice after a
year. Purkinje cells were damaged and destroyed in the cerebellum. (Nature 380, p528.)
This was one up on the Zurich team that removed on ly part of the gene and the animal
remained normal.

Irene Tobler of the University of Zureich looked a little harder at the PrP mutant mice
(nulls) she showed that they did not sleep normally and repeatedly stayed awake for periods of
up to 16 seconds. Perhaps this explained the fatal familial insomnia syndrome Nature 380

Lancet 20.4.96 Evidence from America and Iceland
that infection of scrapie can remain in 'infected' hay
mites. 

The Lancet 347, April 20th 1996 p1114.

basic res in development and disabil, Staten Island, NY 10314, USA except for Siguardson,
who is from Inst of Experimental Pathology, Univ of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland

This is a very important in that it shows the agent for scrapie (or at least a strain of TSE) is
present inside the hay mites that are present on the land. It showed that a relateively high
proportion of the mites were infested, that mice could be infected from them, that hte amount
of prion protein was high enough that the western blotting looking for it in the mite could find
it after dilution of the agent by 200 fold. This may actually suggest that the agent can not just
remain in the mites but perhaps multiplies in them as well. This was required to somehow
explain why scrapie remained associated with the land but gradually died out over many years
(i.e. that sheep put on such land gradually became less and less likely to develop the disease).

What was not made clear in the article is that the hay mite does not live on blood as a source of
food and is not specifically found in parts of the country or with specific groups of sheep etc.
Also the hay mite is very small and it would have been very difficult to carry out the
experiments. This major finding may need a complex investigation.- Ed



Phylogenesis of prion protein

Nature 380 25th April 1996 p675.

Krakauer DC, Pagel, M, Southwood TRE Dept of Zoology Oxford. Zanotto PM Inst
Virology Mannfield Rd Oxford.

Phylogenic analysis for the prion protein. It appears that the PrP structure may actually be
an indication on the ability of the disease to transmit between animals. This may actually
explain why BSE infects humans and scrapie does not. This clearly cannot be the whole story,
however, as although it shows specific parts of the DNA for the PrP in cattle and humans being
the same, they are actually different at around 23 other sites. The chances of the specific
similarity that was found having arisen by accident was 1.2 in 10,000 and so the researchers
believe that the evolutionary pressures that drove the human PrP to change in a specific way
was similar to the pressure on the bovine PrP. The researchers note that the two amino acid
substitutions occur within a region of protein that is known to be involved in prion disease.

Prediction of future BSE spread

Stekel DJ, Nowak, MA, Southwood, TREDep tof Zoology, Univ of Oxford, Oxford, UK,
OX1 3PS

This is a statistical attempt, using the same method as Dealler in 1993 (Br. Food J.) to
calculate the number of cases of BSE that are currently being incubated and will appear as
clinical cases .The data is derived from MAFF, is assumed to be fully correct and is assessed
using standard techniques. No attept is made to show or calculate underreporting but they also
show that the age distribution of BSE appears to become younger in cattle born after the feed
ban, although this does not make a lot of sense. A further 15,000-24,000 cases were
predicted of BSE between 1996 and 1999 assuming no cattle born after 1992 would develop
BSE. About 75% of future cases will occur in cattl eborn in 1989 or later (at least 5 monhts
after the feed ban). No attempt was made to correalate the pattern with that expected for
specific epidemiological models e.g. vertical transmision or to calculate when the initial cases
of BSE were infected.

Unite 106, 75651, Paris Cedex 13, France

He is worried that the article by Will et al, claiming that CJD2 could be a result of the
epidemic of BSE. He is extemely critical of the methods used in stating that there was no
specific genetic link found in the patients with the disease. He claaims that in the late 1970s
he showed around the French neuropatholigal circles an apparently sporadic erly onset case
with initial ataxia, terminal dementia and abundant plaques as "le Kuru de Gonesse". It was
published as GSS only after protracted inquires had showen that four relatives had died with
similar symptoms in psychiatric hospitals..

Lancet. May 11, 1996, vol 347 p 1332/3

Jean-Phillipe Deslys, corrinne Ida lasmezas, Thierry Billette de Villemeur,
Alexandre Jaegly, Dominique Dormont Various sources.

They explain that the reasons given by Will et al for the cases of CJD2 appearing in younger
groups were possibly not the only possible story. Will et al felt it was because younger people
were more exposed to infective material (this has been shown by other groups as well - Ed).
This groups, however feel that there may be another factor, a genetic one also, that made these
people more open to infection. Also, as almost all the population would have been exposed to
some degree, it may even be that a factor is protecting the other members of the community
but missing in these people. They suggest that people already carying non-virulent strians of
disease may actually be non-susceptible to BSE. Only young, gnetically susceptible people who
had not been previously exposed to this agent would beinected with BSE. As a result the
exposure of the whole population to BSE would be apparent in an unusual form of CJD ina
small group under the age of 40 years. (this is actually very similar to what was said by
Harash Narang to the House of Comons Select Committee on 17th of April 1996- Ed).

He suggests that the reason for sporadic CJD having such a high proportion of met/met may be
because they did not really appear out of the blue but caught the condition from animals in the
same way as the CJD2 patients may have done.

Taylor DM Neuropathogenesis Unit, Inst for Animal health, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh, EH9
3JF. 

This is following the article suggesting that sterilisation of medical devices contaminated with
CJD need not be a problem. He says that there is simply not enough known to make that sort of
statemet. He explains that in different TSEs the time needed to sterilise products was not
relaible for instance BSE in cow brain dropped 3.5 logs whereas scrapie infected hamster
brain dropped 7.5 logs under the same action of heat. One of the ideas was that there was
always a small percentage of the agent that was completely resistant to heat and hence he did
not agree with the original author.

This is an attempt at testing the use of an amphoteracin derivative, supposedly less toxic on
the incubation period of scrapie in mice. They looked for the accumlation of glial fibrillary
acidic progein (GFAP) and the accumulation of PrPres. What they found was that the treatment
during the incuabtion period delayed all factors. The continuous treatment with the drug in
this experiment may make it impossible in humans, however.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins plays a role in a wide variety of cellular functions including regulation of protein kinase C and exocytosis. Using antisera specific for the N termini of 14-3-3 isoforms described previously and an additional antiserum specific for the C terminus of epsilon isoform, protease digestion of intact 14-3-3 showed that the N-terminal half of 14-3-3 (a 16 kDa fragment) was an intact, dimeric domain of the protein. Two isoforms of 14-3-3, tau and epsilon, were expressed in E. coli and their secondary structure was shown by circular dichroism to be identical to wild-type protein, and expression of N-terminally-deleted epsilon 14-3-3 protein showed that the N-terminal 26 amino acids are important for dimerization. Intact 14-3-3 is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, but the N-terminal domain does not inhibit PKC activity. Site-specific mutagenesis of several regions in the tau isoform of 14-3-3, including the mutation of a putative pseudosubstrate site to a potential substrate sequence, did not alter its inhibitory activity. Intact 14-3-3 proteins are phosphorylated by protein kinase C with a low stoichiometry, but truncated isoforms are phosphorylated much more efficiently by this kinase. This may imply that the proteins may adopt a different structural conformation, possibly upon binding to the membrane, which could modulate their activity. 14-3-3 proteins are found at high concentration on synaptic plasma membranes and this binding is mediated through the N-terminal 12 kDa of 14-3-3.

14-3-3 proteins have recently been implicated in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways via their interaction with several oncogene and protooncogene products. We found recently that 14-3-3 associates with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in T cells. We report here the identification of the 120-kDa 14-3-3tau-binding phosphoprotein present in activated T cell lysates as Cbl, a protooncogene product of unknown function which was found recently to be a major protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) substrate, and to interact with several signaling molecules including PI3-K, in T lymphocytes. The association between 14-3-3tau and Cbl was detected both in vitro and in intact T cells and, in contrast to Raf-1, was markedly increased following T cell activation. The use of truncated 14-3-3tau fusion proteins demonstrated that the 15 C-terminal residues are required for the association between 14-3-3 and three of its target proteins, namely, Cbl, Raf-1, and PI3-K. The findings that 14-3-3tau binds both PI3-K and Cbl, together with recent reports of an association between Cbl and PI3-K, suggest that 14-3-3 dimers play a critical role in signal transduction processes by promoting and coordinating protein-protein interactions of signaling proteins.

CMP-NeuAc:GM1 alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase (ST-IV) was purified to homogeneity from rat brain. Microsequencing of the tryptic peptides derived from the purified enzyme revealed two amino acid sequences homologous to the 14-3-3 proteins. A polyclonal antibody was raised against purified ST-IV. A 33 kDa protein was co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts with the anti-(ST-IV) antibody as detected by Western blot analysis. This protein was identified as a subtype of 14-3-3 family by an anti-(14-3-3) antibody. Screening of a rat brain lambda gt11 library using the anti-(ST-IV) antibody resulted in the identification of a cDNA clone coding for the subtype of 14-3-3 protein. These results indicate an association of the 14-3-3 protein with the sialyltransferase. Since the 14-3-3 protein has PKC inhibitor activities and the activity of sialyltransferases is, at least in part, regulated by PKC, the association of the 14-3-3 protein with ST-IV may indicate a role for this protein in the post-translational regulation of the sialyltransferase activity through the processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

The 14-3-3 protein family, which is present at particularly high concentrations in mammalian brain, is known to be involved in various cellular functions, including protein kinase C regulation and exocytosis. Despite the fact that most of the 14-3-3 proteins are cytosolic, a small but significant proportion of 14-3-3 in brain is tightly and selectively associated with some membranes. Using a panel of isoform-specific antisera we find that the epsilon, eta, gamma, beta, and zeta isoforms are all present in purified synaptic membranes but absent from mitochondrial and myelin membranes. In addition, the eta, epsilon, and gamma isoforms but not the beta and zeta isoforms are associated with isolated synaptic junctions. When different populations of synaptosomes were fractionated by a nonequilibrium Percoll gradient procedure, the epsilon and gamma isoforms were present and the beta and zeta isoforms were absent from the membranes of synaptosomes sedimenting in the more dense parts of the gradient. The finding that these proteins are associated with different populations of synaptic membranes suggests that they are selectively expressed in different classes of neurones and raises the possibility that some or all of them may influence neurotransmission by regulating exocytosis and/or phosphorylation.

The novel family of 14-3-3 proteins may be involved in the regulation of neuronal activity. During our search for proteins coordinately expressed with the prohormone proopiomelanocortin in the melanotrope cells of the Xenopus intermediate pituitary gland, we cloned and sequenced a pituitary cDNA encoding a Xenopus 14-3-3 protein. Alignment of the Xenopus protein with known mammalian, Drosophila and plant 14-3-3 polypeptide and with a mammalian protein kinase C inhibitor protein revealed that the neuron-specific 14-3-3-related proteins are highly conserved (60-88%) throughout eukaryotic evolution.

14-3-3 proteins form a highly conserved protein family whose members have been shown to activate tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, inhibit protein kinase C and possess phospholipase A2 activity in vitro. We have isolated and analyzed a 14-3-3 protein cDNA clone (H14-3-3) from a human fetal brain cDNA library and found it to possess a high level of sequence identity with the bovine 14-3-3 eta protein cDNA in both the translated and untranslated regions, suggesting the presence of cis-regulatory elements in the untranslated regions of these mRNAs. The proteins encoded by these two cDNAs ar</h3>e 98.4% identical. Two different sized RNA species, approx. 1.9 and 3.5 kb in size that are expressed in a variety of tissues hybridize with this cDNA. However, only the 1.9 kb RNA is detected in the fetal brain. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from eight different human tissues shows that 14-3-3 protein mRNAs are expressed in many tissues in the body. In agreement with previous reports, the highest abundance of RNA hybridizing with this cDNA is seen in the brain.

A broad range of organisms and tissues contain 14-3-3 proteins, which have been associated with many diverse functions including critical roles in signal transduction pathways, exocytosis and cell cycle regulation. We report here the crystal structure of the human T-cell 14-3-3 isoform (tau) dimer at 2.6 A resolution. Each monomer (Mr 28K) is composed of an unusual arrangement of nine antiparallel alpha-helices organized as two structural domains. The dimer creates a large, negatively charged channel approximately 35 A broad, 35 A wide and 20 A deep. Overall, invariant residues line the interior of this channel whereas the more variable residues are distributed on the outer surface. At the base of this channel is a 16-residue segment of 14-3-3 which has been implicated in the binding of 14-3-3 to protein kinase C.

The fusicoccin binding protein (FCBP) is a highly conserved plasma membrane protein present in all higher plants tested thus far. It exhibits high- and low-affinity binding for the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC). We purified the active FCBP from a fraction highly enriched in plasma membrane by selective precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. After SDS-PAGE, the two FCBP subunits of 30 and 31 kD were detected as major bands. Amino acid sequence analysis of the 31-kD polypeptide displayed a high degree of identity with so-called 14-3-3 proteins, a class of mammalian brain proteins initially described as regulators of neurotransmitter synthesis and protein kinase C inhibitors. Thereafter, we affinity purified the 30- and 31-kD FCBP subunits, using biotinylated FC in combination with a monomeric avidin column. Immunodecoration of these 30- and 31-kD FCBP subunits with polyclonal antibodies raised against a 14-3-3 homolog from yeast confirmed the identity of the FCBP as a 14-3-3 homolog. Similar to all 14-3-3 protein homologs, the FCBP seems to exist as a dimer in native form. Thus far, the FCBP is the only 14-3-3 homolog with a receptor-like function. The conserved structure of the 14-3-3 protein family is a further indication that the FCBP plays an important role in the physiology of higher plants.

The 14-3-3 proteins comprise a family of highly conserved acidic proteins. Several activities have been ascribed to these proteins, including activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases in the presence of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, regulation of protein kinase C, phospholipase A2 activity, stimulation of exocytosis and activation of bacterial exoenzyme S (ExoS) during ADP-ribosylation of host proteins. In addition, a plant 14-3-3 protein is present in a G-box DNA/protein-binding complex. Previously, we isolated the BMH1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding a putative 14-3-3 protein. Using the polymerase chain reaction method, we have isolated a second yeast gene encoding a 14-3-3 protein (BMH2). While disruption of either BMH1 or BMH2 alone had little effect, it was impossible to obtain viable cells with both genes disrupted.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins have recently been identified as regulatory elements in intracellular signalling pathways: 14-3-3 proteins bind to oncogene and proto-oncogene products, including c-Raf-1 (refs 2-5), c-Bcr (ref. 6) and polyomavirus middle-T antigen; overexpression of 14-3-3 activates Raf kinase in yeast and induces meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes. Here we report the crystal structure of the major isoform of mammalian 14-3-3 proteins at 2.9 A resolution. Each subunit of the dimeric protein consists of a bundle of nine antiparallel helices that form a palisade around an amphipathic groove. The groove is large enough to accommodate a tenth helix, and we propose that binding to an amphipathic helix represents a general mechanism for the interaction of 14-3-3 with diverse cellular proteins. The residues in the dimer interface and the putative ligand-binding surface are invariant among vertebrates, yeast and plants, suggesting a conservation of structure and function throughout the 14-3-3 family.

We present the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone of mRNA encoding human 14-3-3 protein, a protein kinase-dependent activator of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases and an endogenous inhibitor of protein kinase C. The 1,730-nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA contains 191 bp of a 5'-noncoding region, the complete 738 bp of coding region, and 801 bp of a 3'-noncoding region containing three canonical polyadenylation signals. The 14-3-3 protein eta chain cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 246 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight 28,196. The predicted amino acid sequence of human 14-3-3 protein eta was highly homologous to that of previously reported bovine and rat 14-3-3 proteins with only two amino acid differences. The sequence carries structural features as putative regions responsible for activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases and for inhibition of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. Northern blot analysis demonstrated widespread expression of the 14-3-3 protein eta chain in cultured cell lines derived from various human tumors. These findings suggest the conservative functions of the 14-3-3 protein among species. Spot blot hybridization analysis with flow-sorted chromosomes showed that the human 14-3-3 protein eta chain gene is assigned to chromosome 22.

The highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 family of proteins bind to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The nature and specificity of 14-3-3 binding is, however, not known. Here we show that 14-3-3 is a specific phosphoserine-binding protein. Using a panel of phosphorylated peptides based on Raf-1, we have defined the 14-3-3 binding motif and show that most of the known 14-3-3 binding proteins contain the motif. Peptides containing the motif could disrupt 14-3-3 complexes and inhibit maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results suggest that the interactions of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins are critical for the activation of signaling proteins. Our findings also suggest novel roles for serine/threonine phosphorylation in the assembly of protein-protein complexes.

<h3>A single <A NAME="Arabidopsis">Arabidopsis</A> GF14 isoform possesses biochemical characteristics of diverse 14-3-3 homologues</h3>

Arabidopsis cDNA clones of GF14 proteins originally were isolated on the basis of their association with the G-box DNA/protein complex by a monoclonal antibody screening approach. GF14 proteins are homologous to the 14-3-3 family of mammalian proteins. Here we demonstrate that recombinant GF14 omega, one member of the Arabidopsis GF14 protein family, is a dimeric protein that possesses many of the attributes of diverse mammalian 14-3-3 homologues. GF14 omega activates rat brain tryptophan hydroxylase and protein kinase C in a manner similar to the bovine 14-3-3 protein. It also activates exoenzyme S of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as does bovine brain factor activating exoenzyme S (FAS), which is itself a member of 14-3-3 proteins. In addition, GF14 omega binds calcium, as does the human 14-3-3 homologue reported to be a phospholipase A2. These results indicate that a single isoform of this plant protein family can have multiple functions and that individual GF14 isoforms may have multiple roles in mediating signal transductions in plants. However, GF14 omega does not regulate growth in an in vivo test for functional similarity to the yeast 14-3-3 homologue, BMH1. Thus, while a single plant GF14 isoform can exhibit many of the biochemical attributes of diverse mammalian 14-3-3 homologues, open questions remain regarding the physiological functions of GF14/14-3-3 proteins.

The zeta-form 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3zeta) regulates protein kinases and interacts with several signaling molecules. We reported previously that a platelet adhesion receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX, was associated with a 29-kDa protein with partial sequences identical to 14-3-3zeta. In this study, the interaction between GPIb-IX and recombinant 14-3-3zeta is reconstituted. Further, we show that the 14-3-3zeta binding site in GPIb is within a 15 residue sequence at the C terminus of GPIb-alpha, as indicated by antibody inhibition and direct binding of 14-3-3zeta to synthetic GPIb-alpha cytoplasmic domain peptides. The 14-3-3zeta binds to recombinant wild type GPIb-IX but not to the GPIb-alpha mutants lacking C-terminal 5 or more residues, suggesting that the C-terminal 5 residues of GPIb-alpha are critical. Similarity between the GPIb-alpha C-terminal sequence and the serine-rich regions of Raf and Bcr kinases suggests a possible serine-rich recognition motif for the 14-3-3 protein.

The 14-3-3 protein family plays a role in a wide variety of cell signaling processes including monoamine synthesis, exocytosis, and cell cycle regulation, but the structural requirements for the activity of this protein family are not known. We have previously shown that the 14-3-3 protein binds with and activates phosphorylated tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitter serotonin) and proposed that this activity might be mediated through the COOH-terminal acidic region of the 14-3-3 molecules. In this report we demonstrate, using a series of truncation mutants of the 14-3-3 eta isoform expressed in Escherichia coli, that the COOH-terminal region, especially restricted in amino acids 171-213, binds indeed with the phosphorylated TPH. This restricted region, which we termed 14-3-3 box I, is one of the structural regions whose sequence is highly conserved beyond species, allowing that the plant 14-3-3 isoform (GF14) could also activate rat brain TPH. The 14-3-3 box I is the first functional region whose activity has directly been defined in the 14-3-3 sequence and may represent a common structural element whereby 14-3-3 interacts with other target proteins such as Raf-1 kinase. The result is consistent with the recently published crystal structure of this protein family, which suggests the importance of the negatively charged groove-like structure in the ligand binding.

Prions mediate the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases, including bovine
spongiform encephalopathy in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The prion
particle consists mainly, if not entirely, of PrPSc, a posttranslationally modified isoform of
the cellular host-encoded prion protein (PrPc). It has been suggested that additional cellular
factors might be involved in the physiological function of PrPc and in the propagation of
PrPSc. Here we employ a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screen to search for proteins
which interact specifically with the Syrian golden hamster prion protein. Screening of a HeLa
cDNA library identified heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), a cellular chaperone as a major
interactor for PrPc. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed in vitro for the
recombinant proteins PrPc23-231 and rPrP27-30 fused to glutathione S-transferase with
recombinant human Hsp60 as well as the bacterial GroEL. The interaction site for
recombinant Hsp60 and GroEL proteins was mapped between amino acids 180 and 210 of the
prion protein by screening with a set of recombinant PrPc fragments. The binding of Hsp60
and GroEL occurs within a region which contains parts of the putative alpha-helical domains
H3 and H4 of the prion protein.

<dd>The discovery that the major difference between normal and 
disease-associated isoforms of PrP is in protein conformation (Pan <i>et. 
al.</i>, 1993), led several researchers to hypothesise either that molecular 
chaperones may be involved in the folding of PrP, and hence the disease process, or that PrP itself was a 
chaperone that was misfolded in some way (Liautard, 1991).<p><hr size=3 width=60% align=center><p>
<dd>While studying ubiquitin-protein conjugate immunoreactive inclusions in both Alzheimer's disease and scrapie-infected mouse brain, we discovered 
immunoreactive vesicular structures which are members of the endosome-lysosome 
system (Lowe <i>et. al.</i>, 1990; Lowe <i>et. al.</i>, 1992). These features 
were also seen independently in the human prion encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt 
Jakob disease (CJD) (Ironside <i>et. al.</i>, 1993). Immunogold electron 
microscopy confirms the structures as members of the endosome-lysosome system, 
since they show immunoreactivity to the lysosome-specific enzyme 
beta-glucuronidase as well as to ubiquitin-protein conjugates; interestingly, they were also seen contain an hsp70 (Laszlo <i>et. al.</i>, 
1992; Arnold <i>et. al.</i>, 1995).
<p>
We propose that the conversion of 
PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> to PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> occurs in endosome-lysosome 'bioreactors', 
a hypothesis that is supported by independent biochemical studies. Similarly, an hsp70 is 
detected in endosome-lysosomes in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (Laszlo <i>et. al.</i>, 1991).<p>
<dd>Intracellular and extracellular proteins can be degraded by lysosomes (Dice, 1987) after delivery to the endosome-lysosome system by endocytosis, 
crinophagy, microautophagy, macroautophagy or by hsc73-mediated transport (for 
a review see Terlecky, 1994). Cytosolic proteins are known to be internalised 
and degraded in lysosomes in an hsc73-mediated fashion (Chiang <i>et. al.</i>, 
1989; Terlecky <i>et. al.</i>, 1992) provided that they possess the specific 
peptide signal motif KFERQ or a related sequence (Terlecky <i>et. al.</i>, 
1992). While PrP does not contain this motif, the findings of Dice and 
colleagues indicate that a constitutively expressed hsp70 (hsc73) might be 
found in endosome-lysosomes in neurones and in lymphocytes.<p>
<dd>If PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> is produced from PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> at the cell surface or in endosome-lysosomes, then presumably heat shock proteins must either reside in these compartments (or their topological equivalents) or be able



 to enter such compartments in
 scrapie-producing cells. Clearly it must be established biochemically that heat shock proteins are indeed present in these 
organelles.<p><hr size=3 width=60% align=center><p>
<dd>Recent studies on hsp28 and hsp72 in cell models of scrapie have shown a 
disease-specific modification in the heat shock response. In contrast to the 
situation in control N2a cells, hsp28 and hsp72 are not induced by heat shock 
in scrapie-infected N2a (ScN2a) cells (Tatzelt <i>et. al.</i>, 1995); also the 
transcript of hsp72 is only seen in heat-shocked N2a cells. Tatzelt and co-authors offer several possible explanations 
as to why hsp73 transport is altered in PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> producing cells: hsp73 may be trapped in a particular subcellular compartment; hsp73 may be bound to a protein (perhaps PrP<sup>Sc </sup>?); hsp73 may be altered structurally; or, as 



a final alterna
tive, that translocation mechanisms may be altered. Whatever the reason, it does appear that the roles of PrP and the heat shock proteins could be intrinsically linked (Tatzelt <i>et. al.</i>, 1995).<p><hr size=3 width=60% align=center><p>
<dd>Studies on the prion encephalopathies using transgenic animals have suggested a possible role for heat shock proteins: transgenic mice expressing human PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> are surprisingly insensitive to human prions injected into the brain



 (Telling <i>et
. al.</i>, 1995). Indeed, both onset and pathology of the disease appear to be similar to what is seen when human prions are injected directly into non-transgenic animals (Telling <i>et. al.</i>, 1994). On crossing these transgenic mice with PrP-null mice




 (PrP <sup>0/0</sup>), the crossed mice are very susceptible to human prions, indicating that mouse PrP inhibits the conversion of human PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> to human PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup>. 
Based on these findings and additional studies with transgenic mice expressing 
mutations known to cause natural prion diseases, the amino acid sequence of 
residues 96-167 in PrP appears to be vital for the conversion of 
PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> to PrP<sup>Sc </sup>(Telling <i>et. al.</i>, 1995). If this 
region is homologous in endogenous PrP, or in the corresponding protein product of a PrP transgene, the disease progresses more rapidly. A second region in PrP, at the C-terminus between residues 215 and 230, has also been found to be important in the pro




duction of PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> and may be the region where another species-specific macromolecule (presumably a protein) binds to PrP<sup>C </sup>(Telling <i>et. al.</i>, 1995). This second protein, reflecting its hypothetical nature, has been



 designated 'pr
otein X'. If the binding of host PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> to host protein X was stronger than the binding of host PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> to infecting PrP<sup>Sc </sup>(because the latter originated in a different species), then the rate of d



isease progression would be sl
ow.<p><hr size=3 width=60% align=center><p>
<dd>One final area of research which has yielded interesting results implicating heat shock proteins in the prion encephalopathies is the study of 
non-mendellian inherited elements (or extrachromosomally inherited 
determinants) in yeast (reviewed in Tuite, 1994). [PSI] is an element of <i>S. 
cerevisiae</i>  which is known to amplify the efficiency of suppressor tRNAs, 
while [URE3] stops cells carrying out nitrogen catabolite repression - the 
suppression of genes utilised for exploiting poor nitrogen sources when a good 
source becomes available (Wickner, 1995). Several strong pieces of evidence 
suggest that [PSI] and [URE3] are `prion-like' forms of the `normal' proteins 
Sup35p and Ure2p, respectively: i) each element is 
reversibly curable, unlike nucleic acid replicons which cannot return once 
cured unless introduced from another cell; ii) [PSI] and [URE3] depend on 
chromosomal genes for their propagation, while phenotypes of recessive
<i>sup35</i> and <i>ure2</i> closely resemble those produced in the presence of [PSI] and [URE3]; iii) overproduction of Ure2p and Sup35p induces the 
generation of [URE3] and [PSI] respectively; the presence of more of the 
`normal' form increases the chances of spontaneous `prion-type' change 
occurring (Masison and Wickner, 1995); iv) the N-terminus of Sup35p has several tandem nonapeptide repeats (similar to the octapeptide repeats seen in 
mammalian PrP); v) the predicted secondary structure of the N-terminal regions 
of Ure2p, Sup35p and mammalian PrPs all show related features, including very 
little alpha-helix or beta-sheets, and a high density of turns.<p>
<dd>Hsp104 (a member of the hsp100 or Clp families of proteins (Wickner,S. <i>et. al.</i>, 1994; Wawrzynow <i>et. al.</i>, 1995) is highly conserved in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and has been shown to have a chaperone-like 
function in yeast (Parsell <i>et. al.</i>, 1984). Loss of [PSI] occurs in 
relation to both over- or under-production of hsp104, suggesting both that it 
has a role in the conversion of the normal form of the protein (Sup35p) to the 
prion form [PSI] and also that, when too much hsp104 is present, this change in structure is reversed (Chernoff <i>et. al.</i>, 1995). Concentrations of 
guanidine which can cure yeast strains of both [PSI] and [URE3] also induce the production of hsp104 , as can slight heat shock (Tuite <i>et. al.</i>, 1981; Cox <i>et. al.</i>, 1988). Thus, it seems that the controlled production of a heat shock protein i




s effective in reducing the production of the prion 
isoforms of these proteins.<p><hr size=3 width=60% align=center><p>
<dd>The production of mammalian PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> from PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> <i>in 
vitro</i> is known to be very inefficient; a system in which the ratio of 
PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup>:PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> (both from the same species) was 1:50 yielded 
only trace amounts of PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> <i>de</i> <i>novo</i> (Kocisko <i>et. 
al.</i>, 1994). Perhaps if a complete cell-free system could be set up (i.e. 
one which contained purified protein X or had a purified heat shock protein 
added to the system) an <i>in vitro</i> conversion that is as efficient as the 
conversion in the brains of infected animals could be created experimentally. 
Similarly, if PrP<sup><small>C</small></sup> to PrP<sup><small>Sc</small></sup> conformation changes occur in the endocytic pathway, then <i>in-vitro</i>  experiments with extracts of 
endosome-lysosomes may again increase the efficiency of the process.

<h3>Some notes on Scrapie</h2>
<p>
<h5>Chris Seidel &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeptember 1995</h5>
</center>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Scrapie is a member of a class of 
neurodegenerative diseases known as spongiform 
encephalopathies. Scrapie is referred to as a disease 
of protein conformation because it appears to be 
caused by the misfolding of a normal cellular 
protein, termed the prion protein, or PrP (Prusiner, 
1982). While scrapie was originally identified in 
sheep and goats, the prion diseases span from 
chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle, 
transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), and 
several diseases in humans such as Kuru, 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-
Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal 
familial insomnia (Gajdusek 1988). Common among 
these disorders is the three stage transition of PrP 
from normal cellular protein to the scrapie isoform 
and then to scrapie amyloid fibers which 
accumulate extracellularly in the brain (Gajdusek, 
1988; Prusiner, 1992). The prion diseases have 
been something of an enigma due to their 
mysterious nature of transmission and propagation. 
Scrapie and Kuru are infectious and can be spread 
in a variety of ways, including cannibalism. There is 
also an associated incubation time between 
exposure and sickness that can range from months 
to decades. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Because scrapie is infectious, early 
investigators were led to propose that scrapie was a 
viral agent with a slow course of infection (Cho, 
1976; Kimberlin & Hunter, 1967). However the 
search for an associated nucleic acid has not been 
fruitful. The scrapie agent appears transparent to 
UV radiation at 254 nm and easily maintains 
infectivity at doses of UV far beyond those required 
to inactivate any virus tested (Alper et al.,1967). 
However, since different strains of Scrapie can be 
isolated, some investigators adhere to the notion of 
an associated independent genome for scrapie 
propagation (Bruce & Dickinson, 1987; Braig & 
Diringer, 1985). 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	The scrapie agent was identified by enriching 
fractions from Syrian hamster brains for scrapie 
infectivity (Prusiner et al., 1982). The subsequent 
identification of a scrapie specific protein and 
generation of antibodies led to the identification of 
the prion protein in both infected and uninfected 
brains. This finding suggested for the first time that 
the scrapie agent is a single protein that exists as a 
different isoform in healthy versus uninfected 
tissue (Oesch et al., 1985). Subsequent studies have 
shown that the prion protein appears to be 
responsible for both the toxicity and infectivity of 
scrapie. The prion protein in its non-toxic isoform is 
referred to as PrPC, whereas the toxic and infective 
isoform is referred to as PrPSc. The two forms of 
PrP are easily distinguished based on their 
differential sensitivity to proteases, and solubility 
in detergents. PrP is normally observed as a 33-35 
kDa protein in cellular extracts from either infected 
or healthy cells (Pfeifer et al., 1993). However PrPC 
is rapidly and completely degraded by digestion 
with proteinase K whereas PrPSc is stable to 
digestion with proteinase K, forming a 27-30 kDa 
protease resistant core termed PrP27-30. In 
addition, PrPC remains soluble in the presence of 
detergents, whereas PrP27-30 polymerizes into 
fibrils. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	The scrapie protein is encoded by a single 
copy cellular gene termed the prion protein gene 
(Oesch et al., 1985). The PrP gene is highly 
conserved across species, showing 88%-90% 
conservation at the genomic DNA level between 
sheep and other mammals such as human, rat, 
mouse, hamster and cow. The protein is encoded by 
a single exon, ruling out differential splicing as a 
cause of different protein conformers (Basler et al., 
1986). The mRNA for PrP is expressed at similar 
levels in the brains and other tissues of both sick 
and healthy animals (Oesch et al., 1985). The 
normal cellular function of PrP is unknown. The 
protein is normally found as a membrane bound 
sialoglycoprotein (Stahl et al., 1987, Haraguchi et al., 
1985) on the surface of neuroblastoma cells. Studies 
of mice in which the PrP gene has been removed 
(prn-P0/0) indicate that the gene is non-essential. 
Prn0/0 mice develop and behave normally with no 
visible or measurable defects (Beler et al., 1992). 
Curiously, loss of the PrP gene renders these mice 
no longer susceptible to scrapie infection (Beler et 
al., 1992). Furthermore, propagation of scrapie 
infectivity is also eliminated in mice missing the 
PrP gene (Prusiner, et al. 1993).
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	In the past, studies of the scrapie reagent 
were greatly hindered by a bioassay requiring long 
incubation times on the order of months, or 
sometimes years, after injection of the agent into 
live animals, before a result could be seen (Prusiner 
1992). With the development of chronically 
infected cell lines in which recombinant prion 
protein could be expressed and specifically 
identified (Butler et al., 1988), progress in studying 
scrapie has been greatly increased. Expression of 
prion protein in an infected cell line supports the 
conversion of endogenous PrPC as well as 
recombinant PrPC into PrPSc (Scott et al., 1992). 
While specific antibodies which can distinguish 
between the two isoforms have not been reported, 
the two forms are successfully distinguished based 
on their sensitivity to protease. Studies with cell 
lines have given insight into the cellular trafficking 
of the prion protein. However, the mechanism of 
conversion of prion protein into the scrapie isoform 
is not understood. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
 	Upon discovery that PrPC and PrPSc were 
encoded by the same gene a search began for some 
posttranslational modification that could give rise to 
the difference between the two proteins. However, 
examination of the two proteins for a covalent 
modification unique to one of the two isoforms has 
shown that both forms are modified identically. The 
prion protein undergoes several posttranslational 
modifications before either being degraded as PrPC 
or transforming into PrPSc and accumulating. A 
signal sequence present near the C-terminus targets 
prion protein synthesis to the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), where the sequence is cleaved 
leaving ser-231 as a site for attachment of a 
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) group. Addition 
of the GPI moiety serves to anchor PrP to the 
surface of the cell. The GPI anchor is present on 
both PrPC and PrP27-30. However, synthesis of a 
truncated PrP lacking the GPI anchor attachment 
signal still results in the production of PrPSc, thus 
eliminating this component as a necessary factor for 
PrPSc production (Rogers et al., 1993). 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	PrP protein also undergoes glycosylation in 
the Golgi. There are two consensus sites for 
asparagine linked glycosylation near the C-terminus 
of the prion protein. Examination of the various 
forms of the prion protein reveals that PrPC, PrPSc, 
and PrP27-30 are all glycosylated. While a myriad 
of different oligosaccharide structures are possible 
on the prion protein (Endo et al., 1989), it is 
doubtful that they play any role in leading to the 
transformation of PrPC into PrPSc. Use of a scrapie-
infected cell line which can support PrPSc 
production has shown that synthesis of PrPSc in the 
presence of agents which block N-linked 
glycosylation still allows the production of protease 
resistant PrPSc, albeit PrPSc produced in this fashion 
is unglycosylated (Taraboulos et al., 1990). These 
results have been repeated by other methods, 
including site directed mutagenesis to eliminate the 
sites of N-linked glycosylation. PrPSc is still 
produced in the absence of sites for N-linked 
glycosylation. Thus it would appear that 
glycosylation is not an essential element in the 
transformation of PrPC into PrPSc. 

	To begin examining how early in the 
trafficking pathway scrapie could be detected, and 
assess whether events during protein processing 
were responsible for misfolding of PrP, the ER-Golgi 
was examined. Brefeldin A is a reagent which 
causes the cis-medial and trans-Golgi cisternae to 
fuse with the ER and prevents exit of proteins from 
the ER-Golgi network (Doms et al., 1989). Treatment 
of scrapie-infected cells with Brefeldin A to retain 
PrP within the ER-Golgi apparatus was found to 
reversibly block synthesis of PrPSc. Thus it would 
appear that compartmentalization of PrP within the 
ER-Golgi is insufficient for PrPSc formation. Removal 
of BFA allows the synthesis of PrPSc to continue. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Shortly after exit from the Golgi, PrPC appears 
on the cell surface held to the plasma membrane 
via the GPI anchor. Treatment of cells with 
phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C 
(PIPLC) cleaves the phosphatidyl linkage and 
releases protease sensitive PrPC into the medium. 
Interestingly this also  inhibits production of PrPSc 
(Caughey & Raymond, 1991; Borchelt et al., 1990), 
suggesting that PrPSc is synthesized from PrPC after 
it travels to the plasma membrane. PrPC can be 
immunofluoresced on the surface of cells using an 
antibody that recognizes both PrPC and PrPSc. 
However upon treatment of cells with PIPLC, the 
immunofluorescence signal is lost (Borchelt et al., 
1990). Although PrPSc is easily detected within cells 
(Taraboulos et al., 1990), it has not been detected 
on the surface of cells. Digestion of scrapie-infected 
cells with PIPLC does not release protease resistant 
PrP into the medium, yet the immunofluorescence 
signal is lost. Cell surface proteins can be labeled by 
a number of cell impermeant reagents (Goodloe-
Holland & Luna ,1987). Exposure of scrapie-infected 
cells to sulfo-NHS-biotin allowed labeling of PrPC, 
but not PrPSc, although control experiments indicate 
that purified PrP27-30  is susceptible to sulfo-NHS-
biotin labeling and maintains a protease resistant 
state afterwards (Borchelt et al., 1990). For these 
reasons it is thought that PrP enters the cell before 
conversion to PrPSc occurs. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Evidence to date seems to indicate that the 
prion protein assumes the scrapie isoform in the 
endocytic pathway (Borchelt et al., 1992). However, 
direct identification of endosomes containing PrPSc 
has not been achieved. Immunofluorescence and 
immunocytochemical studies have been used to 
assay for the presence of PrP within cells. PrPSc is 
found to accumulate within cells, while PrPC is 
generally not observed except for very minor 
amounts in the ER-Golgi. From examination of the 
morphology of immunoperoxidase staining patterns, 
PrPSc was deduced to be associated with 
intracellular vesicles. No intracellular staining 
pattern was observed in healthy cells. These 
structures were found to be positive for acid 
phosphatase activity thus identifying them as 
secondary lysosomes. Kinetic studies show that the 
time between acquisition of protease resistance and 
exposure to lysosomal proteases is approximately 
one hour (Taraboulos et al., 1991). Use of 
lysosomotropic amines prevents the N-terminal 
trimming of PrPSc in the lysosome, yet does not 
block the formation of PrPSc, nor does it prevent the 
degradation of PrPC. Since PrPSc cannot be detected 
on the surface of cells, yet can be detected in 
lysosomes, and PrPC can not be detected in cells yet 
can be detected at the surface of cells, these 
observations taken together with those listed above 
point to the endosomal pathway as a possible place 
for the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (Borchelt et al., 
1992). 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	In the absence of evidence for any significant 
covalent modifications that can distinguish PrPC 
from PrPSc, focus has shifted to the difference in 
secondary and tertiary structure between the two 
forms of the prion protein. Purification techniques 
for the scrapie protein have depended in large part 
on harsh conditions such as detergent extraction 
and proteinase K digestion. Purification of the prion 
proteins for structural studies would of course 
depend on more native conditions and structural 
studies have been hindered by the difficulty in 
purifying these two proteins. PrPC is soluble but 
difficult to purify in large amounts (Prusiner, 
1991), and PrPSc is inherently insoluble and 
difficult to work with. Nonetheless spectroscopic 
data has been collected for both PrPC and PrPSc. 
Examination of PrPC and PrPSc by Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy shows that the two 
differ significantly in the relative amounts of alpha 
helix and Beta sheet that each species contains. 
These findings have been verified by Circular 
Dichroism spectroscopy as well. PrPC contains 
approximately 42% alpha helix, and 3% beta sheet. 
However, PrPSc contains a high amount of Beta 
sheet, approximately 43% which rises to 54 % in 
PrP27-30 the product of proteolytic processing of 
PrPSc (Pan et al., 1993). 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	The mechanism of prion propagation is not 
understood. Several theories exist as to how the 
prion protein comes to be misfolded and form 
aggregates. There is general agreement that PrPC 
and PrPSc differ primarily by conformation. One 
model holds that scrapie formation is a kinetic 
event dependent primarily on seeded nucleation, 
much like protein crystallization (Come et al., 1993, 
Jarret & Lansbury, 1993), or the polymerization of 
hemoglobin S into fibers as in sickle cell anemia 
(Hofrichter et al., 1974). PrPC is postulated to unfold 
slightly, exposing  a hydrophobic stretch of amino 
acids to solvent. Aggregation then depends on the 
colocalization of the seed and the monomer. The 
partially unfolded state, PrPU, is proposed to be 
easily accessible from PrPC. Since PrPU formation is 
considered rapid, PrPU monomer is readily 
available for aggregation in the presence of a seed. 
Formation of the seed is the rate limiting step, and 
is considered to be slow, and dependent on the 
concentration of monomer molecules. In the case of 
infection, seed is introduced from outside, after 
which rapid aggregation can begin. Sporadic 
disorders, on the other hand, would depend on seed 
formation from PrPU monomers. The equilibrium 
between PrPC and PrPU could easily depend on the 
cellular environment, and be influenced by things 
such as pH, or the presence of interacting factors as 
well as mutations in the PrP gene that favor PrPU 
formation (Brown et al., 1991).
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Other investigators hold to the notion that the 
prion protein can exist in a meta stable state 
capable of collapse to either of two more permanent 
states. This model put forth by Prusiner and 
colleagues suggests that PrPC can assume a partially 
unfolded intermediate, PrP*, which can then 
become PrPSc, be degraded, or resume the PrPC 
form. In addition, PrPSc would be able to serve as a 
template for the conversion of PrP* into PrPSc. This 
model is not dependent on aggregates or seeds for 
scrapie formation. The slow step is considered to be 
formation of PrP*. Under normal conditions the 
concentration of PrP* is low and formation of PrPSc 
is not significant. However, at some threshold level, 
there would be enough PrPSc present to form a 
complex with any PrP* that forms, thus converting 
it to PrPSc and catalytically increasing the 
concentration of PrPSc. Infection with PrPSc would 
allow propagation by increasing the concentration 
of PrPSc beyond the threshold level. Sporadic 
disorders would arise through events which cause 
an increase in the frequency of PrP*, and 
subsequently PrPSc, such as a mutation in the PrP 
gene, interaction with a co-factor, or an optimal 
cellular environment. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Initial attempts to reconstitute the misfolding 
of PrPC into a protease resistant form in vitro were 
not successful (Raeber et al., 1992). Since it is 
postulated that the misfolded form serves as a 
template or agent to direct misfolding of the normal 
isoform, it is reasonable to suspect that these are 
the only two components required for the creation 
of protease resistant PrPSc. Mixing purified 
preparations of the two forms did not result in 
detection of a newly formed protease resistant 
species (Raeber et al., 1992). Mixing experiments 
involving crude extracts, or synthesis of PrP in the 
presence of microsomal fractions failed to generate 
PrPSc as well. However, recently investigators were 
successful at generating a protease resistant species 
of prion protein  in vitro by mixing PrPC and PrPSc 
together. Furthermore, these results have recently 
been extended to include in vitro formation of 
different strains of scrapie-like proteins starting 
from a common PrP precursor. Both of these 
reactions were dependent on the use of 
guanidinium to unfold the template PrPSc protein 
slightly, but not enough to diminish its infectivity. 
Because these results were obtained using highly 
purified components, they offer very strong 
support of the protein-only model for scrapie 
propagation. The amounts of new scrapie produced 
are much too small however to test for infectivity 
expected with the acquisition of protease resistance. 
These results also lend support to the notion that 
different strains of scrapie may differ simply by 
conformation of the prion protein. The time course 
required for in vitro formation of protease resistant 
PrP, the inefficiency of the reaction, and the nature 
of having to slightly unfold the template molecule, 
if not also PrPC, suggest there are conditions in the 
cell that are optimal for this process, and may even 
include a co-factor such as a chaperonin. The role of 
chaperonins in directing the folding of proteins is 
becoming well documented though is not yet well 
understood. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Recently, a dimer of PrP was isolated from 
mouse neuroblastoma cells expressing hamster PrP 
(Priola et al., 1995). The dimer molecule appeared 
to be covalently linked or was stable to several 
strongly denaturing reagents including boiling in 
SDS. Interestingly, the dimer molecule showed 
properties of both PrPC and PrPSc in that it was 
protease sensitive,  yet also tended to form 
aggregates. Initial examination of the cellular 
trafficking of the PrP dimer indicates that it 
contains only high mannose glycans, suggesting that 
it does not traverse the Golgi where conversion to 
more complex glycans usually occurs. Furthermore, 
no PrP dimer could be detected at the plasma 
membrane of the cells. Thus it does not appear to 
follow the same trafficking pattern as normal PrP. 
It is suggested that the dimer molecule may be an 
intermediate in scrapie formation (Priola et al., 
1995). According to the seeded nucleation model 
described above, the propensity of the dimer to 
aggregate offers a means to the formation of an 
ordered nucleus which could act as a seed, or be 
acted upon by a seed of PrPSc(Priola et al., 1995). 
Scrapie-infected hamster brains were found to 
contain the dimer in a protease resistant form. 
Furthermore, in a cell free system the protease 
sensitive dimer is capable being converted to the 
protease resistant form in the presence of PrPSc 
purified from scrapie-infected hamster brains 
(Kocisko et al., 1994). The observation that the PrP 
dimer does not appear to traverse or enter the Golgi 
is based solely on the finding that the dimer is 
sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H to 
assay the type of glycans it contains. 
Endoglycosidase H is able to cleave most high 
mannose glycans but is not able to cleave complex 
oligosaccharides (Tarentino et al., 1978). As 
proteins traverse the Golgi they undergo 
oligosaccharide processing. PrP is normally 
observed to become resistant to endoglycosidase H 
as it traverses the Golgi where its high mannose 
glycans are converted to complex glycans. While 
most proteins undergo processing to more complex 
glycans, the diversity of structures and the extent 
of glycan processing of proteins is variable. In 
addition, the conformation of a protein may 
influence whether it undergoes complex glycan 
processing or remains high-mannose. Thus it is 
possible that the dimer enters the Golgi and gets 
sorted to some pathway without undergoing the 
same glycosylation as PrP monomers. Although 
dimers of PrP have been reported in the past, in 
light of these recent results they are conspicuously 
absent from the majority of the literature on 
scrapie. However given the large amounts observed 
by Priola et al., and the initial characterization of 
the properties of the dimer, many questions remain 
to be answered about the possible role of the PrP 
dimer in scrapie formation, and a system appears 
within reach to answer these questions. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<A NAME="Recent">Recent</A> results examining the affect of scrapie 
on the distribution and expression of various heat 
shock proteins (Hsps) in scrapie-infected cells 
revealed effects on several of the Hsps in 
comparison to healthy cells. While the majority of 
chaperones are constituitively expressed and found 
in abundance in cells under normal conditions 
(Gething & Sambrook, 1992), some of the heat 
shock proteins are highly induced under cell stress. 
In mouse neuroblastoma cells two of the most 
highly induced proteins in response to stress are 
hsp28 and hsp72 (Tatzelt et al., 1995). Exposure of 
cells to a brief heatshock or to stress inducing 
agents such as sodium arsenite, or Azc, an amino 
acid analog of proline, results in a marked increase 
in expression of several major mammalian stress 
proteins in both healthy and scrapie-infected 
mouse neuroblastoma cells. However, scrapie-
infected cells depart from the normal stress 
response in that they fail to induce hsp28 and 
hsp72. The reasons for lack of induction of these 
two proteins in scrapie-infected cells are not 
understood. Another member of the hsp70 family 
highly related to hsp72 is hsp73. Hsp73 is 
constituitively expressed and is usually found in 
the cytoplasm. Exposure of cells to stress results in 
the translocation of both hsp72 and hsp73 into the 
nucleus of the cell. In scrapie-infected cells, hsp73 
shows an abnormal punctate staining pattern in the 
cytoplasm, reminiscent of the staining pattern 
exhibited by scrapie accumulation in cells (Tatzelt 
et al., 1995). In contrast to normal neuroblastoma 
cells, scrapie-infected cells exposed to stress 
inducing conditions fail to translocate hsp73 into 
the nucleus. How scrapie is able to compromise the 
cellular stress response by affecting these proteins 
is not understood. Tatzelt and colleagues speculate 
that hsp73 may become trapped in a subcellular 
compartment or form a tight complex with PrPSc. 
The hsp70 proteins are described as undergoing a 
host of interactions with proteins, binding both 
folded and unfolded proteins. These interactions 
may be important in scrapie formation.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Observations of prion-like behavior from 
other systems may be informative for how scrapie 
is functioning. In yeast, two proteins have been 
described as prions, as they appear to exhibit 
prion-like behavior of nongenetic self-propagation. 
Ure2p is a yeast protein involved in the regulation 
of nitrogen metabolism. Ure2p appears to 
spontaneously convert to an inactive form, Ure2p* 
(Weissmann, 1994), exhibiting a phenotype 
referred to as [URE3]. The Ure2p* works to convert 
active Ure2p into inactive Ure2p*. [URE3] is a 
dominant trait and can not be explained by classical 
genetic principles. No nucleic acid has been found to 
associate with it, but it can be passed between cells 
by transfer of cytoplasm. Another non-mendelian 
prion-like factor in yeast is [psi+]. Like [URE3], [psi+] 
is sensitive to agents which affect the yeast stress 
response. In a search for mutlticopy suppressors of 
[psi+] function, a chaperonin was found which is 
able to modulate the presence of the [psi+] 
phenotype in cells (Chernoff, 1995). Hsp104 was 
found to be required for propagation of [psi+], yet 
overexpression of Hsp104 "cures" the cells of [psi+]. 
It is postulated that Hsp104 may act by fostering or 
enabling an intermediate folding state, which is 
then able to collapse into either the prion or non 
prion state. Hsp104 is part of the Clp family of 
genes conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, 
including genes involved in the stress response of 
mammalian cells (Parsell et al., 1991).
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	From all indications cited above, scrapie 
formation appears to be localized to subcellular 
vesicles. Examination of vesicles could address the 
following three questions: Where is the precise 
location of scrapie formation? Does the PrP dimer 
that has been postulated to be an important 
intermediate in scrapie formation exist in the 
location of scrapie formation? Does hsp73 co-
localize or share any compartment with PrPC or 
PrPSc?

Evans, Eddie ... 8.1.96 ...  (Reuter)
<P>

WASHINGTON - Research published this week adds weight to the theory that the mysterious prion protein is
behind mad cow disease and other degenerative brain disorders such as Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease in people. 
Proteins with defective traits similar to the prions thought to cause mad cow disease were capable of passing on their
defects to proteins in neighboring cells, an article in Friday's issue of the journal Science said. 
Whether prions were capable of "infecting" other proteins has been a major argument between supporters of the prion
hypothesis and researchers who say viruses cause the brain-wasting diseases. <P>

"This validates the concept of the prion in mammals," said geneticist Susan Lindquist of the research she carried out with
colleagues at the University of Chicago. Lindquist, who used a prion-like yeast protein, told Reuters the finding made the
mechanism by which the prion was thought to destroy the brain more believable. 
"It's a plausible mechanism now. If you can see it working in yeast it makes it seem plausible that it could work in other
proteins, " she said. She said she believed the deformed protein "cozied up" to proteins in other cells, forcing them to adopt
the same deformed shape. 
The effect would be eventually to destroy the cell and neighboring cells, causing the sponge-like holes in the brain that
have given mad cow disease its formal name -- Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). <P>

In the new research, deformed yeast proteins were shown to clump together while normal ones would be evenly spread.
This was further evidence of the prion mechanism, Lindquist said. 
It was the first time characteristics of proteins have been shown to pass from one protein to another without any DNA
undergoing any change or serving as the blueprint for change. 
"It's genetics without DNA," Lindquist said. "We think this is a mechanism of inheritance that people haven't realized
existed." <P>

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the material in each cell that contains the genetic blueprints for life. 
The prion hypothesis for mad cow disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob and the cannibal disease kuru has existed for 30 years,
since researchers showed that diseased brain tissue remained infectious even after heat treatment that would have
destroyed any DNA. 
The British government set off a scare over mad cow disease in March when it announced there may be a link between
the disease and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, suggesting that humans were at risk from the mad cow
epidemic.

A cytoplasmically inherited genetic element in yeast, [PSI+], was confirmed to be a prionlike aggregate of the cellular
protein Sup35 by differential centrifugation analysis and microscopic localization of a Sup35--green fluorescent protein
fusion. Aggregation depended on the intracellular concentration and functional state of the chaperone protein Hsp104 in the
same manner as did [PSI+] inheritance. The amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains of Sup35 contributed to the
unusual behavior of [PSI+].  
<P>
 [PSI+] altered the conformational state of newly synthesized prion proteins, inducing them to aggregate as well, thus fulfilling a major tenet of the prion hypothesis.

Prions--a type of infectious protein responsible for causing several neurodegenerative disorders in
mammals--have recently been identified in yeast. Masison and Wickner (p. 93) now show that the propagation
of the prion phenotype in yeast requires a specific domain of the prion precursor protein, Ure2p, which normally plays
a role in controlling nitrogen catabolism. After induction of the prion phenotype, it becomes resistant to proteolysis. The
prion-inducing domain could be deleted from Ure2p, which left the nitrogen control function intact but abolished the
susceptibility of the yeast cells to express the prion phenotype.

The genetic properties of the [URE3] non-Mendelian element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that it is a prion
(infectious protein) form of Ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism. In extracts from [URE3] strains, Ure2p was
partially resistant to proteinase K compared with Ure2p from wild-type extracts. Overexpression of Ure2p in wild-type
strains induced a 20- to 200-fold increase in the frequency with which [URE3] arose. <B>Overexpression of just the amino-terminal 65 residues of Ure2p increased the frequency of [URE3] induction 6000-fold. </B>
<P>
Without this
``prion-inducing domain'' the carboxyl-terminal domain performed the nitrogen regulation function of Ure2p, but could not be changed to the [URE3] prion state. Thus, this domain induced the prion state in trans, whereas in cis it conferred susceptibility of the adjoining nitrogen regulatory domain to prion infections.

<P>
In all organisms, mild heat pretreatments induce tolerance to high temperatures. In yeast 
such pretreatments strongly induce heat-shock protein (Hsp) 104, and hsp104 mutations greatly reduce
high-temperature survival, indicating Hsp1O4 plays a critical role in induced thermotolerance. Expression of heat-shock factor (and the viability of the strain) <B>requires nonsense
suppression mediated by the yeast prion [PSI+].</B> We conclude that Hsp1O4 plays a central role in
ameliorating heat toxicity. Because Hsp1O4 is nontoxic and highly conserved, manipulating the expression of Hsp1OO
proteins provides an excellent prospect for manipulating thermotolerance in other species.

 The existence of

prion-like properties of yeast Sup35p and Ure2p proteins and a role of tandem amino acid repeats localized in N-terminal
region of Sup35p protein in inheritance of [psi] determinants is discussed. The suggestion is made that the [psi+] status of
yeast cell depends on the specific conformation of the N-terminal domain of Sup35p and that this protein can induce the
specific conformational state of its N-terminal domain on newly synthesized Sup35p molecules via protein-protein
interaction, thus representing a molecular basis of inheritance of [psi+] determinant. Other proteins containing amino
acid repeats of similar type are considered and the suggestion is made that some of these proteins may show prion-like

<P>

The yeast non-Mendelian factor [psi+] has been suggested to be a self-modified protein analogous to mammalian prions.
Here it is reported that an intermediate amount of the chaperone protein Hsp104 was required for the propagation of the
[psi+] factor. Over-production or inactivation of Hsp104 caused the loss of [psi+]. These results suggest that chaperone
proteins play a role in prion-like phenomena, and that a certain level of chaperone expression can cure cells of prions
without affecting viability. This may lead to anti-prion treatments that involve the alteration of chaperone amounts or
activity.

The only identified component of the scrapie prion is PrPSc, a glycosylinositol phospholipid
(GPI)-linked protein that is derived from the cellular isoform (PrPC) by an as yet unknown
posttranslational event. Analysis of the PrPSc GPI has revealed six different glycoforms,
three of which are unprecedented. Two of the glycoforms contain N-acetylneuraminic acid,
which has not been previously reported as a component of any GPI. The largest form of the GPI
is proposed to have a glycan core consisting of Man alpha-Man
alpha-Man-(NeuAc-Gal-GalNAc-)Man-GlcN-Ino. Identical PrPSc GPI structures were found
for two distinct isolates or "strains" of prions which specify different incubation times,
neuropathology, and PrPSc distribution in brains of Syrian hamsters. Limited analysis of the
PrPC GPI reveals that it also has sialylated glycoforms, arguing that the presence of this
monosaccharide does not distinguish PrPC from PrPSc. <HR>

Inherited forms of prion disease have been linked to mutations in the gene encoding PrP, a neuronal and glial protein that
is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. One familial form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is associated with a mutant PrP containing six additional <B>octapeptide</B> repeats. We report here
our analysis of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a murine homologue of this mutant PrP. We find that,
like wild-type PrP, the mutant protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and expressed on the cell surface. Surprisingly,
however, cleavage of the GPI anchor using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C <B>fails to release the mutant PrP
from the surface of intact cells</B>, suggesting that it has an additional mode of membrane attachment. The
phospholipase-treated protein is hydrophobic, since it partitions into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 lysates; and
it is tightly membrane-associated, since it is not extractable in carbonate buffer at pH 11.5. Whether membrane
attachment of the mutant PrP involves integration of the polypeptide into the lipid bilayer, self-association, or binding
to other membrane proteins remains to be determined. Our results suggest that alterations in the membrane association
of PrP may be an important feature of prion diseases. <HR>

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are nonmembrane spanning cell
surface proteins that have been demonstrated to be signal transduction molecules. Because
these proteins do not extend into the cytoplasm, the mechanism by which cross-linking of
these molecules leads to intracellular signal transduction events is obscure. Previous analysis
has indicated that these proteins are associated with src family member tyrosine kinases;
however, the role this interaction plays in the generation of intracellular signals is not clear.
Here we show that GPI-anchored proteins are associated with alpha subunits of
heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins) in both human and murine lymphocytes.

The final step in the pathway that provides for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring
of cell-surface proteins occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and consists of a
transamidation reaction in which fully assembled GPI anchor donors are substituted for
specific COOH-terminal signal peptide sequences contained in nascent polypeptides. In
previous studies we described a human K562 cell mutant line, designated class K, which
assembles all the known intermediates of the GPI pathway but fails to display GPI-anchored
proteins on its surface membrane. <HR>

Many membrane proteins are anchored to the cell surface through covalent attachment to a
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) structure. The GPI anchor is added to proteins in the
endoplasmic reticulum following recognition of a signal in the COOH terminus of the protein.
We show that the GPI anchoring signal can be completely recreated by the synthetic polymer
Ser3-Thr8-Leu14, but not Thr11-Leu14, inserted at the COOH terminus of a protein. This is
consistent with previous reports that a small amino acid such as Ser, Gly, or Ala, but not Thr,
is required at the GPI attachment site. Analysis of synthetic amino acid sequences established a
basic three-part signal for GPI anchoring: a cleavage/attachment domain that requires small
amino acids at the first (GPI anchor attachment) and third positions but with little specificity
at the middle position, a spacer domain of approximately 8-12 amino acids, and a hydrophobic
domain of at least 11 amino acids. The ability to design a totally synthetic GPI anchoring signal
will allow precise probing of the fine structure of this signal. <HR>

Some membrane proteins are associated with the plasma membrane solely through a glycolipid
moiety (GPI anchor). The GPI anchor is composed of a core structure of phosphatidylinositol
attached to a glycan chain which, in turn, is attached to the C-terminus of the protein. The
GPI-anchored protein can be released from the cell surface by the action of GPI-specific
phospholipases C and D. In protozoa, GPI anchors represent the predominant mechanism for
integrating cell-surface proteins into the lipid bilayer. Addition of a glycolipid anchor to a
nascent protein requires a C-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence on the protein which is
rapidly exchanged for a pre-assembled anchor. GPI anchors may have roles in protein
targeting, cell signalling and in the uptake of small molecules (potocytosis). The human
disease 'paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria' represents a defect in biosynthesis of the GPI
anchor. Other lipid post-translational modifications of proteins are also recognized as
important in regulating protein function (myristoylation, palmitoylation, prenylation). <HR>

The glycan core structures of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors on porcine and
human renal membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) were determined following deamination
and reduction by a combination of liquid chromatography, exoglycosidase digestions, and
methylation analysis. The glycan core was found to exhibit microheterogeneity with three
structures observed for the porcine GPI anchor: Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha
1-4GlcN (29% of the total population), Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6(GalNAc beta 1-4)Man
alpha 1-4GlcN (33%), and Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6(Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4)Man
alpha 1-4GlcN (38%). The same glycan core structures were also found in the human anchor
but in slightly different proportions (25, 52, and 17%, respectively). Additionally, a small
amount (6%) of the second structure with an extra mannose alpha (1-2)-linked to the
non-reducing terminal mannose was also observed in the human membrane dipeptidase GPI
anchor. A small proportion (maximally 9%) of the porcine GPI anchor structures was found
to contain sialic acid, probably linked to the GalNAc residue. 
<P>
The porcine GPI anchor was found
to contain 2.5 mol of ethanolamine/mol of anchor. Negative-ion electrospray-mass
spectrometry revealed the presence of exclusively diacyl-phosphatidylinositol
(predominantly distearoyl-phosphatidylinositol with a minor amount of
stearoyl-palmitoyl-phosphatidylinositol) in the porcine membrane dipeptidase anchor.
Porcine membrane dipeptidase was digested with trypsin and the C-terminal peptide attached
to the GPI anchor isolated by removal of the other tryptic peptides on
anhydrotrypsin-Sepharose. The sequence of this peptide was determined as
Thr-Asn-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-Ser, thereby identifying the site of attachment of the GPI anchor as
Ser368. This work represents a comprehensive study of the GPI anchor structure of porcine
membrane dipeptidase and the first interspecies comparison of mammalian GPI anchor
structures on the same protein.

Many proteins of eukaryotic cells are anchored to membranes by covalent linkage to
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI). These proteins lack a transmembrane domain, have no
cytoplasmic tail, and are, therefore, located exclusively on the extracellular side of the
plasma membrane. GPI-anchored proteins form a diverse family of molecules that includes
membrane-associated enzymes, adhesion molecules, activation antigens, differentiation
markers, protozoan coat components, and other miscellaneous glycoproteins. In the kidney,
several GPI-anchored proteins have been identified, including uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall
glycoprotein), carbonic anhydrase type IV, alkaline phosphatase, Thy-1, BP-3,
aminopeptidase P, and dipeptidylpeptidase. GPI-anchored proteins can be released from
membranes with specific phospholipases and can be recovered from the detergent-insoluble
pellet after Triton X-114 treatment of membranes. All GPI-anchored proteins are initially
synthesized with a transmembrane anchor, but after translocation across the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum, the ecto-domain of the protein is cleaved and covalently linked to a
preformed GPI anchor by a specific transamidase enzyme. Although it remains obscure why so
many proteins are endowed with a GPI anchor, the presence of a GPI anchor does confer some
functional characteristics to proteins: (1) it is a strong apical targeting signal in polarized
epithelial cells; (2) GPI-anchored proteins do not cluster into clathrin-coated pits but
instead are concentrated into specialized lipid domains in the membrane, including so-called
smooth pinocytotic vesicles, or caveoli; (3) GPI-anchored proteins can act as activation
antigens in the immune system; (4) when the GPI anchor is cleaved by PI-phospholipase C or
PI-phospholipase D, second messengers for signal transduction may be generated; (5) the GPI
anchor can modulate antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex molecules.
Finally, at least one human disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, is a result of
defective GPI anchor addition to plasma membrane proteins.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
LONDON (Oct 31, 1996) - Italian doctors say a commonly used drug prolongs the lives of hamsters infected with a variant of mad cow disease, and they hope it can point them in the direction of a cure for the brain-wasting condition.
The drug, <A HREF="#Doxorubicin">doxorubicin</A>, is used to treat several forms of cancer but helps hamsters infected with scrapie to live longer, New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday.<P>

    Scrapie is the oldest of a family of diseases that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), which affects people.<P>

    The diseases are always fatal and there is no known cure. Worries that a BSE epidemic in Britain may cause a similar epidemic among people who eat beef make the search for a cure more urgent.

    Gianluigi Forloni and colleagues at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan injected hamsters with iodoxorubicin, New Scientist reported. They then infected them with scrapie.<P>

    They also infected a second group of hamsters -- both with injections of scrapie-contaminated brain matter.

    Scrapie usually kills hamsters within three months. But the hamsters that got the drug lived two to three weeks longer.

    "The effects of the anticancer drug were extremely clear cut," Forloni told New Scientist. "They enabled the hamsters to live at least 20 percent longer."<P>

    Scrapie, BSE and CJD are all characterised by an altered brain protein called a prion. Forloni said the drug seemed to stop the prions from mutating.

    But doxorubicin is very toxic and the research does not show whether it would work if given after infection. It also has to be injected directly into the brain to work.

    "This might not have immediate applications, but it's a start," Moira Bruce of the Institute of Animal Health in Edinburgh told the magazine.<P>

    A second group of scientists, in France, have found an antifungal drug that may also work against BSE and CJD, the magazine said.

    Vincent Beringue and colleagues at the Atomic Energy Commission, which has been doing BSE research, found a <A NAME="deriv">derivative of amphotericin B</A> helps lengthen the lives of mice withh scrapie.Unlike doxorubicin, it worked only after symptoms of the disease appeared.Both groups plan to publish their findings in major medical journals.

MS-8209 either early in the course of the disease or continuously. The results show that (i)
all treatments lengthened the incubation period of hamster scrapie, (ii) continuous treatment
with MS-8209 doubled the length of the incubation period compared with that observed in
infected, untreated animals, and (iii) all treatments delayed the accumulation of a
proteinase-resistant prion protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the brain. These
findings suggest that MS-8209 is a powerful tool for investigating the pathogenesis of
transmissible subacute spongiform encephalopathies.

By using the whole-cell patch technique, it is shown that the total outward current is
increased, as a function of time, after the addition of amphotericin B to the bathing solution.
The whole-cell current is shown to be primarily a K-channel current by the blockage of this
current upon application of TEA to the bathing solution. Single K-channel studies, using the
outside-out patch-clamp technique, reveal that the single K-channel opening probability
increases by a factor of six after the addition of amphotericin B.

Amphotericin B (AmB) is a membrane-active antibiotic which has been shown to increase ion
and small molecule permeability in a variety of model and biological membrane systems. A
major mechanistic model, based on BLM systems, proposes that amphotericin forms
barrellike pores with cholesterol which are cation selective when added to one side of the
membrane and anion selective when added to both sides.

Amphotericin B (AmB) is a potent antifungal polyene macrolide antibiotic and is the drug of
choice for the treatment of deep-seated mycotic infections. Its use is limited, owing to its
nephrotoxicity, and it must be dispersed in deoxycholate for parenteral administration. In
contrast, AME (the monomethyl derivative of AmB) is water dispersible, is appreciably less
cytotoxic than AmB toward a variety of cell types, and is reportedly active against the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome virus (human immunodeficiency virus type 1). The latter
activity has generated interest in AME as an antiviral drug. However, AME is perceived to be
neurotoxic, based on the outcome of a human clinical trial of AME as an antifungal drug. AmB
is not regarded as neurotoxic, presumably because any neurotoxicity in vivo is precluded by
its nephrotoxicity.

The anthracyclines, in particular doxorubicin (DOX), have been used for the intra-arterial
locoregional therapy of liver tumours for over two decades. However, the results obtained
with this form of therapy have been disappointing. It is widely recognised that DOX has a slow

Clinical drug resistance may be attributed to the simultaneous selection and expression of
genes modulating the uptake and metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents. P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) functions as a membrane-associated drug efflux pump whose increased expression
results in resistance to anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, vinca alkaloids, and some
alkylating agents. This type of resistance occurs as both de novo and acquired resistance to
therapy for leukemia.

There is currently no effective therapy for human prion diseases. However, several
polyanionic glycans, including pentosan sulfate and dextran sulfate, prolong the incubation
time of scrapie in rodents, and inhibit the production of the scrapie isoform of the prion
protein (PrPSc), the major component of infectious prions, in cultured neuroblastoma cells.
We report here that pentosan sulfate and related compounds rapidly and dramatically reduce
the amount of PrPC, the non-infectious precursor of PrPSc, present on the cell surface. This
effect results primarily from the ability of these agents to stimulate endocytosis of PrPC,
thereby causing a redistribution of the protein from the plasma membrane to the cell
interior. Pentosan sulfate also causes a change in the ultrastructural localization of PrPC,
such that a portion of the protein molecules are shifted into late endosomes and/or lysosomes.
In addition, we demonstrate, using PrP-containing bacterial fusion proteins, that cultured
cells express saturable and specific surface binding sites for PrP, many of which are
glycosaminoglycan molecules. Our results raise the possibility that sulfated glycans inhibit
prion production by altering the cellular localization of PrPC precursor, and they indicate
that endogenous proteoglycans are likely to play an important role in the cellular metabolism
of both PrPC and PrPSc.

Flupirtine belongs to the class of triaminopyridines and is successfully applied clinically as a
non-opiate analgesic drug with additional muscle relaxant properties. Recently it was
reported that flupirtine acts like an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor complex in neuronal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Here we have used primary
cortical cells from rat embryos to demonstrate that this compound is also neuroprotective
against the toxic effects caused by the prion agent PrPSc and lead acetate (Pb). These two
agents display pleiotropic effects on neurons, which include activation of the NMDA receptor
complex. At concentrations above 30 microM the toxic-peptide fragment of PrPSc causes
apoptotic fragmentation of DNA and is consequently neurotoxic. Pb is neurotoxic at
concentrations above 10 microM. Co-administration of flupirtine (10 microM) with either of
these agents resulted in reduced neurotoxicity. These data indicate that the cytoprotective
effect of flupirtine is measurable in vitro against these noxious agents which show their
effects, including modulation of the NMDA receptor complex, pleiotropically.

NEW YORK -- People with Alzheimer's appear to have unusually high levels of a certain protein in their blood, and a simple blood test might be able to diagnose the disease before its symptoms appear, a preliminary study suggests.
That could give patients and families more time to plan for the future and might open the door to more effective treatment, said researcher Wilfred Jefferies.

<P>

In addition, tracking levels of the protein might quickly show how well medications are working, which could speed up development of new drugs and help doctors tailor therapy to patients, he said.

But Jefferies emphasized that much more work is necessary to see if such a blood test would be useful. 

<P>

Further studies in hundreds of people are needed to see if <B>levels of the protein, called p97, are elevated</B> before Alzheimer's becomes apparent, as well as whether high levels also appear in other neurological diseases or are unique to Alzheimer's, he said.


In addition, it's not clear what the protein normally does in the body, why it would be elevated in Alzheimer's or what role it may play in the disease.

<P>

The work was reported in the November issue of the journal <A HREF="http://medicine.nature.com">Nature Medicine</A> by Jefferies, an associate professor in the Biotechnology Laboratory at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada; Malcolm Kennard and Dr. Howard Feldman of the university; and Dr. Tatsuo Yamada of Chiba University in Japan. 

<P>

Zaven Khachaturian, director of the Alzheimer's Association Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute, called the findings provocative and exciting. But he also emphasized that the work needs to be followed up before its usefulness can be known.

<P>

Jefferies and colleagues compared blood levels of p97 in 27 Canadians with probable Alzheimer's vs. 25 without it, as well as eight Japanese people with probable Alzheimer's vs. seven participants with other neurological diseases. Alzheimer's patients showed consistently higher p97 levels, well above those of the other participants. 
Levels of p97 appeared to be higher in more advanced cases, and a statistical analysis suggested that the protein levels might start to rise two years before symptoms of Alzheimer's appear.

<P>
Experts say brain deterioration in Alzheimer's begins some 20 to 40 years before symptoms appear and suggest that if treatments could be started during this early period, it might delay symptoms.

<CENTER><H4>Organ transplant drugs <A NAME="promising">promising</A> in Alzheimer's and related diseases</H4>
</CENTER>
Associated Press  Oct 29, 1996
<P>
BALTIMORE -- Drugs developed for organ transplants are showing remarkable promise in a totally different area -- protecting nerve cells from damage and helping them regrow after injury, studies show.
Derivatives of drugs such as FK506 and cyclosporin, which help keep the body from rejecting transplanted organs, may be useful in treating strokes and spinal cord damage, and Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and related diseases of the nervous system, neuroscientist Solomon Snyder said Monday.<P>

   In test-tube experiments, as well as trials in rats and monkeys, FK506 and cyclosporin, as well as modified versions of the drugs, can help restore damaged nerve cells.
   "It's clearly something worth studying," said Snyder, a professor of neuroscience, pharmacology and psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

   Animal experiments have shown that the immunosuppressive drug FK506 and other drugs based on it can improve the regeneration of facial and other nerves that have been crushed. In test tubes the drugs also have stimulated regrowth in the kind of nerve cells that are important in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.<P>

   But Bruce Gold, a professor at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland who has made important discoveries in the area, cautioned that it will be awhile before the drugs are used in humans.<P>

   "It's in the early experimental stages," he said.

   Now researchers are beginning to test the drug in monkeys that have a disorder similar to Parkinson's. If those tests go well, Snyder said, human tests of the drug could begin in a year or so.

   "It's preliminary, but let me tell you, it's working," he said.<P>

   Researchers found in the 1960s that they could shut down the body's immune system by interfering with a biochemical pathway that eventually causes an attack on materials alien to the body, such as a newly transplanted kidney or liver. Without the drugs that do that, organ transplants wouldn't be possible.<P>

   Neuroscientists recently discovered that key elements of that biochemical pathway also are present in the brain. And in a host of ailments, those same biochemical steps lead to processes that kill nerve cells.<P>

   So just as gumming up the immune system's works with FK506 and cyclosporin has proven beneficial, the hope is that similar strategies might work in the brain, spinal cord and other parts of the nervous system.

   "It's pretty remarkable in terms of what sorts of things one could dream up," Gold said.

</CENTER>Associated Press Oct 30, 1996

<P>   LOS ANGELES = -- Scientists have found the genetic defect responsible for one type of ataxia and developed a quick blood test for identifying people who have the brain-destroying disease or are almost certain to get it.=
   The development of the blood test represents a breakthrough for families with a history of inherited ataxia, because it could help them decide whether to have children and make other major decisions about their lives.<P>

   "It's fantastic news," said Donna Gruetzmacher, executive director of the 10,000-member National Ataxia Foundation. "Finally, people can know specifically what kind of ataxia they have in their family."=
   Ataxia is a slow, progressive disorder that robs people of of  coordination and can eventually lead to dementia and death for thousands of Americans.<P>

   <B>The newly discovered gene, called SCA2, is responsible for what is known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 2</B>. The blood test can identify people who carry the defect and can also distinguish the disease from a host of other nervous system disorders with similar symptoms, such as multiple sclerosis.<P>

   In addition to making the blood test possible, the discovery of SCA2 also could help scientists in their search for a cure and a treatment.

   "There is no cure at this point, and there is no way at the moment to alter the course of the illness," said Dr. Stefan Pulst, the lead researcher and director of the Division of Neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. But he added: "I'm elated that we now have the gene and can start answering the next round of questions."<P>

   Pulst was to present his findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Human Genetics in San Francisco.

   Scientists previously identified the genetic defects responsible for two other major inherited forms of the disease, types 1 and 3, and developed blood tests for those, too.<P>

   Up until three years ago, doctors could diagnose cases of ataxia based on the patient's symptoms, but they had no way of distinguishing with certainty among the many types of the disease, some of which are not inherited. And they had no way of telling which people were at risk of the disease before they developed symptoms.<P>

   "It is likely this test will be relevant to thousands of patients with inherited ataxias," said Dr. Daniel Geschwind, an ataxia specialist at the University of California at Los Angeles. He said it also should help thousands more rule them out.<P>

   In types 1, 2 and 3, someone who carries one copy of the defective gene will almost certainly get the disease and has a 50 percent chance of passing it on to each child.

   The National Ataxia Foundation in Wayzata, Minn., estimates 150,000 Americans are affected or at risk for the family of diseases called hereditary ataxias. SCA2 is thought to account for thousands of these cases, but the exact number is unknown; the researchers led by Pulst tested only 50 families.<P>

   The disease kills cells in the brain's cerebellum, taking away balance and gradually destroying motor and mental function.

   Dr. Thomas Bird, a professor of neurology and medical genetics at the University of Washington in Seattle, called Pulst's work "a real step forward in terms of diagnosis." Knowing whether they have inherited the disorder lets people make choices about careers, financial planning and family planning, he said.<P>

   Pulst located the SCA2 gene on April 26. Researchers identified the gene for SCA1 in 1993 and for SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, in 1994.

  <B> All three defects stem from too many copies of a three-unit genetic code for making glutamine</B>, an amino acid found in many cell proteins.<P>

   Shirley Labruzzo, 56, of Syracuse, N.Y., lost her husband and a son to ataxia and now cares full-time for her son Daniel, 31, who suffers from severe tremors. She is anxious about her 34-year-old daughter, Nancy, who has no symptoms of ataxia but fears marrying and passing the gene on to a child.

   If Nancy is negative for SCA2, "it means my dreams and hers come true," Labruzzo said.

<H4>HIGH LIPOPROTEIN(a) LEVEL DOUBLES RISK OF EARLY HEART DISEASE</H4>
JAMA Press Release<BR>

Risk similar to high total cholesterol<BR>


CHICAGO--A test not typically included as part of a regular cholesterol screening can be a valuable tool for identifying men at risk of
developing premature coronary heart disease (CHD), according to an article in this week's issue of The Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA). <P>


Andrew G. Bostom, M.D., M.S., of the Framingham Study, Framingham, Mass., and colleagues used data from the Framingham heart study to
determine whether elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for CHD. The Framingham heart study is a program where
the participants' health is tracked for life. 

"Our findings provide the first prospective evidence that elevated plasma Lp(a) level, determined at a baseline examination, is an
independent risk factor for the subsequent development of premature CHD in such individuals," the authors write. <P>


A group of men in the Framingham study between the ages of 20 and 54 were tested and identified to be free of cardiovascular disease
between 1971 and 1975. Approximately 15 years later, they were tested again. 

The researchers discovered that those with an elevated level of Lp(a) in the blood measured semiquantitatively using dectrophoresis during
initial testing were almost twice as likely to develop premature CHD (before age 55) as men without elevated levels. <P>


As a predictor of early CHD, elevated Lp(a) was comparable in magnitude to a total cholesterol level of 240 milligrams per deciliter
(mg/dL) or more or a high density lipoprotein (HDL) level of less than 35 mg/dL. 

However, testing for Lp(a) is not commonly performed as part of routine screening for high cholesterol and potential heart disease. There is
no established treatment for elevated Lp(a). 

The authors say the next step in verifying the value of Lp(a) as an indicator of early heart disease is to begin clinical trials to determine if
lowering Lp(a) concentrations in potentially high-risk individuals can reduce their risk of developing CHD.

<P>
Objective.--To establish whether elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], detected as a sinking pre-beta-lipoprotein band on electrophoresis of
fresh plasma, is an independent risk factor for the development of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) in men. 
<P>
Participants.--A total of 2191 men aged 20 to 54 years old who were free of cardiovascular disease when they were examined between
1971 and 1975. 
<P>
Results.--After a median follow-up of 15.4 years, there were 129 CHD events. The relative risk (RR) estimates (with 95% confidence
intervals [CIs]) for premature CHD derived from a proportional hazards model that included age, body mass index, and the dichotomized
risk factor covariables elevated plasma Lp(a) level, total cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) or more, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) level less than 0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL), smoking, glucose intolerance, and hypertension were as follows: elevated Lp(a) level, RR,
1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-2.9), prevalence, 11.3%; total cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or more, RR, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.7), prevalence,
14.3%; HDL level of less than 0.9 mmol/L, RR, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6), prevalence, 19.2%; smoking, RR, 3.6 (95% CI, 2.2-5.5),
prevalence, 46.7%; glucose intolerance, RR, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4-5.3), prevalence, 2.6%; hypertension, RR, 1.2 (95% CI, 0.8-1.8),
prevalence, 26.3%. 

Conclusions.--Elevated plasma Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for the development of premature CHD in men, comparable in
magnitude and prevalence (ie, attributable risk) to a total cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) or more, or an HDL level less than
0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL). 
<HR><H3><CENTER>New research offers <A NAME="hope">hope</A> for Alzheimer's drug treatment</CENTER></H3>



Nando.net ... Reuter Information Service 

LONDON (Aug 22, 1996) - Two studies published on Wednesday offered hope for a drug that could be used to treat
Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia whose sufferers include former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

Both studies suggested ways to close off reactions between brain cells and chemicals or proteins. Many drugs block receptors that allow
chemicals or cells to attach to other cells, just as a door could be nailed shut.<P>



In Alzheimer's, which affects 15 percent of people over the age of 65 and about half those over 85, proteins gum up and form "plaques" in
the brain. The main component of this plaque is <B>amyloid-beta peptide</B>, which is known to be toxic to nerve cells and activates immune cells
in the brain.<P>

To have an effect on cells, the peptide would first have to attach. Shi Du Yan of Columbia University in New York and a team of international
collaborators looked for the receptor, a kind of door into the cell, where this might happen.


They found that a known receptor, the <B>receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)</B>, was the door letting the peptide hook up to brain
cells.

When the peptide interacted with a RAGE, immune system scavenger cells known as microglia were activated -- indicating that brain cells
were stressed, they wrote in a report published in the science journal Nature.

Microglia are meant to clean up dead or damaged brain cells, and other studies show they may be involved in the brain damage seen in
Alzheimer's.<P>


Yan's group said <B>the receptor may help keep the brain clear of the damaging peptides</B>, but may become overwhelmed by the huge amounts
produced during Alzheimer's.<P>

In a second study published in Nature, Joseph el Khoury and colleagues, also at Columbia University, found a second interaction involved in
Alzheimer's.

They found the microglia attach to the peptides via a receptor known as <B>class-A scavenging receptor</B>. They suggest the microglia are trying
to clear out the peptide, but get mired down in the plaque. The distressed microglia secrete poisonous chemicals, damaging cells around them.

Khoury's group said chemicals that would block this interaction could help delay the onset of Alzheimer's or cause it to progress more
slowly.

                                          The 'senile plaques' found in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease are
                                          aggregates of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) infiltrated by microglia and astrocytes. Abeta is known to
                                          be neurotoxic, inducing oxidant stress and activating microglia. These effects are thought to be
                                          mediated through a cell-surface receptor, and Yan et al. now show that the Receptor for
                                          Advanced Glycation End products, or RAGE, is a strong candidate for this role. Not only is
                                          oxidative stress induced when Abeta binds to RAGE, but the receptor is abundant on microglia and
                                          induces their activation. But RAGE may not be the only receptor involved. In a separate report,
                                          El Khoury et al. show that the class A scavenging receptor of microglia can also mediate their
                                          adhesion to and activation by Abeta.

Alzheimer's disease is thought to be caused by amyloid-beta, but the details of the degeneration
                                          mechanism have so far been missing. Two receptors, called RAGE and SR, now appear to be
                                          involved. Though the two seem to be completely unrelated, both are potential drug targets.

<H3><CENTER>New <a name="treatment">treatment</a> for Parkinson's disease</CENTER></H3>

San Francisco Examiner

<P>   SAN FRANCISCO (Aug 23, 1996 2:23 p.m. EDT) -- Doctors at Parkinson's disease clinics around the nation last week began injecting into the brains of patients a protein that specialists say has the potential of dramatically slowing or even reversing the brain disorder.<P>


   It may be several years before the value, if any, of the growth factor protein, called GDNF, is known. However, specialists in Parkinson's disease said the product, patented by the California biotechnology company Amgen Inc., looks like an important find in research into the incurable degenerative movement disorder.<P>

   "I believe that, eventually, treatment with growth factors or neurotrophic factors (such as GDNF) is going to revolutionize the treatment of disorders like Parkinson's," said Dr. Michael Aminoff, a UC-San Francisco professor of neurology who heads a Parkinson's clinic declared a center of excellence by the National Parkinson's Foundation.<P>

   Stock analysts, like scientists, want to see the results of the study before they pass final judgment on Amgen's discovery. David Crossen of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco visited the company's facilities last week and came away persuaded "GDNF is a very important project." Still, he has a hold on the stock until more is known about GDNF's effectiveness.<P>

   Amgen, a biotechnology company based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said it has begun human clinical trials of its product at multiple clinics it would not identify, lest they be overwhelmed by Parkinson's patients seeking help.

   "I have the necessary desperation," Joan Samuelson of Santa Rosa, Calif., said of her hopes that GDNF or another therapy could cure the disease she has had for 10 years. Samuelson heads Parkinson's Action Network, a national advocacy group.<P>

   The experiment, following recent federal approval, will test GDNF's safety in people with moderate to severe Parkinson's. This phase may take a year. More lengthy tests would follow if it is found to be safe.
   Parkinson's, affecting a million or more Americans, causes muscle tremor, stiffness and weakness. Its symptoms are trembling, a rigid posture, slow movements and a shuffling, unbalanced walk. As many as one-third of Parkinson's patients develop dementia.<P>

   The disorder was defined by James Parkinson, a British surgeon. Its victims suffer damage to nerve cell clusters in the brain called the basal ganglia, where a nerve transmitter known as dopamine is made.<P>

   The most effective drug used for Parkinson's has been Levadopa, or L-dopa, which the body converts into dopamine, but over the years it loses its effect and may even be toxic. Scientists are at odds over this claim, but they agree L-dopa cannot halt the degeneration of brain cells.

   Patients typically survive 10 to 15 years after symptoms appear. Many become so rigid that they die in accidents, such as in falls in which hips are broken, said Dr. Jeff Bronstein, a neurologist who heads the UCLA Medical Center Movement Disorder Center. He called Amgen's research "really spectacular."<P>

   The research on humans followed successful results with monkeys.
   In 1982, Michael Carrillo, a drug addict, arrived at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in Campbell, Calif., nearly paralyzed and unable to speak. Soon, other addicts -- who came to be known as "the frozen addicts" -- came for treatment, all with Parkinson's-like symptoms.

   They were seen by neurologist Dr. William Langston, who found they had all taken synthetic heroin that had a byproduct called MPTP, which an enzyme in the body converts to a poison. In further study, he found the MPTP attacked the brain cells that produce Parkinson's symptoms when they fail.<P>

   Since then, researchers have given monkeys MPTP to produce symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's.

   The Amgen researchers say they were able to protect dopamine neurons from toxic damage, restore functional activity to dormant dopamine neurons in monkeys and reverse the symptoms of Parkinson's. It remains to be seen if they can do the same in people.

   "This safety trial gets us to first base, but this a five-or-more-year program," said Amgen spokesman David Kaye. "This is a tragic disease, and we do not want to contribute to expectations getting wildly out of hand."<P>

   Crossen, the Montgomery Securities analyst, said he learned that 50 patients are in the trial and that GDNF theoretically corrects rigidity, not the symptomatic tremors.

Advanced glycosylation end products of proteins (AGEs) are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in
aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. A approximately 35-kDa polypeptide with a unique NH2-terminal sequence has been isolated
from bovine lung and found to be present on the surface of endothelial cells where it mediates the binding of AGEs (receptor for advanced
glycosylation end product or RAGE). Using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal sequence of RAGE, an apparently
full-length cDNA of 1.5 kilobases was isolated from a bovine lung cDNA library. This cDNA encoded a 394 amino acid mature protein
comprised of the following putative domains: an extracellular domain of 332 amino acids, a single hydrophobic membrane spanning domain
of 19 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 43 amino acids. A partial clone encoding the human counterpart of RAGE, isolated
from a human lung library, was found to be approximately 90% homologous to the bovine molecule. Based on computer analysis of the amino
acid sequence of RAGE and comparison with databases, RAGE is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules
and shares significant homology with MUC 18, NCAM, and the cytoplasmic domain of CD20. 
<P>
Expression of the RAGE cDNA in 293 cells
allowed them to bind 125I-AGE-albumin in a saturable and dose-dependent manner (Kd approximately 100 nM), blocked by antibody to
RAGE. Western blots of 293 cells transfected with RAGE cDNA probed with anti-RAGE IgG demonstrated expression of immunoreactive
protein compared to its absence in mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that RAGE functions as a cell surface receptor for AGEs,
which could potentially mediate cellular effects of this class of glycosylated proteins.

Scavenger receptors are integral membrane proteins that mediate the endocytosis of modified lipoproteins. The first of these to be purified
and cloned were the type I and II macrophage scavenger receptors (SR-AI and SR-AII; class A scavenger receptors). Subsequently, the cell
surface protein CD36 was shown to bind oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxidized LDL). From a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell variant
we have cloned by expression the cDNA for a new member of the CD36 family of membrane proteins, SR-BI, whose predicted protein
sequence of 509 amino acids is approximately 30% identical to those of the four previously identified family members. Both SR-BI and
CD36 displayed high affinity binding for acetylated LDL with an apparent dissociation constant on the order of approximately 5 micrograms
of protein/ml. The ligand binding specificities of CD36 and SR-BI, determined by direct binding or competition assays, were similar, but
not identical; both bind modified proteins (acetylated LDL, oxidized LDL, maleylated bovine serum albumin), but not the broad array of
other polyanions (e.g. fucoidin, polyguanosinic acid, carrageenan) which are ligands of the class A receptors. 
<P>
Thus, SR-BI and CD36 define a
second class of scavenger receptors, designated class B. Native LDL, which does not bind to either class A receptors or CD36, unexpectedly
bound with high affinity to SR-BI. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues showed that SR-BI was most abundantly expressed in fat and
was present at moderate levels in lung and liver. Furthermore, SR-BI mRNA expression was induced upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells
into adipocytes. Thus, the tissue distribution of expression and ligand binding properties of SR-BI raise the possibility that this cell surface
receptor may play an important role in lipid metabolism.

Associated Press ...Aug 20,1996<P>
<I>[Apolipoprotein e4 is a risk factor for CJD; lipid peroxidation may also have a role -- webmaster]</I> 
<P>
CHICAGO  -- A little-known form of "bad" cholesterol that doctors cannot yet measure reliably may cause early heart disease just as often as its better-known cousins, a study suggests.


   The lesser-known culprit -- called <STRONG>lipoprotein(a)</STRONG> -- may lurk in dangerously high levels in the blood of people whose other cholesterol levels appear normal on routine tests, researchers say.<P>

   Excess levels of lipoprotein(a), which are particles of protein and fat in the blood, accounted for 10 percent of all cases of premature heart disease -- those occurring before age 55 -- among the 2,191 men studied, said Dr. Andrew G. Bostom, who led the work as a research fellow for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

   The findings were published in the Wednesday August 21 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.<P>

   The study included women, but too few cases of premature heart disease developed to calculate their risk from Lp(a), presumably because estrogen protects premenopausal women from heart disease, Bostom said.
   Bostom said it's too early to do widespread testing for Lp(a) levels because no standardized screening exists and because even when the Lp(a) level is known, very little can now be done to modify it. Unlike other kinds of cholesterol, Lp(a) levels are 95 percent determined by genes, so drugs and changes in diet affect them very little.<P>

   The value of knowing an excess Lp(a) level is that it may warn the patient of the need for more aggressive treatment of other traits that also predict heart disease: smoking, poor diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol of the type whose levels can be altered through diet or drugs.

   People worried about heart disease should concentrate on those risk factors rather than worrying about Lp(a) because nothing can be done about it at present, the researchers said.<P>

   "Smoking just blows everything out of the water in terms of being a risk factor for premature coronary heart disease," Bostom said. He noted smoking accounted for 55 percent of cases of premature heart disease in the study.
   Abnormal levels of two better-known forms of cholesterol -- HDL, or "good" cholesterol, and total cholesterol, a combination of all forms -- each accounted for about 10 percent of premature heart disease in the study.<P>

   The participants began the study at ages 20 to 54 and were tracked for 15 years, until 1991. A total of 129 suffered premature heart disease, defined as a heart attack, poor blood flow to the heart, heart pain or sudden heart death.

   An expert not associated with the study, Dr. Angelo Scanu, director of the Lipid Clinic at the University of Chicago, cautioned that scientists still do not fully understand the role of Lp(a).<P>

   For example, blacks have two to three times the rate of elevated Lp(a) compared with whites, yet they do not have double to triple the prevalence of premature heart disease, Scanu said.<P>

   As many as 20 percent of people overall have elevated Lp(a) levels, but after more than 20 years of studying Lp(a), scientists still don't know which people the substance threatens and which people it doesn't, Scanu added.<HR>

              A family of Finnish descent with very-early-onset Alzheimer's disease has been identified. Genetic analysis of this family eliminated the amyloid
              precursor protein gene as the pathogenic locus, but strongly implicated a locus on chromosome 14q23.4 between D14S52 and D14S55. The early age at
              onset of the disease (average, 36 years; range, 35-39 years), the rapid progression, and the early and prominent myoclonus, while they appear to be
              frequent findings in the chromosome 14-encoded form of Alzheimer's disease, raised the clinical suspicion of prion disease. However, sequencing the
              prion gene-coding region of 2 affected members of the pedigree failed to show any abnormality. Apart from the presence of modest cortical vacuolar
              change, the pathological features of our index patient appeared typical of Alzheimer's disease with abundant senile plaques immunoreactive with
              beta-amyloid, but not with prion protein antibodies. <HR>

Prion gene sequence is thought to affect the phenotypic expression of prion disease and the E2 variant of apolipoprotein E (Apo E) can be neuroprotectivein dementia. We determined codon 129 of the prion gene and the Apo E variants in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) using PCR and restriction digest. Wefound a significant correlation between valine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene and the presence of plaque in CJD and a later age of onset in CJD casespossessing the Apo E2 allele. This study provides further evidence that sequence variations in the prion gene can modify disease pathology and theneuroprotection afforded by Apo E2 is not confined to Alzheimer's disease.

One of the principle peptide components of the amyloid plaque deposits of Alzheimer's disease in humans is the 40-amino-acid peptide beta-amyloid
A4-(1-40)-peptide. The full-length A4-(1-40)-peptide was chemically synthesized and the solution structure determined by two-dimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy and restrained molecular-dynamics calculations. Synthetic human A4-(1-40)-peptide was soluble and non-aggregating
for several days in 40% (by vol.) trifluoroethanol/water. All spin systems could be unambiguously assigned, and a total of 203 sequential and
medium-range cross-peaks were found in the NOESY (nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) spectrum. Long-range NOE cross-peaks that would
indicate tertiary structure of the peptide were absent. The main secondary-structure elements found by chemical-shift analysis, sequential and
medium-range NOESY data, and NOE-based restrained molecular-dynamics calculations were two helices, Gln15-Asp23 and Ile31-Met35, whereas the
rest of the peptide was in random-coil conformation. A similar secondary structure is suggested for the aggregation part of prions, the postulated
causative agents of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. The sequence of the helical part of prion proteins was observed to be remarkably
similar to the sequence of the helical part of human A4-(1-40)-peptide.

<P>
Apolipoprotein (apo) E is likely involved in redistributing cholesterol and phospholipids during compensatorysynaptogenesis in the injured CNS. Three common isoforms of apoE exist in human (E2, E3, and E4). The apoE4 allelefrequency is markedly increased in both late-onset sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE concentration inthe brain of AD subjects follows a gradient: ApoE levels decrease as a function of E2 , E3, E4. 
<P>
It has been proposed thatthe poor reinnervation capacity reported in AD may be caused by impairment of the apoE/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity. To understand further the role of this particular axis in lipid homeostasis in the CNS, we havecharacterized binding, internalization, and degradation of human 125I-LDL to primary cultures of rat astrocytes.
<P>
ApoE2 binding was significantly lower than that of the other 125I-apoE isoforms in both cell types. 125I-ApoE4binding was similar to that of 125I-apoE3 in both astrocytes and neurons. On the other hand, 125I-apoE3 binding wassignificantly higher in neurons than in astrocytes. These isoform-specific alterations in apoE-lipoprotein pathway couldexplain some of the differences reported in the pathophysiology of AD subjects carrying different apoE alleles.

<P>
 An important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the cerebral deposition of amyloid. The main component of the amyloidis a 39-44-amino acid residue protein called amyloid beta (A beta), which also exists as a normal protein in biological fluids, known as soluble A beta. A major risk factor for late-onset AD is the inheritance of the apolipoprotein (apo) E4 isotype of apoE. How apoE is involved in the pathogenesis of AD is unclear; however, evidence exists for a direct apoE/Abeta interaction.  

<P>
ApoE copurifies with A beta from AD amyloid plaques and that <B>under certain in vitro conditions apoE promotes a beta-sheet structure in A beta peptides</B>. Currently we document the high affinitybinding of A beta peptides to both human recombinant apoE3 and -E4 with a KD of 20 nM. This interaction is greatly influenced by the conformational state of the A beta peptide used. Furthermore, we show that the fibril modulating effect of apoE is also influenced by the initial secondary structure of the A beta peptide. The preferential binding of apoE to A beta peptides with a beta-sheet conformation can in part explain the copurification of A beta and apoE from AD amyloid plaques.

 Prion-related encephalopathies are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal prion protein              isoform (PrPSc) associated whith neuronal degeneration and astrogliosis. The synthetic peptide              homologous to PrP fragment 106-126 (PrP 106-126) induced in vitro neuronal apoptosis and glial              proliferation.  Since              clusterin (apolipoprotein J) mRNA levels are increased in prion-related encephalopathies and              clusterin immunoreactivity has been located in association with PrPSc in              Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker brain, the expression of clusterin was determined in neuronal and              astroglial cells chronically exposed to PrP 106-126. Although the induction of clusterin has been              involved in the apoptotic mechanism in other experimental conditions, its expression was unchanged in              PrP 106-126-treated neurons, while a three-fold induction of clusterin mRNA was observed in              astrocytes exposed to PrP 106-126. To investigate whether the clusterin up-regulation was simply              associated with the astroglial proliferative stimulus of PrP 106-126 or was specifically induced by the              peptide, we measured clusterin expression in astrocytes cultured in fetal calf serum-free medium and              exposed to PrP 106-126 or fetal calf serum restoration. In this condition the PrP peptide, like fetal calf              serum, increased the glial proliferation rate, but only PrP 106-126 doubled clusterin mRNA. The              selectivity of this effect indicates that PrPSc is directly involved in the clusterin up-regulation seen in              prion-related encephalopathies and is associated with astroglial cells.  <HR></BODY></HTML>

<H3><CENTER>Older Gossip and Rumor: 1983 to June 1996</CENTER></H3>
<PRE>

<B>1983</B>
              It is claimed that MAFF knew about BSE in 1983 but decided not to let the public (and
              possibly the politicians) know. This agrees with Helen Grant other heresay and with
              Dealler and Kent's calculated statistics. 
First numerous cases of BSE not going to be announced.
              They were found by a farmer in Surrey and reported to the local vet and hence to
              MAFF. They were slaughtered and the farmer was going to publish the data (in 1986).
              He was told not to do this and the information reached the Veterinary Record from the
              histopathologists in a small collumn in 1987. The reason why MAFF told him not to
              publish it is not clear. 
No BSE available for research.
              Apparently, the experts all over the world were asking MAFF for samples for BSE
              (after all they had a lot of it) but MAFF refused to play ball for the first few years fo
              the epidemic. A researcher from the US actually came over to the UK and got hold of
              the head of a cow with the disease, put it in his fridge and then took it back to
              california in his baggage. He was stopped by the guards at the airport and the head
              taken away. This may have shown the MAFF just what researchers will do to get a
              sample and may have pushed them to allow others some BSE. 
Wilesmith's suggestion that BSE may not be from scrapie.
              Everything that is published from the Central Veterinary Laboratory has to go to
              higher authorities to get permission. This one, in 1990 (?), did not get the
              permission and still stays with them. It is not clear why MAFF would prefer that
              information suggesting that they were wrong about scrapie being the immediate cause
              of BSE should be kept from the public and possibly politicians too. 
The beefburger fed by John Gummer
              , Then the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Food, he fed it to his daughter in
              front of all the cameras at the Houses of Parliament was actually largely turned down
              by her and he had to eat it himself. How he could have known that it did not contain
              infective material is not clear. The question arises as to whether the ministers have
              been told by MAFF what is actually going on. 
Denials of BSE risk.
              Bradley gave specific direct denials to the media in 1989-1994 that bovine brain
              tissue never reached British food and had not until then. Specific machines were
              available for the removal of brain tissue from the cranium. One of them seemed to be
              like a sort of claw and the other was a band saw that cut the head in half. It was well
              known that brain was used for the manufacture of human food and this was present in
              text books. Brain had a specific value as offal and as such was removed from the head
              for sale. It was said that the EC rules stated that brain was meat and hence could be
              used in various products that were claimed to be beef. Bradley denied this and said that
              brain could not be used in specific products. 
Is BSE new at all?
              Calculations show the first case of BSE to have been born before the change in the way
              in which bovine food was manufactured (1980/81). Originally it seemed that BSE
              infected the cattle when they were very young but this would be difficult if there was
              not BSE in the food! What might have happened is that the older cattle dying with BSE
              in 1990 might well have not become infected when young but rather when they were
              being fed large amounts of infective food to get them to produce milk. One group
              thought that BSE was not a new disease at all and was probably present in 1 of every
              20,000 to 1 in 30,000 cattle. ANyway, both of the hypotheses would not fit well with
              scrapie being transmitted to cows to cause BSE. 
Plum Island
              When BSE was first announced the exported cattle that were moved to the USA were
              actually rounded up and taken to Plum Island when they were kept to see if they
              developed BSE and exports of live cattle to USA were stopped. At this time MAFF were
              stating that there was no problems with BSE and that nobody was worried. 
Transmision of BSE by a bull?
              A herd of cattle in Northern Ireland became had no cases of BSE. A bull brought in
              from England died of BSE but so did some of its offspring on the farm. It was as if the
              bull had infected its calves in some way. 
Tissue from cattle was tested for BSE by inoculation into mice. 
              Only the brain and spinal cord tissue caused a disease in mice and this was used as an
              indication that there was no infectivity in the other tissues. This was clearly
              misleading but was shown to the press as proof that there was no risk to humans from
              eating bovine tissue. (1993 onwards) 
Southwood not accepted
              The 'Southwood' report (from the Working party on BSE, organised by the MAFF in
              1987) was produced by spring of 1988, and was presented to MAFF. Apparently they
              were horrified by the report, which made heavy statements about how we did not know
              enough to be certain of the risk. It is said that MAFF put pressure on him to change the
              text in such a way at to make it clear that eating bovine tissue would not be a risk.
              This, it is said is the reason for the two revisions of the report, which not become
              reach Parliament for several months later, the reason for which is unclear. 
Southwood sources
              It seems that Southwood did not actually take information from the right sources to
              decide what to do about BSE anyway. Several experts were almost pulling their hair
              out when they saw the report, which said that no restrictions should be put on the
              consumation of brain, spinal cord, etc and that BSE would not go on to infect further
              animals. These are clearly ignorant statements and could not have been advised by
              anyone involved in the science. 
Farmers have been much more worried about BSE than has been reported.
              They feel that they have been treated badly and that, as there is no risk to humans
              whatever (as MAFF keeps telling them) why should they have to work hard and pay up
              to report the cattle? There is a great feeling that BSE actually came into the UK from
              elsewhere and that BSE is in fact prevalent in France but the french are not reporting
              them (apparently they are calling them cases of rabies). 
Are BSE cases getting to MAFF statistics
              After 1991 farmers that reported cases born after the feed ban of what they were
              certain were BSE (by this time many farmers had seen half a dozen cases) to the
              veterinary officer found themselves in a problem. The problem was that initially the
              VO would say that he wasn't sure that it had BSE and that it had to wait on the farm for
              a month when he would return. Then the VO came back to find that the animal was sick
              but could not be said to have certain BSE and so the VO turned it down. There the
              farmer was left with a sick cow, that could not be sold to anyone except for animal
              meat and would be worth less than 100, whereas when the VO was first called the
              farmer could have taken it to the market just looking a little low and got 800. The
              reason was twofold. Partly it was because the farmers were getting much better at
              spotting the initial changes in personality of the cow that preceded the clinical disease
              and the second was that the VOs had been told to be tighter in their selection of cattle.
              They were also told that there would be few cows born after the ban that showed BSE.
              Eventually, a particularly honest farmer called Lacey, saying that the VO had turned
              down a 'barn door' case and that he wasn't having it. Lacey had it slaughtered, the
              brain examined and it was clearly BSE. 
Vets at markets
              Initially vets were hired to be at the market for quite long hours inspecting cattle to
              make sure that clinically infected animals did not get sold. In about 1992/3 the time
              of the vet was dropped from 12 hrs to week to 2 hrs per week (one local vet that is
              known). Few infected cattle were picked up and it was not thought to be worthwhile.
              No farmer has been taken to court as if any infected animal was pointed out the farmer
              just apologised and took it home. 
EC regulations were not enforced fully
              The Germans and eventually the whole EC, in 1990 demanded that UK meat not be
              exported if it came from an infected herd. This was to be carried out by: 1 the farmer
              selling the cow at market would announce that he had a case of BSE on his herd within
              the previous 2 years and the price of the cow would drop accordingly. 2. The market
              would announce this to the buyer. 3. The buyer would not export the meat 4. The
              abattoir would supply certificates for any meat being exported, signed by a vet to say
              that the meat was not from an infected herd. In 1992 the workers at Smithfield and
              the meat groups marched on the MAFF and told them that this simply would not do. The
              reason was that such a high proportion of the cattle were from an infected herd (by
              this time it was probably 65%) that it was ruining the export and making such
              difficulty that things had to change. In around 1992 things seemed to change. The
              markets seemed to stop asking the farmers presenting cattle if they had had a case of
              BSE previously, they stopped putting ribbons around the cow when sold, the abattoirs
              happily exported them as if they were from a non-infected herd. Vets were put under
              pressure to sign the certificates even though there was no evidence that what they
              were saying was true. This all changed with Maria Hovi, (0734 667090) who was
              sacked after she refused to sign the certificates because they were not true. She made
              it plain that this was unacceptable. 
Misleading data
              The impression is that 55% of the dairy herds in the UK are affected at one time or
              another by BSE. It is a misleading impression, however, as the larger the herd, the
              greater the likelihood of BSE. In fact >90% of the dairy cattle in the UK are now from
              an affected herd. 
Vertical transmission means that large numbers were infected
              The number of cattle infected with BSE that are being eaten has been claimed to reach
              1.8 million by 2001 but it is not realised that the figure is four times as great if the
              cattle become infected from their mother. 
USDA
              The USDA was determined to carry out as much as possible of the research into BSE in
              the USA and researchers there outside the USDA had trouble at times getting funding
              or samples to carry out experiments. 
USDA research
              Workers at the USDA have been under pressure not to find out what is actually going
              on with BSE. For instance they were told to feed the mink some amounts of bovine
              brain to fid out how much was needed to transmit the disease. In their publications
              they say that they tried out down to 1g (which still worked). This is extremely
              unlikely. Anyone carrying out this sort of experiment will use doses much lower than
              this, probably 1000 times lower. Perhaps the USDA does not want the results to be
              published?? 
Experiments not done
              Numerous experiments into the risk of BSE to humans have not been done and some
              have been done that have turned out to be useless. For instance: No measurement of the
              amount of infectivity in tissues was done properly until 1992 (far too late). No
              measurement of the amount of specific tissues needed to infect specific animals
              (sometimes done with grossly too high amounts, officially). No range of animals tested
              with BSE to work out the chance of transmission to humans. No transgenic mice made
              to look for methods of tissue testing. Cattle have not actually been fed specific amounts
              of bovine meal as a test to see if this is the way they become infected. No infectivity
              has in fact been found in the meal at all. 
No replies from officialdom
              Various groups have written to the Minister of Agriculture and not received replies.
              Dr. Dealler wrote to Wilesmith at his parliamentary address, at his constituency
              address and at the MAFF and got no reply. 
Tyrrell
              Attempts made to get in touch with Tyrrell have been difficult and it has been
              worrying that he seems to have been believing everything told to him by MAFF. At a
              meeting he stated that the mouse assay for infectivity in tissue of cattle tissue should
              be thought to be 100% sensitive, a clear mistake but one put over by MAFF regularly
              to the press. Tyrrell used to run the common cold unit associated with Porton Down.
              Although a lot of work was done, it is not clear if we have less common colds. 
A meeting between Wilesmith, Bradley, Tyrrell, Lacey and Dealler at the MAFF centre of the
Royal Showground in 1993.
              It was made clear that by Wilesmith that the cases of BSE born after the feed ban were
              simply due to bags of meal being kept for longer than expected. When asked, farmers
              said, however that they never kept bags for longer than 6 weeks because they
              generally rotted. Lacey made it clear that the Aspergillus fungus that would grow was
              unacceptable and the economics would make sure that the bags were not kept for any
              length of time. "do they think we're idiots?" Lacey growled to Dealler and pulled
              Wilesmith's arguments to pieces. Tyrrell claimed that he would not let ten thousand
              infective units of BSE into a human diet as this was shown to be an oral dose in some
              TSEs. Lacey explained that if 10,000 IU was not in a meal of 100g of food then they
              would have to use a test that would find 100 IU in a single gram and that was not
              possible by inoculating tissue into mice. 
Cases in France? 
              They say they've had about 6. Farmers in the UK think they've had more. The
              Portuguese say they've had 12 but they are generally the offspring of imported UK
              cattle...and one that is the offspring of a Dutch cow. It is not clear how the infectivity
              could have reached them as other Portuguese cattle do not seem to be affected. 
The case of BSE in a bull exported to Canada
              In 1994 it was a shock. The response from the Canadian meat groups was severe. 
The original cat with FSE
              It was claimed that the cat that originally died of FSE did not eat any infective food at
              all. It was supposedly only given proper steak. Similarly, the puma and the cheetah
              that died in the zoo were not knowingly given the offal of infected animals. Could cats
              be particularly open to infection. 
Before BSE got going there were only a few, specific groups in the world working on TSEs
              . Meetings were of an eye scratching type, with one group trying to be one up on the
              other group. At one meeting one of the lecturers was picked up by his lapels and
              pushed off the stage. Now there are too many people involved to be the king of the
              castle and hopefully things will be less personally messy. 
Daisy leaves in Bradford.
              Dealler found a specific chemical in the leaves of the daisy with Nash. It was found to
              be active against HIV but he wanted it to be active against BSE. The children of
              Bradford collected hundreds of bags of leaves on the 'daisy day' in 1993 and the
              chemicals still lie in wait. Dealler could find no funding to go further. 
MAFF knew the numbers of cases were not going away.
              In order to find out if the case numbers is changing is actually much more difficult
              than it seems but MAFF had about 6 people (e.g. Linda Hoinville, Judy Ryan) at one
              time working on it at the Central Veterinary Laboratory. They must have known that
              things were not a good as seemed. It does not seem obvious, however that they told the
              politicians. 
The computer was useless. 
              Originally it was a good idea that instead of all the information being given from one
              person to another about each cow, the farmer would put a tag on its ear and keep a
              record of what happens to it. A computer would keep all the records of deaths and
              farms etc. This was probably going to be used for the abattoirs to check if it came
              from an infected herd but it turned out that the information could not actually be
              released by the computer to anyone outside MAFF. The machine became a statistics
              machine and little else until the law was changed in late 1995. 
Offal has a price.
              Offal of various sorts is removed at slaughter in the abattoir. What happens to it
              then? It is very difficult to be sure and it is said that the offal may well end up in
              animal food. The fact that they have now demanded that offal is stained black by the
              abattoir may be an indication that MAFF can realise that they might not all be being
              destroyed as they should be. 
Meat and bone meal.
              MBM could no longer be used for bovine feed in the UK as of July 1988. So what
              happened to the meal? Well, it was just exported. Bradley put it over to the EC that it
              was sent to foreign parts to be used in soil fertiliser but the evidence for this is poor.
              The worry is that it got sent to Europe and that they will follow us with an outbreak of
              BSE. 
Mechanically recovered meat.
              MRM is the meat that is removed from the surfaces of bone after the abattoir workers
              have taken as much as they can. The effect is really quite large but contains fragments
              of bone and hence has a lot of calcium. Human food is always worth more than animal
              food and it is expected that MRM still ends up in human food. The worry is that MRM is
              likely to contain many tissues. 
The use of bull's eye balls in school was recommended to stop (1995). But it was OK to eat.
Various schools refused to continue to give beef to the children (1994).
              This was put down as rediculous by Meldrum and pressure was put on schools to
              change their ways. Various schools refused to do this (try some in the Hull area). 
Sausages.
              What is in your sausage? It is not exactly clear but it is expected to contain a fraction
              of many of the tissues that you did not otherwise eat (e.g. lungs). Some of these tissues
              are known in other species to be infective for TSE. 
For some reason Lacey is no longer lambasted at lectures that he gives.
              The media pulled him to pieces for saying that the cattle born after the ban would
              continue to be infected and for saying that we may find the ground to be infected (as
              with scrapie perhaps). It now seems that various groups are happy with what he is
              saying. 
Dealler's argument with McLean.
              McLean (then the top of the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1991) had given a
              lecture to the abattoir workers and the butchers in Bradford and stated that no
              infection had ever been found in meat. He had said that there was no possible risk to
              the workers and not to worry. Afterwards Dealler approached him and offered to make
              some kind of agreement; (?if McLean tells the truth then perhaps Lacey will stop
              spreading the fear. ??). Apparently McLean was determined that all the information
              concerning infectivity in meat was simply wrong and invalid. It ended up with Dealler
              shouting out of the door of the hall at McLean and his entourage heading for their car.
              Meantime, the workers were all talking to Lacey and were clearly unimpressed by
              McLean's denials. 
Wilesmith claimed that there would be no cases of BSE born in 1992 and put his job on the
line.
              When a case appeared, and the EC demanded to know how, MAFF could not say but
              promised that there would be no more in 1993. There has now been one born in 1993
              (and this is only around 2 years old so there will be plenty more. One neurological
              case has been reported to a VO in the west that was born in 1994. The farmer thought
              it was BSE but the VO didn't and told that he couldnt get any compensation. The farmer
              told Granada Television. 
Hugh Frazer.
              HF the expert in scrapie and other TSEs has now left the BBSRC Unit in Edinburgh. He
              has retired. This is a great loss as he was an excellent researcher. When BSE was first
              being investigated MAFF ordered him how to do the experiments (wrongly) but he had
              to do them that way. This is not the sort of man to lie down when retired and it would
              be a pity if he left. What a loss. 
Honors.
              Ray Bradley, who has been in charge of the BSE Unit at the Central Veterinary
              Laboratory since the beginning of the epidemic has been given the CBE...and now
              retired. Keith Meldrum has also (but not retired) and Rob Will has been made a
              Professor. Narang has been sacked, Dealler has had attempts made to destroy his
              career, and Lacey has been demoted. I hope that the winners are right. 
Keep official sources quiet.
              The Communcable Disease Report (CDR), which is produced by the Public Health
              Laboratory Service was determined to produce regular information on the BSE
              epidemic. They were told not to. A meeting there was a serious argument as to whether
              they should put up with the directions from above. This was obviously a public health
              matter and should be spread as information to doctors. It turns out that the whole of
              the PHLS were told to provide no information about BSE to anyone. No information
              could be obtained on BSE from the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of
              Pathologists, the British Medical Association, the Royal Society, Environmental
              Health and many more. This was probably because of the effect the salmonella and
              listeria news outbreaks had. Originally when it was anounced that listeria was in
              cook-chill food, everyone rang up the PHLS and asked what it was. PHLS told them that
              it was a pathogen that causes a severe disease and is sometimes associated with
              outbreaks from food. This caused a press calamity. With BSE the way to handle it was
              to make sure that there was only one source of information and that was to be MAFF. 
Consumers Assn. 
              The main group that kept needling the MAFF was the consumers association. 
Richard Kimberlin.
              He is more in charge than you think. An excellent scientist from the era of TSEs when
              interpersonal vengeance was known, is determined that the risk to humans from BSE
              is minimal. He left the research unit in Edinburgh in 1987 and set up his own
              company as advisor to other food groups, Governments, research groups, drug
              companies, committees etc. Unfortuneately this means that they have all heard the
              Kimberlin side of the story more than others. 
Various BSE researchers in the UK have made it plain that they would not let their children
eat sausages, meat pies, etc. 
Infection in meat?
              McLean stated that Dr. Pattisson, a veterinary researcher into scrapie, now deceased,
              was misleading when he stated that there was infectivity in goat meat with scrapie.
              Pattisson wrote back to the Veterinary Record making it plain that the meat taken
              from the goat was nothing but meat and it was injected into another goat. The second
              goat died of scrapie so there was infection in the meat. He told me that the real
              problem was that he carried out the experiment with a small herd of goats and was
              told to slaughter them when only a few years old. If only I had let them live on, he
              said, possibly all of them would have died of scrapie. 
GPs.
              Various GPs have made it clear that they will not eat bovine material and certainly not
              recommend it to their patients. One near Cambridge and one near York are determined.
Narang is now backed. 
              To MAFF's annoyance he is backed by a food manufacturer. 
The information source for the media from MAFF is very poor.
              Numbers can be got but information about diseases is difficult. There is a special
              telephone line at MAFF but this is limited in its value. Various researchers have
              needed some information from a vet locally and been referred to the Central
              Veterinary Laboratory. Here the researcher says they must speak to the manager, the
              manager refers them to MAFF, the MAFF demand that they speak to Kieth Meldrum. Its
              felt to be a tight ship. 
Farmers want nobody to realise that their cattle are sick.
              Although such a high proportion of herds are affected by BSE the farmers are still
              embarrassed. If they could, a farmer would sell his cow, with symptoms of BSE to an
              intermediate farmer (there was one near Ilkley and one in Cheshire) who would then
              announce the case to the veterinary officer and claim the compensation. Mean time the
              original farm did not have anything wrong with his farm. Originally MAFF took some
              trouble to prevent this but little has been heard since. 
Vicky Rimmer.
              She was with an incurable presenile dementing illness and now in a coma was first
              seen by the expert from the CJD Unit in Edinburgh when she was 16. He came and
              asked her grandmother questions about what was wrong and then told them not to tell
              anyone about the case. What he did not seem to realise was that Alan Watkins, the
              Today expert on BSE was actually in the room with them. Was this a cover-up? 
An expert at MAFF applied to the Spongiform Encephalopathy Research Campaign for the post
as the manager.
              He/she made it clear that what MAFF was doing concerning BSE was quite unacceptable
              and that some of the things said were almost unbelievable. SERC wondered whether the
              appointment was genuine but the person seemed good. 
London Zoo and its Kudu.
              Dealler went to London Zoo to look at the Greater Kudu. Unfortunately the vet was out
              but one of the zoo keepers was there and showed him around. Apparently they were
              expecting to discard the top food of soil from the kudu pen because of infection
              remaining in the soil, all droppings from the animals had to be collected and
              incinerated, the man had to get changed before he entered and left, and anything that
              was dropped into the pen by a viewer would be incinerated too. This was at the time
              that MAFF was telling farmers that BSE would not remain endemic in their farms. 
Tyrrell Committee.
              For some reason there does not seem to have been specific groups invited to the
              Tyrrell Committee for advice concerning BSE. The most important one would be one of
              Medical Ethics (the people that decide what is morally acceptable), then the Medical
              Microbiology group, then the Infectious Disease, and especially Public Health. What is
              being discussed is a matter of public health. The reason why PH is not fully involved
              is not clear. 
Death certificates.
              Various relatives of people that have died of CJD have reported that the doctors
              refused to write CJD as the cause of death on the certificate. Some (for instance Mr.
              and Mrs. Churchill) were determined and demanded the change. Exactly why this is
              cannot be sure. We are told that recently the CJD people have been asking histologists
              not to report cases but I cant believe that this can this be true. It is also said that
              various cases of CJD have not reached the CJD unit records. 
Two diseases??
              Initially it was found that around 10% of the cases of BSE reported to MAFF in 1988
              were not histologically true. This represented a few hundred. By 1993 it had risen to
              15% of the cases but this was several thousand. So what was wrong with the other
              ones? How could the number of other fatal neurological diseases have increased
              remarkably at the same rate as the number of cases of BSE? Are we having two
              epidemics in parallel? Could it be that we are just getting the histology wrong? 
Urine test.
              A technique may have been found to look for the diagnosis of BSE by looking at urine.
              The experiment work has been stopped and the funding removed at MAFF. 
Mawhinney. 
              In charge of the Department of Health he announced in 1995 that there would be no
              research into methods of diagnosis or treatment of BSE as this would simply be used to
              indicate that there was a risk to humans. He made no notice of the fact that we do not
              yet know if there is or is not a risk. 
Germans are not so easily misled. 
              It was expected that the Germans scientists would not be misled by MAFF but when
              speaking to them. Dealler found that they too had believed many of the pieces of data
              that Bradley had put out (which were all essentially true) and took them to show that
              BSE was going away and there was little risk. 
Questions not answered.
              Meetings involving Linda Hoinville and John Wilesmith with the vets from the south
              of England were strained as they refused to answer some questions. For some reason
              the 'vertical transmission study', which will not now be able to show if there is any
              because both the control mothers and the test mothers are from the same herd, has
              finished but the results not arrived for publication. 
Hogg the new minister
              Hogg got in as the Minister of MAFF and must have wondered why. His wife has been
              disposed of by Major as an advisor and there had been a mild fracas. When arriving in
              the post he asked to see all the information about BSE. It is assumed that some of it was
              not as he liked and a press conference was announced saying that there was more
              infection in bovine tissue than they thought. No further data was given. Bradley said
              later that this was due to the oral transmission of BSE by 1g of brain tissue to another
              cow. Clearly this did not incidate more infectivity in the tissue, so there must have
              been some more information. Is the information fully reaching the Spongiform
              Encephalopathy Advisory Committee? It is worried that the SEAC is being used to
              blame when things go wrong and their advice is more manipulated than wanted. One
              thing is clear from the way things happened is that Hogg might have wondered if
              anything was wrong when he got the job. 
SEAC decisions.
              The decisions made by MAFF and by SEAC early in the epidemic had to be on best
              guesses because there was simply not enough information to be sure of the risks that
              were being taken. It is not at all clear, however, how those best guesses were
              calculated. Dealler's calculations of the number of infected cattle that were being eaten
              was given to MAFF and SEAC 4 months in advance of the following SEAC meeting.
              Bradley was to send copies to all the members. They reached the members a week
              before the meeting and were little looked at. A letter was sent back to him saying that
              they could not accept his findings of human risk because they were calculated
              assuming cumulative doses of BSE and there was not proof of this. The problem with
              SEAC is that it has had to make decisions where there is inadequate proof. Anyone in
              Public Health would have accepted the findings as you must always assume the worst.
              Instead Dealler offered to calculate risks with non-cumulative doseas of disease. He
              received no reply. Could SEAC be looking on the bright side when the dark side is the
              PH line it should take? Are they going to be the fall-guys? 
New test for CJD.
              Narang claims that by looking at the urine of a patient under the microscope he
              identified the objects that were associated with infection. He says that he used simple
              local urine as controls and was happy. He felt that the test should be tried by many
              other groups and that he should be allowed to carry it out without the fight of trying to
              use a laboratory. "Why dont you use your garage?" said a local hospital manager. 
Foreign cows.
              A farmer with a number of cases of what he thought were BSE reported them to the VO.
              The VO ignored a few of them and when asked why, he said that they were foreign cows
              and therefore couldn't have BSE. Apparently MAFF has had pressure put on it to cut
              any budgets that it can and the compensation for BSE is one of them. 
MAFF chases away experts.
              Some researchers appeared from Edinburgh to a farm in the South of England to carry
              out electronic recordings of the brain waves of the cows suffering from BSE and those
              that were apparently normal. The reason was that this particular herd had had a large
              number of cases of BSE and nobody was sure why. Initially the vet reported to the
              Veterinary Record that there had been 12 cases and it was published. There was at
              least 60 by a few years later however. By this time it seemed that there was
              something special about the farm and they may be able to tell which cattle were
              incubating the disease and which were not so an agreement was made with the farmer.
              MAFF arrived to chase them away. The vet in charge of this farm described the tale in
              awful terms and actually moved house partly to get away from the problem. 
Espionage??
              The worry among the people outside MAFF/DoH has always been that they are at risk
              in some way. Letters have gone missing, computer discs, files, publications, and
              crackles on the line, but nobody is sure of any espionage. The publisher of Lacey's
              latest popular book about BSE seemed to vanish after spending a year of organising and
              few books were sold. A bit strange but not surely a spy. Dealler's manuscript was
              turned down for the Lancet but none returned. He found that the computer disc and the
              hard copy of the manuscript had gone from his office. Not exactly serious; he just
              rewrote it. 
Update April 1996
Transmission to pigs? 
              The sheer idea of this must shake the MAFF to the core. The fact is that we eat pigs at a
              very low point in their normal life expectancy (generally about 4 months) and so the
              actual likelihood of significant amounts of BSE being present in the tissues are pretty
              slim. However, we also eat older sows and boars but in much smaller numers and a lot
              of the reaction to this disease is not totally logical anyway. It appears that scrapie has
              been transmitted to sheep orally (a french thesis) and although we are now 6 years
              into the study it is not being made absolutely plain that pigs have not succumbed. The
              Chief Vet Officer has not made this clear. 
Vertical transmission? 
              It was never clear why the VT study was being done 'blind' i.e. so that neither the
              researchers nor the cattle knew which were the offspring of the cow with symptoms
              and which were the offspring of cows without. Blind studies are usually done if the
              researchers's knowledge might alter the outcome. But BSE is fatal and so this is very
              unlikely. The possibility is there but the significance is slim. The fact that the
              controls were the offspring of other cattle in the same herd is very had news indeed.
              The VT researchers are beginning to suggest that all the cows in a herd may well be
              infected and it is the offspring that we see with disease anyway. In that case there
              would be no difference between the two groups. All attempts by MAFF, if they found no
              difference between the groups, to say that 'therefore all the cattle (about 40 so far)
              that have succumbed have caught it from their feed' will be fought. It might be
              possible to get some useful data from this study but I think that it can now only bring
              bad news. 
The press are moving in. 
              There appears now (April 1996) to be 4 major TV programs being organised, mainly
              by groups outside the tenuous control of the Government. 
House of Commons Select Committee. 
              The health and agriculture committees met over the period from the beginning of
              April 1996 to around the end. It now appears that much of the data that they were
              given did not look good to the health side but the agriculture thought it was fine.
              Particularly this was the data from Professor Lang, who made it clear that there was
              no justification for the way that the MAFF had acted. Jerry Wiggin asked Dr. Dealler
              how he could justify his predictions of human pathogenesis from BSE and got a hail of
              statistics. Wiggin immediatly turned to Proffessor Pattison and asked if this could
              possibly be accepted. Pattison simply said that most of the logic was valid and Wiggin
              almost fell backwards. It now seems that the joint committees cannot agree on a report
              and will be putting all the data that they have been given out as the report itself. It
              will be long and tiring but all Dr. Dealler's data concerning the times at which MAFF
              knew what was going on but did not tell either Parliament or the population will creat
              some havoc. 
Younger CJD again 
              It now seems that an even younger child than the one in Glasgow with similar
              symptoms may well be being investigated for CJD. 
Public Enquiry 
              Lacey immediately demanded that the Government start a Public Enquiry into the way
              in which BSE had been handled. He has been completely ignored apparently for the
              time being. 
Dealler's book. Lethal Legacy. BSE a search for the truth, 
              came out in April 1996 published by Bloomsbury. It had originally been about half as
              big again and the publishers decided to hack it back and call in the legal experts.
              Apparently there were about a dozen places where the author was distinctly sailing too
              close to the wind and they had to be calmed down. The book was accepted for publication
              and reached the shops within 3 weeks. 
Narang's book. 
              Not finished yet and mainly science but is on the way. 
Cases in Ashford. 
              Apparently there were 3 cases of what seemed to be CJD in men in Ashford (a town in
              Kent, S. england) reported in 1996. The local Public Health Physician was shocked
              and has called in the Public Health Lab Service to try to work out if there is anything
              that conects them. This is an amazing breakthrough in that the PHLS were ordered to
              keep their thieving fingers away from anything to do with BSE right at the beginning
              of the epidemic (this was because they actually gave information to the public about
              things - quite unacceptable! - and had been involved in the media hype of Listeria and
              Salmonella). The fact that we have suddenly been shocked by what was going on is
              mainly due to inadequate epidemiology having been carried out up until now. The PHLS
              must be a necessity in this disease and a lot of people know it. Also the cases in
              Ashford, if they are a cluster (an accidental chance of 1 in 300 of 3 cases including 2
              of the new type CJD2 appearing in the UK in a year) might suggest that the cases were
              becoming infected early in the BSE epidemic. 
10 cases so far of CJD2? 
              It seems that the number of 10 was picked out of the air to some degree when it was
              first announced in the Houses of Parliament onthe 20th March. There were actually
              more than that but some were in the process of dying. A better figure would be 15 at
              that time and apparently there has been a run on cases ever since then as everyone
              from psychiatrists to dermatologists have realised what was wrong with some of their
              cases. 
4 farmers? No abattoir workers? 
              It appears now that in 1995 there was another farmer just Norther of Manchester
              that developed CJD. He was from a farm with BSE. It was hushed up and keep quiet as
              all the staff working in the hospital with him were told to. The abattoir worker in
              York appeared in Jan and died quickly and it now appeares that there may well be
              another one on the way. 
France is OK? 
              The French government has made grand statements that this new CJD2 may have
              nothing to do with BSE. They had a case in a man from Lyon and the people in
              Edinburgh confirmed that it was one of the CJD2 type. The crash in the beef sales in
              France led to the slaughter of thousands of cattle exported by the UK and the
              Government trying pseudoscience to calm everyone down. What they did not say is, of
              course, that UK had been exporteing some of the most infective cattle carcases to
              France and the French had not introduced an offals ban until (?1994). The French are
              the biggest consumers of offals in Europe and the number of infected cattle eaten in
              France can actually be calculated from MAFF's export data. This has been offered to
              them but no reply has come. The French are now going to be putting more research
              into CJD than the UK did! 
We told them so. 
              Apparently various documents had gone from the UK to France warning them of the
              BSE risk early in the epidemic. It seems that they are going to need someone to blame
              when they did nothing. 
Research is stepping up in the UK. 
              Well it would do. The problem is that the research funding may just be part of the
              current budget. What happens then is simply the people working on chickens that
              suddenly could not get a grant have to moving into BSE, a very complex subject indeed.
              This sort of thing happened with HIV. Huge funds appeared and little got done because
              the research being carried out by many of the people was valueless. 
Narang's magic test. 
              He actually had the urine test for CJD going to some degree a long time ago. The
              technique involves the filtration of the urine onto a mineral and the removal of it
              again into a small volume of fluid. This is then looked at under the electron
              microscope. There is a lot of cynical viewing of his results but I expect he will get
              somewhere if given the equipment. The House of Commons Select Committee on Health
              chairwoman (Mrs Roe) simply said she did not understand all the papers he had given
              them and it was only Mr. Campbell Savours, a determined man, on the Labour side that
              made it clear to the MAFF that ignoring potential opportunities such as Narang's test
              at this time would be quite unacceptable. 
Central Veterinary Laboratory in disarray. 
              Now that Ray Bradley has gone to join the SEAC there appears to be relative disarray.
              The reason was that RB seemed to be steering the ship in the direction of 'dont worry
              about it folks' and now, all you have to do is re-look at the results they had got already
              and it becomes clear that not all is so surely safe. Much of the research money that
              was supposed to appear in December 1995 just disappeared and the researchers at
              CVL quickly got very little (nobody is very sure where it went). Wilesmith is still
              going around telling everyone that there is no vertical transmission or very little at
              least. He does not seem to be taking into account various possibilities and his group
              are not all believing him dispite all the hard work. 
Vertical Transmission. 
              A poster of information on vertical transmission of BSE was put up at the Soc Vet Epid
              and Inf Cont in Glasgow in March. It was a popular poster and showed that things were
              not all as should be if the disease was just passed in feed. 
Web sites 
              . The possibility has now appeared on the horizon of all the web sites being sort of
              joined together on BSE. 
Dogs and BSE? 
              The noise that some dogs may have BSE has increased apparently there have been
              around 30 reports of progressive degenerating nervous conditions leading to death
              over the past year. It seems to start in older animals as a staggering and falling over.
              The development of the condition is slow but relentless. One animal has been looked at
              by Liverpool Vet school and they found nothing in its brain under histology. Watch this
              space. 
Compensation. 
              The data that had been put out by the USDA concerning the effect of changing the level
              of compensation and the effect that his has on the numbers of cases of scrapie
              reported. This is so blatant that it would be impossible for MAFF to pretend that
              compensation levels changing from 50% to 100% in 1989 for BSE had no effect. 
Blood transfusion. 
              At the Gottingen conferencein 1995 Paul Brown refused to answer a question
              concerning the risk to humans from blood transfusion if some of them had caught BSE.
              He said that nobody could catch BSE and so there could be no answer to the question.
              The article in the BMJ in March 1996 from him was almost an apology. He said he
              never expected it but now we now we had to assume that BSE had infected humans.
              Well, Paul, what now about blood transfusion? 
Rob Will's speech. 
              Two weeks before the UK government admitted that it had been in error (March 20,
              1996) suggesting that BSE would not affect humans, Rob Will, who must have known
              all about this at the time, gave a speech to the House of Commons Forum stating the
              same thing. In fact they had quite a bit of data in 1995 and Ironside must have been
              pushing it forward then. (Ironside is a bright man and I doubt that he would not have
              noticed the changes in CJD2 fairly earlyEd) 
What are they going to do with all the carcasses? 
              Apparently it simply has not been worked out what to do with all the potentially
              infective material. Mince it, put it in the ground? The current best plan is to turn it
              into meat and bone meal as previously and then incincerate it in Powergen's coal fired
              power stations. Every seen any dust onyour car? Where does the dust come from? In
              the UK a lot of it comes from powerstations. There's going to be a lot of arguments on
              this one. 
The dying farmers. 
              Well, not all that many farmers in the UK only are involved in milking cattle
              (although this is certainly true in some parts of the country). When investigated it
              appears that he farmers have done so well over the past few years (partly because of
              the drop in the value of the pound) that they could easily pay for many of their
              milking cattle to be slaughtered at the end of their milking lives and not even get any
              compensation. "they could handle it quite easily" was an opinion I heard at the
              agricultural meeting. 
SEAC did not suggest that older cattle be destroyed? 
              I find this extremely unlikely as it would be the older cattle that represented the risk
              to humans. What seems much more likely is that the UK Government took SEAC advice
              and then decided themselves that there should be no slaughter. This was boiund to be
              followed by demads from the EU ....and in that case the EU can pay for it cant they! A
              crafty way to pass the bill the the EU I would guess but it hardly matters now. 
SEAC 
              asked to go back to their meeting and decide if children were more at risk. Well,
              perhaps they were, but it seems more likely that they had already given a decision on
              this subject to Steven Dorrell and he asked them to think again. 
Why March 20th? 
              The story goes that SEAC had been given the data (dont forget that Rob Will's band
              report to the Dept of Health, not SEAC) and decided that this was very serious indeed.
              When it was put to the Government they did not really want to let it out and wanted
              more information before making it public. Indeed some members fo the Government
              (?Heseltine) wanted for it to be suppressed. They say that Pattison, who is 6 feet tall,
              and a very determined but mild mannered man, made it clear that either they let the
              information out or he would resign (in which case it would get out of the bag anyway).
              Very complex and a lot of heresay but it is clear to all involved that Pattison has been
              a breath of fresh air to the whole process. 
Research. Well yes we should go ahead. 
              One expert on CJD is not Professor Swales (formerly the prof of medicine at Leicester
              University, but now at Richmond House, in Whitelhall DofH). The statement in the
              House of commons on 25th of March by Dorrell that Swales was going to be drawing up
              (over the weekend supposedly but this seems rediculous) a research plan for BSE
              would be worrying. Yet again they have picked someone outside the subject to produce
              their report. Let us hope he gets good advice. 
The Southwood Committee. 
              Southwood, from the Zoology Dept in Oxford, now claims that he wanted to put in his
              report that BSE should be assumed to be infective to humans but this not happen. He,
              and his mate Dr. Watson (who appeared on Grampian TV in March, telling everyone
              that their report was acceptable when it stated that humans eating bovine brain was
              not a risk) surely cannot justify some parts of the report and the fact that some of the
              major researchers in the field were not asked for their opinion before it was
              published. 
Public health and beef. 
              Dealler have a talk at the Royal Society of Medicine on the risks to humans from BSE
              in April. At the end a very nice American stood up and asked the audience (about 60 PH
              workers including the top dogs) if they still ate beef. Only 3 people raised their hands
              and Calman, the government's chief medical officer, kept his hand down (but I expect
              he was abstaining). 
On the way (May, 1996). 
              The TV people are moving in. The Europeans are moving in and it looks as if the budget
              for research in the field will jump. The data concerning risks from blood transfusion
              and exported cattle to France will be published soon. The information concerning the
              risks to humans and how the calculations could be made as to the size of the epidemic
              will come out in the data given by Dealler to the House of Commons Select committee
              on Health and Agriculture. The problem with this sort of disease is that there is
              rarely good news. 
Vertually everyone is now admitting that BSE is not scrapie
              This is now being admitted by MAFF's veterinary officers unfficially. 
Further information suggests that genotype (or perhaps the semen) of certain
bulls may transfer the disease
              A second report of the offspring of a specific bull seem to go down with BSE. This
              report comes from the South West. 
Lectures are being given in various places where they simply cannot find
enough room in the buildings for the audience because it is so large.
              The recent talk in Glasgow at the SEC (16.5.95) and in Aberdeen Forresterhill on the
              same day, were packed out. 
There now seems to be evidence that there are a few more cases of CJD in
abattoir workers.
              More data may come out on this in a few weeks time. 
It now seems that there may be more the the OP story. 
              Other farmers have been found to feel that there is some external factor that is
              involved and the infective agent may not be the whole story. 
It now (May 1996) may appear that BSE may cause CJD and the CJD unit in
Edinburgh is backing up this idea against argument
              . They are now quite determined (and probably rightly so - Ed). At the meeting in
              Glasgow Martin Zeidler, who had worked on the epidemiology had made it certain in is
              own mind that the new cases really were new and that there had not been many before
              this date. They had to assume it was due to BSE. Gareth Roberts was, however putting
              forward the position that there was more CJD around than we thought and, because of
              this we must look out for the possibility that the new cases really had been there
              before. 
The Ashford cases.
              It now seems that the PHLS are going to be involved in some of the work on the cases
              seen. The CJD Unit are not happy that there is any connection between them but that
              does not seem to stop the flurry. 
A dog in Lancashire and one Staffordshire have gone down with BSE-like
symptoms.
              I am not sure whether they are actually going to get post-mortems. 
The new regulations for cattle over 30 months being slaughtered and
incinerated at the end of their working lives means that farmers will be
compensated for them..
              I have now heard that farmers are not reporting cases of BSE because of this. After
              all, if they will get some compensation anyway, why go through the difficulty of
              claiming a case of BSE? I am now told by farmers in Yorkshire that many cases of BSE
              have been slaughtered in this way rather than reported to MAFF. This will have a big
              effect on the BSE figures. 
The reason why cattle that go down with BSE tend to be born in September and
October is not clear (it is certainly not due to that being the calving time of
the year)..
              Suggestions have been put forwards that this is due to heifers being made pregnant for
              the first time so as to calve then and specific bulls being used. Another reason put
              forward is that at that time of the year, when the animals are born, the grass is
              covered with spiders webs (? how this will cause the diseaseEd). June 1996 
It now appears that there may well be more new cases appearingin young
people in France.
              It is certainly not clear yet but there has been some gossip coming out of young people
              with the new CJD2 symptoms. 
Major may have completely failed in trying to get the Europeans to back down. 
              I have now spoken to a number of people in Europe that see his stance as having been
              completely useless and made a lot of enemies. 
The French have now made the reporting of cases of Scrapie a legal act and if
farmers do not do it they will be fined heavily.
One of the things that did not seem to come out in the news was that the
selective culls suggested by MAFF to the Europeans in order to get rid of BSE
would only really prevent about 35% of the cases that would otherwise have
appeared.
              It is not surprising that they were not impressed. 
Farmers are now saying that they will not continue to report cases of BSE in
the UK!
              This is really an unofficial statement in that it is not the NFU but individual farmers
              taht have been saying this. The reason is simply that they can get some compensation
              for the death of a cow by taking it to the incinerator if it is over 30 months while it
              can still stand. Why bother milking the cow for a month and throwing the milk away
              when you may not get any compensation at all (if the vet wont accept the case) and
              why get a case of BSE and not be able to sell you cattle in the future as a result? The
              farmers simply thought it would not be worth it and that MAFF's statistics on the
              incidence of BSE should no longer be believed (i.e. they thought that the other farmers
              were thinking the same way). 
The electricity company Powergen has already got onto the incineration of
meat and bone meal from the cattle over 30 months.
              They are actually being paid to do it. What has not been let out is that they were given
              data on the potential risk that they would be putting their staff to..and it was not zero
              (indeed MAFF did not pretend it was). ....Mean time MBM was piling up on a military
              base in Gloucestershire afterbeing dumped there by open topped lorries. The men
              dealing with it were wearing paper masks and it was blowing all over to the local
              houses. 
This is not to say that National Power are out of this. 
              They are also interested in the process but the amount of electricity produced will not
              be the advantage. No doubt the government will have to give them some money. 
The new ideas that are appearing as to the causes of CJD/scrapie/BSE have put
the scientific world (if it is awake) to storm. 
              Stuart Neilson's genetics stories have a strong ring of truth and his work at Brunel
              may well come up with a lot of answers. 
It now looks as if the evidence concerning vertical transmission of BSE from
cow to calf is being given to SEAC.
              Dealler has produced a 50 page dossier of the information and explanations, which are
              difficult to understand at first hand and may well have great difficulty getting through
              to the those that are still stuck on the 'nugget' of infection theory of MAFF. 
Newsnight on the BBC on 20th June had Stephen Dorrel, John Patisson, and
some compettive groups.
              After the show they were given a few glasses of wine (Dealler having shaken Dorrel's
              hand and offered him a copy of his book, 'Lethal Legacy' before the politician left). At
              this one of the farmers spent a good 10 minutes explaining how he was quite certain
              that there was more to it than just the feed and that he was quite unhappy with the
              handling of the subject by MAFF. It was interesting that he was quite certain that large
              numbers of cases of BSE had been taken to the abattoir. "it was just the done thing".
              Frances Hall was furious at Dorrell and how he had not stopped the risks to other
              people from BSE. 
At last it seems that the Public Health Laboratory Service may be becoming
involved with BSE.
              The reason why it has been kept out of the subject is simply not clear througout the
              epidemic. The small cluster of cases in Ashford may well bring them in this time. 
The EMPs in Strasbourg have called a number of the relatives of the people
that have died of BSE to see them.
              Apparently there is going to be a meeting of some kind there in the last week of the
              month. The MPs, who are of course associated with the Labour EMP for Scotland that
              is head of the Public Health Committee are not at all happy with the way that the UK
              government has handled this. They are all 'praying that Major does not last much
              longer.' 
It now seems that MAFF have offered Narang some cattle urines to do some of
his amazing test on (looking to see if they are infected). 
              "Well, what about some controls?" he asked but was asked why he wanted them. They
              said that they could not find any cattle urine in the UK that they could guarantee did
              not contain BSE. They did not even seem to have good figures on how many of the cattle
              in a field were likely to be infected. Narang demanded that they get urines from abroad
              to act as the negatives for his test. 
British beef sales in the UK have not fully recovered. 
              It does not seem to have met people's eye but the level of beef sales is still quite low.
              People in the meatpie, sausage etc companies have changed the meats that they are
              using to make the produce, basically because the demand for UK beef is still low
              (despite the idea being put around that you should now eat UK beef for queen and
              country, as well as to show these Europeans that we dont care what they think). 
A group of French neuropathologists have now said that they are unhappy that
BSE has caused the new CJD2.
              The reasons are that the appearance down the microscope that they see have been seen
              for many years. 
Lacey now claims that there have been 23 cases of the CJD-2 disease.
              Lacey usually has the information that others do not have if only because various
              consultants ring him up. 
The article in the BMJ that says that half the neurologists in the UK did not
know to report cases of CJD to the CJD Unit in Edinburgh.
              This seems really worrying in the Rob Will has been happy that his results have been
              quite good. The difference that this will make is not clear at this time, however. 
The Medical Research Council seems to have an unknown amount of money at
its fingertips concerning BSE and the CJD that it seems to have caused.
              The group at the Department of Health have produced a list of research that needs to be
              done (although this is not let out to mortals) have not released any figures on the
              quantity of money that will be made available. 
It seems that one of the relatives of a man that is dying of CJD is going to be
sueing the MAFF. 
              He was apparently hired by them to slaughter cattle and was not warned of any risks
              that he might be taking. 
The experiment that has been organised by the MAFF to see if pigs develop BSE
after being fed the disease has been rather different from the experiment used
in other animals.
              What they have done is feed the pigs with a similar amount of infection that they think
              would be in the pig feed 'normally'. They do not seem to realise that they dont know
              how much infection is in the meal and they cannot carry experiments out on only a few
              pigs in such a manner in order to proclaim that all the millions of pigs that might eat
              the meal would be OK. You have to show that the pigs are not at risk after eating maybe
              100 or 1000 times that amount as guesstimated to be in the meal on average. The
              experiment will be open to severe criticism. 
Gelatine manufacturers may not be telling the whole truth.
              Originally the idea was that gelatin was manufactured from the bones of larger
              animals and then it was purified, dried and powdered. The temperatures for this in the
              text books are not really paticularly high. When the World in Action Team asked them,
              the manufacturers told them of temperatures over 200 degees that would be used.
              Apparently Lacey has had a try at using the methods that they say they are using and
              cannot reach the pressures needed for the temperatures and even when high
              temperatures are used, the gelatine is destroyed by the heat....so what is happening? It
              may well be that they meant Farenheit and not Centigrade...but if they did then the
              geletine will not be safe. 
I have been contacted by the wife of a person working for the new Meat
Hygeine Service and it seems that he has been threatened for turning down too
many carcasses.
              Before starting withe the MHS he was working for a group with good standards and
              expected the same of the MHS. Apparently their standards are not as high. 
Reports are coming in of some farmers having far too many cattle aged 30
months released back to them allegedly for their own consumption. 
              apparently they simply could not possibly be eating them. 
The spinal of the carcass is still being used for the manufacture of
mechanically recovered meat.
              This was a shock to me in that I had locked it in my head that the spine had been banned
              from human consumption. He (from the MHS) told me that all they were soing was to
              remove the meninges from the spinal canal and after that the rest could go to the
              machines.

Sean O'Neill      Daily Telegraph      Wednesday July 24 1996 
<P>

STEPHEN Daniels's customers were treating the mad sheep scare as a bit
of a joke yesterday. 

"People have been coming in and saying 'Oh, what am I allowed to eat
now?' Then they ask for lamb chops," said Mr Daniels <P>

"We've had eggs, poultry, beef, now sheep - I think it's getting to the
stage where people are laughing at it all. When I saw it on television I
laughed too. I suppose there will be a turkey scare at Christmas." 
But Mr Daniels, 43, who has run Artingstalls Family Butchers in Chipping
Sodbury for 10 years, doesn't always see the funny side of the never-
ending BSE crisis. <P>

"It seems that all these scientists have done is take BSE from a beef
animal, inject it into a sheep, then say that sheep can get mad cow
disease," he said. "They don't seem to realise what damage they're doing
to the meat industry."

Margaret Harding came into Artingstalls to buy pork and apple sausages
and lamb's liver. "It's getting a bit silly now," she said. "What can we
eat and what can't we eat - does anyone know? I sometimes think we
should be more worried about what they spray on vegetables than about
meat." <P>

Across the street at M. E. Nelson Family Butchers, Mike Nelson has
reacted to the series of food scares by diversifying. "My wife and my
son work here, it's our family business, so we had to sit down and
scratch our heads to decide how to keep going," he said. "We didn't used
to sell quiches and vegetables but we have to now. We're lucky because
we serve a farming community out here in the sticks. Every time BSE
reared its head the farmers supported us. Otherwise, we might have
closed like a lot of town butchers. There's been a lot of pressure,
maybe that's why I had a heart attack." <P>

Sisters Anita Moore and Liz Herbert, shopping in the high street, said
they had continued to eat beef and would not worry about buying lamb 
Mr Nelson, 57, believes his business has seen off the worst of the
problem partly because the public have more trust in small, independent
butchers than in anonymous supermarkets. <P>

He said: "I'm hoping the public are going to get fed up with it -
they'll start asking themselves what can they eat. My wife will eat
salad every day, 365 days a year. But I need more substance." <P>

Sisters Anita Moore and Liz Herbert, shopping in the high street, said
they had continued to eat beef and would not worry about buying lamb.


Mrs Moore said: "I think there's always a lot of scaremongering about
these things. Some of the publicity has been quite off-putting but my
impression was that we might have been at risk in the past, before they
identified the problem and the rules were put in place." <P>

Mrs Herbert said: "I think it's important to have a lot of safeguards
with regard to our food in the first place. When these things come along
we're left wondering if they're the tip of the iceberg or just a storm
in a teacup? "

Jill Norris, 51, was having difficulty deciding what meat to buy. "I
bought cold meats in the end," she said. "I did look at the lamb chops
but I think my husband would end up saying no. <P>

"Every time there's a scare he says 'don't give me any of that'. He
stopped eating eggs after that row and he stopped eating chicken. He
gave up beef after the last fuss.

"Then after he saw the news on television last night he said he was
going to become a vegetarian. So I don't know what we're going to eat."

<H3><CENTER>Mad Cow <A NAME="team">team</A> investigates sheep</CENTER></H3>

By Roger Highfield, Science Editor      Daily Telegraph    <BR>
Wednesday July 24 1996 
<P>

A SURVEY to establish whether mad cow disease has spread to sheep is to
be conducted by the same team of scientists who established that BSE can
infect sheep.

"We have been building the experimental protocol of this survey for some
time but the results will not be known for a couple of years," said Prof
John Bourne, director of the Institute for Animal Health, at Compton,
near Newbury. <P>

The team will take various pure-bred strains of mice and inject them
with contaminated tissue, then wait for disease to develop. 

If a sheep sample has the same pattern of disease as one from a BSE-
infected cow, they are likely to be the same strain of spongiform
disease. "If we find it, it begs the question of where it came from,"
said Prof Bourne. <P>

One possibility would be that BSE was transmitted by contaminated feed.
Another would be that it was the original scrapie that started the BSE
epidemic. 
"The overall evidence suggests to us that the BSE problem did arise from
sheep scrapie," said Prof Bourne. <P>

The alarm over contamination of the national flock by BSE was raised in
a paper in the Veterinary Record, by scientists at the Institute for
Animal Health's Neuropathogenesis Unit, in Edinburgh.
They found that BSE can be transmitted to sheep by injecting
contaminated cow tissue directly into the brains of animals and also by
contaminated feed. <P>

The disease is linked to a brain protein, called prion protein. The
experimentally infected sheep showed that the agent maintained all the
hallmarks of BSE but the disease also affected the spleen as well as the
spinal cord and brain, as one would expect from scrapie.

By George Jones, Political Editor      Daily Telegraph   <BR> 
Thursday July 25 1996 
<P>

STRICTER controls on the slaughter of sheep were proposed by the
Government yesterday after scientific evidence that BSE in cattle could
be transmitted to them. <P>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said the Government was
proposing that the heads of all sheep and goats be destroyed in the same
way as for cattle in the slaughter process. "These steps are being taken
out of an abundance of caution. There is no direct threat to human
health," he assured the Commons in a statement. <P>

Mr Hogg also assured MPs there was no evidence that scrapie in sheep and
goats, a brain disease similar to BSE, was linked to Creutzfeldt Jakob
Disease in humans. 

Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, backed the new measures,
saying it was right to "err on the side of caution". <P>

Mr Hogg said the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) had
advised that BSE "could, theoretically, become established in the sheep
flock". There was no evidence of BSE occurring naturally in the flock,
but the committee was concerned that scrapie might be "masking" BSE. 

Mr Hogg said the Government was consulting its European partners and the
Commission was formulating proposals for the removal of certain offals
of sheep, goats and deer from the human and animal food chain. <P>

On the recommendation of SEAC, agriculture officials had issued for
consultation a proposal that the heads of all sheep and goats be removed
and destroyed in the same way as cattle. 

"It should not have a major economic impact as the vast majority of
sheep's heads are already destroyed. It is worth noting that sheep meat
for human consumption comes predominantly from young lambs under 12
months," said Mr Hogg.

"That's another fine mess you have got yourself into, or this industry
into" <P>

"With the exception of the consumption of brains, there is absolutely no
reason for anybody to change their eating habits. I repeat: there is no
evidence at all that in field conditions BSE has got into the national
flock, but as that possibility cannot be wholly excluded we are
proposing to take these precautionary measures." 
He said the Government was commissioning further research into the
possible transmission of BSE to the British sheep flock. <P>

Paul Tyler, for the Liberal Democrats, said such precautionary measures
were irrelevant to the traditionally reared and butchered British lamb.
"Is it not true that the English chop is safe in our time?" he said. 

To cheers from MPs, Mr Hogg said the British chop was "a splendid
product" that could be eaten in complete safety.

But John Robertson, Labour MP for East Lothian and a farmer, told Mr
Hogg: "That's another fine mess you have got yourself into, or this
industry into." The Government was driving consumers and producers to despair. <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Rohwer (in: Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: Scrapie, BSE and
Related Human Disorders, ed. by B.W. Chesebro, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York,
London and so on, 1991) emphasizes too that CJD didn't exist in Slovakia in
former generations. I remember having read somewhere else (but where?) that
CJD started at a certain point in time with victims of different age.
<P>
 
Mayer, Orolin and Mitrova (The Lancet, July 30, 1977) report 10 CJD cases
between 1972 and 1977, in a clearly defined area; an extend not reported
before in Slovakia.
 
The Fore in New Guinea too could remember (according to Gajdusek) that Kuru had started at
a certain point in time (about 1920-1925), whereas the disease hadn't existed
before. Such a start is very typical of an infection which arrives at a region for
the first time.

According to the reports of the Gajdusek-group, already two four-year and
7-year-old children came down with kuru. They can have been infected as
toddlers (1 - 1.5 years) at the earliest. We have to assume that - like in
animal experiments with TSE - the outbreak of the disease was determined by
the dose of infection: more relatives dead of kuru - more infectious rituals
- earlier outbreak of kuru with the persons involved in the funeral rituals.
<P>
Women and children were also the only ones to eat infectious brain; men and
older boys were not involved. The dose of infection of women and younger
children might therefore have been substantially higher than that of knacker
men and renderer staff. On top of it, young children probably run the highest
risk: Taylor (Vet. Rec. 1989, 14, p. 413 ff.) proofed by animal experiments
that scarification in the oral cavity increases the risk of infection
significantly. Applied to men , this means that the agent could directly pass
into the blood system in case of second dentition and tonsillitis - thus the
incubation period would shorten.
 
We should also remember that 2 British abattoir workers (at the age of about
50) came down with CJD - probably with a different variation than the V-CJD
victims. Spontaneous CJD may be the result of an infection. It's unlogical to postulate
85% of the CJD cases as "causally unknown", whereas it is known at the same
time that all other TSE are infections (kuru included)."</BLOCKQUOTE>

"The article below is at Babraham, Cambridge. There may be another at Compton, Berkshire.

The 1995 report gives details of some genetic lines conferring 
resistance in Cheviot sheep. Note that this is a different breed than 
the Suffolks mentioned in the magazine. However the authors may well 
know of other work.
<P>
The scrapie genotype test costs UKP 70 <about $100) an animal
and takes about a month."
<P>
PrP genotypes of sheep affected with natural scrapie and those of 
healthy flock mates are being compared. Differences have
been noted between outbreaks and between flocks. This may be due to 
differences in the strain of natural scrapie affecting the
flock or may reflect breed differences in the sheep themselves.

The most important variants of the PrP gene are those differing at codon 
136 and 171. Valine at codon 136(V136) has a
dominant association with incidence of scrapie but is not found in all 
breeds of sheep. Glutamine at codon 171 (Q171) has a
recessive association with scrapie and has been found in all breeds of 
sheep examined so far. 

The NPU Cheviot flock had 45 deaths from natural scrapie between 1986 
and 1995. Of these cases 39 were analysed for
disease-linked PrP gene polymorphisms and all encode V136 on at least 
one allele with 79% homozygous (VV136) and 21%
valine/alanine heterozygotes (VA136). Mean survival time was 888 and 
1482 days for VV136 and VA136 animals respectively.
VV136 animals were all at great risk of disease if allowed to live long 
enough. However, scrapie occurred only in a specific
subgroup of VA136 sheep, survival advantage depending on VA136 animals 
being heterozygous for other polymorphisms at
codon 154 or 171.

The flock history has been recorded in great detail since its foundation 
in 1960. However there was no strong evidence for
simple maternal or paternal transmission of disease other than 
inheritance of PrP genotype.

In a Suffolk flock with scrapie, cases occurred in animals according to 
their PrP genotype at codon 171. QQ171 sheep were at
great risk of scrapie whereas those which were arginine/glutamine 
heterozygotes (RQ) were at less risk and RR171 animals
appeared to be resistant. A histidine codon (H171) can also be found at 
this position in Suffolk sheep but this did not occur in
scrapie-affected animals.<P>


Natural modes of transmission:

The incidence of natural scrapie in the NPU's flock of Cheviots is 
linked to PrP genotype. The flock is maintained as two
breeding lines, one (susceptible: 'positive') which has endemic natural 
scrapie and the other (resistant: 'negative') which is
entirely free from clinical manifestation of the disease.
<P>

The positive line is being bred to carry specific PrP genes which are 
linked to susceptibility to experimental inoculation but
resistant to the natural disease (VA136/RQ171), thereby controlling its 
incidence by manipulating genetic frequency. The negative
line is being bred for different PrP genes (AA136/RR171, RQ171, QQ171) 
which also never allow natural scrapie to develop and
in which transmission experiments can be achieved without compromise. A 
further line, completely segregated from the first
two, is being bred to generate an high incidence of natural scrapie, by 
increasing the frequency of susceptible PrP genes

<H3><CENTER>Massive Beef Intervention Rip_offs</CENTER></H3>

Brussels Correspondent, 25 July, 1996

<p>Just as huge sums of European Community funds are being found to put massive amounts of unwanted beef and veal resulting from the mad cow crisis into subsidised public intervention cold storage, four countries of the European Union, France, Ireland, Italy and UK, have been <B>heavily fined</B> by the Brussels Commission for non-compliance with financial and sanitary regulations in the sector.

<p>Responsibility for the ensuring that this sector operates legally falls to the European Executive, the Commission.  The mechanism known as "intervention stocks" exists to cushion over-production. The goods are preserved until such time as there is a demand. Abuse is widespread. Fines for abuse are proportional to the level of fraud.  Policing the system operates simply: inspectors run spot checks, report their findings and when fraud is uncovered, estimate what is owed to EU.  A "correction" is duly levvied.

<p>All fairly straightforward up to this point.  But, from here, the picture clouds over somewhat. Fixing the fines is so serious a matter that the ultimate decision is made at top level by the College of  Commissioners themselves (20 including President Jacques Santer). And this is where the chaos sets in as lobbying errupts on the scene.  Individual member states dispatch their most able negotiators to Brussels with instructions to threaten, promise, curry and cajole EU officials <B>into reducing their penalties</B>.

<p>And so it was Ireland's and Britain's good fortune that their efforts paid off.  Faced with the uncomfortable prospect of forking out Irish punt 74 263 567.- (rumoured to equal the country's total contribution into the EAGGF budget!) Ireland succeeded in getting 24 020 455.- deducted, leaving a less fearful 50 243 112.- to pay. Ireland currently holds the EU presidency.<P>

  Preparations for such a mandate begin three years in advance and entail regular close contacts with Brussels. Ireland took maximum advantage of this to bend the Commission's ear, according to observers on the scene. During this run up period officials from the little country would discuss nothing but the daunting fine.  Only when a solution which suited them was offered could other business proceed. The UK must have used effective bargaining tactics too because a hefty reduction of 7 475 778.-to  4 983 852.- from an initial 12 459 630.- was negotiated.  Less fortunate were, France and Italy who were faced with immovable amounts, respectively  FF 189 379 759.- and It Lira 54 927 174 195.-.

<p>Before taking an <B>eye-opening glance at the misdeeds done to earn such penalties</B> (see excerpts of Summary Repor below), the context of intervention and the European Agriculture Guarantee and Guidance Fund (EAGGF) need to be understood.  EAGGF is the principle Fund of the EEC,  it was created in April 1962 as the financial instrument of the Common Agriculture Policy.  It has no judicial character of its own, the Commission manages it. A very significant part of the European Community general budget : 49% in 1995 is taken up by the EAGGF.  The guarantee activity finances interventions within the internal market (to guarantee producers minimum prices) and provides export restitutions for goods sold to countries outside the EU. 

<p>The revealing excerpt below, regarding <B>Beef and Veal public storage</B>, is taken from the European Commission's latest Summary Report on the results of inspections concerning the clearance of the EAGGF Guarantee section.  It refers to accounts for 1992 and of some expenditure for 1993.  The document is internal.  The excerpt relates to only one aspect of the EAGGF budget.

<p>Meat going into intervention may be kept there indefinitely, experts at the Commission say.  But the quality of meat gradually diminishes the longer it is kept frozen.  The meat can be stored boned or deboned according to specifications agreed with each member state. Carcases are stored in halves or quarters. (Weight of quarter carcases vary depending whether they are hind or fore quarters.)  Deboned meat must be packaged according to procedures designed to limit fraud....
 

<p>

<H3><CENTER>EXCERPT OF SUMMARY REPORT</CENTER></H3>
The European Commission ... Brussels 27.03.96<p>

Quality of the Public storage of beef and veal

<p>IRELAND

<p>In 1990 the EAGGF investigated public storage of beef and veal in Ireland.  The Irish monitoring system was based on "permanent presence" and presented a number of basic flaws :<p>
<PRE>
- no effective monitoring of the goods during storage;
- no lightning inspections;
- no administrative or contractual penalties where traders failed to meet their obligations;
- no staff rotation in sensitive areas, which inevitably reduced their independence and impaired the effectiveness of the entire monitoring procedure as a result.</PRE>

<p>Fears that such an inadequate system for monitoring public beef storage might lead to fraud and irregularities were heightened by the fact that an identical system with all the same flaws had led the Commission to make a correction on private storage in the 1989 clearance of accounts.

<p>The Commission began its inspections on bones and bone-in meat in March and April 1990. These investigations were followed by checks in 1991 on boned meat and carcases in Ireland, then on a consignment of boned meat in Italy in 1992 and lastly on tonnes of bone-in meat stored in Netherlands (four centres) in 1993.

<p>2. Findings

<p>The EAGGF's findings during these checks were notified to the Irish authorities in a series of letters (five in all).  The main points highlighted were :<p>

<PRE>- inadequacies of the "permanent presence" systems as the only means of control;
- the Irish acceptance procedure caused classification problems that resulted in the buying-in of ineligible goods;
- the Irish instructions on boning and their interpretation did not comply with the Community  rules and led as a result to the inclusion of ineligible goods in the cartons of boned meat;
- no real explanation was provided for the differences in yield upon boning noted between                  public and private storage.</PRE>

<p>All the above was explained in detail to the Irish authorities by letter in September 1991, July   1992, November 1992, May 1993 and January 1994.  Two bilateral meetings were held in May   1993 and July 1994, the latter concentrating in particular on the outcome of the inspections   undertaken in the Netherlands in 1993 and in the differences in yield which have still not been   satisfactorily explained by the Irish authorities.

<p>
3. Anomalies detected

<p>The Commission reached the following conclusions, based on the various checks and analyses carried out :

<p>- The Irish monitoring system, based on "permanent presence" was unable to ensure                             satisfactory protection of the Community funds (point 1.6 below).

<ol><li>- The same inadequacies revealed in 1989/90 in the private storage sector led to the same                    abuses in the public sector, i.e. an almost systematic increase in carton weight through the                inclusion of ineligible merchandise.

<li>- The Irish acceptance procedure did not comply with Community rules and regulations.  The  shortcomings in the classification procedure were obvious: they were especially highlighted  during the checks carried out in Italy in 1992 and in the Netherlands in 1993.  The ineligibility rate (85% in one centre) found during this latter check was unacceptable.

<li>- The number of inspections carried out on the work of some 15 slaughterhouses is sufficiently representative for the EAGGF to draw conclusions (a scrutiny of 657 quarters, 70% of which were ineligible and 50% of the cartons of meat boned in Ireland and Italy and                         representing several contracts were found not to conform).

<LI>- The Irish instructions on boning, and in particular the national authorities' interpretation of  "identifiable piece of meat" did not comply with the Community rules and regulations.  The result was an inevitable breach of Article 22(2) of Regulation (EEC) N 859/89 and the                 inclusion of ineligible goods in the cartons (as had already been noted in the case of private             storage).  This can be confirmed by the photographs taken.

<LI>- The Irish authorities were unable to explain the substantial difference recorded between                   public and private storage as regards the yields obtained upon boning.  The explanation                  offered that the differences could be explained by stricter instructions for intervention are               unsatisfactory and run counter to the evidence, which is that the commercial instructions are  stricter than those for intervention.  Furthermore, the yield differences obtained in private  storage (between 73 and 77%) when compared with similar yields in public storage (most  firms achieve 68%) add wieght to the belief that a practice was widespread whereby boners deliberately obtained only the minimum 68%. The conclusions of the Special Tribunal support the EAGGF analysis in this regard. (pages 525 and 526).

<LI>- The outcome of the Article 9 investigations carried out in several Member States in                         particular those carried out in Ireland, demonstrated that the monitoring of goods bought in           was unsatisfactory.  This led the Commission to revise its rules on intervention by means of            Regulation (EEC) N 2456/93, which should result in a significant change in Irish                           monitoring procedures.</ol>

<p>For the above reasons, the Commission has concluded that the Irish authorities did not fulfil their obligations in 1990-91 pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70.

<p>5. <B>The Conclusions of the Special Tribuna</B>

<p>The Special Tribunal included in its report under 'Recommendations' the comments made by the Director of the EAGGF as regards the inadequacies of the "permanent presence" system.  The Tribunal considers the amendments contained in Regulation (EEC N 2456/93 eminently advisable.  The new Regulation led the national authorities to carry out a complete overhaul of the monitoring procedures in several key sectors.  As regards the problem relating to yields, the Tribunal established that the companies in the xxxxx group operated on the basis that, once the minimum threshold of 68% had been reached, the quantities of meat left over from the boning operations became their property.  This practice was followed semi-officially under the monitoring and surveillance arrangements then in force in Ireland.

<p>6. Correction

<p>A correction is necessary because in 1990-91 the Irish authorities did not fulfil their obligations under Articles 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70.  The weaknesses inherent in the monitoring system occurred in areas considered essential by the Commission.  Furthermore, anomalies had already been reported for 1991 in summary report VI/320/94.  Very large amounts had been wrongly charged to the Fund as a result.

<p>As the loss suffered by the EAGGF cannot be measured accurately, it is necessary to make a flat-rate assessment which, in view of the efforts made by the Irish authorities to improve their monitoring system, will amount to 10% of the expenditure charged to the Community budget for 1990 and 1991 in respect of the public storage of beef and veal.

<p>After carefully examining the report of the Conciliation Body of 21.11.1995 on case 95/IR/013, the Commission considered that the proposed correction for 1990 should be maintained, in view of the gravity of the deficiencies found during their controls and that for 1991 fixed at 5%, in view of the measures taken during that year to improve the effectiveness and reliability of controls and the consequent lesser risk of irregularities.



<p>TOTAL 1990:						          26 222 656.62 IRL

<p>		TOTAL 1990 + 1991:		50 243 112.26 IRL
		<HR>


<p>
<B><CENTER>ITALY</CENTER></B>

<p>In 1990 the EAGGF began an investigation in Italy  into the public storage of beef and veal. In view of the deficiencies in the organization of buying-in and the anomalies detected, a second mission took place in 1991.  The findings made during the on-site scrutiny of the goods were confirmed when goods left storage as part of the humanitarian aid operation for Bulgaria (Regulation (EEC) N 843/91) and sales to the former Soviet Union (Regulation (EEC) N 1187/91) and Brazil (Regulation (EEC) N 910/91).

<p>The Italian authorities were informed of the investigation results in letter N 30509 of 7 October 1992 from the Director-General for Agriculture.  A bilateral meeting was held in Brussels on 15 and 16 March 1993 during which the Italian authorities responded to the Commission's findings and submitted a plan to improve their buying-in procedures.  Their responses were officially sent by letter N 1573, dated 19 May 1993, from the Director-General of AIMA.  The Director of the EAGGF replied by letter N 1549 3 January 1994 in which he said that AIMA's replies were <B>unsatisfactory</B>.

2. Inadequacy of checks

<p>Responsibility for checks had been delegated in its entirety to the professional body AIA.  AIMA did not check to see whether the responsibilities  delegated were properly carried out.  Auxiliary staff with links to the meat industry were frequently used to carry out the checks; their independence could not therefore be assured.  Some of the staff were not sufficiently qualified to carry out buying-in. Responsibility for boning operations was entirely delegated to the intervention centres, without monitoring.  The monitored were thus their own monitors.

<p>3. Buying-in of ineligible goods

<p>The following anomalies were detected during the on-the-spot goods inspection:

<OL><LI>- removal of the health stamp, leading to the conclusion that the merchandise was not of                Community origin.  5.13% of the consignments examined in 1991;
<LI>- buying-in of ineligible merchandise (class, conformation, degree of fat cover) 40% in 1990,         35.5% in 1991);
<LI>- reclassification of the goods by falsifying the classification of origin and using highly                    exaggerated health documents (22.58% of the consignments inspected in 1991);
<LI>- overclassification: 30% in 1990; 9.1% in 1991:
<LI>- acceptance of goods that did not comply with the instructions laid down in Annex III to              Regulation (EEC) N 859/89;
<LI>- inadequate freezing;
<LI>- inadequate dressing;</OL>

<p>5. Conclusions

<p>All of the findings in Italy in 1990 and 1991 show that the monitoring system then in place was unable to satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70.  In the case of 1991 in particular, the EAGGF regrets the light-handedness with which the German health and customs authorities treated goods leaving their territory, since some German traders took advantage of the inadequacies then pertaining in Italy.

<p>In 1990 to 1991 sales into Italian intervention of meat originating in Germany increased considerably (from a few thousand tonnes in 1990 to about <B>80 000 tonnes</B> in 1991). Some of this merchandise was of doubtful origin, because health stamps had been cut out and the original classification of numerous carcases had been removed.  Much of the merchandise in question did not meet criteria applicable for German intervention and was accompanied by health certificates which had clearly been altered.  It is hardly imaginable that these facts could have passed unnoticed by either the health or customs authorities, given the quantities involved.

<p>6. Correction

<p>The inadequacies in the monitoring system occurred in areas that the Commission deems essential. Furthermore, anomalies had already been reported for 1991 in summary report VI/320/94.  Very large sums had been wrongly charged to the Fund as a result. As the loss sustained by the EAGGF cannot be measured accurately, it was decided to make a flat-rate assessment.  In view of the Italian authorities' efforts, the proposed correction amounts to 10% of the expenditure on public beef and veal storage charged to the Fund for 1990 and 1991, as follows:

<p>Total for 1990:				        	        7 002 348 655 LIT



<p>		TOTAL 1990 + 1991:	54 927 174 195 LIT


<p>
<B><CENTER>FRANCE</CENTER></B>
<p>In 1992 the EAGGF investigated the public storage of beef and veal in France.  The findings made during the investigations were notified to the French authorities by letter from the Director-General for Agriculture N 3179 of 20 January 1993.  The French authorities replied in note N 1125 of 23 July 1993. In his letter of N 34350 of 19 October 1993,  the Director-General for Agriculture noted that the replies sent were unsatisfactory.  Two bilateral meetings were held in Brussels on 21 January 1994 and 23 March 1994.  A technical meeting was held in Paris on 25 April 1994.

<p>The following shortcomings were highlighted :

<OL><LI>- no check on the dates the animals delivered into intervention were slaughtered;
- no check as to the Community origin of the animals;
<LI>- the buying-in stations were badly organized; as a result the buying-in staff were unable to            make rigorous checks on the weight of the carcases submitted;
<LI>- inadequate ex-post checks;
<LI>- no check upon exit;
<LI>- storage was badly organized; transfer warehouses were unable to retrace the origin of the            merchandise as a result;
<LI>- there was no rotation of the buying-in staff.

<LI>- buying-in of ineligible goods (class, conformation, degree of fat cover);
<LI>- non-compliance with the instructions laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) N859/89;
<LI>- reclassification of the goods delivered by falsifying the classification of origin.
</OL>

<p>5. Conclusion

<p>The inadequacies and anomalies detected show that the system for buying beef and veal into intervention as operated in France in 1992 did not fulfil the requirements of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70.  The inadequacies related in particular to the monitoring arrangements, which the Commission deems to be of great importance.  Moreover, anomalies had already been reported for 1991 in summary report VI/320/94.

<p>6. Correction

<p>As the loss to the EAGGF cannot be calculated accurately, it has been decided to make a flat-rate assessment.  In view of the efforts of the French authorities to improve their buying-in and monitoring procedures, a correction amounting to 5% of the expenditure charged to the EAGGF for the public storage of beef and veal will be proposed by the Commission.
After carefully examining the report of the Conciliation Body of 21.11.1995 on case 95/IT/009, the Commission's services consider that the proposed corrections should be maintained, in view of the gravity of the deficiencies found during their controls.

<p>7. Specific irregularities

<p>The French authorities will initiate recovery proceedings against the trades involved in the irregularities detected during the EAGGF investigation.  They must follow the procedure laid down in Regulation (EEC) N 595/91.  The EAGGF will reserve its position on charging to the Community budget, as laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70, sums which have not been recovered.

<p>
<B><CENTER>UNITED KINGDOM</CENTER></B>

<p>In 1991 The EAGGF investigated the public storage of beef and veal in the United Kingdom.  The on-site checks were done in two phases: an examination of frozen meat and a selection of cartons to be thawed out (Northern Ireland: November 1991, Great Britain: February 1992); examination of the thawed-out cartons (NI: December 1992, GB: November 1992).

<p>When the EAGGF investigation was announced the UK authorities informed the EAGGF of irregularities it had discovered in the activities of xxxxxxx.  A second company was convicted of wrongdoing between the first phase of the investigation and the second.  The EAGGF agreed not to check the goods from these two companies, provided that the results of the national authorities' investigations were incorporated in the Commission's Article 9 investigation, since the financial consequences of the irregularities had to be examined in accordance with Articles 8 or Regulation (EEC) N 729/70.
<p>In June 1994 the Commission sent the UK authorities its conclusions, in particular as regards the management of buying-in.

<OL><LI>- Unsatisfactory classification procedures, particularly during significant buying-in periods;
<LI>- inadequate monitoring of warehouse entry operations, as attested to by several cases of                 substitution;
<LI>- inadequate checks on boning operations;
<LI>- checks during storage were almost non-existent;
<LI>- no check when the goods exited the warehouse.</OL>

<p>As a result of their discussions with the EAGGF in June 1992, the UK authorities undertook a radical overhaul of their monitoring arrangements.


<p>Four irregularities were detected by the UK authorities as a result of the investigation initiated by the EAGGF.  The scale of the irregularities illustrates the flaws in the system in force in the UK at that time.  The anomalies recorded in one of these cases were so varied they are likely to have a <B>major financial impact on the Fund</B>.  They will be dealt with under the procedure provided for in Articles 3 and 5 of Regulation (EEC) N 595/91.  The national authorities have yet to inform the Commission of the quantities involved, the contracts in question and the exact nature of the fraudulent practices uncovered.  it is not yet possible, therefore, to draw any conclusions as to the financial consequences under Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70.

<p>4. Anomalies detected

<OL><LI>- non-compliance with the rule of "first-in, first-out".

<LI>- some undertakings, a list of which has been supplied to the UK authorities, did not comply             with the Community rules on packaging;
<LI>- some undertakings (list supplied) did not comply with the Community rules on freezing                  (presence of exudates);
<LI>- the integrity of the sample selected by the Commission for examination once thawed out was         not maintained by the national authorities.  The sampling carried out was partly invalidated as    a   result.</OL>

<p>The UK authorities replied to the EAGGF's observations by letter dated 4 October 1994.  The replies, which ran counter to the official written instructions from the UK intervention agency, were <B>deemed unsatisfactory</B> by the Commission.

<p>In view of the UK authorities' failure to fulfil their obligations under Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70, a flat-rate correction will be applied.  The shortcomings in the monitoring system then in force in the UK occurred in areas that the Commission considers important. Furthermore, anomalies had already been notified for 1991 in summary report VI/320/94.  In view of the efforts made by the UK authorities to improve the monitoring procedures, <B>5% of all expenditure on intervention in the UK has been withheld.</B>

<p>Following the conciliation procedure (report of  21.11.1995 on case 95/UK/011), and taking into account the results of a reexamination of the British control system (in particular the frequency and the organisation of controls in Northern Ireland), and on the basis of criteria laid down in document N VI/216/93, the Commission's services consider that the proposed correction <B>can be reduced to 2%.</B>

<p>The irregularities notified in accordance with the precedure laid down in Regulation (EEC) N 595/91 will be dealt with separately.  The EAGGF <B>reserves its position</B> in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) N 729/70 as regards charging to the Community budget sums that have not been recovered from the traders concerned.

<HR><H3><CENTER><A NAME="Agenda">Agenda</A> of EP BSE Inquiry</CENTER></H3>
<pre>Thu, 25 Jul 1996<p>

<STRONG>1.1 The BSE problem</STRONG><P>

BSE, the so-called "mad-cow disease" was identified for the the first time
in the UK in 1986. since 1988, more than 160 000 confirmed cases of BSE have
been identified in British herds, according to figures supplied by the UK in
May 1996.

Cases of BSE have also been reported in France, Ireland, Portugal and
Switzerland.

A number of preventive measures have been enacted in the UK since 1988 and
at the level of the Union since 1990.

Since 1990 the European Parliament has adopted several resolutions related
to BSE and has made a number of proposals with a view to eradication of the
disease.

In March 1996, the independent body advising the UK Government on matters
related to BSE published new information on the recent appearance of certain
atypical cases of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in the UK and stated that in the
absence of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation was at
present that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE.

On 22 March 1996, the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union
recognized the need to review the adequacy of the current Community measures
in the light of the new information; the committee also recognized that the
risk of spread of BSE could be further reduced by excluding from the food
chain animals most likely to have been exposed to infection.

On 27 March 1996, the Commission adopted decision 96/239/EC which prohibits
exports from the UK to the other Member States and non-Member countries of
live bovine animals slaughtered in the UK, a number of products obtained
from bovine animals slaughtered in the UK as well as bone meal.  On this
occasion, the Commission stated that the risk of transmission of BSE to man
could not be excluded.

On 11 June 1996, the preventive measures imposed by Commission decision
96/239/EC were partially relaxed.  The export ban with regard to bovine
semen was lifted.  On other products (essentially gelatine and tallow) the
lifting of the export ban was made subject to the application of certain
manufacturing measures.  This new decision also requires the Commission to
carry out Community inspections, before exports of tallow or gelatine may be
resumed.

On 16 July 1996, following an invitation by the European Parliament, the
President of the Commission, Jacques SANTER, and the Commissioner
responsible for Agriculture, Franz FISCHLER, made declarations on the
Commission's information policy on BSE since 1988 and measures it has taken
to ensure compliance with the export ban and to eradicate the disease.

<STRONG>1.2 Current problems</STRONG>

The are significant indications that the BSE problem has not been managed
with the necessary vigilance by the Commission or the national authorities
in their responsibility for monitoring the activities of economic operators
and that the measures and initiatives taken have not proved sufficient to
protect the health of the public in the European Union and effectively to
combat 'mad cow disease'.

- According to an internal Commission document published in the press the
Commission underestimated its duty to inform the Member States in an
appropriate manner about the risks connected with BSE and encouraged one
Member State no longer to publish its research findings.

- Recent press revelations indicate that the export ban imposed by the
Commission on 27 March 1996 has not been observed by certain Member States.
The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, is currently carrying
out investigations to shed light on these allegations.

- Although the British Government banned the sale, in July 1988, of feeding
stuffs for ruminants containing ruminant protein, the Council did not
adopted the first measures in this connection until 1990.  Moreover, the
European Parliament had called on the Commission as early as 1990 to bring
forward a proposal with a view to prohibiting the use as animal feed of
animal protein recycled from carcases.

- Further to a technological change in the manufacturing process of meal of
animal origin, the disease seems to have appeared without the Member States
or the Commission taking the precaution of effectively ascertaining the
harmlessness of these new processes and the practices of the businesses
concerned.

<STRONG>1.3 The aim of the temporary committee of inquiry</STRONG>

The aim of the temporary committee of inquiry is to establish the facts
about these allegations and the implications for the various authorities and
operators without prejudice to the juirisdiction of the Community and
national courts.  The Commission may, where appropriate, formulate
recommendations as provided in Article 4(3) or the decision of the European
Parliament, the Council and the Commissiosn of 19 April 1995 on the detailed
provisions governing the exercise of the European Parliament's right of
inquiry and in Rule 136(10) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure.

<STRONG>2. Explanatory statement</STRONG>

<STRONG>2.1 Attitude of the Commission towards the dissemination of information
about BSE.</STRONG>

In the abovementioned internal Commission document the conclusion is drawn
that it is necessary to 'practice disinformation' with regard to BSE and
that 'it was better to say that the press has a tendency to exaggerate'.
The committee of inquiry will investigate whether and to what extent this
attitude was generally characteristic of the action taken by the Commission
and the relevant Member States with regard to the real data relating to the
spread of BSE and to their duties from the point of view of Community law as
regards the protection of the health of European consumers and the necessary
checks on the relevant products within the internal market.

It will also consider the implications and repercussions on the Member
States' administrations and the national supervisory and research departments.

<STRONG>2.2 Publication of research findings about BSE</STRONG>

The Committee of inquiry will verify whether the Member States'
administrations, individuals or other bodies were the subject of enticements
or recommendations to the effect that they should not disclose the
information in their possession about the nature and seriousness of the
disease and the development of relevant scientific knowledge.

<STRONG>2.3 Controls on the production and exports of recycled animal protein</STRONG>

In July 1988 the British Government prohibited the sale of cattle feed
containing cattle protein.  Subsequently the United Kingdom reportedly
continued to export animal protein recycled from carcases to the other
Member States and to third countries.  These exports, to France in
particular, allegedly increased substantially after the use of these animal
proteins was prohibited on the British market.

The Committee of inquiry will check the measures taken to control the
quality and distribution of animal feed by the competent departments in the
Commission and the Member States following the introduction of new
manufacturing processes for meal of animal origin in the United Kingdom and
in other Member States.

<STRONG>2.4 Controls on the temporary ban on exports of cattle, beef and meat-based
products</STRONG>

The Commission's decision of March 1996 to ban the export of beef from the
United Kingdom to the other Member States and to third countries is
apparently not being observed.  The committee of inquiry will review the
effectiveness of administrative checks at Mamber State level.

<STRONG>3. Brief of the temporary committee of inquiry</STRONG>

The temporary committee of inquiry will be set up in order to clarify the
nature and causes of the alleged infringement or maladministration of the
application of Community law by the competent authorities of the European
Union and the Member States with regard to BSE, without prejudice to the
jurisdiction of the Community and national courts.

It will identify any malfunctioning and will formulate conclusions in the
light of the requirements of public health.  It will recommend improvements
as regards in particular

- the transparency of the policy to combat BSE through the widest possible
dissemination of relevant research data and findings,
- the procedures for monitoring the ban on exports of the products in question,
- the adoption of all relevant measures for the protection of public health
and the restoration of the smooth operation of the markets.

<STRONG>4. Duration of the temporary committee of inquiry</STRONG>

The temporary committee of inquiry will submit its report within three
months of the publication of the European Parliament's decision setting up
the committee.

<STRONG>Questions:</STRONG> <BR>
who is ever going to buy and eat substandard, mislabelled
meat warehoused from the bse era?  <BR>
How long does the EU hold it and  do they
incinerate it?

<STRONG>Answer:</STRONG><BR>
 Since when does the consumer have a choice?<BR>

Meat in intervention can only be kept 3 months
if it is to be resold as pure raw meat, 6 months if it is to be integrated into stuff; pies,
bolognaise, prepackaged fast food etc., and 9 months = pet food.
<P>


But at the Commission they tell me it can be kept "INDEFINITELY, saying there is  meat holed up
in there dating back to the WAR!!!!
