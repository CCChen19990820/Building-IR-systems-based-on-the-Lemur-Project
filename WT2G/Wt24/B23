<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Reflections on Equity</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="../bios/ahilliar.htm">Asa G. Hilliard III</A></H3>
<HR>

<P><I><B>Every child has the right to play on a level playing field with other children.  But in education, the field often is tilted in favor of the affluent, white suburban child.  Technological hardware and software and well-paid, well-trained teachers are hard to come by in the inner city.  Asa Hilliard thinks we can change that.  First, he says, educators must raise their expectations for cultural minority children.</B></I></P>
<BR>

<P>Equity issues in instructional technology are very simple and straightforward: Who gets to play? What is the impact on students of the game that is to be played?</P>

<P>There is nothing in the characteristics of cultural minority children that requires that they be analyzed to determine their fitness to be served by technology. Rather, it is the delivery system that must be examined to determine if the distribution of high quality services is indeed equitable.</P>

<P><B>Attitude Adjustment</B></P>

<P>For years I have been involved in the study of the education of low-performing groups, most of whom tend to be cultural minority groups, as well as economically impoverished groups, minority or majority. During the entire course of those years, I have observed a fundamental paradigm problem among educators. The problem is that, in general, educational thinking has been driven by invalid and scandalously low estimates of the basic intellectual capabilities of the mass of our students, especially those from cultural minority groups.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3asa2.gif" align=right hspace=10>Most educators have assumed that most of the things schools teach in the college preparatory curriculum are beyond the intellectual level of the majority of students. Therefore, they have designed structures to fit the low expectations they have of children. The evidence for this assertion is to be found in the almost universal use of tracking and in the over-enrollment of students from some cultural minority groups into special education programs. Not surprisingly, the existing structures do produce the results that are expected. As Thomas Skirtic points out in his 1991 article, &#147;The Special Education Paradox: Equity as the Way to Excellence,&#148; in <I>Harvard Educational Review</I>, the existing structures provide neither the quality of exposure nor the quality of nurture that would guarantee the kinds of achievement and socialization outcomes that children are capable of reaching.</P>

<P>I have argued in other places that we can explain most of the variations in children's academic and social performance by reference to the quality of instruction and nurture they receive from home, school, and community. I have further argued that even if home and community are unable and sometimes unwilling to meet their obligations, schools can and have filled in to meet the education and socialization needs of children. This is not a matter of speculation but a matter of record.*</P>

<P><SMALL>(*See <I>Unusually Effective Schools: A Review and Analysis of Research and Practice</I> (1990), by Daniel U. Levine; and Barbara Sizemore's chapter, &#147;The Algebra of African-American Achievement,&#148; in <I>Effective Schools: Critical Issues in the Education of Black Children</I> (1989).)</SMALL></P>

<P>Many of us have seen children of all colors, shapes, sizes, and income levels as they descend upon commercial video arcades and consume, within the limits of their income levels, the &#147;educational&#148; challenges there. Yet I know of no one who has suggested that cultural, racial, economic, or other differences account for the child's learning or enjoyment of these technological applications. Children are quite equal in the arcade, as they could be in the schools. They need no &#147;head start&#148; or &#147;handicap.&#148; They only need a chance.</P>

<P>When the appropriate quality of instructional services is provided, excellence-level outcomes appear. For the mass of our children, an intellectual genius exists&#151;even under conditions of extreme deprivation&#151;that will enable them to master all of the intellectual tasks that constitute an excellence-level education agenda. To be specific, virtually all students are capable of achieving the level of excellence reflected in such statements of objectives as found in The College Board's <I>Academic Preparation for College: What Students Need to Know and Be Able to Do</I>. All that is required is appropriate professional service, not extraordinary service. The simple fact is, the mass of our children never are exposed to the quality of service that all have a right to expect.</P>

<P><B>Questions of Access</B></P>

<P>As we view the wonder of technology unfolding before our eyes, it is clear that some homes, as some schools, are loaded with the latest in high-tech hardware and software. Of course, very few of these serve African-American, Hispanic-American, or Native-American children. Well-prepared teachers of advanced technology and its applications are simply too expensive for even the largest school district to acquire in numbers sufficient to serve all students who can benefit from such technology and its applications. So, as Jonathan Kozol points out in his 1991 book, <I>Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools</I>, what we have, purely and simply, is an access problem. And that is a public policy issue. I fear, however, that the paradigm problem, with which we continue to suffer, will leave too many educators to argue that some children, such as the gifted, are more &#147;ready for&#148;&#151;and therefore are more entitled to&#151;high technology than are others.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3asa.gif" align=left hspace=10>The schools are already heavy consumers of technology. I am highly impressed with the increases in student achievement with appropriate use of IBM's Writing to Read and Writing to Write programs. I am often taken aback as I discover how quickly these and other software packages are being developed and applied on a wide-scale basis in schools.</P>

<P>Some of the interactive videodisc programs, such as Ulysses by IBM and the encyclopedia by Jostens Learning Corporation, are nothing short of awesome in their potential for use by skilled teachers to enhance the quality of instruction. This powerful teaching and learning has emerged in some cases totally outside the formal school system. Many of these and other advanced technologies, such as simulators, have been used widely in industry and in the military for teaching and learning.</P>

<P>In the past decade, we have seen a majestic growth of the linking of institutions and individuals in intricate communications networks. The world of bulletin boards, of Prodigy and CompuServe, of library search services, such as Lexis/Nexis/Medis, has democratized the whole information enterprise among those who have access to it. Yet this spectacular expanded national and even international networking is an invisible world to most Americans.</P>

<P><B>Designing a Level Playing Field</B></P>

<P>Hardware combined with software can help educators to level the playing field for the millions of children that we serve. A spell check or a grammar check on the computer provides consistent, nonarbitrary feedback to writers from the most expert teachers. In fact, I am more impressed with the innovations in software than I am with the hardware itself.</P>

<P>I was excited, for example, to find a software package that teaches calculus and enables me to review my mathematics (some of it poorly learned in the first place), and to do so in the privacy of my own library, at my own pace. Frozen into this pedagogically sophisticated software is the work of a great mathematical mind and a skilled teacher, available 24 hours a day on an equal basis to any student who has access. The work of the minds of designers of software for the 1990s is something to behold.</P>

<P>Content of the software is a major concern**. Who is writing the software? What is their choice of content? What is their background for selecting content to be included? Neither the computer hardware nor the software format can allow distortion of the material. The make-up of the design group is of critical concern if equity issues are to be confronted.</P>

<P><SMALL>(**See Bowers, C.A., <I>The Cultural Dimensions of Educational Computing: Understanding the Non-Neutrality of Technology,</I> New York: Teachers College Press, 1988.)</SMALL></P>

<P>There is a fantastic potential for technology if the software is based on sound pedagogy, as Paul Pipitone argues in a recent article in <I>Headlines</I>. If pedagogical specialists do indeed understand the dynamics of mental functioning, and if they respond to these applications in a sophisticated way, we may actually be able to raise the general level of intelligence of the whole population. Knowing patterns and preferences of thinking, the designers of software can make their products not only user friendly but also user natural. Therefore, cultural sophistication must be a requirement for designers.</P>

<P><B>Teachers as &#147;Software&#148;</B></P>

<P>Equity and software must be thought of at another level having nothing directly to do with either the hardware or the commercial software, for those who guide the uses of those things are themselves &#147;software.&#148;</P>

<P>Teachers, the decision makers about the use of technology in the schools, present a whole other array of potential equity problems. Perhaps the greatest problem in this area has to do with staff development to ensure that equally talented teachers are available to all the children. This is certainly not the case now. Many teachers, though well-endowed intellectually, often experience more problems than their students do because they harbor a long-term fear of technology.</P>

<P>It is absolutely essential that we respond as we did in the 1960s and 1970s to urgent national instructional needs. This nation must mobilize to provide training opportunities for teachers to learn, among other things, the vast range of educational software that is available to them. They must learn strategies for using this technology effectively in their classrooms. Unevenness in the exposure of teachers to instructional technology will result in an even greater unevenness in results of the use of technology with children in schools.</P>

<P>Fearful and unprepared teachers will misuse or will fail to use available technology. They, like their students, are an important audience for whatever it is that we have to say.</P>

<P><B>Challenge to Change</B></P>

<P>Educators have been too slow to mobilize. I know that this sounds unduly critical, especially in view of the wide expansion of the use of technology in the schools. Yet, in my opinion, what we have done so far is merely a drop in the bucket compared to what we must do. The child of African, Hispanic, Asian, Native, or European descent, whether rich or poor, must have an equal opportunity to be exposed to the intellectual wealth that resides in the practice of technology. All of these children&#151;not some&#151;must experience technology at all of its levels, from drill and practice to systems analysis.</P>

<P>The great Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget described an intellectual world in which learners developed to the point of thinking about thinking. Those who shared a pessimistic paradigm then began to separate the world into those who could think and those who could think about thinking; there were &#147;concrete&#148; and &#147;abstract&#148; thinkers. Of course, these are false dichotomies in the real world. Similarly, in the case of technology, those children normally falling on the bottom must be engaged in the use of advanced technology at levels normally thought to be the exclusive preserve of the gifted.</P>

<P>With technology as a partner, we now have the language and the vehicles to confront some of the perennial equity issues in a new way, a way in which deliberate or unconscious inequity is hard to hide.</P>

<P>The children I see in the ghettos of America don't need therapy and remediation. They need dedicated mentors, advocates, friends, and peers who will collaborate with them in unleashing their intellectual hunger and capabilities. As we draw closer to these children, appropriate uses of new technologies can make us less mechanical and more human. Inappropriate uses will make us slaves of ignorance or prisoners of algorithms.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Of Tinkertoys, Technology, and the Educational Encounter</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="..\bios\jschwart.htm">Judah L. Schwartz</A></H3>
<HR>

<P><B><I>The only thing that's new about technology in education is the technology. Education has been going on for a long, long time. But what do we really know about what happens or should happen when teaching and learning occur? Educator Judah Schwartz says that only by trying to answer this question can we think about the ways technology affects the transaction we call learning.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>How can technology affect learning? How should it? In trying to answer these questions, we had better first turn our attention to the nature of the learning process. We have to start by thinking about what I call the educational encounter, an event that takes place whenever there is a setting in which someone is trying to teach and someone is trying to learn. For the learner, the experience is an encounter because the other entity&#151;either an animate one such as a teacher or a colleague, or an inanimate one such as a book or a video&#151;can trigger a process that leads to the acquisition of information, the development of skills, the solving of a problem, or the creating of new knowledge.</P>

<H4>The Educational Encounter</H4>
<P>This encounter has several characteristics&#151;some occurring sequentially, some simultaneously&#151;but all of which are present at some time in all encounters that are truly educational. These characteristics are exposition, exploration, challenge, assessment, and motivation.</P>

<UL TYPE =DISC>
<LI><P><B>Exposition</B>. It takes the form of information conveyed by the teacher or a textbook to a student and often gets the encounter started. But such statements of information are effective only if they appear to students to be in the context of some question of theirs that requires an answer. Students rarely learn well or truly master new skills unless what is presented to them appears in the context of a question they
have posed for themselves or had posed for them in a way to capture their attention. For this reason, the issue of exposition is intimately linked to the issue of motivation.</P>

<LI><P><B>Exploration</B>. It is something we rarely permit our youngsters to do in the formal educational encounters that we have in schools. Exploration involves allowing students to roam the intellectual terrain finding connections for themselves. Aimless roaming can, of course, be counterproductive, and our overwhelming reaction to the fear of aimless roaming is not to permit it at all. But there is another way to cope with our fear. We could provide guidance to our emerging roaming intellectuals by posing thoughtful challenges for them to bear in mind as they traverse the landscape of the discipline we are asking them to study.</P>

<LI><P><B>Challenge</B>. It is intimately connected to exposition and exploration. Let me explain how they work together. Suppose you give children sets of Tinkertoys and tell them to build whatever they like. You show the various kinds of building blocks in the set and explain how they may be joined to one another. That's exposition. The children will explore the possibilities of the materials. Many of them will construct quite interesting things, but some will randomly poke dowels into hubs and end up with little more than dowels poked into hubs. Some people find free exploration frustrating and even frightening.</P>

<P>It could be much more interesting to provide the children with a good set of challenges. Clearly, they can build a cube, which could be a model for a house, out of eight hubs and twelve sticks. But can they enclose a three-dimensional volume using fewer hubs and sticks? What is the smallest number of hubs and sticks that can be used to enclose a three-dimensional volume? Or, can they build a Tinkertoy bridge strong enough to support a 20-pound dictionary? What about a 60-pound classmate?</P>

<P>Not all challenges are good. A challenge that doesn't permit students to judge for themselves whether they've succeeded in addressing it is, in my view, dumb. For example, if I challenge you to use a calculator to find the product of 37 and 563, that's pointless. On the other hand, if I tell you to build a Tinkertoy bridge that can hold a dictionary, you don't need me to tell you when you've succeeded. You can test your results right away. An intelligent challenge permits you to judge whether or not you've met it.</P>

<LI><P><IMG SRC="2schwart.gif"align=right hspace=10><B>Assessment</B>. When you test your bridge by piling books on it, you are involved in assessment, a necessary and essential part of any educational encounter. Like Janus, assessment has two faces. Instructors need to know whether they are succeeding and whether and what their students are learning. This is the traditional and classic face of assessment. More important for a successful educational encounter, however, is getting students to ask of themselves, &#147;How well am I learning this?&#148; or &#147;Do I really understand this?&#148; In a deep sense, education has failed if these questions aren't asked.  We all need to internalize the habit of asking, &#147;How do I devise a test for myself to see if I can do this?&#148;</P>

<LI><P><B>Motivation</B>. It must be involved in any educational encounter. Students come to learning with a mixture of motives. Some of them, at least some of the time, may engage in education to satisfy a genuine personal need, a hunger for knowledge or competence. Many students, however, are motivated by a range of external pressures ranging from the need to get into college or to get a job, to an awareness of the emotional investment of some other person&#151;most often a parent&#151;in their achievement.</P>
</UL>

<P>We need to be aware of these characteristics of educational encounters as we consider critically (and not necessarily negatively) educational innovations, both technological and other. Whenever we attempt to modify the educational encounter in some way, whether by the adoption of a new teaching technique or a new technology, we should ask ourselves, &#147;How can and should this new element affect exposition, exploration, assessment, and motivation?&#148; When we consider the potential effects of an educational innovation, we also must consider the idiosyncratic strengths and weaknesses of that innovation. When we think about the role of technology in education, therefore, we must both evaluate its effect on each characteristic of the educational encounter and remind ourselves of several issues that are specific to technology. We need to consider the subject matter being taught, what students and teachers bring to the encounter, and how the characteristics of different technologies can shape the encounter in various ways.</P>

<H4>A Match Game</H4>
<P>All technologies do not benefit all areas of inquiry equally well. Some subject areas have a natural affinity for certain technologies and little to gain from others. For example, the computer is a wonderful tool for math and science. And the study of music has gained immeasurably from the technology of sound recording and reproduction. I believe that print is still the technology of choice for the study of literature, although I am certain that students' understanding of <I>King Lear</I> is greatly enhanced when they can see several different interpretations on videocassette. Estimating the usefulness of a particular technology for a subject area involves the educational ideology of the researcher, teacher, or administrator. Most literary scholars would argue that computers are unlikely to provide them with genuine literary insight. Others seek illumination about an author's intention by ranking words in a text according to the number of uses. These people may legitimately claim that the computer is the essential ally of their literary analysis.</P>

<P>The point is, a sense of purpose has to underlie any decision about the use of technology. It makes about as much sense for a school to decide to use a poorly conceived instructional video series on math merely because it's available as it does to try to teach children to swim in a sandbox.</P>

<P>I will never forget the evening I heard the late historian, Barbara Tuchman, give a lecture entitled &#147;How I Write My Books.&#148; After greeting the audience, the very first sentence she uttered was, &#147;First you have to have an idea.&#148; The same admonition applies to the application of technology to education. It's foolishness to squeeze a subject area and a technology together in a Procrustean way.</P>

<H4>Students And Teachers</H4>
<P>Even when the technology and the subject matter are well suited to one another and there is a thoughtful approach to the match between the two, we must consider our students and our teachers.</P>

<P>Students come to learning from a great variety of backgrounds, with varying degrees of motivation and a great range of abilities. Some may respond quickly and well to the immediacy of video presentation; some may learn readily from impersonal, nonjudgmental computer software. Others may require constant one-on-one contact and encouragement from a teacher; still others may learn best in small-group interactions with their fellow students. Teachers know their students well and have to use their considered judgment.</P>

<P>In addition, teachers may have many problems implementing even the best-designed technologies. Traditionally, the school setting has not made the use of technology very easy. The VCR is at the other end of the building on a cart with a broken wheel; the cable that attaches it to the TV monitor is missing, or there's no extension cord to be found anywhere. A computer freezes up or crashes, and no one in the building is trained to troubleshoot. Using technology effectively can be a substantial logistical undertaking, and such problems can ultimately defeat the most well-intentioned projects.</P>

<H4>Technological Conversations</H4>
<P>Even when the user has a well-developed idea about the purpose of using a technology for a particular subject matter, and when its suitability for students and teachers has been established, we still have to look at the specific characteristics of an educational encounter mediated by technology.</P>

<P>First, there is the nature of the conversation. In a two-way conversation, each party responds to the other, and each response triggers another. Each party continually
grows or changes as a result of the ongoing interaction.</P>

<P>Even though it may not look like it&#151;or it may not be the response we were hoping for&#151;in an educational encounter, a student is always responding. Therefore, it's a mistake to talk about passive learning. As they read a book or watch a video, students continually make constructions and interpretations, but their constructions and interpretations have no effect on the expository sequence built into the work. Interactive videodiscs, on the other hand, permit us to see a limited form of interaction between student and medium. In response to input from the student, the sequence of images can be altered.</P>

<P>But interactive videodisc technology has its limits. Although there is a large number of distinct images on a videodisc&#151;and thus a large number of possible sequences of images&#151;the images themselves are frozen. Nothing the student does will cause the system to display an image that was not previously recorded on the videodisc.</P>

<P>The dominant use of computers in education occurs in a mode called Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI). In most CAI, the computer software is in control. It establishes the terms of the encounter, limiting the learner's vocabulary and choices. It asks; the learner answers&#151;and only in terms the computer accepts. Even when it is combined with an interactive videodisc, the software directs the interaction with the student.</P>

<P>Most of the time I abhor this use of technology. Granted, there are situations in which this kind of educational encounter is reasonable, but for me it's an issue of informed consent, of knowing what I'm getting into. I do not know how to touch-type, for example, and were I to actually want to learn to type properly, I admit that typing tutorial software can be very useful for practicing such a skill. But it's questionable whether such directed drill is really educational. It's certainly not creative.</P>

<P>Once we concede that a computer runs the encounter, we have to ask, &#147;How structured is the conversation? How prestructured is it?&#148;</P>

<P>No computer program is entirely open-ended, able to discuss variable mortgage rates with the viewer one moment, correct spelling or grammar the next, and then immediately go on to solve a problem in astrophysics. Every piece of computer software&#151;every technology, in fact&#151;operates in a specific and limited domain or environment. In that sense it is structured.</P>

<P>If the software runs a conversation that not only is structured but also is prestructured, it establishes a path that the learner must follow. Choices are often possible, but the consequences of each choice&#151;the branch in the path&#151;has been laid out in all details. Learners can never step off the path to explore the woods. And because the path has been laid out by someone else, they never experience discovery, or find or make what no one has found or made before.</P>

<H4>Intellectual Mirror Environments</H4>
<P>I suggest an alternative. Suppose you give a child a set of building blocks and say, &#147;Using only these blocks, try to build a structure that is both big enough for you to sit inside of and strong enough for your cat to walk on.&#148; If the child finds the challenge interesting, she can set to work in this open-ended, but nonetheless structured, environment. She can stack the blocks you have given her any way her imagination leads her. If the blocks have interesting shapes and colors, she will be enticed into exploration and experimentation. She and her playmates can decide for themselves when the challenge is met. The objects combined with interesting challenges constitute an environment that permits exploration and experimentation within a bounded, structured domain. It is possible to use the computer to do exactly the same thing with domains of subjects we teach in schools.</P>

<P>About a decade ago, a colleague and I began work on a computer software environment that similarly challenges students' creativity while they are working within the structured and bounded domain of Euclidean geometry. The GEOMETRIC SUPPOSER is what I call an intellectual mirror environment. It is a series of computer programs that deal with geometry and that allow&#151;indeed invite&#151;the user to explore and experiment. Just as the child's blocks do not by themselves pose problems, neither does the SUPPOSER. Just as the blocks, in conjunction with interesting challenges, provide an opportunity for invention, exploration, and problem posing and solving, so does the SUPPOSER.</P>

<P>Here is a standard problem situation. You are given a square, each side of which is marked in three equal segments. Some of these points are joined, and a new four-sided figure inside the square is formed. Geometry classes for hundreds of years have solved the problem of proving that the new figure is also a square and that the ratio of the area of the original four-sided figure&#151;in this case a square&#151;to that of the newly formed four-sided figure is nine to five.</P>

<P>But some 10th-grade students working with the SUPPOSER discovered something that had not hitherto appeared in any geometry book. The same ratio of areas pertains if one starts with a parallelogram or a kite or a trapezoid or indeed any four-sided figure, even one with no regularity or symmetry whatsoever. Allowed to wander intellectually with the SUPPOSER, our sophomore geometry students devised a new piece of mathematics.</P>

<P>In an intellectual mirror environment, students can pose questions, suppose, explore, and create. They are never directed to a &#147;right&#148; answer, or to any answer. Within the limited domain of geometry, they are free to wander at will. If we are wise enough to pose interesting challenges, they can go far and have the all too rare experience of making new knowledge.</P>

<P>Unless we learn to exploit technology to create such intellectual mirrors for use in schools, we will condemn schools to simply teaching what is already known. Teaching the already known is absolutely necessary, but teaching the already known is also absolutely insufficient. We need to educate our youngsters to pose and solve new problems, to cherish old knowledge, and to make new knowledge.</P>

<H4>The Nature of Some Media</H4>
<P>The technologies of recorded sound and image present an additional dimension to the educational encounter, that of the relationship of image to reality. Users must ask themselves, &#147;What is the source of these images and sounds? Did I create them, or recall already existing ones from some recording and storage device?&#148; Standard videotapes and discs capture and present previously existing images and sounds. A computer and synthesizer permit the user to generate them.</P>

<P>New technology, however, is blurring the line between recorded and generated images and sounds. Recently developed techniques for the processing of recorded sound and images make it possible to produce sounds and images that are curious blends of the recorded past and the created present. Thus, we can see pictures in the newspapers of meetings that never happened between people who were not there, and we can hear radio conversations that never took place. We have yet to explore and understand the potential of these techniques for society in general and for education in particular.</P>

<P>We must not omit consideration of printed text in this discussion. In almost all classrooms, the textbook is the physical artifact that structures the long-term interaction between the student and the subject matter. It's the clothesline on which all other curricular materials are, in fact, hung. Texts are a quintessentially linear medium, as the table of contents tells us. Is any reader now likely to read chapter nine before reading chapters one through eight?</P>

<P>What if we restructure printed texts to accompany non-linear technologies? Text has many advantages and disadvantages compared to electronic media, but we may have to free it from its linear confinement in order to make it work better with other media. People now are doing timid experiments with typeface, size, color, margins, and insets to break linearity. As long as most people still feel that they have to be given permission to jump ahead or skip back, however, I believe we must be bolder. Suppose, for instance, that texts came in loose-leaf binders. You might be given 23 chapters, named but not numbered, along with several different suggested maps of how to organize the material. You could organize it in any way that suited your purposes. If printed texts were loosened up, there could be a much more fluid interchange between print and other technologies.</P>

<H4>The Next Step</H4>
<P>Technology will enter the educational encounter as a major player only when it can permit users to ask questions of their own posing, when it can permit free exploration in response to good challenges, and when it provides users with the means of assessing how far and in what directions they have progressed. When we are able to provide students with a range of such intellectual mirror environments, I believe we will have taken a giant step in the direction of motivating our students.</P>

<P>It is reasonably obvious that the road to doing better does not lie in the direction of the pedagogy of the past. If we are going to make the kinds of changes in our educational system that the times and the evolving world economy demand, we must clearly aspire to more than simply having all our students learn the basics, as important as that might be. We must do better than that.</P>

<P>We must commit ourselves seriously to the intellectual and social diversity of our young people and give them schools that motivate them and that allow them to explore, to experiment, and to invent. Above all, though, we must give them schools that teach them to ask of themselves, &#147;How well am I doing?&#148;  and &#147;How do I really know?&#148;</P>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="hbecker.gif" align=left hspace=10><B>Henry Jay Becker</B> is principal research scientist at the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. During the 1980s he conducted national surveys at the Center that provided concrete data about how representative samples of schools and teachers used computers for instruction. The 1989 survey he refers to here was conducted by the Center in the United States for the international survey of Computers in Education, under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. Becker's current projects include a large-scale evaluation of computer-based integrated learning systems and the development and testing of lesson plans for middle grade mathematics teachers in the inner city.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>A Note from the Teacher</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By <A HREF="/journal/bios/mfinch.htm">Mary Finch</A></H3>
<HR>
<P>I was teaching the process of writing a research paper to my fourth-graders and found that Charlotte, Nancy, Sarah, and Lindsay had already mastered this skill in their gifted and talented experiences. I asked them to design a task that would be more appropriate. They decided upon a collaborative project that focused on computers, an area of interest to them all. When we learned about Toshiba's ExploraVision competition, the girls really went to work! Frustrated in their search for materials on computers in the classroom of the future, they wrote to leaders in the field and asked for their thoughts [see &#147;Letters,&#148; TECHNOS 4:4 and 5:1].</P>

<P align=center><IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/2twgang.gif" hspace=10></P>
<P><I>The four coauthors in the front row appreciated the advice and encouragement of their 17 classmates, shown here with their teacher, Mary Finch.</I></P>

<P>Working together was a real challenge, but the students discovered areas of strength in each other, and the research was divided accordingly. The girls worked at home and at school, often giving up recess and coming to school early. The rest of the class took great interest in the girls' vision of the classroom of tomorrow. They patiently shared my time, attention, and assistance. Everyone listened and critiqued each topic as the research paper developed. The long process of revising and polishing the final draft was a wonderful lesson for all of the fourth-graders. Even our principal helped the girls proofread.</P>

<P>Toshiba also wanted a 10-frame storyboard for a brief movie the students might make about their project. When the class was unhappy about having a substitute while I was on jury duty, the idea developed to parody a popular children's book, <I>Miss Nelson Is Missing</I>, by Henry Allard and James Marshall [see <A HREF="/journal/volume5/sb2carter3.htm">A Trick and Technology</A> Sidebar]. When the last picture was colored and the last paragraph was printed, our class celebrated a job well done!</P>

<P>Many of the computers at Timberwilde Elementary School are hand-me-downs from local high schools. Nearly all of our software is on 5-inch floppy disks; the newest program among those is dated 1989. The story is frequently the same in the 105,952 public and private schools in the United States (Quality Education Data).</P>

<P>The number of antiquated machines that cannot run the most up-to-date software is high. The picture is bleakest in elementary schools, where 60% of the machines are old 8-bit terminals like Apple IIs. Intermediate machines, like IBM 8088s, account for 23%; only 14% of elementary computers are up-to-date and capable of supporting CD-ROM drives (Software Publishers Association).</P>

<P>Ten years ago, there was one computer for every 125 students, K&#150;12. Today, there is one for every nine students. But if the installed base is significantly outdated, those nine students are being shortchanged (QED).</P>

<P><SMALL>(*Inspired by the childrens book <I>Miss Nelson Is Missing</I> by Henry Allard and James Marshall (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977)).</SMALL></P>

<BR>
<P><B>Frame 1: Girl on a computer phone</B>
<BR>
It is Monday and Lindsay has come to school early to get help from Ms. Nelson on a team project. She finds a substitute, Ms. Swamp. When Lindsay asks a question, Ms. Swamp replies: <I>Computers? Oh, dearie! I don't know much about those things</I>. Lindsey quietly calls a team member: <I>Charlotte, we have a problem</I>.</P>

<P><B>Frame 2: Two girls talking in the classroom</B>
<BR>
Lindsay and Charlotte watch for Sarah to arrive. Ms. Swamp reminds girls their project is due Friday and Ms. Foret's class is coming to see their presentation.</P>

<P>Ms. Swamp: <I>Dearies, Ms. Nelson will be out all week</I>.</P>

<P>Lindsay and Charlotte: <I>But, Ms. Swamp, we need Ms. Nelson's help with the media</I>.</P>

<P>Someone from the office calls. Sarah has broken her hip and is in the hospital.</P>

<P><B>Frame 3: One girl at the server with Ms. Swamp; another at a desk working on a laptop</B>
<BR>
The school sends a broadcast computer to Sarah so she can connect with her class. Charlotte shows Ms. Swamp how to run the network and teach Sarah using the CompuVision screen.  Lindsay is on the Internet, chatting with someone in Mexico City. Laptop computers are in use throughout the room. A light buzz of voices and keyboard clicks in the background.</P>

<P align=center><IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/2twdraw.gif"></P>

<P><B>Frame 4: A girl in bed</B>
<BR>
Ms. Swamp: <I>Good morning, Sarah. How are you feeling?</I></P>

<P>Sarah: <I>Not too badly, Ms. Swamp. This setup is witchy! I can see and hear you just fine. Jimmy, please get your feet off my desk.</I></P>

<P>Ms. Swamp: <I>Your assignments are on your screen now. Do you have any questions?</I></P>

<P>Sarah:<I> Yes, has Lindsay reached Nancita Ram&oacute;n in Mexico yet?</I></P>

<P><B>Frame 5: Hispanic girl in library with book</B>
<BR>
Lindsay:<I> Wait one, Sarah. Charlotte, can you help me with the split screen commands?</I></P>

<P>[Two girls appear on the CompuVision.]</P>

<P>Ms. Swamp: <I>Hi, Nancita.</I></P>

<P>Nancita: <I>Buenos d&iacute;as. Sorry to hear about your fall, Sarah. I did get the diary translated. It should be coming out of your classroom printer now. It has all the data you need. Meet you on the Web Friday at 2:00. Adi&oacute;s.</I></P>

<P><B>Frame 6: Two girls in classroom using fancy equipment</B>
<BR>
Charlotte:<I> I'll ask Nancita to send us photos of the artifacts and Ram&oacute;n's grave. I will scan them into the video and author the CD. Lindsay, can you generate titles and barcodes for the presentation graphics on your laptop?</I></P>

<P>Lindsay: <I>Sure, and I'll get sound effects from the library. Mission bells, hoof beats, maybe even &#147;Bolero&#148; for the background. We may pull this off yet!</I></P>

<P><B>Frame 7: Two girls, teacher, and Sarah on laptop at table in classroom</B>
<BR>
Lindsay:<I> In 1716, Domingo Ram&oacute;n brought the first European women to East Texas. Sarah tells how the Karankawa Indians and the French drove the missionaries off in 1719. I tell about their escape to San Antonio, and Nancita covers Ram&oacute;n's last days in Mexico. We have the museum's videodisc of his belongings, his diary, and flag.</I></P>

<P>Ms. Swamp:<I> Excellent, dearies.</I></P>

<P><B>Frame 8: The presentation in progress</B>
<BR>
Lindsay and Charlotte are speaking to an attentive audience of their peers. Nancita in seen on the CompuVision, while Sarah is projected onto a pull-down screen. They give their 20-minute multimedia presentation, &#147;Three Hundred Years Ago This Month.&#148; Ms. Swamp watches from the side.</P>

<P><B>Frame 9: Hispanic girl with flag</B>
<BR>
Nancita: <I>So, 300 years ago, Captain Domingo Ram&oacute;n led 12 priests, 25 soldiers, and 7 families from Spain to East Texas. Eventually, the survivors settled in San Antonio. Mission records show that my ancestor moved to Mexico City in 1725, where he died in 1731. He's buried in the church behind me. This is the flag he brought with him from Spain. Do you have any questions?</I></P>

<P><B>Frame 10: Charlotte hugs Lindsay; Sarah watches from the laptop screen</B>
<BR>
Charlotte: <I>We did it, Lindsay. Ms. Swamp, did you like it?</I> [pause] <I>Ms. Swamp? Where is she?</I></P>

<P>Sarah:<I> Look behind you! It's Ms. Nelson. She's back.</I></P>

<P>Charlotte: <I>Ms. Nelson, you missed our project. We did it all by ourselves.</I></P>

<P>Ms. Nelson: <I>Yes, you did. I hope you put it on disc, dearies.</I></P>

<P>Girls: <I>Dearies? You're her. You're Ms. Swamp. You tricked us! You made us do all this work.</I></P>

<P>Ms. Nelson: <I>Yes, and look at the great job you did, dearies.</I></P>

<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>Sidebar for <A HREF="/journal/volume3/4eakin.htm"><I>What's Wrong with This Picture?</I></A></H3>
<HR>
<P><B>Q: What are electric and magnetic fields, or EMFs?</P>

<P>A:</B> Power lines, electrical wiring, and appliances all produce AC electric and magnetic fields. EMFs are invisible lines of force that exist in the area surrounding any electrical device. They are measured in <I>gauss</I> or <I>tesla</I> and are not easily shielded or weakened by most material. EMFs are reduced in strength with increasing distance from the source.</P>

<P><B>Q: How do electric power EMFs compare to other types of fields?</P>

<P>A:</B> The electromagnetic spectrum covers an enormous range of frequencies, which are expressed in cycles per second, called <I>Hertz</I>, or <I>Hz</I>. Electric power (60 Hz in North America, 50 Hz elsewhere) is in the extremely low-frequency, or <I>ELF</I>, range, which includes frequencies below 3,000 Hz. In general, the higher the frequency, the greater the amount of energy in the field.</P>

<P><B>Q: How do EMFs from transmission lines, appliances, and video display screens compare?</P>

<P>A:</B> Electric fields close to transmission lines are much stronger than the fields found near electrical appliances, but they are reduced in strength by objects such as buildings, trees, and vehicles. Magnetic fields very close to electrical appliances are often stronger than the fields directly beneath power lines, but they decrease in strength with distance more quickly than do power-line fields. Some appliances also produce both 60-Hz and higher-frequency fields. For example, video displays such as TV sets and video display terminals, or VDTs, used with computers produce radio-frequency fields as well as ELF fields.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume3/4mprii.gif" align=left border=5 hspace=10>
<P><B>Q: Are there any standards for 60-Hz EMFs?</P>

<P>A:</B> In the United States, there are no federal health standards specifically for 60-Hz EMFs. A professional society, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has developed &#147;Threshold Limit Values&#148; for EMFs that include 60 Hz. These are guidelines for use by industrial hygienists in occupational settings and are not considered a line between safe and unsafe EMF levels. At least six states have set standards for transmission-line electric fields; two of these also have standards for magnetic fields. Interim guidelines on limits of exposure to 50/60-Hz EMFs have been developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. These limits are based on established effects of EMFs, such as nerve stimulation, and they are much higher than EMF levels found typically in occupational and residential environments.</P>

<P><B>Q: What happens when a person is exposed to EMFs?</P>

<P>A:</B> Strong electric fields, such as those found beneath large transmission lines, can cause the hair on a person's head to vibrate at 60 Hz. This is felt by some people as a tingling sensation. EMFs from transmission lines can also cause nuisance shocks from voltages created by EMFs on objects like metal fences. AC fields create weak electric currents in the bodies of people and animals. This is one reason why there is a potential for EMFs to cause biological effects. Currents from electric and magnetic fields are distributed differently within the body. The amount of this current, even if a person is beneath a large transmission line, is extremely small&#151;millionths of an ampere. The current, which is too weak to penetrate cell membranes, is present mostly between the cells. Currents from 60-Hz EMFs are weaker than natural currents in the body, such as those from the electrical activity of the brain and heart. For this reason, some scientists argue that it is impossible for EMFs to have any important effects. But others point to results of studies that show that biological effects can be caused by exposure to EMFs. In most cases, however, it is not clear how EMFs actually produce these demonstrated effects.</P>

<P><B>Q: What can be done to limit EMF exposure?</P>

<P>A:</B> Individuals and organizations can reduce exposure to EMFs in a number of ways, some of which are not expensive. The simplest way is to increase the distance from the source of EMFs, such as a student's computer monitor. Another way is to design a source to shield or cancel the field, such as a screen over the monitor. Time spent in the field can be reduced.</P>

<HR>
<P>&#147;The CoVis Network Use Policy&#148; is sent home with students at the beginning of the school year and must be read and signed by both parents and students. In this way, parents are informed of the activities their children will be engaged in as participants in the Internet community as well as the innovative nature of the activities in the CoVis classroom. To ensure that students have an opportunity to think through the issues and guidelines described in the policy, time in each classroom is devoted to a follow-up discussion, led cooperatively by a CoVis teacher and a Northwestern graduate student. This excerpt has been edited for publication in TECHNOS.*</P>

<HR>
<P><B>The Gerald R. Ford Library</B></P>

<P>The Gerald R. Ford Library is located on the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan. A
repository for 20 million documents and a half million audiovisual items, the Library also offers
programs to make these materials accessible. Researchers utilize PRESNET (a computer database
that describes more than 50,000 folder titles and collections), finding aids (detailed narrative
summaries created by archivists), and archivists' assistance to find documents on their topics.</P>

<P>The Ford Library is one of 12 Presidential libraries and museums that are part of the National
Archives and Records Administration. Other Presidents so honored are George Bush, Jimmy
Carter, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, Lyndon Baines Johnson, John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman. </P>

<P><B>The Gerald R. Ford Museum</B></P>

<P>The Ford Museum, which opened in 1981 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is only a short walk from
the site of Ford's first campaign headquarters in 1948 (the subject of a Ford Museum display).
Visitors can also walk through an exact replica (with artifacts) of the White House Oval Office in
1976, when Ford occupied it. Along with these permanent exhibits, the museum offers a
succession of temporary exhibits that draw upon the entire Presidential libraries system, the
Smithsonian Institution, the National Archives, and others. With a focus on public programming,
the museum, which focuses on public programming, also hosts special events, naturalization
ceremonies for new citizens, and Fourth of July celebrations. In April 1996, the museum unveiled
a new exhibit, <I>41 Men: From Washington to Clinton</I>, a display of personal objects from each of
the U.S. Presidents. The privately funded Ford Museum is currently undergoing a $4 million
makeover that reflects both historical interpretation and new museum technologies, as well as a
glimpse of the 70s culture&#151;complete with disco and polyester suits. The redo, which is being
constructed offsite to permit the museum to remain open, will feature an interactive White House
situation room that lets tourists make foreign-policy decisions, a mixed-media multiscreen
treatment of Watergate (complete with a burglary tool from the break-in), and an Oval Office
sound-and-light show. The &#147;grand reopening&#148; is scheduled for April 1997.</P>

<HR>

<P>David Heil, host of the PBS science show &#147;Newton's Apple&#148; and associate director of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, calls himself an &#147;enthusiastic skeptic&#148; of multimedia. He insists that, despite the promise of multimedia, there will be a continuing need for both teachers and textbooks. &#147;There is a real value to having textbooks,&#148; Heil says. &#147;I think kids want something that is their own, which they can reference when they want to and how they want to. A well-written text is a great resource for kids in a classroom setting. I think it is very important that we don't make bookless classrooms, because books still are a valuable resource for kids' learning, whether in a classroom setting or outside the classroom.&#148;</P>

<P>Heil, who has helped produce several interactive educational CD-ROMs, warns that &#147;the assumption is made by parents and teachers or entire school districts that if they can buy this batch of software and have it on all the terminals in the computer lab, that the kids can come down the hall, go into that lab for 45 minutes, and call it a science lesson. I think that is a very dangerous assumption because, while the new software, by and large, offers valuable resources, most of the products are still information-dense rather than interactive in terms of instigating experiments and encouraging students to formulate new ideas from their experience. There isn't a lot of experimental learning going on.&#148;</P>

<P>Calling for far more research into the ways children learn at different developmental stages, Heil says that, in general, the developers of today&#146;s multimedia programs &#147;haven't spent a great deal of time on understanding learning theory and where kids are developmentally. So, for instance, they ignore the fact that at a late primary and early adolescent stage, children learn in very different ways than when they are fifteen, or when they are six.&#148;</P>

<P>Heil says the value in the "Newton's Apple" CD-ROM package called "What's the Secret" lies in the many "interactive mini experiments you can do right on the terminal to explore things such as sound. You can compare a cow's moo with a honking car. Then you test what it's like as the sound passes through water or over a mountain range. You can do these experiments right on the terminal, which makes it interactive software. And there are opportunities for kids to conduct experiments away from the terminal and come back and compare the results. The more of this approach there is, the better off we will be in terms of using these kinds of products."</P>

<P>Heil predicts that multimedia will succeed as an educational tool if it stresses &#147;learning that is self-instigated on the part of the learner&#148; and encourages students to &#147;get up out of their chairs and do something else, somewhere else.&#148; This is precisely the experiential learning process being promoted by electronic publishers.</P>

<P>Heil calls for more research on learning, saying, &#147;I&#146;m glad computers and multimedia have offered this ability to combine many technologies and many approaches to produce a product. But what we've been producing up to now basically has been electronic lectures.&#148; The best products are likely to emerge from combining the multiple strengths and valuable inventories of traditional schoolbook publishers with &#147;the creative talents of the Disneys and the MTVs.&#148; Yet he warns that, despite the apparent promise of multimedia, &#147;you don't want to rely on it as your sole learning resource&#133; Experiential learning is what I believe in. I am very concerned about kids or educators thinking that the computer can provide enough of a resource to stimulate all kinds of learning.&#148;</P>

<P>Stressing the need to focus on students and student needs, Heil concludes that &#147;if we can&#146;t include the learner in the &#145;multi&#146; of multimedia, then it&#146;s not really multimedia yet.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Charter schools</B> are &#147;autonomous, results-oriented, publicly funded schools of choice that are
designed and run by teachers or others under contract with a public sponsor.&#148; In September 1995, there were 226 charter schools in operation in the United States. Of these, 214 were in states with the most expansive charter school laws&#151;Arizona, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Minnesota&#151;while there were only 12 schools in five states having the most restrictive laws&#151;Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/1rooney.gif" align=right hspace=10>

<P>Most charter schools are small elementary schools that are experimenting with a variey of educational approaches, such as interdisciplinary instruction, expanded use of technology, increased parental involvement, performance assessments and portfolios, and back-to-basics instruction. Two major barriers affect most charter schools: lack of capital funds and lack of legal aid and business expertise. Effects on student achievement are not yet documented.</P>

<P><I>Golden Rule Insurance Company's Pat Rooney visits with some CHOICE students in Indianapolis.</I></P>

<P>In Milwaukee, where a <B>voucher system</B> has been implemented, the six-year legal battle over a school choice law will culminate on February 27, 1996, when the Wisconsin State Supreme Court will review what promises to be a landmark case. A decision is expected in April or early May. In 1989, the original choice amendment, introduced by Wisconsin State Representative Annette &#147;Polly&#148; Williams (D-Milwaukee), was passed. But when the choice program began operating in 1990, public school teachers and administrators sued, after which parents in favor of the choice program countersued. The straightforward voucher program had some 1,420 students enrolled, but 3,000 had applied and already started school when the injunction was issued, leaving many students without educational provision. At that time, <B>PAVE (Parents Advancing Values in Education)</B>, a private scholarship organization serving low-income families since 1991, quickly organized an emergency fund-raising drive, led by executive director Dan McKinley. Within 10
days, it had raised $1.8 million to send all the remaining students to school. On March 3, 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that private school choice was constitutional in Wisconsin. In 1995, Governor Tommy Thompson signed a state budget that would dramatically expand the choice program, and again Milwaukee Public School teachers and the American Civil Liberties Union sued to block the move. The Supreme Court took the case directly and enjoined program expansion until a decision could be issued on its constitutionality.</P>

<P>Clint Bollick, litigation director at the Institute for Justice in Washington, D.C., expects similar challenges as other states adopt private school choice programs. Currently, there are 26 programs in Wisconsin, where the state issues funds directly for education. Ohio plans to have its choice program in place for the 1996&#150;97 school year; Minnesota and Vermont have similar programs in place.</P>

<P>A Chicago organization, <B>Family Options for Children Urban Scholarship Fund, or FOCUS</B> (launched in December 1995), models Milwaukee's PAVE program. FOCUS plans to provide partial scholarships for some 30 to 50 students in September 1996 and to continue to provide partial scholarships for low-income parents for at least three years. The FOCUS fund was started with an initial grant from the Children's Educational Foundation, funded by the family fortune of the late Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart.</P>

<P>The <B>Educational CHOICE Charitable Trust</B> program, funded by the  Golden Rule Insurance Company, pays half the cost of private school tuition for K&#150;8 children of qualifying families within the Indianapolis Public Schools district. Led by Chairman Pat Rooney, Golden Rule has pledged at least three years of support for the program&#151;at a total cost of $1.2 million. CHOICE was praised by the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> as &#147;a breakthrough in corporate support for educational choice&#148; that other businesses should model. Golden Rule's CHOICE program, recognized by the Childhelp USA organization and the U.S. Senate for helping children and families succeed, is the first privately funded tuition voucher program in the country. Currently CHOICE-inspired programs are operating in 22 U.S. cities, with enrollments totaling 10,000 students and some 16,000 on waiting lists for admission.</P>

<P><B>The Edison Project</B> establishes partnership schools, either in contract with public authorities or as
part of a charter school initiative within a local community. A team led by Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., former Yale University president, recently spent two years integrating successful educational practices into this comprehensive school design. The first four full-partnership schools, serving K&#150;5 students, opened in summer 1995 in Sherman, Texas; Wichita, Kansas; Mount Clemens, Michigan; and Boston. In fall 1996, these schools will add programs for grades 6&#150;8, with additional elementary schools opening in another six or so communities.</P>

<P>The Educational Freedom Initiative (EFI), which was filed on August 14, 1995, proposes The Educational Freedom Amendment to the California Constitution. Petitions are being circulated for signatures through March 21, 1996, with the target date for qualifying the initiative of November 5, 1996, Election Day. The initiative would do the following:</P>

<HR>
<P>&#147;Christa McAuliffe wanted to view the earth without its political boundaries,&#148; says Misty Brave,
one of five 1992 Christa McAuliffe Educators. &#147;Technology allows us to do that.&#148; Brave and her
teacher colleagues are leaders in the use of technology to restructure education. They &#147;touch the
future,&#148; as McAuliffe once said of her own teaching mission.</P>

<P>The McAuliffe Educators are sponsored by the National Foundation for the Improvement of
Education (NFIE), a creation of the National Education Association. The teachers are nominated
by others and are chosen through a national search. Named for the teacher who participated in the
ill-fated <I>Challenger</I> space shuttle mission of 1986, the Christa McAuliffe Educators plan and
conduct the Christa McAuliffe Institute for Educational Pioneering at Stanford University.</P>

<P>Each August the Institute brings together outstanding teachers for training that will help them
reach their restructuring goals. In addition to the five Educators, 20 McAuliffe Fellows attend the
Institute. The Fellows apply for selection through a national competition. In 1992, the Institute's
fifth year, participants were chosen because of their work along the theme of Preparing All
Students for the 21st Century: Using Telecommunications to Restructure Education for Global
Understanding.</P>

<P>At the 10-day Institute the teachers work on honing organizational skills, collaborating on
projects, building teacher networks,  recognizing and overcoming barriers to educational change,
and learning how to operate within the complexity of school bureaucracies.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3cgilkis.gif" align=left hspace=10><B>Carol Gilkinson</B>, a 1992 McAuliffe Educator and third-grade teacher at Washington School in Covina, California, knows how slowly this grass-roots reform works. &#147;It takes a lot of effort&#151;one person at a time,&#148; she says. To her, telecommunications is the &#147;great  equalizer,&#148; the means for cutting through layers of educational bureaucracy so those in the classroom can communicate directly with those making policies in the state houses.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3mschlie.gif" align=right hspace=10>Global education is a high priority for all the 1992 McAuliffe Educators. <B>Marilyn Schlief</B>, a high school teacher of Japanese language and culture in Garden City, Michigan, has established electronic learning links between students and teachers in her school district and those in a partner high school in Shiga, Japan. Using a videophone, Schlief's students and those in Shiga can see and hear each other as they communicate through international lines. &#147;My main interest is in the cultural understanding students gain through the use of new telecommunications technologies,&#148;
she says.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3mbrave.gif" align=left hspace=10>It is the need for cultural understanding that motivates <B>Misty Brave</B>, a middle- and high-school environmental sciences teacher at Little Wound School on the Oglala Lakota (Sioux) Pine Ridge Reservation in Kyle, South Dakota. She uses sophisticated technology and multicultural contexts to enhance the curriculum while continuing to stress traditional Indian values. &#147;We are all connected and we must all think of ourselves as a global unit,&#148; she says. &#147;We can do that by
sharing information and learning of each other's cultures through technology.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3bbracey.gif" align=right hspace=10><B>Bonnie Bracey</B> believes using instructional technology is in itself a step toward restructuring. Her fourth- and fifth-grade students at Ashlawn Elementary School in Arlington, Virginia, use a variety of hardware and software applications and frequently participate in the National Geographic Society's HELLO Network and other on-line links. They use telecommunications to
participate in international research projects on challenging global issues. &#147;The kids get really
excited when they're using on-line telecommunications,&#148; Bracey says. &#147;They're thinking, learning,
making changes in their work, and using higher-level thinking skills.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="3zimmerm.gif" align=left hspace=10>After the Institute,  the Educators continue to share their enthusiasm and leadership with other teachers by attending state and national conferences, serving on committees and boards, and hosting a national teleconference October 22 on PBS. They become NFIE's ambassadors for using technology to enhance global education.</P>

<P>&#147;That,&#148; says McAuliffe Educator <B>James Zimmerman</B>, fifth-grade teacher at Thomas Paine Elementary School in Urbana, Illinois, &#147;is something that won't end when this year is over. I think that's going to be a part of who I am and what my curriculum is from now on.&#148;</P>

<HR>
<P><B>The NetDay Concept</B></P>

<P>NetDay was started in central California by Michael Kaufman of KQED, a public broadcast organization, and John Gage of Sun Microsystems. It was conceived as a grassroots drive to help bring California's elementary and secondary schools onto the Internet, using a combination of public volunteers and private contributions that culminated in a single, focused day of activity called NetDay.</P>

<P>The goal of NetDay was to install high-speed wiring infrastructure in local schools and to enable schools to connect to the Internet. The wiring standard used was Category Five, a level of performance that allows sophisticated digital video and data transmission within the school.</P>

<P>Information about schools, volunteers, and donations was shared over the Internet through a site on the World Wide Web. This method allowed new information to be available immediately throughout the state, and made it easy to monitor the progress of NetDay preparations. Posted on the Web site, efforts by individuals and companies as well as conditions in individual schools were highly visible. Companies committed to NetDay became models for involvement for other firms.</P>

<P><BR><IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/2brown.gif"align=left hspace=10><BR>
<I>The late Ron Brown, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, center, and Glenn Rule, 12, a sixth grader at Freeport Elementary School watch a screen showing an Internet link-up with President Clinton in Concord, California, during NetDay '96 on Saturday, March 9, 1996. Next to Brown is Peter Pak of Sun Microsystems, who assisted in the link-up.</I></P>
<BR><BR>
<P><B>California NetDay</B></P>

<P>On March 9, 1996, tens of thousands of volunteer parents, students, teachers, and high-technology engineers installed the wiring in public and private schools. Sponsors bought wiring kits and contributed their equipment and skilled installers. School organizers arranged events at their schools and attracted considerable media attention. Several top-ranking government officials came to California to help install Category Five wiring in schools for the occasion. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were in a Contra Costa County school; Secretary Richard Riley participated at a San Diego school; FCC Chairman Reed Hundt was in Los Angeles; and the late Ron Brown assisted in a Sacramento-area school.</P>

<P><B>Massachusetts NetDay</B></P>

<P>Massachusetts businesses and educators, inspired by the California effort, came together to help schools in their Commonwealth. Many of these people, long committed to education technology, saw an opportunity for higher visibility and success. They wanted to provide help not only in wiring but also with PCs, network hardware, and support for teachers.</P>

<P>Such help is urgently needed, because the full promise of the Internet is far from being realized in Massachusetts classrooms (and indeed in schools throughout the country). According to a GAO report, two-thirds of the state's elementary and secondary schools lack computers to meet current instructional needs. Existing computers are often slow and obsolete, and only 20 percent of the computers in Massachusetts schools have hard disks. Teacher training and development have also fallen behind technological advances.</P>

<P>Education, labor, and business groups have come together to form MassNetworks, which is a campaign to help Massachusetts schools. MassNetworks provides the foundation for a statewide partnership&#151;consisting of a broad coalition of business, education, labor, nonprofit institutions, and government organizations&#151;to use technology to support school reform.</P>

<P>The goals of MassNetworks are: to coordinate Massachusetts NetDays by acting as a clearinghouse for donations and volunteer work; to support teachers, principals, and students at all schools, and to help them use this technology effectively; to create public support for long-term school reform; and to form an alliance of business, labor, government, and education groups to accomplish these goals.</P>

<IMG SRC="/journal/volume5/2cable.gif" align=left hspace=10>
<P><I> Marilyn Strasser (cq), a Pacific Bell Pioneer of America volunteer, lays wiring down before it can be fed into the classrooms for link-up to the Internet. Strasser was one of approximately 66 people from the Sacramento community and businesses to volunteer for NetDay '96 on March 9, 1996.</I></P>

<P>This ambitious effort, the largest of its kind to date, will require large private-sector contributions to succeed. Over the next year and a half, thousands of volunteers will be mobilized at hundreds of schools. These volunteers will install wiring and computers to give students and teachers access to computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Teachers will begin to receive the support and training they need.</P>

<P>The first event of MassNetworks is a NetDay on Saturday, October 26, 1996. On that day, Massachusetts pilot schools will have wiring infrastructure installed. Many more schools will receive other types of help as needed, such as teacher support, computer and network hardware, and technical advice.</P>

<P>The many tasks associated with MassNetworks are divided among working groups coordinated by members of the schools and business communities. These groups are responsible for tasks such as Web site administration, local site preparation and wiring plans, volunteer mobilization and training, outside wiring and connections, and teacher training and professional development.</P>

<P>To fulfill these goals, MassNetworks needs a budget of $3 million, including in-kind equipment, tools, and services. The organizers, who regard this effort as the beginning of a long-term school improvement initiative, are also working for passage of an education technology bond bill to provide the required support.</P>

<P><B>NetDays Nationwide</B></P>

<P>Schools nationwide are now mobilizing to plan their own NetDays. The California organizers of NetDay are orchestrating a month of NetDays on the four Saturdays of October 1996. In addition to Massachusetts, NetDay efforts are also underway in North Carolina, and additional inquiries and requests for information have come from 39 other states and several foreign countries.</P>

<P>In preparation for these events, California NetDay organizers have expanded their Web site to accommodate data for schools and volunteers throughout the United States, and are making their videos and other training materials available. The California group is also planning a nationwide &#147;How-To&#148; NetDay Conference in Washington, D.C., in late June for organizers from all 50 states.</P>

<P>The California NetDay World Wide Web site is <A HREF="HTTP://www.netday96.com">http://www.netday96.com</A>. MassNetworks can be
reached at their Web site,<A HREF="HTTP://www.massnetworks.org"> http://www.massnetworks.org</A>.

<P>Brooklyn College's Alice Miller, the developer of the Eureka program for Girls Inc., is a strong advocate of all-girl classrooms. She says it is the only effective way to engage girls in the use of technology. When Miller and other researchers asked girls if they preferred all-girl classes, they said yes, because they didn't want to do unconventional things in front of boys and then be criticized by them.</P>

<P>Not everyone agrees with Miller, however. Hyacinth Foster, a teacher of the Eureka curriculum at Brooklyn College, Polytech University, and at a private school in New York, doesn't think girls need a different type of instruction or separate classes. She says it's the teacher's responsibility to involve girls. Through positive leadership and role models, girls can achieve the confidence to speak out and participate. Foster points out that at her school three girls were accepted into engineering programs, while only one boy was accepted.</P>

<P>Terry Wardrop from Saint Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, tells the story of a program at the North Carolina School of Science and Math, where boys and girls were put in single-sex collaborative groups to work on projects. Previously, when the groups had been mixed, the boys had dominated the equipment and the conversations. The collaborative environment also deteriorated. When single-sex groups were formed, the girls out performed the boys. An added benefit was that the boys, observing the girls' success and method of interaction, adopted the girls' communication style.</P>

<P>Women have played vital roles in the development of modern technologies. <B>Augusta Ada Lovelace</B> wrote the instructions for Charles Babbage's computing machine in the 1800s. <B>Adele Goldstine</B> wrote the first programs for the ENAIC, built in the 1940s. <B>Grace Hopper</B> was the central figure in the development of the computer language COBOL in the 1950s, and she coined the term <I>bug</I> to refer to a computer malfunction. In the 1940s, the Hollywood actress <B>Hedy Lamarr</B> made major contributions to the science of electromagnetic waves.</P>

<P>In 1960, when the computer industry was young and there were only 2,000 computer operators, 65 percent of the operators were women. Since then, the situation for women in high-tech fields has taken a turn for the worse. Although in 1987-88 women constituted slightly more than half of the U.S. population and 45 percent of employed workers in the nation, they made up only 30 percent of employed computer scientists. In addition, only 2.5 percent of engineers were women. Women are a mere 7.8 percent of computer science and computer engineering faculty members. Only 2.7 percent of them are tenured, according to the 1988 report on women and minorities in science and engineering.</P>

<P>A group called <B>Women of Vision at the Technology Museum</B> in San Jose, California, was born in 1993 from the realization that since the museum's opening day on October 29,1990, more men than women had participated as exhibitors and attendees. Part of its outreach efforts involve sending women in the industry who are scientists, mathematicians, and technical writers to classrooms around the Bay Area to discuss how they chose their field, the classes they took, and who their mentors were. They primarily visit students 11 to 15 years old. They talk to classes of boys and girls, but direct their messages toward the girls. If the girls don't ask questions, they try to break through to them to draw them into the conversation.</P>

<P>Frankie Kangas, membership manager for the Mercury Center in San Jose, California, and a role model for Women of Vision, says, &#147;I think we are role models for boys, too. We demonstrate that women are competent scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists.&#148; These encounters with role models provide girls with ideas and encouragement and improve their environment as a whole by exposing boys to these role models as well.</P>

<HR>
<P>The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), under cooperative agreement with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, has released a report on telecommunications and the National Education Goals. The report is the culmination of the two-year United States Education and Instruction through Telecommunications (USE IT) project, which drew upon the expertise of key individuals from education, government, and private industry. The USE IT report  describes the technologies currently being used for distance learning, highlights examples of resources and applications, and discusses significant barriers to realizing the full potential of distance learning. The report makes the following <B>12 Recommendations</B> for ensuring the effective use of telecommunications technologies for lifelong learning:</P>

<P><B>Recommendation 1:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Education agencies at all levels must support the development and use of distance-learning resources to achieve the National Education Goals.</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<B>Recommendation 2:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Education agencies at all levels must strive to achieve equitable access to distance-learning resources to increase the opportunity for all citizens to learn.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Recommendation 3:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The telecommunications industry, distance-learning service providers, and regulatory agencies must support and develop distance-learning delivery systems and information networks that are compatible and interoperable, and should explore methods for the cooperative, cost-effective use of distance learning facilities and services.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Recommendation 4:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Federal and state governments, together with local communities, educational institutions, the telecommunications industry, and business and industry, should promote public/private partnerships for distance learning and support	regional and statewide applications of distance learning to form an integrated national resource.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Recommendation 5:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>State and federal regulatory agencies must develop policies that ensure affordable rates for the educational uses of telecommunications resources. Regulatory agencies having appropriate responsibility should ensure availability of universal telecommunications services for all levels of lifelong learning and maintain reasonable fair-use copyright guidelines for instructional materials used in distance learning.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Recommendation 6:</B>

<P>At the core of an apprenticeship &#147;system&#148; is a set of national or by-industry standards for certification. &#147;They are a guiding point for organizing a program and maintaining quality,&#148; says Stephen Hamilton of Cornell University's Youth and Work Program. &#147;They also give young people goals.&#148; A stringent skill certification system is critical, says Sue Berryman, former director of the Institute on Education and the Economy who is now with the World Bank, &#147;no matter if apprentice ships are school-based or work-based.&#148;</P>

<P>Apparently, such a certification system is in the making. The most publicized effort has been that of the Bush Administration initiative&#151;the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills, or SCANS. Its report, released in June 1991, calls for all high school students to develop a set of higher competencies and that these standards for high performance be geared to those of the country's most competitive companies.</P>

<P>Among the five categories of competencies seen as basic for workers of the future is that of technology. Education should prepare entering workers to be able to select the proper equipment and tools, apply technology to specific tasks, and maintain and troubleshoot technologies, SCANS says.</P>

<P>Without reference to the SCANS effort, both Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and Secretary of Education Richard Riley have testified for a Clinton Administration proposal&#151;a National Skill Standards Board. Its work would parallel that of a national education standards board, continuing efforts already under way to rewrite the curricula for K&#150;12 schooling.</P>

<P>According to Reich, the board &#147;would unite representatives of business, labor, education, and others with a stake in the development of the American work force and the expertise to contribute.&#148; He sees skill standards as &#147;the cornerstone of our work force development system.&#148; They would be voluntary; designed with private sector leadership in order to incorporate the best of what is known about top-quality competency and performance; knit together work already carried out in industry, the states, or the education system; and be inclusive and free from gender, racial, or other bias.</P>

<P>Presumably, this National Skill Standards Board will take steps beyond the SCANS recommendation for experiments and demonstrations. One effort, however, already is setting the pace for others. The Fort Worth Independent School District decided that &#147;tinkering&#148; with its education program would not be enough to assure its graduates could be absorbed into increasingly high-tech jobs in the area. &#147;Today's schools are better than they used to be&#151;at what they used to do,&#148; Superintendent Don Roberts told education and business leaders. But in order to be what they should be, schools need to link with real-world applications.</P>

<P>Working with the local Chamber of Commerce, the school district developed a strategy to find out what skills students would need. Literally thousands of employees from 300 companies and community organizations analyzed nearly 800 jobs in the area. The levels of proficiency identified have been used to help teachers redesign their curricula and their teaching strategies.</P>

<P>This partnership with the community&#151;known as C&#150;3 for community, corporations, and classrooms&#151;has led to Applied Learning at schools in which students work in teams and learn by doing; and Vital Link, a job shadowing program that involved 2,000 students during the 1992-93 school year in five half-day sessions with their teachers at local workplaces. Further, the school district is moving to replace simple field trips to work sites with hands-on internships for students.</P>

<P>Two dynamic forces&#151;communications technology and interactive distance learning programs&#151;are shifting the focus of schools from inward to outward. School walls no longer stake the boundaries of the learning environment. Isolation, low enrollment, or limited district staffing budgets no longer preclude a quality education.</P>

<P>Various distance learning programs&#151;employing phones, fax machines, electronic bulletin boards, interactive video, computers, and other media to enable instructors and learners to interact&#151;are being implemented across the country. The technology used by each program depends on a variety of factors, including the number of sites, the distance between sites, program objectives, the level of interaction required, and available funds.</P>

<P>The Wisconsin Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Network Model Distance Learning Project (WISMATE) is achieving effective interaction under the direction of Jon L. Harkness and the technical coordination of LeRoy Lee. The project uses computers, modems, and regular copper telephone lines. WISMATE is funded for the 1992-93 school year by a $44,653 state Science, Mathematics, and Technology grant. It links 577 fifth-grade students and 17 teachers in classrooms across Wisconsin with one another and with practicing scientists, mathematicians, and engineers who volunteer their services. Participating schools provide their own computers and modems.</P>

<P>WISMATE students work on projects especially designed for the network with the help of their in-class teachers and their assigned on-line volunteer scientists. Students and teachers in all classes collaborate and exchange information. Participating scientists pose and answer questions, make suggestions, and guide students to further collaboration with other scientists and with students in other classrooms.
WISMATE users communicate with one another by leaving messages in electronic mailboxes for information &#147;not of interest to everyone&#148; and on electronic bulletin boards for information from which &#147;everyone could benefit by reading.&#148; All interactions on the network require writing and reading, a fact which Harkness says WISMATE educators consider a &#147;definite plus to students.&#148;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="1indy.gif" align=right hspace=10><I>Distance learning in Indianapolis, using fiber-optic connections. Students and teachers see each other on screen and interact as if in the same classroom. This photo was taken at the Ameritech SuperSchool exhibit.</I></P>

<P>Interaction is ready to happen on a different level on the Indianapolis Regional Economic/Academic Development (IREAD) network. The IREAD network, also begun in fall 1992, is a closed-circuit television system built and implemented through the cooperative efforts of Indiana Bell/Ameritech, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS). The network links three administration buildings and 87 schools by 600 miles of fiber optics. It has the potential to connect any IPS classroom as well as various ad hoc groups of the 47,000 students and 4,000 teachers in the IPS system in an audiovisual, real-time interactive environment. It is also joined to Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), 45 miles south of Indianapolis, by fiber.</P>

<P>Because the schools already were wired for cable, Indiana Bell was able to lay a fiber-optic trunk line and connect it in most cases to the existing coaxial cable in each building to form the network. Easily transportable equipment in the schools can quickly ready classrooms and other sites for two-way voice/video interaction on a need basis.</P>

<P>The first two IREAD projects in fall 1992 were a three-credit-hour graduate course from IUB for teachers and a student project built around the election-year theme that included lectures by IUB professors. IPS spokesman Mark Goff says feedback on these projects was &#147;very positive, and teachers are actively planning new distance learning projects to fulfill the network's interactive potential.&#148;</P>

<P>According to Indiana Bell media information specialist Lisa Hendrickson, the initial cost of the network is covered by a 10-year contract between IPS and Indiana Bell. She says the contract&#151;which has six more years to go&#151;calls for &#147;monthly payments of $15,000 to Indiana Bell,&#148; an amount that includes all Indiana Bell communication services to IPS.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Virtual Reality Lexicon and Litmus Test</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By Joan Lewis</H3>
<HR>

<P><B>Lexicon</B></P>

<P>Following the virtual reality (VR) saga as it unfolds will be a lot more enjoyable if you understand some of the jargon and are able to decode a particular set of acronyms.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><P> <B>Cathode ray tubes (CRTs).</B> In VR, CRTs are tiny versions of the TV receivers you have in your home. CRT technology is one of the two currently available display options for <I>HMDs</I>. CRTs provide the best resolution, but you give up color. Color TVs that tiny can't be made yet.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>Cybernaut.</B> As you wander around <I>cyberspace</I>&#151;maybe on the Internet through your computer or around a virtual environment through an <I>HMD</I>&#151;you are a cybernaut.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>Cyberspace.</B> This term, coined by author William Gibson in his 1984 novel <I>Neuromancer</I>, is broadly used to describe a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Cyberspace is sensation of place without physicality&#151;an electronically linked network of the information held in human minds and computer banks, worldwide.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Data glove.</B> VPL's DataGlove is a trademark product, whose name has come to stand for the whole genre of sensory glove-input devices to a VR <I>engine</I> computer. Sensory gloves are built with sensors that allow the wearer to direct a <I>virtual agent</I> and manipulate objects in the VR environment. &#147;Output tactile gloves&#148; and &#147;sensory full-body suits&#148; that will allow the computer to transmit information to the wearer via the sense of touch are under development.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>Fly.</B> A term sometimes used in discussing a VR experience that lets the user pass quickly, or fly, through a virtual environment. Some low-end VR systems are referred to as &#147;fly-only environments&#148;&#151;the flyer can direct his or her route but cannot interact with or change the virtual environment.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Head mounted displays (HMDs).</B> These are the stereoscopic screens, about one inch in diameter, on which you view the computer-generated virtual world. The screens, one for each eye, may be <I>CRTs</I> or <I>LCDs</I>. The HMD itself may resemble a helmet with a visor, goggles, or clunky glasses. As technology improves, HMDs are becoming less bulky. More than 17 are currently on the market.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>Liquid crystal displays (LCDs).</B> LCD technology is one of the two current display options for HMDs. LCDs in VR are mini versions of the screens you see on portable computers, game systems, and digital watches.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>Real time.</B> When the actions of a VR user's <I>virtual agent</I> occur simultaneously with those of the VR user, that is real time. Real time is desired. When you do not achieve real time, you experience &#147;lag&#148;&#151;a slight time-lag between what you do and what you see. Lag can make you sick.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Virtual agent.</B> A computer-generated character who acts on behalf of the user in a virtual (computer-generated) environment. If you raise your real hand, you see your virtual agent's hand raise in the VR world.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Virtuality.</B> The virtual environment that the VR user perceives.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>VR data base.</B>  You cannot build a VR environment without a data base.  If you want a VR version of a medieval city scene, you must first compile data that includes all the details: Appearance of the buildings, surroundings, objects, people, etc., that inhabit that environment, as well as data on how those people and objects react to stimuli.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>VR engine.</B> The computer that runs the VR environment. Complex, interactive environments require a much more powerful engine than do <I>fly-only environments</I>.</P></LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Litmus Test</B></P>

<P>Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research, Inc., is credited with coining the term <I>virtual reality</I>, which originally described the use of computer-generated images to give the user the illusion of participating in fabricated events in a fabricated world. The two qualifying characteristics of this &#147;true&#148; VR are total immersion in the fabricated world and ability to interact with and change that world. But as its offshoots and parallel technologies develop and its commercial exploitation becomes rampant, VR is becoming a catchall term for several distinctly different experiences. Is there a litmus test to certify legitimate VR from pretenders going by that name in the marketplace? Not really&#151;definitions are still hotly contended. Following are a few technologies that sometimes carry a VR label.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> <P><B>3-D computer graphics.</B> Three-dimensional representations, often with limited animation. They sometimes require the viewer to wear special glasses to get the full effect.</P></LI>

<LI><P> <B>Experience theaters.</B> In these modern movie houses, moviegoers view films on huge curved screens and are surrounded by stereophonic sounds. Granted, that's not so new&#151;but now your theater seat moves to match the action.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Interactive video.</B> The user views a typical 2-D film but can change the course of that film by exercising options, sometimes just by touching the computer screen.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons).</B> Sometimes referred to as text-based VR adventures, these simulation games are carried out in the cyberspace of the Internet. You input and receive only text messages; the vision is all in your mind's eye.</P></LI>

<LI> <P><B>Telepresence.</B> A computer system under development that allows the remote manipulation of equipment or instruments. One example: Information regarding the movements of a doctor working in a VR environment in one location could be fed electronically to a robotic arm in another location. The robotic arm, mimicking the doctor's actions, would actually work on the real patient.</P></LI>

<P><B><I>To ensure its students enjoy the benefits of on-line access, the San Francisco Day School has addressed community concerns with a full menu of student and parent education, Internet workshops, student Internet use policy and materials, and a parent volunteer program.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>It happened at the beginning of this year. Our school went on line with full Internet access&#151;high speed and in full media. Generous donations, an excited faculty, a terrific Internet provider, and a helpful phone company resulted in a swift transition into the information age. The San Francisco Day School's (SFDS) administration and faculty decided that the first phase of Internet access development would be to create a small but powerful computer center in the library, since we view the Internet as an information source and, therefore, a fundamental library function.</P>

<P>Faculty and students alike were very excited about the access to new sources of information. Images, text, sound, and video from millions of sources on and off the planet are available via the Internet from places like the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Virginia; the Hubble telescope in space; and the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The opportunity for rapid communication with the NASA space crew on the Space Shuttle, relief information on the Kobe earthquake in Japan, and cooperation and response from the global community open doors to different ways of teaching and learning.</P>

<P><B>Concerns and Benefits of Internet Access</B><BR>
The school community recognized early the need for a student Internet use policy. School faculty, parents, and I struggled to come up with a plan. The community was concerned that students would access inappropriate material and that student privacy needs could be compromised. The SFDS Technology Planning Committee, with the help of library parent volunteers, evaluated potential approaches to managing Internet access. The committee, which I chair, is comprised of 13 teachers and administrators who have worked to understand the concerns and the benefits involved in giving our students access to electronic information. The responsibilities of the committee include making recommendations for planning the technology program at SFDS.</P>

<P>Among other challenges faced by the committee was the representation of the Internet in the media. The media tends to pay more attention to access to pornography and inappropriate materials than to the educational potential of electronic information. To balance this representation, the SFDS Technology Committee identified the benefits of on-line access, which include using technology as a critical thinking tool to encourage students to make informational connections and identify degrees of relatedness. Teachers commented on the advantages of technology in integrating the curricula of all subjects, addressing different learning styles through multimedia, and giving students access to more information sources and communication potential than had previously been available. The SFDS faculty are also excited about how the use of networks and multimedia could change portfolio student evaluation. Educators are enthusiastic about interschool collaboration on research projects and the ability to access up-to-date information relating to their subjects.</P>

<P>The SFDS Technology Committee was also worried about students' accessing inappropriate material on line and giving out personal information that could be used by individuals who want to harm children. These issues and others are being addressed by educators through curriculum design and integration that focuses on the use of on-line services and electronic media as a critical thinking tool.</P>

<P>A survey of the fifth- to eighth-grade students at SFDS showed that approximately 30 percent of upper-school children have on-line access at home, with most of them acquiring access within the last year. This discovery underlined the need for a school education program aimed at teaching students and parents common-sense safety practices. When children &#147;go on line,&#148; they leave the building and may meet other people on their journey-other students, teachers, professional experts, or friends. They could also engage in conversations in cyberspace and encounter Internet users who may want to harm children. Just as we educate our children to make intelligent choices when they exit the home environment, we also need to help them exercise common sense when they exit the school environment and travel the planet via wires and satellite.</P>

<P>Traveling on line is also like entering a very large bookstore. Some of the information is not appropriate for children. Such information can be found through a directed search or simply be stumbled upon. Students need guidance on what material is acceptable to access, just as they would in a bookstore. Students will be less confused if the educational message regarding safe and smart use of on-line services is fairly consistent between home and school.</P>

<P>From a technological standpoint, trying to control conversational space and access to inappropriate material at the school would be extremely difficult if not impossible. Some students invariably will excel at manipulating networks and getting around any controls that a system's administrator might put into place. Because of this, and because many of our students have access at home, SFDS chose an approach that focuses on parent and student education as well as student supervision.</P>

<P><B>Education and Supervision</B><BR>
To encourage a more united community approach to managing student use of the Internet, SFDS developed a parent education and volunteer program. Our efforts to involve parents include sending home educational materials and a student contract and conducting monthly workshops on how to use Internet tools. In addition, the Internet center's parent volunteers help develop student use policies and are responsible for supervising and helping students who use the Internet to access computers outside of class time. Parent volunteer suggestions and ideas are critical in developing the management policy for Internet use in the library. When parent volunteers explore the Internet with students in the library, they help the school community come to a consensus about what materials are deemed inappropriate.</P>

<P>A brochure regarding child safety and the use of on-line services is also included in materials sent home with the students. The brochure, &#147;Child Safety on the Information Highway,&#148; was written by Lawrence J. Magid, a syndicated columnist for the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, and produced by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Interactive Services Association. The brochure clearly explains the risks of on-line access and outlines ways to reduce them while using on-line resources. The guidelines ask parents to take responsibility for and become involved in their children's use of on-line services. Parents are also urged to mention the importance of not giving out personal, identifying information. The brochure includes a section titled &#147;My Rules for On-Line Safety&#148;, which is meant to be detached and put near the computer to help remind children of their responsibilities.</P>

<P><LI>I will not respond to any messages that are mean or in any way make me feel uncomfortable. It is not my fault if I get a message like that. If I do, I will tell my parents right away so that they can contact the on-line service.</P>

<P><LI>I will talk with my parents so that we can set up rules for going on line. We will decide upon the time of day that I can be on line, the length of time I can be on line, and appropriate areas for me to visit. I will not access other areas or break these rules without their permission.</P>

<P>Also included in the informational package SFDS sends home to students and parents is a Student Acceptable Use Contract. This contract clearly outlines both parent and child responsibilities and is to be read and signed by both. The contract was modified from a document made available on the Internet by the California Department of Education. This and other information can be found on the Department of Education's gopher server at:</P>
<P><CODE>gopher://gopher.inform.umd.edu/11/Educational_Resources/AcademicResourcesByTopic/<BR>EducationResources/K-12/CalDeptofEducation</CODE></P>

<P>Any students signing the contract must assert that &#147;as a representative of the school, [they] will accept personal responsibility for reporting any misuse of the network to the system administrator.&#148; The contract states that &#147;misuse can come in many forms, but it is commonly viewed as any message(s) sent or received that indicate or suggest pornography, unethical or illegal solicitation, racism, sexism, inappropriate language, and other issues described below.&#148; The contract also requires that the student be polite, use appropriate language, and follow privacy guidelines. Students are taught how to exit quickly from inappropriate material they may have stumbled upon on line. The consequences of not following school guidelines include loss of use and service benefiting the technology program.</P>

<P>When parents sign the contract, they state that they &#147;accept full responsibility for supervision if and when [their] child's use is not in a school setting.&#148; Teachers, through the contract, maintain that they will &#147;agree to instruct the student on acceptable use of the network and proper network etiquette.&#148;</P>

<P>SFDS offers parents monthly hands-on workshops on how to use Internet tools and explore electronic information with their children. Emphasis is placed on using the computer as a tool to bring people together and share experiences. Many of the parents who participate have little experience with computers and no experience with on-line services, and through the workshops they become more comfortable learning how to use new technologies. The workshops generate so much enthusiasm that parents who have attended them often become involved in the parent volunteer program of the school's Internet center.</P>

<P><B>The Parent Volunteer Program</B><BR>
When teachers bring their classes to the library to research information or to communicate via e-mail, they are responsible for student supervision. After school, the library is open for students to explore information on their own time. Since the librarian has many responsibilities at this time, additional supervision was needed at the Internet center.</P>

<P>The Internet center's parent volunteer program helps the school increase the level of supervision of student Internet use and creates opportunities for parents to become much more knowledgeable about Internet access issues. Parent volunteers are responsible for ensuring that students abide by library computer use policies and do not access inappropriate material, supporting student research as much as possible, sharing the students' experiences, and learning about Internet access from the students.</P>

<P>The parent volunteer program can benefit the school community. Increased parental involvement in schools has been identified by the California State Assembly as a way to improve student performance. To encourage this involvement, a new California law allows parents to take time off from work to participate in their children's school activities. The Family-School Partnership Act, Assembly Bill 2590, became state law on January 1. The act was authored by State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin when she was still a state assemblywoman. Eastin commented that &#147;when schools work collaboratively with families, studies show that students have higher grades and test scores, better attendance, fewer placements in special education, more positive attitudes and behavior, higher graduation rates, and greater enrollment in postsecondary education.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Conclusions</B><BR>
The Internet is an incredible information resource and a powerful communication tool. The ability to use new technologies is becoming a more important factor in career options, and the future success of today's students will be more affected by their understanding of and ability to access and use electronic information. The increased use of on-line services in the home by children adds to the impetus for schools to take a more active role in family education regarding their use.</P>

<P>Schools have the potential to be access points and educational centers for exploring Internet resources. Increased involvement of parents in school education programs can help address community concerns and can improve their children's overall academic performance. If educators assume responsibility for helping students master the use of technology and educating them about potential risks, students will become more empowered to make intelligent choices.</P>

<P><B><I>The debate over censorship and electronic communication is misguided, according to this author. The real debate should be over how we can expand horizons&#151;not limit them out of misplaced concern.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>As a teacher in an inner-city school in Richmond, California, I'm delighted that so many people are concerned about the problems I face in my daily work. I'm more than pleased at how concerned influential people are with ensuring that my students inhabit an educational environment that will help them prepare for a productive life. Consider the following efforts being made on county, state, and ideological levels.</P>

<P>Orange County, California, is a county concerned with morality. A recent issue of the <I>Orange County Register</I> included the following report on proposed federal legislation:
<blockquote>
In one corner are politicians who vow to keep the information highway from becoming a red-light district to make it a haven safe for children. They hope to arm themselves with the Communications Decency Act of 1995, a bill that&#133;makes it a crime to transmit obscene or harassing text or images through any electronic media&#133;If the government doesn't act, it would be &#147;an open invitation to&#133;hard-core pornography,&#148; said [U.S. Senator Jim] Exon, D-Neb, the bill's sponsor [See <A HREF="sb2radke.htm">The Proposed Communications Decency Act of 1995</A> Sidebar].</blockquote></P>

<P>The state of California is concerned about taxes that could drive out of the state those businesses interested in hiring my students when they graduate from high school. To avert this loss, Governor Wilson, who wishes to take his vision to a national level, has proposed &#147;cutting&#148; taxes, an action which would reduce state funds for education and gut California's educational system even further. If taxes are cut, there will be no money for poor schools to connect to the Internet.</P>

<P>And if political and economic censorship weren't enough, we have Clifford Stoll's new book, <I>Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Superhighway</I> (Doubleday), proclaiming the social argument that teachers, not cyberspace, make a difference in the life of students. He says the millions that would be spent on computers and connections to the Internet would be better spent on teachers. (Since the teachers in the Richmond Unified School District took a nine percent pay cut four years ago, I have no objection to more money being spent on teachers.) At the Berkeley Mac Users Group Macfest in March, Stoll added that rather than e-mailing pen pals in different countries, children should visit the parks, become involved in their own communities, and not replace real friendships with friendships in virtual environments. He also stated that &#147;people who get the most out of computers are people who follow the rules. People who have the most problems with computers don't follow all of the rules; they are creative people.&#148; Cliff Stoll, it should be noted, has been surfing the Net since the 1973 ARPA Net days.</P>

<P>At a later session of this same Macfest conference, Nora Ponce, a 17-year-old Richmond High student, had this response:
<blockquote>
My neighborhood doesn't have parks or roses to smell, just trash and drugs. Walking home from school or the library, I've been mugged and harassed on the streets&#151;I don't know how many times. Our school library is only open three days a week and doesn't have very much in it, and it's outdated. I found one book for a report I have to do on bandits in Mexico; from the World Wide Web I got 64 responses. It's safer ftp-ing materials from my home with the terminal my school gave me. When I program my MOO environment, I can see things come alive on the computer.</blockquote></P>

<P><B>The World in Which We Live</B><BR>
Richmond High School is typical of any inner-city school in the country. We <I>do</I> have a principal and a core of teachers who are committed to restructuring the educational process. But our school is home to students who are shaped by the social decay of the community-joblessness, homelessness, child abuse, drug abuse, poor nutrition, and few resources outside of churches and a couple of neighborhood houses, all of which lack funds to develop any sort of self-esteem in our students.</P>

<P>Every year our students are subject to drive-by shootings, and every year we give excused absences to large numbers of students to attend the funerals of their schoolmates, friends, and relatives.</P>

<P>The December 1, 1994, issue of <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine included an article on gang violence in the Richmond community. In &#147;Hyper Violence,&#148; Lewis Cole includes this telling quote from a surgeon at Oakland's Children's Hospital: &#147;There's a severe crisis. I had a patient with a stab wound. It turned out he had two outstanding felony warrants on line, one for armed robbery, the other for drug trafficking. [He] was an 11-year-old. I've seen 8-year-olds shot because of gang activity. And the ages are going down.&#148; The present homicide rate in Richmond is 59 per 100,000&#151;these are predominantly public school youth.</P>

<P>&#147;I had to take care of my child the last few days&#151;I have an excuse for missing school,&#148; one of my 16-year-old students told me last week. Every day in the United States, 40 teenage youths give birth to their third child. By grade 12, more than 60 percent of surveyed American students indicated that they had engaged in sexual intercourse.</P>

<P>The lack of jobs for graduates means that students have no incentive to finish school. The drop-out rate in Richmond, at 28 percent, mirrors that of the United States. Among Latino youth it's 48 percent; among African-American youth it's 39 percent.</P>

<P>And the problems of these students engulf the classroom. Students &#147;dis&#148;&#151;make fun of&#151;the teachers as well as each other. Respect for adult authority is almost nonexistent, and adult role models are replaced by gang discipline and gang support. No wonder. We place a literal handful of students in four-year colleges. Jobs are scarce, and many of the summer jobs depend on programs that are federally funded and are constantly in danger of being cut.</P>

<P>While our student body is 88 percent non-white, the staff is overwhelmingly white. In fact, 86 percent of public school teachers in California are white, while most students in inner-city schools are non-white. The teachers have their own problems&#151;salaries are dropping or not keeping up with inflation; supplies and books are scarce. And the cultural divide between students and teachers is great.</P>

<P>After I returned from a sabbatical a few years ago, a student asked me, &#147;Are you a new teacher?&#148; Embarrassed, I wondered aloud why she would say that. &#147;Because you don't yell at us like a lot of the other teachers.&#148; And she was right&#151;for most of our teachers, the love of teaching becomes replaced by the drudgery of surviving another day.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2censo2.gif"align=left hspace=10><I>Les Radke's students are a diverse group. They or their parents come from such countries as Nicaragua, Mexico, Vietnam, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.</I></P>

<P><B>Where are the Role Models?</B><BR>
Adult role models are lacking. Fathers are often absent from their families. Many parents leave the country for Mexico or Central America for long periods of time, giving students the choice of disrupting their education or trying to survive on their own. This is not the problem of self-esteem Doonesbury cartoons make light of in discussing California. This is a lack of self-esteem tied to the struggle to survive.</P>

<P>When these students intersect with the world of technology, it's sometimes enough to drive them to virtual reality. The next time you attend a computer event, or walk around a research facility, be conscious of the number of African-American women or Hispanic or Native-American role models my students would see if they were there. An Asian teacher once told me, &#147;I don't watch football because there are so few Asian women quarterbacks.&#148; This is perhaps not a bad reaction for someone who dreams of having a career in football but, finding no role models in the sport, chooses not to pursue that dream. But it would be an unhealthy reaction for my students who dream of having a career in technology.</P>

<P>Three years ago, I took my students to a Sun World computer exhibit. We arrived in a standard yellow school bus. The students were Hispanic, Asian, and African-American. We had passes to the show from a representative of Visual Technology, an exhibitor. When the security guard saw this motley crew from Richmond High School and their teacher, we were promptly told we couldn't go in. When the exhibitor said our tickets were legitimate, we were reluctantly allowed in. After half an hour, a security guard called me to his booth for the following exchange:<BR>
&#147;Please call your students together. They're disrupting the show.&#148;<BR>
&#147;I don't see them doing anything. What are they doing?&#148;<BR>
&#147;That's the point. Vendors think they're regular attendees.&#148;<BR></P>

<P>The vendors supporting me told me all the vendors had actually taken a vote to exclude students from the exhibit. They had, however, voted to <I>allow</I> students to attend. An official of the Sun User's Group apologized and the following year again offered us tickets to the event. But my students voted not to attend any exhibits outside of Silicon Valley, even though I urged them to go.</P>

<P>One of the officials told me the &#147;problem&#148; was that they were high school students, not that they were non-white. If so, students need another venue through which to learn about future technology.</P>

<P><B>The Internet Alternative</B><BR>
As students go through their lives dealing with violence, decreasing opportunities for jobs, sexual and physical abuse, hunger, lead poisoning, racism, a lack of role models, death, and overwhelmed teachers, they look for alternatives.</P>

<P>No place has more alternatives than the Internet. Our school has a principal who has supported the creative use of technology. We've wired all the rooms in the main building of the school with a 10Base-T connection to our Unix lab. We have a dedicated group of former students and other friends who support us by donating equipment and time in our lab. We have four Sun servers controlled by students. This was done with minimal support from our district, which was nationally known for going bankrupt several years ago.</P>

<P>The students have helped the rooms go on line with the Internet. Because students who understand technology, and the social uses and misuses of it, will help control the shape of the information supercanal, these students are taking control of their future.</P>

<P>Part of this control has been assumed by the more interested students who manage our Web server and MOO server, as well as the computer room itself. MOO, the virtual reality environment allowing people to communicate with each other, allows this poor community access to people all around the world and a shot at equal treatment.</P>

<P>For teachers, having a machine that is a host on the Internet, as opposed to an infrequent and unreliable phone connection, means having a reliable tool to expand their classroom activities. Even the technophobes are drawn in and begin e-mailing to friends, subscribing to lesson plans or hobby groups, and talking to teachers in other parts of the school.</P>

<P>We've now been on the Internet as a full node for one and a half years. The students now tell the teachers how to block unwelcome messages. We have a use policy forbidding swearing or harassing others on the Internet.</P>

<P>But our focus needs to be on providing tools to the students to expand their horizons, not to develop tools and policies to limit them. I agree with the representative from Russia who attended the fall telecommunications conference of the International Society for Technology and Education. He said, &#147;We tried censorship for 70 years, and it helped no one. I'm opposed to limiting people's access to information.&#148;</P>

<HR>
<P>The Maine Youth Apprenticeship Program, developed under former Governor McKernan's administration, was already under way when Congress passed the School-to-Work Opportunities Act.</P>

<P><B>School-to-Work</B> was signed into law in May 1994; it will run until October 1,2001. With an appropriation of $250 million for 1995, it establishes a national framework administered jointly by the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor that has already provided development grants to states for comprehensive school-to-work programs. The Act also provides for implementation grants, which eight states have received so far. Fifteen to 20 more will be awarded in 1995. In addition, 15 partnership grants to bring together local employers and educational institutions and 21 urban/rural opportunities grants for high-poverty areas have been sent to local communities. All of these grant awards, as well as special grants for programs serving Native American youth, are expected to increase.</P>

<P>Existing or planned transition programs such as Tech Prep, cooperative education, and youth apprenticeships provide the foundation for the kinds of initiatives to be fostered statewide. Grant criteria include emphasis on high standards, especially those listed in Goals 2000; instruction that integrates work and school; linkages among secondary schools, junior colleges, and universities; and workplace monitoring and instruction.</P>

<P>Students who complete funded programs successfully will receive at least two credentials: a high school diploma and a certificate attesting to skills recognized and respected by employers. Some students may also receive a two-year college degree or they may opt for further education. For information, contact: Department of Education, 202/260-7278: or Department of Labor, 202/219-6871.</P>

<P>The <B>Maine Youth Apprenticeship Program</B> prepares high school students for the world of work through a combination of intensive classroom learning at school and structured workplace experiences. The program is based on the assumption that young people need better training to succeed in a competitive, global economy and that the challenge is best met if businesses become true partners in the education process.</P>

<P>The involvement of employers includes assessment of students' performance, creation of relevant curriculum, and the development of occupational skill standards specific to given industries. The three-year program provides a direct link to higher education, with students attending high school during the first two years of their participation and a technical college during the third and final year.</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1st Year: 11th Grade</B><BR>
Students spend about 50 percent of their time at school and 50 percent of their time at work in alternating blocks, starting in February. They work full-time during the summer.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B>2nd Year: 12th Grade</B><BR>
Students continue alternating their time between school and work (50 percent of their time at each) and spend summers at their worksites. Students receive high school diplomas.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B>3rd Year: Technical College</B><BR>
Students alternate in blocks of time between school and work (about 50 percent) at each. Apprentices who attain established skill levels receive Certificates of Skills Mastery listing specific occupational skills mastered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Apprentices, who must survive a competitive selection process, earn about $85 a week as long as they are enrolled (whether they are in a school-based or workplace-based block), with a raise each year, and they receive one year of free tuition at a technical school. During this time, the students are considered employees, not of the firms where they work, but of the Center for Youth Apprenticeship, the office housed at Southern Maine Technical College that oversees the program. The money comes from the $5,000 payments per apprentice that businesses make to join the program. In return, the program guarantees the quality of the apprentices' academic skills (the guarantees are based on proven outcomes in academic testing rather than records of time served in class) and promises to provide remedial retraining free if an apprentice fails to measure up to expectations. The program also provides liaison and technical help to the businesses, schools, and students, and offers training and support to the business and the "meister" (the mentor/supervisor) who oversees the student.</P>

<P>Students' classroom work consists of rigorous courses in math, science, English, and social studies (sometimes in &#147;applied&#148; versions of these subjects), and students must demonstrate high levels of both academic and social skills to succeed.</P>

<P>Apprenticeships are offered in many career fields, including manufacturing, allied health, machine tool, computers, customer service, banking and finance, and others.</P>

<P>In January 1995, 35 Maine high schools combined with 57 state businesses to offer youth apprenticeship opportunities to a total of 70 students. Over the next five years, officials hope that all high schools in the state will participate.</P>

<HR>

<P>According to the National Center for Education Statistics' report, <I>Adult Literacy in America: A First Look at the Results of the National Adult Literacy Survey</I> (NALS), almost half of U.S. adults&#151;nearly 100 million people over the age of 16&#151;demonstrate low levels of literacy skills. The NALS measures levels of literacy skills based on participants' performance on a wide variety of tasks, including &#147;prose, document, and quantitative proficiency.&#148; Demographic and educational information is surveyed, as well as reading practices and other areas related to literacy.</P>

<P>Those who are classified in the two lowest levels of literacy in the report don't perceive themselves to be at any risk from their lack of skills. But according to the results of the survey, which was administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) for the U.S. Department of Education to 26,000 adults, there is a direct correlation between literacy skills and economic status.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Individuals demonstrating higher levels of literacy were more likely to be employed, work more weeks in a year, and earn higher wages than those demonstrating lower proficiencies.</LI>

<LI>Adults in the lowest level on each of the literacy scales were far more likely than those in the two highest levels to report receiving food stamps.</LI>

<LI>Nearly half of all adults in the lowest level on each literacy scale were living in poverty, while fewer than 10 percent of those in the two highest proficiency levels lived in poverty.</LI>
</UL>

<P>&#147;This report is a wake-up call to the sheer magnitude of illiteracy in this country and underscores literacy's strong connection to economic status,&#148; said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. &#147;It paints a picture of a society in which the vast majority of Americans do not know that they do not have the skills they need to earn a living in our increasingly technological society and international marketplace.&#148;</P>

<P>The report also points out the risk that U.S. society may become more divided racially and socioeconomically. Already black families are three times more likely to live in poverty than are white families. One in five children is born into poverty; one in two children, in minority populations. Education levels (and increased literacy and life skills) for the poorest U.S. citizens are lower; therefore, their employment potential suffers. And the cost to American society in terms of public assistance grows.</P>

<P>According to the National Center on Education and the Economy's 1990 report, <I>America's Choice: High Skills or Low Wages!</I>, males ages 24 to 34 years who are college educated have increased their earnings by 10 percent over the last 15 years, while those with only high school diplomas have seen theirs decrease by 9 percent. Furthermore, the earnings gaps between professionals and clericals and white-collar workers and skilled tradespeople are growing.</P>

<P>Clearly, education continues to be the crucial catalyst in determining success in U.S. society, when measured by employability and economic status. Mere subsistence literacy no longer will do, as technological advances continue to propel this country from an industrial to an information economy. In addition, the sense of citizenship in American society suffers, as the NALS report points out, because those in the lower levels of the literacy scales also are less likely to vote.</P>

<P>What's the problem? The Executive Summary of the NALS report concludes: &#147;If large percentages of adults had to do little more than be able to sign their name on a form or locate a single fact in a newspaper or table, then the levels of literacy seen in this survey might not warrant concern. We live in a nation, however, where both the volume and variety of written information are growing and where increasing numbers of citizens are expected to be able to read, understand, and use these materials.&#148;</P>

<HR>
<P>Many of the small public schools in New York City which have succeeded in recent years were created by four organizations: ACORN (New York Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), the Center for Educational Innovation, the Fund for New York City Public Education, and the Center for Collaborative Education. In 1994 the Annenberg Foundation asked these organizations to sponsor, collaborate, and form New York Networks for School Renewal to reform the New York City school system. The foundation also provided an Annenberg Challenge grant of $25 million for five years to help fund the project. This reform initiative consists of three levels: the creation of more small schools, the development of networks among these small schools, and the acceptance of these networks into the Learning Zone, a citywide demonstration project.</P>

<P><B>More small schools.</B> The project builds on more than 80 small schools already working with the
four sponsors. These schools include a variety of grade levels, methods of operation and governance, themes, and individual characters.</P>

<P>School themes vary from the School for the Physical City that uses the city's infrastructure as a textbook to the John V. Lindsay Wildcat Academy that has created a businesslike environment in which troubled 16- to 20-year-olds attend school throughout the year from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., completing assignments during school hours. Other schools include the El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice, the Monroe Academy for Business and Law, the School for Writing and Publishing, and the Museum School, which incorporates weekly field trips to local museums and models its curriculum on museum research.</P>

<P>These schools share common principles involving student learning and development, assessment of students and schools, collaboration with parents and community, school-based management, and school choice for students, family, and staff. The flexibility afforded these small schools enables teachers to experiment with teaching techniques and to mix students from different grades, provides students with smaller class sizes, and involves parents and the community in the school's success. Most of these schools' students come from surrounding neighborhoods and are admitted on a first-come, first-served basis.</P>

<P>Over the next few years, the project will create an additional 50 small schools. Some will be new, and others will result from breaking up and redesigning existing large schools or chronically deficient schools. The resulting body of small schools will eventually serve a diverse student body of at least 50,000&#151;the equivalent of a mid-sized city school system&#151;in a school system projected to have 1.3 million schoolchildren by the year 2000.</P>

<P><B>Networks of small schools. </B>The development of networks among these small schools is the
project's key mechanism for stimulating and spreading innovation among schools and for exploring alternatives to the traditional hierarchy of school control and accountability. The founding 80 schools have formed 20 networks of three to seven related or like-minded schools. Each network reflects a variety of grade levels, locations, philosophies, and operations.</P>

<P>These collaborations provide member schools with mutual support, elicit ideas, and help strengthen school management, student and school assessment, and public accountability. Networks meet regularly and share resources, technology, professional development and curricula, and interschool visits and activities involving staff, students, and families.</P>

<P><B>The Learning Zone.</B> As the networks develop into functioning collaborations, they will be invited
to apply to join the Learning Zone. A review panel of state and city education officials, educators, parents, and community leaders will review applications and assess each network's reliability and credibility.</P>

<P>Schools in the Learning Zone networks will have more direct access to their share of public resources and the power to decide how to use them. They will also shoulder more demanding responsibilities as they are held publicly accountable for their decisions and work.</P>

<P>As a citywide demonstration project, the Learning Zone will test the viability and effectiveness of the project's lessons in how to recast the public school system.</P>

<P>New York Networks for School Renewal's bottom line is to see whether this new form of operation improves student achievement, does so in an equitable fashion, and is fiscally responsible for the use of public funds. Throughout the project, a university-based research team is observing and documenting how participating schools and networks go about their business, with an emphasis on determining how well they educate the full range of students and use the public's money.</P>

<P>Project partners include Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City Board of Education President Carol A. Gresser, Schools Chancellor Rudolph F. Crew, and United Federation of Teachers President Sandra Feldman.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><I>It's The Law</I></H1>
<H3 ALIGN=RIGHT>By John Pesta</H3>
<HR>
<P><B>Old Law, New IDEA</B><BR>
The Education of the Handicapped Act of 1975 gave disabled children the right to be educated with nondisabled students &#147;to the maximum extent appropriate.&#148; In 1990 the title of this law was changed to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, and greater provisions were made to ensure that all children receive the educational services they require. Public schools now have responsibilities to identify the technology that students need, to obtain appropriate devices, and to provide necessary services. Because all children are entitled to a &#147;free appropriate public education,&#148; schools must provide assistive technology free of charge. This can be a problem for budget-strapped districts; therefore, local officials sometimes resist buying highly expensive equipment that only one student will use. Nevertheless, in cases where the devices are required solely for educational purposes, the schools have no choice. Because the local education agency is required to implement a special-education student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP), it must make available any technological devices that are necessary for school-related activities, including homework. If a school district refuses to implement the IEP or offers to provide less desirable devices (perhaps because of cost), dissatisfied parents may demand a due-process hearing before an impartial third party to resolve the issue. However, in a case where a student needs an assistive device not only for educational reasons but also for general living purposes, there is some question as to who must pay for it. Each case is handled individually, and there is no simple pro-forma procedure.</P>

<P><B>The Tech Act</B><BR>
The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, generally referred to as the Tech Act, is intended to expand the availability of assistive technology for all persons with disabilities. The law authorizes grant incentives for all 50 states to develop programs of technology-related assistance. Among their many services, these programs help disabled individuals learn to use devices appropriate for their specific needs.</P>

<P><B>Americans with Disabilities Act</B><BR>
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) is the most comprehensive federal civil-rights law specifically for people with disabilities. It extends to physically impaired persons the same protections that other civil-rights laws give to individuals on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and religion. The ADA guarantees equal opportunity in employment, public accommodations, transportation, state and local government services, and telecommunications.</P>

<P><B>Les Radke</B> is a Regional Occupation Program (vocational education) teacher at Richmond High School (RHS) in Richmond, California, where for the past 20 years he has emphasized integration of technology into the curriculum. Most of his students are low-income, academically at-risk, and minority. Radke's classes have become a hands-on laboratory for training computer professionals&#151;a significant number of his students have gotten jobs in industry as system managers. Former students on Radke's advisory committee, now computer professionals, have provided advice and technology donations to keep RHS's program up-to-date. Radke takes yearly trips to Russia, where he taught in the public schools for a year. Backpacking in the Wind River Range is one of his other high-tech loves. He checks his e-mail at les@rop.edu.</P>

<HR>
<P>In late January of this year, U.S. Senator Jim Exon (D-Neb) proposed the Communications Decency Act of 1995 to &#147;stop those who electronically cruise the digital universe to engage children in inappropriate communications&#133;or electronically stalk users of computer networks.&#148; As an updated revision of the Communications Act of 1934, this act would include tougher penalties for obscene, indecent, or harassing use of telecommunications devices (a maximum fine of $100,000 and a maximum jail sentence of two years) and require cable systems to scramble adult pay-per-view programming to ensure non-subscribing households do not receive unwanted, explicit material.</P>

<P>Internet users have responded to the proposed act with petitions and letter-writing campaigns seeking to kill the bill, which not only would hold the sender liable for illegal material but also would hold the service provider liable. Columnist Stephen Chapman argued that &#147;to ban material in a new medium that we tolerate in old ones is to let the novelty of strange gadgets warp our judgment&#148; (March 26, 1995, <I>Chicago Tribune</I>). The bill would create two major problems, Chapman contends. First, on-line services would be exposed to liability &#147;just for letting adults willingly converse, or exchange material, on sexual subjects of interest to both.&#148; Second, the measure would curtail children's access to adult fare and the &#147;freedom of adults to see and read what they choose.&#148;</P>

<P>In mid-March, the act was adopted without debate and included in a general telecommunications bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. If the Senate passes the bill, the House will have a chance to consider it and either vote it down or pass it and recommend changes. If both the Senate and House agree on a revised version, the bill may be presented to President Clinton for signing as early as this summer.

<P><B><I>Precedents for future legal cases involving the K&#150;12 environment, censorship, and electronic communication could be set in pending cases that involve adults. Individual schools and school districts should formulate and implement use policies now that limit provider liability and minimize student exposure to inappropriate material.</I></B></P>
<BR>

<P>&#147;Students do not leave their rights at the school-house gate.&#148;<BR>
<I>Tinker v. Des Moines</I>, 1967, p. 12</P>

<P><I>Tinker v. Des Moines</I> (1967), the seminal Supreme Court ruling on free speech and expression rights, contained this now familiar quote regarding students' rights. It bears directly on any discussion of questions surrounding the rapidly evolving issue of censorship and pupils' access to the Internet and other forms of electronic communication. However, one of the difficulties associated with attempting to formulate a coherent policy on censorship in cyberspace is that all of the key court cases involving student speech predate widespread access to electronic communications. For example, speech cases such as Tinker, upholding the rights of Vietnam-era protesters, and <I>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</I>, affirming the right of school administrators to control student publications, were adjudicated prior to the burgeoning of Internet bulletin board services and technology reform initiatives (such as Goals 2000 and the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 that created the National Research Education Network, NREN) that encourage schools to use the Internet as an educational resource.</P>

<P>Rather than attempt a comprehensive examination of legal issues related to Internet access, this piece focuses on two key issues that must be considered if we are to define the problem and frame district policy solutions.</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>We must consider the difficulties surrounding definitions of obscenity and censorship that might limit freedom of expression.
<LI>We must consider the responsibility of carriers who provide users with access to information from myriad network resources, many of them not explicitly designed for educational use with students in grades K&#150;12. 
</OL>

<P><B>The Eye of the Beholder</B><BR>
What material is obscene, and when is censorship justified? Forty-one states have statutes that prohibit the distribution of obscene materials to minors. Rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments have never extended to obscene material. But who determines what is obscene? Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart declined to state a comprehensive definition of obscene materials but said of pornographic material, &#147;I know it when I see it&#148; (<I>Jacobellis v. State of Ohio</I>, 1964). As his statement infers, determining obscenity has rightly been relegated to localities because of the recognized differences among community values (<I>Miller v. California</I>, 1973). In Miller, conditions for determining &#147;obscenity&#148; were met if the average person, applying current community standards, would find that the materials were offensive, designed to arouse immoral or lustful desire, or  appealed to &#147;prurient&#148; interests.</P>

<P>On the Internet, the process of defining obscene materials based on community standards is complicated because materials originating in one locale are distributed to another. In a recent Tennessee case, Robert and Carleen Thomas were convicted on 12 obscenity charges when a Tennessee postal inspector subscribed to their adults-only, California-based bulletin board service and downloaded images judged to be obscene in Tennessee. The Thomas case aside, the general spirit of <I>Miller v. California </I>(1973) still provides the guiding tenet for determining obscenity, though even this issue has been clouded by the character of electronic network distribution and access.</P>

<P>Determining whether material is obscene is but one key factor related to policy that may limit minors' access to these materials. The other factor is determining who is responsible if unacceptable or unsuitable materials find their way into the hands of or onto the computer screens accessed by school children. Not surprisingly, in the context of rapidly evolving Internet legal issues, the responsibility of carriers&#151;on-line services like America Online or CompuServ&#151;that provide access to Internet information is unclear. However, control over information is the central issue. Common carriers such as phone companies have been judged free of liability for damages since they have no control over the information transmitted via their service. In contrast, print publications that exert full editorial control over published works are fully liable for damages resulting from printed work. A recent court case has upheld these trends with reference to electronic carriers. In a 1991 ruling, <I>Cubby v. CompuServ</I>, a federal trial court ruled in favor of the carrier in a defamation claim resulting from an item in a newsletter distributed via CompuServ. The court noted that CompuServ had neither knowledge nor reason to know of the contents of the newsletter. Although CompuServ had the right to edit the newsletter, its liability was limited because of the impracticability of reviewing every item posted using its service.</P>

<P>Some providers choose to exercise more control over access than do the commercial on-line services. Recently, for example, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh made headlines when its administrators dropped from its servers certain bulletin boards that contained sexually explicit materials. The university cited its worry that because it had formal knowledge of the offensive images, it risked criminal liability for carrying the materials (because first-year college students are often minors). Several Internet watchdog groups, such as the Electronic Freedom Frontier, believe Carnegie Mellon overstepped its responsibility and chose censorship when a &#147;sensible-use&#148; policy would have sufficed to solve the problem.</P>

<P>For school districts, formulating enforceable policies that address the suitability of materials and carrier liability issues is critical. Even in the current climate of evolving legal frameworks, it is possible to make a policy that limits the school's exposure to liability and realizes the enormous educational potential of information networks. Teachers, parents, administrators, and service providers can work together to delineate responsibility and the kinds of access that will be acceptable and appropriate for students in their district.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="2intcar.gif" align=left hspace=10>A reasonable district policy can be formulated that places responsibility on the user and apprises parents of the possible hazards of Internet access and their right to limit their child's access to those materials. In such a policy statement, parents and students would be defined as the responsible parties and arbiters of suitable materials. Teachers would be defined as supervisors of young children at school, and access to files by system operators and school officials would be clearly stated. A brief and understandable user agreement and parent permission form should be signed and returned to the school where it can be kept on record.</P>

<P>To date, no cases involving school districts and obscenity and liability issues are pending. There are, however, cases involving adults and obscenity, privacy, and First Amendment rights that may foreshadow cases and rulings for public schools. What is essential in this atmosphere of emerging legal precedent is that school districts work with community stakeholders to draft and implement network use policies that offer access to the vast educational resources of electronic networks, protect minors from unsuitable materials, and provide districts and carriers with relief from liability.</P>

<P>As a group, home schoolers tend to score higher than their peers on standardized achievement tests. A study completed in 1991 by the Psychological Association considered the standardized test scores used to measure whether children were meeting grade-level expectations. The Association analyzed the scores of 5,124 home-schooled students from all 50 states and in grades K&#150;12 and found that they ranked 18 to 28 percentile points above public school averages for reading, math, and language arts. An analysis of data from the spring 1994 Iowa Tests of Basic Skills by Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem, Oregon, revealed similar results. The more than 16,000 home-schooled children from all 50 states in grades K&#150;12 who completed the tests resulted in a nationwide average for home-schooled students in the 77th percentile on the Basic Battery, 79th percentile for reading, 73rd percentile for math, and 73rd percentile for language.</P>

<P>State-by-state analyses, however, reveal more mixed, but generally positive, results. A 1985 analysis by the Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction found that the average scores state home schoolers were at the 62nd percentile in reading, 53rd percentile in math, and the 56th percentile in language.  Public high school counselor Jon Wartes tracked the SAT scores of hundreds of Washington state home-schooled children in grades K-12 for several years. In reports published annually from 1987 through 1990, and available from the Washington Home school Research Project in Woodinville, Wartes found that home schooners consistently scored above the national average in reading, language, math, and science, with a median score at about the 67th percentile. Other studies have resulted in similar findings, with the home educated in Montana averaging, at the 72nd percentile, in North Dakota at about the 85th percentile, and in Oklahoma at the 88th percentile.

<P>The home schooling newsgroup on Internet provides a forum through which educators and others interested in home schooling can share their experiences and seek information. The responses to a brief survey posted on this newsgroup illustrate some of the applications of technology in the home school (contact: misc.education.home-school.misc).</P>

<P>Bill Gidzak is currently teaching his sons programming in Qbasic and C++: &#147;The boys have a good grasp of the languages, but now we want to progress to doing things in robotics. Our proposal is to make robots (out of Legos or whatever), access them through a serial port, and write programs that will manipulate these robots.&#148; Although they are having difficulty finding information on accessing serial ports in Qbasic, their query through the newsgroup may lead them to what they need to know (contact: bgidzak@minet.gov.mb.ca).</P>

<P>James Henderson of Dayton, Ohio, provides a lengthier response. &#147;With proper technology,&#148; he writes, &#147;students from all over can have access to shared material, can share ideas with others from around the world, and can have access to almost anything one might find in a public school. PCs give students computing power unthinkable a decade ago, and educational software allows the student a different &#145;teacher&#146; for a while. [Upon entering the workplace,] the well-equipped home-schooler should be able to walk right into a company, sit down, and use the same software and hardware that they have at home.&#148; For Henderson, a parent with two to three years of homeschooling experience and an instructor of software engineering with a master's in computer science, the ideal home school environment would include cable TV or a satellite dish, a powerful multimedia PC with Internet access service and good software. &#147;Basically, the only thing that a public high school has that we don't is an auto shop, a wood shop, a chemistry lab, and a football team.&#148;</P>

<HR>

<P>I have been asked more than once to chronicle my work in creating comprehensive corporate/education technology partnerships since 1982. This article is my first positive response. My reluctance has not been based on a desire to keep some secret process intact, but instead is due to my experience with those who pick up an article looking for a quick-and-dirty list of static &#147;how-to&#148; items that can be generically applied without regard to context.</P>

<P>Usually, the result of misapplied concepts is failure, and that causes us to turn in disdain to the dreaded &#147;how-to&#148; article. Possible progress is deferred or compromised; education fails to improve as it might otherwise, and teachers and students lose their opportunity for an improved environment. Those who &#147;knew things would not work&#148; are affirmed, and it is harder to try again. There is always a good excuse for why things cannot work.</P>

<P>For a decade, I have been creating K&#150;12 and higher education partnerships that do work for all involved. That was done while working from within institutions and as an outside consultant for institutions. Thus far, I am still welcome to return to the K&#150;12 schools and the college campuses that were involved in those projects, and the companies still do business with me. The breakthroughs in the application of technology or in new systems still work today, and faculty and students use them. However, each project was different.</P>

<P>Whether the partners were AT&T, GTE North, South Western Communications, Dynacom, GTE edna, Northern Telecom, the regional Bell companies, or others, the partnerships have varied with the people, the opportunity, and the local context. The University of Pittsburgh and AT&T&#151;a partnership that resulted in the first Campus of the Future project in 1983&#151;were quite a different time and place from the K&#150;12 schools in Westfield, Indiana, and The America School 2000 project with GTE North in 1992.</P>

<P>Therefore, the accompanying article is useless unless the reader is willing to apply the ideas flexibly within a context complicated by personalities, historic practices that may or may not be wise today, risk-aversion traditions, conflicting corporate philosophies within the same company, technology change, regulatory change, economic timing, and community differences&#151;to list just a few. I much prefer to communicate my ideas and explain some of the issues of partnerships through video conferences, which I did in 1984, 1989, and 1992. The dynamics involved with live or even interactive video conferences far exceed the static nature of the written word. While I am willing to share my experiences, I am conscious of the limitations of this article and therefore caution the reader to consider his or her context while reading it.</P>

<P>Articles are always too short to be comprehensive and this one is no exception. Life, careers, and education and business entities all share long-term prospects in most cases. Short-term decisions of an unnecessarily competitive (as opposed to cooperative) nature come back to haunt us over time. Long-term partnerships usually leave us with contributions on which we can reflect with pride; they are the basis for substantive organizational improvement and professional career growth. They involve some vision, some calculated risks, and a good bit of work, but this world in which we must live and retire inevitably will treat us better for our creation of sound business/education improvement partnerships. It is both a selfish and wise choice, from my experience. There are few alternatives that do so well.</P>

<P>Partnerships and technology are just tools for positive change in education. There are no cookie-cutter answers to complex, ambiguity-filled problems such as the challenge of improving education. I have been successful in most projects because I insisted that my clients remember this, and I have insisted that they recall that two four-letter words&#151;&#147;work&#148; and &#147;luck&#148;&#151;are far more prevalent in such projects than either &#147;risk&#148; or &#147;genius.&#148; I wish to be a part of the solution to education's problems, not a source of more problems.</P>

<HR>
<P><I>The following analysis of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the legislation, but an evaluation of specific sections of the bill that have received little coverage elsewhere and are of importance to public interest advocates. The Benton Foundation's Communications Policy Project promotes public interest values and noncommercial services for the National Information Infrastructure through research, policy analysis, publishing, and outreach. The complete analysis is available online at http://www.cdinet.com/cgi-bin/text-only/Benton/Goingon/telecom-post.html and from The Benton Foundation at 1634 Eye Street N.W., 12th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20006, (202) 638-5770.</I></P>

<P>On August 4, 1995, the House of Representatives approved its version of telecommunications reform legislation, H.R. 1555, by a vote of 305-117. The Senate passed a companion bill, S.652, in June. A conference committee convened in September to reconcile the House and Senate versions. After a series of delays and negotiations between both houses and the administration, a reconciled version of the telecommunications bill was completed in late December. On February 1, 1996, the Congress passed the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996. The House voted on the bill first, passing it 414 to 16. The Senate voted on the measure two hours later. The tally was 91 to 5. The bill was signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996.</P>

<P>The legislation will fundamentally affect the emerging &#147;information superhighway,&#148; shaping how it is built as well as the scope and control of its content. Basic features of the bill include extensive deregulation, relaxed restrictions on concentration of media ownership, and a preference for private market forces over public responsibility guarantees in ensuring access to telecommunications services.</P>

<P>Although the legislation includes some acknowledgement of public interest concerns, such as universal service, implementation of the bill's many provisions may undermine public interest values of access and equity. Our analysis focuses on the low probability that a universal service package will include advanced telecommunications services or any acknowledgment of public interest uses of technology.</P>

<P><B>Universal Service</B></P>

<P>The Conference Committee version of the bill directs a Federal-State Joint Board to recommend a definition of and funding mechanisms for universal service to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The main provisions within the universal service section of the bill describe the board, the principles upon which universal service will be based, and a baseline definition of universal service.</P>

<P><B>Composition and purpose of the Federal-State Joint Board.</B> The bill calls for a Federal-State Joint Board comprising three federal representatives, four state representatives, and a state-appointed utility consumer advocate to recommend actions to the FCC and state commissions for the preservation of universal service. The board must submit its suggestions to the FCC within nine months of the legislation's enactment. The FCC must complete any proceeding to act on the board's initial recommendations within 15 months of enactment.</P>

<P><B>Universal service principles.</B> The legislation directs the joint board to base the preservation of universal service on six general principles, but stipulates that the board may consider additional principles in making its recommendations. These principles are (1) quality and rates, (2) access to advanced services, (3) access in rural and high-cost areas, (4) equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions by providers to the preservation and advancement of universal service, (5) specific and predictable support mechanisms, and (6) access to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health-care facilities, and libraries. The board, the FCC, and state commissions should promote in all regions of the nation rates &#147;that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.&#148;</P>

<P>The Senate language which includes the broad assertion that &#147;access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided in all regions of the Nation,&#148; was retained over weaker House language. Similarly, the Senate concept that &#147;[e]lementary and secondary schools and classrooms, healthcare providers, and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services&#148; was retained. Further, the bill retained a Senate provision that would give rural health-care facilities and most schools and libraries special rates for access to telecommunications facilities.</P>

<P><B>Funding.</B> The Conference bill contains language modeled on the House version, providing that &#147;[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Definition.</B> When defining the telecommunications services included in universal service obligations, the bill directs the joint board to consider the extent to which such telecommunication services have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers; are essential to education, public health, or public safety; are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by telecommunications carriers; and are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</P>

<P>Because each of these factors is to be considered in conjunction with the others, and because it is unlikely that any advanced telecommunications service will be widely subscribed to and defined as essential to the public health, safety, or interest in the foreseeable future, it is improbable that the board or the FCC will include any advanced telecommunications or information services in universal service plans. Unlike the House bill, however, the Conference bill anticipates ongoing review of universal service obligations.</P>

<P>The Conference bill does not include the Senate language that those who define universal service should consider the potential of telecommunications technology to affect civic life, health, and education. The bill does retain the Senate requirement that, in addition to considering consumers' market choices, the FCC's determination of the services to be included in universal service should take into account &#147;advances in telecommunications and information services.&#148; However, absent from the bill is language that the Commission should determine which services &#147;are essential for Americans to participate effectively in the economic, academic, medical, and democratic processes of the Nation.&#148; This enumeration of the potential benefits of telecommunications would have allowed for a broader interpretation of which services should be considered essential enough to be included in universal service schemes.</P>

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="/images/technos/nsf.gif" border=4 align=left>The Office of Systemic Reform was established in June 1992 to serve as a focal point for the Directorate for Education and Human Resources' growing emphasis on systemic reform of the science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education (SMETE) infrastructure. The office works with states, major cities, and rural regions to meet its two broad goals: to support educational systemic reform activities and to improve the academic research capabilities of states that traditionally have been underrepresented in the nation's science and technology enterprise. To achieve its goals, the office has established four programs:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The Statewide Systemic Initiatives (SSI)</LI>
<LI>The Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI)</LI>
<LI>The Rural Systemic Initiatives (RSI)</LI>
<LI>The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)</LI>
</OL>

<P>The statewide, urban, and rural initiatives support educational systemic reform by providing large-scale awards to stimulate systemic change, principally in K-12 education. EPSCoR is directed at developing the academic research and development capability of states that have historically been less competitive in obtaining research funding.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Through the <B>Statewide Systemic Initiatives</B> (SSI) program, NSF supports the efforts of 24 states and Puerto Rico to establish comprehensive changes in science and mathematics education through the development and alignment of new standards, partnerships, policies, and practices. The initiatives respond to state and local needs but typically cover teacher development, changes in governance, curriculum and instruction, and statewide assessments.</P>
<P>The maturing SSI program is having a positive effect on the science, mathematics, and technology education community. Collaboration among elementary and secondary education and higher education is now common; representatives of business and industry and educators work together regularly; curriculum, instruction, assessment, and staff development have become increasingly aligned; and policy makers are reducing policy barriers and creating enabling policy and legislation. Other agencies, notably the U.S. Department of Education, are emulating NSF's SSI program, with systemic reform applied to both science and nonscience disciplines.</P>

<LI><P>The <B>Urban Systemic Initiatives </B>(USI) program targets the 25 U.S. cities with the largest numbers of school-age children living in poverty. School districts in these cities are challenged through USI to reform their science and mathematics programs and provide high-quality education in these areas for all students. The USI addresses the need for systemic change in science and mathematics education at the elementary and secondary levels and the need for enhanced productivity for groups that have been underserved by our educational system. In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, USI awarded planning grants to each of the eligible cities. The first cohort of implementation awards was made in FY 1994 to Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, El Paso, Miami, New York City, and Phoenix. The second cohort of awards is being made in FY 1995 to Cleveland, Columbus, Fresno, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans, and
Philadelphia.</P>

<P>The USI program has had a positive impact on the ways that cities conceptualize, organize, and conduct science and mathematics education; the way they allocate their budgets and coordinate existing programs; and the way they increase support from educators, business and community leaders, and policy makers (including mayors) for SMETE and collaboration among all levels of education.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The <B>Rural Systemic Initiatives</B> (RSI) program supports systemic reform of mathematics and science education in rural areas where more than 30 percent of the school-age children live in poverty. The first RSI awards for planning and development were given in FY 1994. In FY 1995, five-year implementation awards are being made to coalitions from Alaska, Appalachia, the Four Corners (Southwest), and the High Plains. The RSI program has helped to establish communication and partnerships across state and tribal lines and has resulted in several joint ventures in distance learning and telecommunications.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The <B>Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</B> (EPSCoR) was established in 1979 to increase the academic research capability and the competitiveness of research faculties in states that have had a relatively low number of NSF research awards. Eighteen states and Puerto Rico have participated in the program to date. Through EPSCoR, participating states have made significant advances in the quality of their graduate training and research efforts. The program provides a partnership between NSF and a state to develop improved science and technology (S&T) educational quality and opportunity, increased competitiveness for research and development funds, and development of an S&T infrastructure capable of supporting a knowledge-intensive economy. EPSCoR achieves its objectives through three- to five-year cooperative agreements, smaller nonrenewable awards to be used as "venture capital" to implement S&T efforts that exhibit significant potential for future growth, and co-sponsorship of select research projects with the foundation's research programs.</P></LI>

	As the prologue indicates, Mann Packing Company, Incorporated was founded in 1939 by H.W. "Cy" Mann.  Today, Mann Packing Company is the worlds largest shipper of fresh broccoli, as well as a shipper of over 35 different fresh vegetable commodities packed in 175 pack specifications. These packs are designed for the retail, wholesale, foodservice and export markets. 
	<p>
	In 1976 Mr. Mann welcomed Bill Ramsey and Don Nucci as partners in the firm. These partners in progress have not only led a quality team of personnel into building one of the most well-respected brands in the  fresh vegetable industry, but are champions on behalf of the industry and their community through the many additional activities they lend their leadership and support to.
<p>
<b>William "Bill" Ramsey</b><br>
	Ramsey joined Mann in 1955 where he directed growing and harvesting operations. Today he serves as company president and directs Manns quality systems in field-harvesting operations.
	<p>
	Ramsey is currently chairman of the board of Western Growers Association (WGA). WGA is an agricultural trade association whose members grow, pack and ship 90 percent of the fresh vegetables and about 60 percent of the fresh fruit and nuts in Arizona and California.
	<p>
	Besides being a WGA director for over 12 years, Bill is also a trustee for WGAs Pension Trust. His role as a member of WGAs Political Action Committee has taken him to Washington, D.C. on many occasions to testify before Congress on issues concerning American agriculture.
<p>
	 On a state level, the California Women for Agriculture have presented Bill with a Distinguished Service Award. He is also a honorary lifetime member of the California Teachers-Parents Association.
<p>
	Not many people in the local Salinas area can deny Bill Ramseys involvement in community issues. Ever since being voted the Salinas Jaycees outstanding young man of the year in 1967, Bills had a hard time learning to say "no." Hes a committed and driven man who believes strongly in family, community and charity. When he lends his time and support to a cause, you can bet its going to succeed.
<p>
	Bill is a past president of the Grower-Shipper Vegetable Association of Central California. He is a trustee of the Sun Street Alcohol Rehabilitation Center and has been a director of the California Rodeo for 15 years. He also served as Salinas City School Board president in 1987. His many years of service as a trustee for Hartnell Community College led them to thank him this past year by presenting him with an honorary degree. 
<p>
	Bill resides in Salinas with his wife Marlene Sbrana Ramsey. He has four children, three of which are involved at Mann Packing Company. Hes also the proud grandfather of eight lovely children.
<p>
<b>Don Nucci</b><br>
	Don joined Mann Packing Company in 1967 as office manager. He currently is secretary-treasurer for the firm and directs all sales and marketing.
<p>
	In 1984 Nucci was named THE PACKERs Produce Marketer of the Year. 
THE PACKER is the agricultural industrys Wall Street Journal  and each year honors an individual that has contributed significantly to the advancement of the marketing of fresh produce. The award is given on a national level at the Produce Marketing Association Convention and Exposition. In addition to this national recognition, Don served on the board of directors of the Produce Marketing Association for several years.
<p>
	Don also served on the board of directors for the Center for Produce Quality (CPQ) which was formed after the 1989 Alar Scare (a result of a story on 60 Minutes  regarding the safety of apples). CPQ was designed to unite the produce industry and allow them to respond quickly and accurately to misrepresentation of the safety of our food supply in the media. 
	<p>
	Don served as the founding president of the Central Coast Ag Task Force. He is also a past president of the Grower Shipper Vegetable Association of Central California. He also served on the board of directors of the Spreckels Union School District. 
<p>
	Don is a Salinas native which is evident in his involvement with the community. From coaching Little League to sponsoring scholarships for the children of farm-laborers, Don believes strongly in supporting education and recreational activities for the children and young adults of our city. His son and daughters may have played ball and graduated from local schools a few years ago, but Don can still be seen cheering in the booster section, coaching girls softball, and barbecuing tri-tip in the rain to raise money and support for his favorite teams.
<p>
	Don continues to reside in Salinas with his wife, Joan. He currently has three children working at Mann Packing and a fourth attending the University of Arizona. He also has a new grandson, Joseph Mathew Nucci.
<p>
	Mann Packing Company is a family-owned organization with roots running deep into the Salinas Valley. Weve been in business for 55 years and some of those years have been good, some of them bad. However, we love what we do and after 55 years weve discovered that what we do is not just run a company, but build families.
	<p>
	Weve also discovered that Mr. Mann is right. Teamwork is what has gotten us here and teamwork is what will take us into the future.  We are a proactive company. Our purpose is to be a leader in the fresh vegetable industry by providing a consistent supply of quality fresh vegetables through innovation, research, development, and marketing.
	<p>
	Being proactive is not just a clich, its a responsibility. A responsibility that we have not only to our 600-plus employees, but to over 30 families that grow crops for our company; to the service providers that paint our trucks and fix our forklifts; to the companies that supply us with cartons and computers; and to the hard-working, dedicated people of this community. Without them, we wouldnt be here.

<font face="Helvetica" size="6">RESPONSE TO ADVERSITY/PROBLEM SOLVING</font><br>



	A willingness to listen and observe in an ever-changing, competitive environment is essential to success. Weve always taken a creative-problem solving approach to challenges we face - looking at them not as problems, but as opportunities in which to make things better.  We believe that obstacles are what you see when you take your eyes off the road. Following are some obstacles weve managed to avoid during our business history.
<p>
<b>Developing Markets</b><br>
	Growers and shippers in the Salinas Valley operate in a free-market environment - which means we are basically gamblers. There are no government subsidies for our crops or prorates. We basically go through a "daily auction" that establishes a market based on supply and demand. Grower-shippers invest tens of thousands of dollars in crops daily, not knowing if they will ever get a profitable return. 
	<p>
	Our goal is to ensure that the return is a profitable one for our growers and our company. Weve been able to do this by continually developing new and expanding markets for the crop. Some examples:
<p>
<b>Flight of the Freezers...</b><br>
	In 1968, 70 percent of our fresh broccoli volume was going to the frozen food market while 30 percent was directed to fresh. The early 1980s brought on an exodus of the freezers with companies like Green Giant/Pillsbury moving to Mexico. While operations and people can move to less-expensive growing regions such as Santa Maria or Mexico Salinas Valley acreage cannot. We had a responsibility to our growers to find a market for their crops - so we did.
<p>
	Today our company markets close to 15,000 acres of fresh broccoli to the domestic and international markets. We were able to find a "home" for the freezer broccoli while increasing our acreage because of new market developments. 
<p>
<b>Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan</b>
	In 1987 Mann Packing shipped our first box of broccoli to Japan. We took a unique approach to developing this market. Instead of trying to introduce the Japanese consumer to an American pack of broccoli (such as our traditional bunch) we duplicated a broccoli pack that was similar to one produced by Japanese broccoli growers.
<p>
	This pack takes extra time and attention since it features broccoli crowns that must be aesthetically pleasing and identical in size. We researched seed varieties that were suitable for producing uniform broccoli crowns and developed special cartons to protect the vegetable during long shipments. We also developed special cutting boards that attach to the harvesting machines.  These boards have a measurement device which enables the harvesters to measure each crown to the exact specification.
<p>
	Today our Pacific Rim distributor is one of our top three customers.  Shipper throughout the area have started to put up a pack similar to ours. We set the standard for exporting broccoli to Japan and look forward to expanding export-market opportunities.
<p>
<b>Broccoli Wokly Brings a Break-Through</b><br>

	Another new market development which enabled us to divert acreage away from freezer production was the foodservice market which was looking for a pre-cut, 
pre-washed fresh broccoli florette.
<p>
	Our first carton of broccoli florettes was shipped in 1983. What started on a metal table in the corner of our packing shed has turned into one of the largest fresh vegetable categories in the country.
<p>
	Today we produce over 120,000 pounds of broccoli florettes per day.  The florette development was soon followed by other innovative products such as: plate-ready broccoli spears, Hearts of Broccoli  and  MANNs Broccoli Cole Slaw. These products will be addressed in more detail under "Innovation and Creativity."
<p>
	In 1988 fresh-cut broccoli accounted for less than 5 percent of our sales. In 1993, 60 percent of our sales were fresh-cut.
<p>
<b>The White Elephant</b>
	In 1981 Mann Packing moved into a new, state-of-the art facility that was designed to facilitate the bunching of fresh broccoli.
<p>
	The number of companies shipping broccoli was limited since you needed a packing shed in which to bunch the broccoli. However, in the early 1980s harvesting developments allowed companies to bunch broccoli in the field. This brought on an influx of competition from other shippers and left us with a building that many in the industry referred to as "Manns white elephant." Our state-of-the art facility had suddenly become obsolete. At our lowest point, we had less than 100 people working in production.
<p>
	Mann Packing Company pioneered the markets for fresh-cut broccoli and today our "white elephant" is operating 20 hours a day, six days a week, year-round. With 600-plus employees, weve doubled our production capacity two years in a row and just finished an additional 30,000 square foot cooling expansion.

We strive to be as supportive as possible when it comes time to gather up volunteers to work shifts at Cherrys Jubilee or to serve our favorite recipes on "Broccoli Day" at the Monterey County Fair.
	<p>
	We have four graduates of Leadership Salinas as members of our staff and we are proud of them - as well as all of our volunteers who work hard to help those organizations currently helping our community.

	Mann Packing Company is the 14th largest employer in Monterey County. Our employment growth pattern is as follows:<pre>

			1989		235 employees
			1990		273 employees
			1991		243 employees
			1992		335 employees
			1993		432 employees
			1994		612 employees
</pre>
	Employee safety and productivity are foremost goals at Mann Packing. In 1992 we started an employee Wellness Program that is designed to develop healthy minds and bodies of the some 600 employees that work for us.
<p>
	Classes to learn to speak, read and write English are available to employees as well as basic math courses. All of these classes are offered free of charge. Should employees choose to further their education even more, Mann Packing offers an Educational Assistance Program to employees with one year of employment or more with the company. 
<p>
	The Educational Assistance Program offers financial aid to employees wishing to take a job-related course at an accredited school, college or university. The percentage of reimbursement offered depends on the grade received. Since the programs inception two years ago, one Mann employee has completed a bachelor of science in business management from Golden Gate University. Another employee was this years valedictorian at Hartnell College and dozens of others have earned credentials and credits through various courses and institutions.
<p>
	At Mann Packing Company we believe that investing in our employees future benefits the company greatly. The more they learn - the more they have to contribute. Job training is on-going, but at Mann Packing we try to take it one step further by investing in the employee. 
<p>
	The Employee Wellness Program also includes health clinics that cover such topics as: low-fat cooking, AIDS awareness, seminars on how to use the companys health insurance, and health screenings which monitor weight, cholesterol and blood pressure. 
Last year the company also started offering flu shots and sponsoring blood drives. The Salinas Police Department also comes in occasionally to speak to the night crews about night safety. 
<p>
	Mann Packing has an active safety program which has enabled us to lower our classification risk considerably over the past eight years. For instance, in 1988 our classification risk was at 239, far above the 100 average for agriculture businesses. Today, our classification averages 78, well below the industry average. The fact that we were able to lower this number significantly, while increasing the number of employees in production, is something we are very proud of.
<p>
	Our insurance carrier and Pan American Underwriters have given us many awards over the past several years for "our dedication to reducing hazards at our worksite."
<p>
<b>INCREASE OF SALES</b><br>

	Mann Packing Companys sales have increased 130 percent since 1988.  We currently market close to 15,000 acres of broccoli, as well as 2,000 acres of leafy vegetables and 2,600 acres of iceberg lettuce. We ship over 30 different commodities available in over 175 different pack specifications. We shipped close to six million cartons in 1993.
<p>
	Because the company is privately held, no further financial statements are available.

<b>Product</b><br>
	
	The principals at Mann Packing Company have a great deal of faith and trust in the people they employ. Following are some examples of what a few good employees can create when given the latitude to do so.
	<p>
	As previously stated, Mann Packing Company suddenly experienced a sharp increase in competition in the early 1980s when broccoli packing moved to the fields.
In order to stay competitive, employees at the company decided to  develop broccoli products that they could produce better, and more efficiently, than anyone else.
<p>
	David Stidolph, a consultant for the company for over 30 years, was brought in to develop a market for the fresh broccoli florette. Today Mann Packing ships dozens of different broccoli florette packs to the foodservice, wholesale and retail markets. Under the label "Broccoli Wokly" Mann Packing is the leader in broccoli florette production. Stidolph is highly regarded as "the father of the broccoli florette" throughout the produce industry and was named Produce Man for All Seasons by THE PACKER in 1993 for his work in this market development. 
<p>
	However, all of this fresh broccoli florette production turned into somewhat of a mixed blessing. You see, we were only shipping the top half of the broccoli plant. The bottom stalk was being hauled away by "cull" drivers and fed to dairy cattle. Mann Packing was faced with the challenge of developing a market for the delicious, edible stem of the broccoli plant. 
<p>
<b>Getting to the "heart" of the matter...</b><br>

	Under the guidance of David Stidolph, a team of marketing and production personnel at Mann Packing set forth on this challenging task. A competitor had previously diced and chopped the stalk and it was not received well by the industry. The team at Mann Packing knew we had to be better, we had to be different, and we had to get to the "heart" of the matter.
<p>
	Thus our Hearts of Broccoli line was born. We diced, we cut, and we sliced the stalk into various shapes and sizes. However, we stopped calling it the stalk of the broccoli and trademarked the phrase Hearts of Broccoli and Broccoli Hearts.  Suddenly we had a gourmet item that foodservice professionals were interested in!
<p>
	Aided by recipe development, marketing support and training, Mann Packing introduced the line to the trade. While we pinned the products to be perfect for institutional and non-commercial feeding establishments (such as schools, hospitals and prisons), little did we know that a long-time retail customer of ours would be interested in a pack that we put up "just for fun."
<p>
	We put the shredded broccoli hearts into a one pound bag and add carrots and red cabbage. Since broccoli is a cole crop, we called it MANNs Broccoli Cole Slaw. The retailer took some samples, put them on his shelf, and the rest is history.
<p>
<b>"Cool Slaw"</b><br>

	Today we produce over 90,000 pounds of MANNs Broccoli Cole Slaw every day. We get thousands of letters from consumers throughout the country applauding the virtues of this product. In fact, an informal survey of food editors by Food Business magazine named MANNs Broccoli Cole Slaw one of the best new food products - two years in a row!
<p>
	Weve hired 200 additional employees since introducing MANNs Broccoli Cole Slaw and have expanded the line to include a broccoli cole slaw with dressing, a Cauliflower cole slaw and a Rainbow Salad which includes broccoli cole slaw and cauliflower.






<p>
<b>Design</b><br>
<p>
	Mann Packing Company has a team of individuals nestled on a ranch near Chualar that design and fabricate some of the most advanced harvesting machinery in the world.
<p>
	Remote control operations... the ability to move at one-half mile per hour... elevating or lowering the cutting tables to the height of the plant so harvesters backs dont strain...these are just a few features created by Mann Packings team of engineers.  
<p>
	Four-way turn around capabilities allow for more efficient passings in the field. The powerful hydraulics proved to be a good investment for the company. Two Winters ago the Yuma growing region experienced devastating floods when the Gila River overflowed. Many companies could not get their machines into the field to harvest but we were able to.
<p>
	The processing plant on Harkins also has a team of engineers that are experts at the craft of "preventive maintenance." Machinery is designed and installed with checkpoints in place. Down-time is never good news to production managers. The refrigeration engineers must ensure that the 480 ton ice plant is able to produce just that, 480 tons, every day of the year. The bagging machines that produce 40-60 bags per minute must operate continuously so customers can get their product fresh and in a timely manner. This is no easy task. Proper design and implementation is crucial to running a productive and efficient "fresh" packing operation.
<p>
<b>Service</b>
	<p>
	Mann Packing Company is often referred to in the industry as the "unofficial broccoli board." We believe in promoting our commodity as much as our company and often supply generic broccoli information and photographs to food editors, dietitians, schools, home economists and hospitals throughout the country.

<p>
<b>Getting Broccoli into Schools...</b><br>

	Our "Camp Broccoli Wokly" program is designed to encourage fresh broccoli consumption among American school children. When our broccoli is featured on their "Menu Madness" schools are given free posters, Happy Camper stickers and Camp Counselor buttons. The schools are given credit for free nutritional education merchandise for each box of Mann Packing product served. Still in its infancy, the program is being well received by schools and has been successfully test-marketed in several regions of the country. 
<p>
<b>Helping the Environment...</b><br>

	Two years ago several employees were concerned with the amount of solid waste being produced by the Harkins Street plant. The principals agreed to form a Recycling Task Force to address the issue.
<p>
	The employees brought in a waste management expert that conducted a waste audit of the facility. They analyzed the waste stream from receipt to disposal and made recommendations on where the company could divert, reduce or eliminate waste.
<p>
	Today the plant currently diverts 82 percent of its solid waste away from landfills. The company has a part-time recycling coordinator on staff and participates in a national pallet pool to eliminate one-way pallets which are creating a huge environmental problem back East.

	<p>

H.W. "Cy" Mann started his agricultural career trimming fruit and lettuce for 40 cents an hour. He loaded grain onto boxcars for a local company and through hard work and dedication, eventually became foreman of a produce shed.
	<p>
<img border="1" src="../images/history/HISTORIYPHIL16.jpg"><p>
It was 1939 when a fresh carrot packing operation opened called, quite simply, H.W. Mann. It was soon thereafter that Mr. Mann found his niche in the fresh vegetable industry. It was broccoli.
	<p><font size=+2><i><b><font color="#6A006A">Today, H.W. Mann is Mann Packing Company, Incorporated and the largest shippers of fresh broccoli in the world</font>
	</font></i></b><br>-as well as a shipper of over 35 fresh vegetable commodities. Packed under the famous MANNs Sunny Shores and Sunny Shores labels, these commodities are available in retail and foodservice pack specifications.
	<p>

<img border="1" src="../images/history/HISTORYPHIL19.jpg"><p>
In 1976 Mr. Mann welcomed Bill Ramsey and Don Nucci as partners in the firm. Ramsey joined Mann in 1955 where he directed growing and harvesting operations. Today he serves as co-ceo and president and directs Manns quality systems in field operations.

We survive ever-growing competition because of our adherence to quality. We give our customers full value and treat them fairly. This is why we continue to grow."
	<p>The year 1996 marks the passing of Mr. Mann at the age of 86. While he is missed by  his friends and family every day, he has left a strong foundation for the company to build on and employees at the company are committed to running the business by the standards he set for the company.
	<p>
<img border="1" src="../images/history/HISTORYPHIL17.jpg"><p>
Mann Packing remains a family-owned operation with strong ties to the local community. Generations of families have grown vegetables for the company and many veteran employees have generations of their families at work for the firm.

At Mann Packing our extensive, on-site Food Safety and Product Protection Program not only meets all government standards, but we continually perform voluntary audits to ensure that every product is safe and nutritious  In addition, all of our vegetables are hand-cut with sterile, stainless steel knives and individually sorted for quality by our team.  The hand-picked vegetables are then measured in precise protions per package and put through a metal detector to ensure safety.

<b>
<br>
The big question has always been, &quot;How can you keep pre-packaged
vegetables fresh without preservatives?&quot;
 Since vegetables
continue to breathe after harvest by taking in oxygen and giving
off carbon dioxide, they will suffocate in an ordinary plastic
bag. After over 15 years of research, a special film was discovered
that revolutionized our industry. This specially designed film
allows MANN's fresh-cut vegetables to breath, keeping them fresh
and preservative free!

<img align="right" border="1" src="../images/salinas/CA.jpg">
Mother Nature has painted a beautiful canvas across Monterey County's
Salinas Valley, located on California's Central Coast, just 15
miles east of Monterey Bay. Wrapped between the arms of the Gabilan
and Santa Lucia Mountain ranges, the Salinas Valley boasts a colorful
tapestry of 640,000 acres which produce wine grapes, fruits, vegetables
and floral products of unrivaled quality. 
<P>
Nobel Prize winning author John Steinbeck was born in Salinas
and referred to his home as &quot;pastures of heaven.&quot; Today
the Salinas Valley is an agricultural mecca producing over $2
billion worth of agricultural products annually. The nickname
bestowed on the valley decades ago has now become a fact. The
Salinas Valley is indeed, the Salad Bowl of the World.
<P>
The Salinas is a rich, flat valley 85 miles long and 15 miles
wide at the plain near its mouth. The most significant feature
of the Salinas Valley is the Salinas River. The watershed of the
river consists of 4,000 square miles, creating the largest intermontane
valley of the Coast Range. This river is the longest underground
river in North America, with nearly 80 miles of its 150 mile length
occurring below the surface. The Salinas River played a large
part in the settling of the Valley. Three of California's 21 missions
(Soledad, Carmel, San Antonio) were in the Salinas Valley, due
in part to the available water supply, suitable building sites
and sufficent grazing land.
<P>
<img align="left" border="1" src="../images/salinas/CA2.jpg">
When Father Junipero Serra established the Soledad and San Antonio
missions in the late 1770's, the Salinas Valley had been cattle
country where thousands of head roamed the unfenced land. In the
early 1860's the Salinas Valley economy was based on ranching.
Ironically, the Valley was deemed worthless for farming. Between
1861 and 1865 the Valley experienced years of extreme drought,
followed by unprecedented flooding and cold weather, killing off
90 percent of the county's tens of thousands of black Spanish
cattle. What proved to be a disaster to the ranchers became a
blessing to the farmers. The floods washed rich top soil from
the hills and deposited them on the valley floor. River silt further
enriched the land and from 1862 to 1875, acres under cultivation
more than tripled and wheat grew from 26 percent share of the
crops to 75 percent.
<P>
Some significant changes began occurring in the Valley's agricutural
patterns. Sugar beets had been planted on over 23,000 acres and
dry beans and peas occupied another 18,000. The year 1919 brought
even more changes. With the fading of World War I, so did the
demand for dry beans and sugar. Sugar beet acreage increased at
the time only to be met by a decrease in demand due to the end
of World War I. This caused prices to fall and the spread of &quot;curly
top disease&quot; and a decline in seed quality also impacted
sugar beet production. 
<P>
Artichokes began to fill the void left by the reduction in sugar
beet cultivation in the Northern end of the Salinas Valley. The
artichoke fields surround a small town called Castroville which
claims to be the &quot;artichoke&quot; center of the world. 
<P>
While artichokes then and now play an important role in agriculture
production, it was iceberg lettuce that would lead an agricultural
revolution in the rest of the area. Consider this: in 1922 approximately
300 acres of lettuce were planted around Salinas. By the end of
the decade 43,000 acres of the Salinas Valley were growing this
&quot;green gold.&quot;
<P>
<img align="left" border="1" src="../images/salinas/CA3.jpg">
The Valley today is still comprised of family ranches that have
been cultivated for many generations. The majority of these growers
produce crops for larger &quot;shippers&quot; who bring the farmer's
crops to market. These markets could be as close as the store
in downtown Salinas or as far away as Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
Switzerland, Japan or Indonesia. In fact, there is little doubt
that the produce in <I>your </I>local grocery store was grown
in the Salinas Valley.
<P>
Each year farmers in the Salinas Valley produce 12,500 tons of
tomatoes, 15,000 tons of strawberries. Do you like to eat salads?
Last year farmers in the Salinas Valley produced over 82,000 tons
of lettuce! 
<P>
Broccoli is the second largest crop with close to $271 million
dollars worth produced annually. In fact, there are 47 crops,
from grapes to brussel sprouts, that bring in over one million
dollars annually to Monterey County.
<P>
Of course, all of this money is not seen by the farmers who must
invest in the seed, fertilizer, water and cultivation before the
crop is ever brought to market. If there is an excess in supply,
the market is low and farmers often sell their crops at a loss.
Worst yet, if there is a problem with pests or weather, entire
crops can be lost and the farmer will never see a return on his
or her investment.
<P>
<img align="right" border="1" src="../images/salinas/CA4.jpg">
<br>
Unrivaled growing conditions, fertile soil and an ideal climate,
helped make the Salinas Valley what it is today. During peak growing
season, over 1,000 refrigerated trucks leave the area daily to
deliver fresh, wholesome produce to markets all over the world.

<P>
So the next time you step into your local grocery store and take
a look around that colorful, fresh produce department, or the
next time you sit down at a restaurant and bite into a crunchy
Caesar Salad, think of Monterey County's Salinas Valley, and all
of the families who work so hard to bring fresh, quality produce
to you.<BR>

<font face="Helvetica" size="6">History & Origin of Broccoli</font><br>
<br><b>
<img align="right" border="1" src="../images/origin/Br.Spears.jpg">
Broccoli has been around for more than 2000 years, although Americans have grown it in their gardens for only 200 years!  WOW! During the sixteenth century, the plant was grown in France and Italy. Little was known about this vegetable until the 1920s, when the first commercially grown broccoli was grown and harvested in Brooklyn, New York. In 1923, the DArrigo Brothers Company made a trial planting of Italian sprouting broccoli in California.  A few crates were sent to Boston and by 1925 the broccoli market was established.
<p>
<img align="left" border="1" src="../images/origin/Br.WoklyFl.jpg">
The word broccoli comes from the Italian <i>brocco</i> meaning arm branch.  Broccoli is a member of the Cruciferae family which means its related to cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, etc. The word <i>broccolo</i> is the diminutive form of <i>brocco</i> and refers to cabbage sprout, while broccoli is plural and refers to the numerous shoots in the form of Brassica Oleracea.  There are two types of broccoli:  sprouting/Italian broccoli (Brassica Oleracea Italica) the most common, and heading broccoli (Brassica Oleracea) which looks like cauliflower. 

<p>
<img align="right" border="1" src="../images/origin/broc_from_field.jpg">
Broccoli grows best in areas with a cool climate and moist soil. Over 90 percent of broccoli is grown in California.  It is grown in the Salinas Valley and the Santa Maria Valley from March through December.  During the winter months, November to March, broccoli is grown in the Yuma Valley in Arizona. Broccoli is not only grown in California and Arizona, but -surprise!- it is also grown in Texas, Florida, the Carolinas, Washington, Wisconsin, Colorado, Oregon, and as far north as Maine. Planting is done by direct seeding  or by transplanting seedlings started in a greenhouse. Although various varieties have slightly different harvesting time, most reach maturity from seeds in 100 to 120 days. Over 30,000 plants can grown in only one acre of land!  WOW! A field may be harvested 2 to 3 times to remove all the broccoli!  Ideally, broccoli should be harvested during the cooler months in order to ensure the longest storage time.  It should be cut with eight to 10 inches of stem left intact and the heads should be cooled immediately to prevent opening and discoloration.  Broccoli may be packed in the field or transported to a processing facility where it is cut and packaged.
<p>
<img align="left" border="1" src="../images/origin/gourmet_broc_fl.jpg">
Broccoli is known as the "Crown of Jewel Nutrition" because it is rich in vitamins and minerals.  Over the last 25 years, broccoli consumption has increased over 940 percent!  Maybe its because its a good source of Vitamin A , Potassium, Folacin, Iron and Fiber.  Or maybe its because broccoli has as much calcium ounce per ounce as milk   Or better yet- maybe its because it contains a few important phytochemicals: beta-carotene, indoles and isothiocyanates.  What is so important about phytochemicals?  Well, phytochemicals prevent carcinogens (cancer causing substance) from forming.  They also stop carcinogens from getting to target cells and help boost enzymes that detoxify carcinogens.
<p>
So next time you sit down for dinner and broccoli is on the menu.  Remember...broccoli <i>really</i> is good for you!

Handling & Storing Tips
</font>
</center>
<font size="3"><b>
<p>
<font size=+3><font color="#00672E">B</font></font>roccoli stalks should have tight and compact bud clusters with an even dark green or purplish green color. The stalk should be easy to pierce with a fingernail.  Different varieties of broccoli come in colors ranging from deep sage green to purplish green.  Broccoli stems should be a lighter green than the buds, tender and slightly moist.  Avoid broccoli stalks with yellowed or open bud clusters or stems that are hard and dry.  Also avoid broccoli with soft, slippery water-soaked spots of the bud cluster. Broccoli is usually sold by the one-pound bunch; check the weight to get the best value. The size of the head has no relation to eating quality. Store in plastic bag in refrigerator crisper.
<p>
<font size=+3><font color="#00672E">B</font></font>roccoli crowns are becoming more popular and provide more accurate portion control for the consumer and less waste. They are sold by the individual piece or by the pound.
<p>
<font color="#00672E"><font size=+3>B</font></font>roccoli florettes are also sold in stores loose in baskets for consumers to choose or packaged in a breathable bag. Broccoli florettes in a bag should have no brown discolaration at the cutting point and should look and smell fresh. An expiration date should be on the package.
<p>
<font size="3"><b>
<font size=+3><font color="#00672E">B</font></font></font>efore using broccoli that is not already packaged washed and ready to eat, clean by rinsing (not soaking) the broccoli and trim the main stem slightly at the bottom.

<font size="2" color="#000000"><b>
	Because of its strong characteristic flavor, broccoli should be cooked uncovered in a large quantity of boiling water.  Fresh broccoli requires 3 to 6 minutes cooking time in rapidly boiling water. Broccoli should only be cooked until it turns a bright green and is still crisp and tender.It should then be drained and rinsed with cool water to stop the cooking process. Broccoli that is overcooked will turn a dark khaki green (almost) gray and will not look or smell pleasing. The biggest mistake people make with broccoli is overcooking it.
	<p>
	If steaming the product on your stovetop leaves an undesirable odor, place a drop of dry vermouth in the pot to hinder the odor.

	<b>MICROWAVE PREPARATION:<br>
	</font>
<font size="2" color="#000000"><b>
	Broccoli is cooked beautifully in the microwave. Simply place cut broccoli in a microwave safe dish with one inch of water. Cover bowl with saran wrap or glass lid and place in microwave for 3 to 4 minutes (time will vary depending on power of the microwave and the amount of broccoli youre preparing).Remove and rinse with cold water (be careful of hot steam that might burn).
	<p>
	Some fresh broccoli florettes come washed and ready to eat in a microwavable bag. Read the package instructions for more details.

	<br>Place fresh broccoli in boiling water for approximately 6-8 minutes. For tender crisp vegetables steam for 4-6 minutes. Frozen broccoli cooks in 8 to 10 minutes.

	<br>Place broccoli in a saucepan with one inch of boiling water and one-half teaspoon of salt.  Cook with cover off the first five minutes, and then cook covered 10 to 15 minutes or only until crisp-tender.  Or, if desired, leave cover on during the entire cooking period, but lift the lid three or four times to permit the gases to escape, and thus protect the green color of the vegetable.

	Before using, wash by rinsing (not soaking) the broccoli and trim the main stem slightly.  (If fresh broccoli is soaked, it may lose the benefits of Vitamins B & C.) Cut into florettes or for a crunchy snack, peel stem and cut into coins or sticks.

<b>Serving Broccoli "Cold"</b></font><br>
When serving broccoli raw in a vegetable tray or cold salad (such as pasta), try blanching or steaming the product very lightly (under one minute) then immersing in ice cold water to stop the cooking process. The broccoli will be a beautiful, brilliant green. The broccoli will also be tender-crisp with a more pleasing flavor. 
<p>
<blockquote><b>Note: </b>  <br><i>This process should only be done when serving the broccoli within the next two 	hours. If left  overnight the broccoli will turn a dull green and not taste as fresh. 
</i></blockquote><p>
<font size="4"><b>Serving Broccoli "Hot"</b></font><br>
Broccoli is best prepared by blanching or steaming the product lightly (three to four minutes maximum). Blanching may be done on the stove top in boiling water or steamed in a microwave or commercial steamer. It is important to "shock" the broccoli after this process so the cooking stops. If broccoli just sits hot in a strainer it will continue to cook, causing the color to fade and the texture to become soft. Broccoli is ideal when prepared
 tender-crisp or al dent which means "to the touch." This not only retains nutrients but provides beautiful color and texture to any recipe.
<p>
<font size="4"><b>Save Those Broccoli Stems!</b></font><br>
When preparing fresh broccoli dont forget the nutritious, tender stalk (or Hearts of Broccoli or Broccoli Hearts which is what we call them here at Mann). We use shredded hearts of broccoli in our broccoli cole slaw which is one of the fastest selling vegetable items in the country!
<p>
Try creating some Broccoli Heart recipe applications in your kitchen at home! Trim about half an inch off the bottom of the stalk and dice into small pieces as a more nutritional alternative to diced celery. Use in stuffings, tuna or chicken salad. Crunchy and nutritious!
You may also cut the stalk into "broccoli sticks" but use them quickly because they will start to curl eventually (unless you want to serve "broccoli curls" another good idea!).  
The stalk is also ideal for cutting into "coins" and adding to salads, stir frys, pasta or dip.
<p><blockquote>
<b>Note: </b><br><i> Many folks belive you have to peel the stalk before using. While the inner portion
	is certainly more tender, our experience has shown that the light layer of skin
	on the stalk is similar to the skin on an apple or potato. Its holding in nutrients
	and does not create a fiborous barrier (especially when cooked).

B</b></i></font>roccoli stalks should have tight and compact bud clusters with an even dark green or purplish green color.  The stalk should be easy to pierce with a fingernail.  Different varieties of broccoli come in colors ranging from deep sage green to purplish green. 
<p>
Broccoli stems should be a lighter green than the buds, tender and slightly moist.  Avoid broccoli stalks with yellowed or open bud clusters or stems that are hard and dry.  Also avoid broccoli with soft, slippery water-soaked spots of the bud cluster.  Broccoli is usually sold by the one-pound bunch;  check the weigh to get the best value.  The size of the head has no relation to eating quality.

		Early decay is caused when there is a break in the *"Cold Chain". Ideally, vegetables should be refrigerated within 30 minutes after purchase. </font>

Store broccoli in plastic bag in refrigerator crisper -do not rinse. With proper refrigeration  (34 - 40 degrees) you should enjoy as much as 16 days of safe delicious eating.  Please note The vitamin content will remain higher if your fresh broccoli is used as quickly as possible.
	<p>
After opening a bag of vegetables, simply seal the freshness by twisting the bag closed and using a rubber band or twist tie for a secure hold. To ensure our quality, Manns fresh-cut vegetables have the Best If Used By Date conveniently printed on the front of all packages.

<TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE=6>What Are Nutrients?</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>A nutrient is defined by the <U>Oxford American Dictionary</U>, as a nourishing substance. To understand the basics of nutrition you need to first understand the concept of food and energy. There are three kinds of nutrients: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. Macronutrients include: Fat, Carbohydrates, and Protein. 'Macro', meaning large, suggest that macronutrients are those that are present and needed in large amounts. Micronutrients--vitamins and minerals--are present in much smaller quantities. Water, although not thought of as a nutrient, is a component in all foods and is an essential element of life.<BR>

<P>
Each of the three nutrients have specific functions and they each work together to carry out their functions. Macronutrients provide energy and help maintain and repair the body. Micronutrients, both vitamins and minerals have different functions. Vitamins help regulate chemical processes in the body which will be explained later. Minerals again help the vitamins with their functions and play a vital role in body maintenance as well, notably in the formation of new tissue, including bones, teeth, and blood. Water provides a fluid medium for all chemical reactions in the body, and for the circulation of blood, removal of waste, and the regulation body temperature. <BR>

<P>
Your body burns a mixture of macronutrients for energy. The production of energy ---and the potential for a food to supply energy---is measured in calories (kcal). The caloric content of a food is determined by measuring the amount of heat produced when the food is burned in a laboratory device called the calorimeter. The heat that is generated compares to the energy produced in the human body. It is recommended to not lower your caloric intake below 1200 calories (for an adult) unless under a doctor's supervision. It's also important to realize that everybody has different needs (infants, children, elderly, etc.). A key element in watching your caloric intake is to always think of food as energy. What you put into your body must equal your energy output (yard work, house cleaning, aerobics, baseball, etc.) or you'll see weight gain. 3500 kcal is the equivilent to 1 lb or .45 kg of body fat. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>How Many Calories Do You Need?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The following steps are tool to help figure out your daily caloric needs. Remember that this is just a guideline for you to follow and if you have any questions, please contact your doctor or a local registered dietitian.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step One:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Multiply your ideal body weight or present weight by 10 (use your ideal body weight if you want to lose body fat). How to find your ideal body weight is given below. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE: <BR>
145 (Present or ideal body weight)<BR>
<U>X10<BR>
</U>1450 (kcal you need daily to rest)<BR>
</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step Two: </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Find your activity factor in the list below and multiply it by your weight to get the calories you need to perform daily activities. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE:<BR>
145 <BR>
<U>X 5</U> (activity factor) <BR>
725 (kcal you need for daily ativities) <BR>
</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step Three: </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Add the sums from steps one and two to get the calories you need daily to maintain your present weight. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE: <BR>
1450 <BR>
<U>+ 725</U> <BR>
2175 (kcal you need daily to maintain your present/ideal weight)<BR>
</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step Four:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you want ot lose weight, subtract 250-500 calories a day and increase your exercise to burn an additional 250-500 kcal/day. This will allow a healthy weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. To gain weight add an additional 500 kcal/day and increase your strength training to ensure a weight gain of helathy muscle and not fat.<BR>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE: <BR>
2175 <BR>
<U>- 500</U> (dietary kcal to eliminate) <BR>
1675 (daily kcal intake to lose weight)</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Ideal Body Weight Estimation:<BR>
</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<U><FONT SIZE=4>female:</FONT></U> 100 lb for first five feet, 5 lb for each additional inch (+/- 15 lb)<BR>
<BR>
<U><FONT SIZE=4>male</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=4>: </FONT>105 lb for first five feet, 6 lb for each additional inch (+/- 15 lb)<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=4>Activity Factors:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=5>3 </FONT>Sedentary: no exercise<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>4 </FONT>Moderately Active: Exercises, gardens, does housework 3 - 5 times per week for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Uses stairs and walks briskly.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>5</FONT> Active: Exercises 3 - 5 times a week for 60 minutes at a time. Uses stairs and walks briskly.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>7 </FONT>Very Active: Exercise 3 - 5 times a week for 90-plus minutes at a time. Uses stairs and walks briskly. Daily physical activity and competitve with recreational sports. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
REMEMBER: These are only estimates. Individual activity factors and body frames vary from person to person and the individual's lean body mass. The most important thing to remember in reaching and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is to get to know your body and your body type. Every person who is 5'4&quot;, is not going to weigh 120 lb. The average person's body is on the upper end of the scale, around 135lb. So please, remember to personalize your needs based on the guidelines given.

<FONT SIZE=5>Basic Healthy Diet</FONT>
<P>
Once you've figured out how many calories your body needs, it's time to determine the nutrient breakdown. With the information given above, you can estimate the amount of each nutrient with these following guidelines: 
<UL>
<LI>55% of your total daily calories from carbohydrates, carbohydrates have 4 kcal/g 
<LI>&lt;30% of total calories from fat, fat has 9 kcal/g 
<LI>12-15% of total calories from low-fat protein sources, protein has 4 kcal/g<BR>
<BR>
<U><FONT SIZE=4>example:</FONT></U><blockquote>
Juan needs 2000 kcal/day <BR>
<BR>
2000 x .55 = 1100 kcal, 4 kcal in 1g carbohydrate <BR>
<U>1100</U> kcal = 275g carbohydrates (CHO) <BR>
4 kcal/g<BR>
<BR></blockquote>
</blockquote>
For example, one serving of Mann's Broccoli Coleslaw has 6 grams CHO and a slice of bread has 18 g of CHO.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>Carbohydrates</FONT> <BR>
Carbohydrates are the most efficient fuel for the body because they can be broken down almost instantly. Most carbohydrates are from plant sources and include all sugars, starches and all types of dietary fiber. Once into the body the sugars and starches are transformed into glucose. Glucose is carried in the blood and transported to cells for energy. Carbohydrates come in two forms: complex and simple. For the healthiest diet, you want to consume a diet rich in complex carbohydrates. <BR>
<BR>
Simple carbohydrates are sugars. These are found in all sorts of places such as soups, spaghetti sauces, fruit drinks, frozen dinners, cereals, and yogurts. They are, of course, also found in the traditional candy items and soft drinks. Most importantly, they occur naturally in fruits, vegetables and dairy products. <BR>
<BR>
Complex carbohydrates are better for you than simple ones because they usually come with lots of other nutrients as well. They are grains such as rice, bread, and pasta, and vegetables such as corn and potatoes. Legumes are included in this category and are also high in protein. Most simple carbohydrates only offer you calories, and lack more nutritious substances like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. You should try to eat 6 to 11 servings of complex carbohydrates (55% of daily kcal) and limit your sweets sparingly. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>Fiber</FONT> is another type of carbohydrate that is very important to a healthy diet. Fiber is found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. These parts cannot be digested by enzymes in the stomach and therefore are excreted from the intestinal tract. There are multiple benefits of fiber, and, most importantly, foods that are high in fiber are normally low in fat and calories. It also represents a large bulk to the diet to help fill you up faster. The recommended amount of fiber is 20 to 30 grams a day, and others suggest even more--40 to 50 grams a day. <BR>
<BR>
Although eating too much fiber often causes discomfort (bloating, cramps, intestinal gas, etc.) the health benefits out-weigh the negative effects. Fiber helps with constipation, decreases the risk of colon and rectal cancer, helps reduce total blood cholesterol, and helps control blood sugar with diabetes. Also, when increasing your fiber intake, your body will slowly adjust and the negative affects will ease. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>Protein<BR>
<img align="right" border="1" src="../images/education/chickenthigh.jpg">
</FONT>Protein should consist of 12-15% of your daily caloric intake. That means for Juan's 2000 kcal/day diet he should have 75 g of protein. (2000 x .15 = 300; 300/4 = 75 g). Most Americans eat on the average 100 g of protein/day which dramatically exceeds the recommended daily allowance. A large misconception is that you need to get your protein from animal sources. Animals are a great source of protein, with lean meats and low-fat dairy products, but you can also get protein from vegetables and legumes (beans). For example, Mann's Vegetable Medley (broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower) contains 3 g of protein in a 4 oz serving size. <BR>
<BR>
Protein makes up three-fourths of your total body, including muscles, organs, enzymes, and some hormones, which are largely composed of protein. A protein is made up of chains of amino acids which are the end by-product once proteins are digested in the stomach. Only thirteen of the twenty-two amino acids can be made by the human body. That means that there are nine essential amino acids (essential, meaning they need to come from our diet). <BR>
<BR>
Proteins are also categorized as &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;incomplete.&quot; Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids, and consequentially, incomplete proteins do not. Fruit, grain, and vegetable proteins are considered incomplete. Although incomplete, they are still a great source of protein when eaten in combinations that contain all nine amino acids. These combinations have been done for years (beans and rice, beans and cornbread, and corn and lima beans). <BR>
<BR>
The USDA's Food Guide Pyramid recommends 2-3 servings of protein per day, depending on your energy needs. Other health professionals recommend even less, 1 to 3 servings. Americans generally eat too much protein and not enough calcium rich dairy products, so they recommend eating more low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese. This also is effected by the large portion sizes many Americans indulge in.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>Fat<BR>
</FONT>The December 4, 1995 issue of <I>The Food Institute Report</I> stated, &quot; When reading labels, 87% of Americans are concerned with the fat content of food while half pay close attention to the cholesterol.&quot; This in fact can be in conjunction with the numerous studies that have linked high-fat diets to heart disease, cancer, obesity and many other diseases. With the great amount of attention on how &quot;bad&quot; fat is, it musn't be forgotten that fat is an essential part of a healthy diet. Many people have gone to excess with the low-fat and fat-free craze. Likewise, the food industry has initiatated this by manufacturing food products that are low-fat, light, or fat-free. <BR>
<BR>
You might be surprised to find out the actual amount of fat that is recommended to eat each day. We mentioned earlier that our daily caloric intake should consist of less than 30% of total calories from fat. When using Juan's 2000 kcal/day diet, that would mean he'd need to eat less than 67 fat grams each day. Some people may claim that's too much fat, but to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle, that is the upper scale of the limit. Of course receiving 20% of your calories from fat is better and even then the equivilant in fat grams equals 44 g. To follow a general guideline, you should eat between 20 to 40 g of fat, minimum. Even those extremists who claim to eat no fat at all, are eating fat. Everything has traces of fat, even broccoli has traces of fat. <BR>
<BR>
Fat is an essential aspect of a healthy diet. It provides a supply of essential fatty acids that the body needs for proper functioning. They are the basic building blocks for prostaglandin's, a type of hormone, which help control blood pressure, blood clotting, inflammation, and other bodily functions. Linoleic acid is the most important of the essential fatty acids and helps with proper growth and development of infants. Other functions of fat is that it serves as a storage for the body's excess calories, in adipose tissue. The fat storage is utilized for energy 20-30 minutes after aerobic exercise begins and after the immediate stored carbohydrates are used (after the first 20 minutes). <BR>
<BR>
Fat not only is utilized for energy but also helps with maintaining healthy skin and hair, transports fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, K, &amp; E) throughout the blood stream, regulates blood cholesterol levels, and helps you feel full when eating (takes longer to digest in the stomach and slows emptying of the stomach). <BR>
<BR>
The types of fat you consume are also very important to a healthy diet. Fats are also known as lipids and come in liquid and solid forms. Triglycerides compose most of the fats in foods. They are made up of three fatty acids and a glycerol molecule and vary in saturation of hydrogen atoms. This saturation is what determines the different properties of fats. There are two kinds: saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. <BR>
<BR>
Saturated fatty acids are full of hydrogen atoms and are solid at room temperature. These fat come primarily from animal sources such as butter, dairy products, and meats, but coconut and palm oils are also highly saturated. A diet high in saturated fats can lead to an increase in blood cholesterol levels which may lead to heart disease.<BR>
<BR>
Unsaturated fatty acids are under two categories depending on the amount of hydrogen's attached. Monounsaturated are found in olive, canola, peanut, and avocado oils. Polyunsaturated fats are found in corn, safflower, and sesame oils. Your dietary fat should come primarily from these unsaturated sources. An easy way to remember the difference is that saturated fats are solid at room temperature and unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. Of course, this is not always true, there are always exceptions to the rules. Be sure to read your <font size=4>Nutrition Facts Label</font> on processed foods because there are many hidden saturated fats in processed foods (i.e. movie popcorn) that you would not think of as extremely fattening.<BR>
<BR><font size=4>
Cholesterol</font> is in all of our body's tissues, but the serum cholesterol, the cholesterol in the blood, is what health professionals and ourselves should be concerned with. This blood chole0sterol can accumulate along the blood vessel walls causing atherosclerosis (hard plaque build up) which could lead to a possible heart attack or stroke. High cholesterol (&gt;200 mg/dl ) along with the risk factors of high blood pressure, family history of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and smoking are especially dangerous. Cholesterol is found in all animal products, including our own bodies. <BR>
<BR>
Our liver manufactures the cholesterol necessary for our body, but it is the excessive dietary intake of high-fat animal products which makes the cholesterol levels such an issue. There is actually little research supporting high dietary cholesterol intake and high blood cholesterol levels. There is more of a genetic link which gives a person a sensitivity to dietary cholesterol. It is recommended to keep your cholesterol intake to no more than 300 milligrams per day. This is easily attainable by sticking to a diet that is low in fat and high in fruit and vegetables. Be aware of products that say &quot;no cholesterol.&quot; Any product that does not have animal by-products is cholesterol free. That does not mean it is fat free. The product still may contain lots of fat from vegetable oils. Many manufacturers like to point out that there is no cholesterol, but fail to recognize the fat content. Remember: Always read your Nutrition Facts Label. <BR>
<BR>
Cholesterol is made up of different types of lipoproteins. LDL (low density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein), and HDL (high density lipoprotein) are the three categories. LDL's, also known as &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, are made when there is a high consumption of saturated fats. According to some recent studies, both polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats actually help reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol, and therefore help reduce the total amount of artery clogging cholesterol in the blood. <BR>
<BR>
HDL cholesterol, or the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol, is so great because it has the ability to pick up &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol from cells in the body and return it to the liver for excretion in the urine. There is no proven way to increase your HDL cholesterol, except exercise has proven to show some benefit.<BR>
<BR>
What is your cholesterol level? If you don't know, please check with your doctor about finding out. Many health and wellness centers offer very inexpensive cholesterol screenings. Again, remember to ask what your HDL level is as well as your total serum cholesterol level. The desirable range for cholesterol levels are between 140-220 mg/dl. For children: 70-175 mg/dl. An HDL level that is greater than 35 mg/dl is desirable as well.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>Vitamins and Minerals <BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>Vitamins<BR>
</FONT>Vitamins are defined as a group of organic substances, present in minute amounts in natural foodstuffs, that are essential to normal metabolism; insufficient amounts may cause deficiencies. There are thirteen vitamins needed by humans. All of them except D and K, must come from food sources. Vitamins D and K can both be synthesized in the body. There are two different kinds of vitamins: fat-soluble and water soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, K, and E and are stored for a relatively long time in the body's adipose and liver tissues. Water-soluble vitamins stay in the body for relatively short periods of time and therefore must be replenished frequently. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=5>
Vitamins, Storage, and Cooking <BR></font>
Vitamins are effected by temperature changes when being stored, handled and cooked. Fruit left out on a window sill in sunlight will speed up the ripening process and will continue until it is spoiled (i.e. avocados, bananas). You will also see damage to produce when left uncovered in the refrigerator, as well as when you don't store them at the proper temperature. The optimal temperature for Mann's vegetables is 34 degrees F. They keep much longer when stored at that temperature. They also will keep there optimum vitamin and mineral content as well when handled properly. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Fat-soluble Vitamins<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Vitamin A<BR></font>
One of the most important functions of vitamin A is that it promotes good vision, particularly in dim light.. Retinal, a form of vitamin A, is an essential part of the retina, rhodopsin. Vitamin A also helps maintain healthy skin, teeth, mucous membranes, and skeletal and soft tissue. The recommended daily allowances (RDA) for Vitamin A is 1000 micrograms for men, and 800 micrograms for women. A deficiency in vitamin A increases your susceptibility to infectious diseases and causes vision problemsmas well. Vitamin A can also be toxic at high doses, which has caused abnormal fetal development in pregnant women.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: cod &amp; halibut fish oils, liver, kidney, and other organ meats, milk, cream, and cheese. These sources are also high in fat and cholesterol (except for skim milk). Vegetables sources are fat and cholesterol free (see beta carotene).<BR>
<BR>
<img border="1" align="left" src="../images/education/vegies.jpg">

<FONT SIZE=4>
Beta Carotene <BR></font>
Beta carotene has been proven to be a very potent substance with antioxidant properties that may protect against cancer. Beta carotene is the vegetable source of vitamin A and is non-toxic in large amounts. The worst that large amounts could do is turn your skin orange or yellow, if you eat for example, a pound or two of carrots a day. Beta carotene is a carotenoid and contains the potent antioxidant properties of vitamin A that is believed to help fight cancer. Some clincal studies are also relating beta carotene with a decreased risk of heart disease.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: <FONT SIZE=4>Carrots</font>, sweet potatoes, pumpkin and other winter squashes, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit, <FONT SIZE=4>spinach</font>, apricots, <FONT SIZE=4>broccoli</font>, and most <FONT SIZE=4>dark green leafy vegetables</font>. The darker the green or yellow-orange color, the more beta carotene the fruit or vegetable contains.<BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Vitamin D<BR></font>
Vitamin D is synthesized by sunlight in our skin and is sometimes called the sunshine vitamin because deficiencies are so rare in sunny climates. Vitamin D, also known as calciferol, promotes the absorption of calcium which is necessary for the normal development of bones and teeth. It also helps with maintaining proper blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D is sometimes classified as a hormone, as well as a nutrient, because it is synthesized in the body. Large doses of vitamin D are toxic and can cause significant calcium reabsorption from the bones, as well as deposition in soft tissues, like the heart and lungs. Deficiencies in vitamin D is called rickets and causes bone and teeth deformations in children. Deficiencies are rare in the U.S. due to the fortification of milk and because vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. The RDA for vitamin D is 5 micrograms, but being in the sun for 15 minutes, three days a week, will produce enough for the body as well.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Fortified milk (U.S.), butter, margarine, cheese, cream, fish, oysters, and fortified cereals. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Vitamin E<BR></font>
Vitamin E , also known as tocopherol, is an antioxidant which protects tissue against the damage of oxidation by eliminating free radicals. It also helps in the formation of red blood cells and utilization of vitamin K. Vitamin E is also a fat-soluble vitamin, and rarely do you see deficiencies. A deficiency in vitamin E causes neuropathy, which is a disorder of the nervous system, and muscle disorders. The RDA for vitamin E is 10 mg for men and 8 mg for women. There has been no discoveries of toxicities with megadosing vitamin E, and yet, no potential benefits recorded either. Although there are some claims that vitamin E helps prevent scarring or helps with healing, there were headaches reported as side effects while megadosing. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Vegetable oils (soybean, cotton seed, sunflower, corn) and products made from them such as margarine; wheat germ, corn, nuts, seeds, olives, <FONT SIZE=4>asparagus, spinach</font>, and other <FONT SIZE=4>dark green leafy vegetables</font>. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Vitamin K<BR></font>
Vitamin K is critical to our blood clotting system which gives our body the ability to heal.  Intestinal bacteria manufactures 80% of the vitamin K we need. The other 20% comes from our diet and deficiencies of the vitamin are virtually unheard of. They mainly stem from an inability to absorb the vitamin efficiently. Taking antibiotics also eliminates the bacterial flora in the intestines and infants who don't have an abundance of intestinal bacteria are also at risk. With deficiencies, you would see a slower coagulation time with blood clotting. The RDA for vitamin K is 80 micrograms for an adult.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: <FONT SIZE=4>Cabbage, cauliflower, spinach,</font> and other <FONT SIZE=4>leafy vegetables</font>, cereals, soybean and other vegetable oils.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Water-soluble Vitamins<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Thiamin (vitamin B1)<BR></font>
Thiamin is part of the B-complex vitamins and is essential in metabolism. It helps convert carbohydrates to energy. As well, it is necessary for healthy brain and nerve cells and proper heart functions. Thiamin deficiency, also called Beriberi, is a disease that is rare in the U.S. but mild deficiency symptoms are common. Mild symptoms are weakness and fatigue, nerve damage and even heart failure. The RDA for thiamin is 1 mg day.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Whole grains, lean meats, fish, <FONT SIZE=4>peas</font>, dried beans and soybeans, peanuts, fortified breads, pasta and cereals. Milk and other dairy products, as well as <FONT SIZE=4>fruit</font> and <FONT SIZE=4>vegetables</font> when consumed in quantity.<BR>
<BR>
<img border="1" align="right" src="../images/education/milk-blue.jpg">
<FONT SIZE=4>
Riboflavin (vitamin B2)<BR>


</font>
Riboflavin is also essential in releasing energy from carbohydrates. It is also essential for the growth and production of red blood cells and regulation of some hormones. Skin will become dry and flaky and your eyes will be extremely sensitive to light with a deficiency in riboflavin, although extremely rare. There are no toxic effects because absorption of the vitamin in the intestines is difficult. The RDA for Riboflavin is 1.7 mg per day for men and 1.3 mg per day for women. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Milk and other dairy sources, lean meats, eggs, nuts, <FONT SIZE=4>green leafy vegetables</font>, and legumes. Bread and cereals are often fortified as well. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Niacin (vitamin B3)</font><BR>
Niacin, like the other B-complex vitamins, is crucial in the transformation of food into energy. In addition, niacin also helps with the normal functioning of skin, nerves and the digestive system. The body's able to transform niacin from tryptophan (amino acid) or acquire it from food sources. Megadosing niacin, falsely believed to boost strength and energy, causes rashes, liver damage, ulcers, and other side effects. Under medical supervision it is sometimes prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, like a drug, not a supplement. Deficiencies in niacin, called pellagra, cause inflammation of the skin, digestive problems, and mental impairment. The RDA for niacin is 19 mg NE (NE = niacin equivalent = 1 mg niacin = 60 mg dietary tryptophan) for men and 15 mg NE for women. <BR>

Vitamin B6<BR></font>
Vitamin B6, also known as pyroxidine, is important for protein and protein component chemical reactions. The higher your protein intake the more B6 is required to use it. It also helps maintain normal brain function, aids in the formation of red blood cells and builds antibodies for the immune system. Megadoses causes numbness and other nervous problems and deficiencies are rare. The RDA for B6 is 2 mg for men and 1.6 mg for women.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Meats, fish, nuts, beans and other legumes, bananas, eggs, whole grains, and fortified cereals and breads. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Vitamin B12<BR></font>
Vitamin B12 is important, like all the B-complex vitamins, for metabolism. It also helps make red blood cells and maintain nervous system functions. It is also needed to activate the folate coenzyme. It is synthesized by bacteria, fungi, and algae, but yeast, higher plants, and animals cannot manufacture it. Vitamin B12 is supplied to humans primarily by animal products which have accumulated it from bacterial synthesis. Vegetarians who do not eat eggs or dairy may need supplements of B12. A deficiency in B12 is called pernicious anemia, which is related with fatigue. This deficiency however, is not related to intake, but probable with an inability to absorb the vitamin. It is corrected with vitamin B12 shots. There are also no health benefits for taking large amounts of vitamin B12 and no reports of toxicities with large dosages. The RDA for vitamin B12 is 2 micrograms for both men and women.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Mainly animal products, especially liver and other organ meats, clams, and oysters. Milk products, seafood, and eggs are other good sources. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Pantothenic acid<BR></font>
These two B-complex vitamins have never had requirements established because there were no deficiencies reported. Pantothenic acid, or vitamin B5, is essential for metabolizing food and in synthesizing various body chemicals, like hormones and cholesterol. Megadoses cause no toxic effects except possible diarrhea. The estimated safe and adequate intake for pantothenic acid is 4 to 7 mg (No RDA established because there are no reported deficiencies).<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Widespread in foods. Meats, whole-grain cereals, and legumes. Milk, <FONT SIZE=4>fruit</font> and <FONT SIZE=4>vegetables</font> contain a modest amount. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Biotin <BR></font>
Biotin is responsible for metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and the construction and oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids. Deficiency is rare and limited to a few people with inborn metabolic disorders that interfere with the ability to absorb the nutrient. There are no reported toxicity's for an intake up to 10 mg. The estimated safe and adequate intake for biotin is 30 to 100 micrograms.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Liver, egg whites, soybeans, and yeast. Cereals, legumes, and nuts contain moderate amounts. Most fruits and vegetables and meats have little biotin, with the exception of cauliflower and mushrooms.<BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Folacin<BR></font>
Folacin, also known as folate or folic acid, is important to the synthesis of DNA which controls cell function, heredity and tissue growth. It also works in combination with B12 to make red blood cells. There's not a big problem with getting enough folacin because it is so plentiful in foods, but pregnant women should be careful to consume enough because folacin is critical to the growth and development of fetus. Folacin is not toxic except with 100 times the RDA. The RDA of folacin is 200 micrograms for men and 180 micrograms for women. Pregnant women and women of child bearing age should consume 400 micrograms per day.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: <FONT SIZE=4>Dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli, citrus fruits and juices</font>, beans and other legumes, wheat bran and other whole grains, pork, poultry, and shellfish. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Vitamin C<BR></font>
Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, plays many roles in the body. It acts as an antioxidant to protect cells, helps promote healthy gums and teeth, aids in iron absorption, forms collagen, and helps with metabolism of certain amino acids from hormones. An adequate intake also helps prevent cataracts and a low intake is associated with cancer of the stomach and esophagus. There are no studies proving the myth that large doses of vitamin C helps cure a cold, but megadoses can cause diarrhea. The RDA for vitamin C is 60 mg and up to 100 mg for smokers.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Citrus fruits, strawberries, tomatoes, <FONT SIZE=4>broccoli</font>, turnip greens and other greens, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, and cantaloupe. Most other fruits and vegetables contain some vitamin C; Small amounts are found in meats, fish, and milk. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Minerals<BR>
</FONT>Minerals are single inorganic (contain no carbon) elements that are widely distributed in nature. They are basic elements of the earth's crust taken up by water, soil, and sea by erosion. Plants take them up from soil and water and then they are passed to animals and humans when consumed. Minerals make up almost 4% of the body's weight with over sixty of them to count. Only twenty-two of them are considered essential, and they are a vital part of many processes of the body. Minerals are indestructible and therefore are not destroyed by heat, air, acid, or mixing, although some are lost in boiling water while cooking. Minerals perform an impressive amount of metabolic roles including: building, activating, regulating, transmitting, and controlling. <BR>
<BR>
There are major minerals and trace elements. Major minerals occur in larger amounts in the body, and therefore are needed in larger quantities. The major minerals include calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, and sulfur. Trace elements make up the remaining 18 minerals and make up the remaining 20-40% of inorganic substances in the body. They are just as important in the body processes, but are just needed in minute amounts. These trace elements are then subdivided further into essential and essentially unclear. Essential trace element s are iron, iodine, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, cobalt, selenium, molybdenum, and fluorine. We will discuss the important major minerals and trace elements but the others will not be mentioned. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Major Minerals <BR>
Calcium<BR></font>
Calcium is a mineral of big concern in the American diet. The average American women only consumes half of the recommended amount of calcium. Calcium is a mineral that is critical to the proper functioning of the body. It helps build strong bones and teeth and aids in blood clotting, muscle contractions and relaxation, heart action, and nerve transmissions. Calcium is even more critical to consume when your are a growing child and young adult. During that time, the bone mass is developing and will reach its peak around age twenty-five. This does not mean that you can stop worrying about your calcium intake. You still need calcium to maintain the bone mass that has developed. As you age, the bone mass begins to decline and your body has a reduced ability to absorb calcium efficiently, and you become at risk for osteoporosis. (see broccoli &amp; your health) <BR>
<BR>
It is also believed that the best source of calcium is from dairy products. That is a big problem because a certain percentage of people are lactose intolerant. Lactose, a sugar in dairy products, is sometimes indigestible and causes stomach discomfort (i.e bloating, cramps, nausea, diarrhea). Ounce for ounce, broccoli has as much calcium as milk, and provides many other health benefits as well. The RDA for calcium is 1200 mg for people 11 to 24 years old, pregnant women, and lactating women, and 800 mg for all other ages.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: <FONT SIZE=4>Broccoli</font>, milk and milk products, some tofu, whole grains, egg yolk, legumes, nuts, sardines, salmon (with bones) and <FONT SIZE=4>dark green leafy vegetables,</font>. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Phosphorus<BR></font>
Phosphorus is vital for energy production and helps build bone and teeth as well as helps form cells and genetic material. Phosphorus is readily consumed in the American diet because of the high consumption rate of sodas and processed foods. It also is related with calcium in effecting bone mass. A few studies found that a diet high in phosphorus and low in calcium has a great effect on the mineral content of bones. It's necessary to try and balance the intake of both. The RDA of phosporus is the same as calcium: 1200 mg for 11 to 24 years old and 800 mg for 24 and older.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Almost all foods: fish, meat, poultry, dairy products, eggs, peas, beans, and nuts. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Sodium<BR></font>
Sodium helps regulate blood pressure by controlling water balance and extracellular fluid. It also plays a major role in muscle action and acid-base balance. Sodium is a mineral that Americans do not fall short of because of its presence in all proceessed and natural foods in the from of salt (sodium-chloride), baking soda, baking powder and as a mineral. In continuation with the nutrition &quot;moderation&quot; theory, sodium falls right into place. Many people believe salt is evil because the role it plays with high blood pressure, but it is an essential element to life. Some people are &quot;salt-sensitive&quot; and therefore need to watch and limit their intake because it causes fluid retention and increased blood pressure. Others who are not &quot;salt-sensitive&quot;, can consume as much as they like and it won't benefit, or hurt them. The excess will simply be excreted in the urine, so always drink a lot of water. <BR>
Unfortunately, there is no way to detect if you are salt sensitive, and currently, 50 million Americans have high blood pressure which is why health professionals recommend limiting the amount consumed. If you do have high blood pressure, please consult your doctor or registered dietitian about the amount of sodium you can consume. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Table salt and salt added to prepared foods, especially cheese, smoked meats, soups, salty snacks, and fast food items. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Potassium<BR></font>
Potassium is necessary for muscle action, nerve impulses, and proper functioning of the heart and kidneys. It also, along with calcium, magnesium, and sodium, helps regulate blood pressure and water balance. It is also believed that a high potassium diet helps reduce the risk of stroke and hypertension (high blood pressure). The RDA of potassium is 2,000 mg a day. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: <FONT SIZE=4>Broccoli</font>, apricots, avocados, cantaloupes, bananas, currants, dates, kidney beans, kiwi fruit, mushrooms, oranges, pears, potatoes, prunes, and <FONT SIZE=4>spinach</font>.<BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Magnesium<BR></font>
Magnesium is critical to many metabolic functions and aids in bone growth and the function of nerves, bones, and muscles, including the heart. A low intake has been linked to high blood pressure, heart-rhythm abnormalities, and as a result, heart attacks. Use of diuretic drugs (used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and high blood pressure) and an excessive intake of alcohol, which acts as a diuretic, can lead to further excretion of magnesium. Mild deficiency symptoms are fatigue, weakness, and muscle cramps which are easily confused with other problems. The RDA for magnesium is 350 mg for men and 280 mg for women. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Wheat bran, whole grains, leafy green vegetables, meat, milk, nuts, beans, bananas, and apricots. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Chloride<BR></font>
Chloride, also known as chlorine, is responsible for maintaining the body's fluid balance and buffer systems. It also is an essential part of the stomach's gastric juices which digests <BR>
foods. No RDA is establishe due to the fact that there are no known deficiencies. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Table salt and fish.<BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Trace Elements<BR>
Chromium<BR></font>
Chromium is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Recently, there has been a lot of hype about chromium as a &quot;fat burner&quot;, etcetera, but there has been no long term studies done on the short-term and long-term effects of chromium, and therefore leaves plenty of room for skepticism. Chromium does acts as a diuretic and therefore may seem as if you have lost weight, but in water, and it may play a role in people who are deficient in this mineral, in helping with the action of insulin and regulation of glucose in the body. Supplements of this mineral may prove to help with glucose intolerance and lower insulin levels, but there is not enough research to allow a recommendation. The estimated safe and adequate daily intake for adults is 50 to 200 micrograms.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Meat, whole grains, brewer's yeast, and fortified cereals. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Copper<BR></font>
Copper acts as part of an enzyme system that consumes oxygen and free radicals which helps us release energy and heal wounds. It also helps form red blood cells with iron. Deficiencies are quite rare, but symptoms of deficiencies are anemia, with decreased white blood cells, and osteoporosis. The estimated safe and adequate daily intake of copper for adults is 1.5 to 3.0 mg. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Shellfish, nuts, beans, organ meats, whole grains, and potatoes. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Fluorine<BR></font>
Fluorine, also known as fluoride, helps form bones and teeth and some studies support that it helps prevent osteoporosis. One of the most common uses of fluorine is in the prevention of tooth decay where it has been most beneficial. The estimated safe and adequate daily intake for fluorine is 1.5 to 4 mg for an adult. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Fluoridated water and foods grown or cooked in it, canned fish (with the bones), and tea. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Iodine<BR></font>
Iodine, also known as iodide, is necessary for normal cell metabolism and is essential in the synthesis and secretion thyroid hormones. A deficiency in iodine is the development of goiter, a condition which enlarges the thyroid gland. This condition however is nonexisten in the United States due to the introduction of iodinized salt. The estimated safe and adequate daily intake for an adult is 150 micrograms. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Sea water, seaweed, seafood, table salt, dairy products, and crops from iodine rich areas. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Iron<BR></font>
Iron is essential to the formation of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood, and myoglobin, which carries oxygen in muscle. It is also involved in the making of amino acids, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Symptoms of deficiencies are anemia, concentration difficulty, fatique, weakness, and cold hands and feet. Heme iron, iron from animal sources, is absorbed better than nonheme iron, iron from plant sources. If consuming a strict vegetarian diet, be sure to consume vitamin C with the nonheme iron sources to aid with absorption. The estimated safe and adequate daily intake for adults is 10 mg, but for women between the ages of 19 to 50 years old 50 mg is recommended. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Liver, kidneys, red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, peas, beans, nuts, dried fruits, leafy green vegetables, enriched past and bread, and fortified cereals.<BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Zinc<BR></font>
Zinc is important in the activity of enzymes needed for cell division, growth, and repair and assists with the immune system . Zinc deficiency is rare, but occurs in heavy drinkers, endurance athletes and strict vegetarians. The RDA for zinc is 15 mg for men and 12 mg for women. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Manganese<BR></font>
Manganese plays a role with reproduction and energy production. It is believed that manganese plays a vital role in building bones as well. Deficiency is practically unheard of because of the wide spread availability in foods. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Whole grains, nuts, beans, vegetables, fruit, instant coffee, tea, and cocoa powder. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Molybdenum<BR></font>
Molybdenum is needed as an activator of certain enzymes in the body. It is required in minute amounts which is easily acquired in the diet. No deficiency has ever been recorded in humans. <BR>
<BR>
Sources: Whole grains, liver, beans, and <FONT SIZE=4>leafy vegetables</font>. <BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
Selenium<BR></font>
Selenium is a part of certain enzymes which act as antioxidants and helps the immune ssytem and heart functions. The RDA was just recently estblished and is 70 micrograms for men and 55 micrograms for women.<BR>
<BR>
Sources: Fish, shellfish, red meat, grains, eggs, chicken, garlic, amd liver. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Water<BR>
</FONT>The human body can only live a few days without water. Although not classified as a nutrient, water is the single most important factor to human life. More than half the body's weight is water and it is the basis of all bodily fluids and most functions. Water is important factor in losing and maintaining your weight. It helps the body feel full, while also suppressing the appetite and helping the body metabolize stored fat. It helps treat fluid retention, which is caused by too little water or excess sodium. Water maintains muscle tone by giving muscles their natural ability to contract and prevents dehydration during exercise.<BR>
<BR>
It is recommended to drink at least 64 ounces each day. That is actually the minimum recommendation. During exercise of even mild intensity, your body requires more water (2 cups every 15 minutes). Cold water absorbs more quickly than warmer temperatures and some people believe it helps your body burn extra calories to warm it up.<BR>

<br>
Wondering whats in all those little snacks youve been eating?  Hopefully, by now,  everyone looks at the back of a food products label before purchasing.  The "Nutrition Facts" labeling, found on the label of all food products since May 8, 1994,  was designed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in correlation with multiple consumer studies.  The new label was designed to make reading nutritional information on product packages easier for consumers and in a language they understand.

Before the new labeling was introduced manufacturers could put information such as saturated fat and cholesterol on the labels voluntarily, but facts such as dietary fiber and sugars were not allowed.  
<p>
 The purpose of the new "Nutrition Facts" labeling is to clear up confusion that has prevailed in food labeling for years, to help consumers choose more healthful diets, and to offer an incentive to food companies to improve the nutritional qualities of their products.

<p>
The new food label rules effect the fresh fruit and vegetable industry in a variety of ways.  Fresh fruits and vegetables treated with post-harvest wax or resin coatings must indicate the presence of coatings following the FDAs new rule, for example, with apples. The labeling for fresh fruit and vegetables is covered by a <b>voluntary</b> program following  guidelines issued by FDA in November 1991.  Under this rule it is the responsibility of the <b>retailers</b> to provide nutrition information for the twenty most frequently consumed varieties of fresh fruit  and twenty most frequently consumed varieties of fresh vegetables.  This information should be available to consumers at the point of purchase in the form of posters, brochures, notebook, etc.
<p>
When considering the fresh-cut packaged category of fresh fruits and vegetables, it is still voluntary for manufacturers to provide nutritional labeling.  The exception of this rule is when another product is in the package.

For example, with <b>Manns Broccoli Wokly with Cheese</b>, the nutritional information of the cheese is required on the package.  Fortunately, most of the manufacturers place the Nutrition Facts on all consumer packages.
<p>
Nutrient content claims (e.g. LOW FAT, GOOD SOURCE OF VITAMIN C, HIGH FIBER) can be made only if the product meets composition requirements established by the FDA.  The FDA has reviewed research supporting individual claims for specific product categories, and then grant permission to companies to make the claim.  If it fits the composition requirements for the claim, the company can use it on their packaging. For example, <b>broccoli</b>  is allowed to add the health claims between:<b> vegetables and cancer, fat and cancer, saturated fat and cholesterol/coronary heart disease, and sodium and hypertension.</b>  These are established and approved by the FDA.

<FONT SIZE=5>Broccoli is known as the &quot;Crown Jewel of Nutrition&quot;
for its vitamin-rich, high in fiber, and low in calorie properties.
Not only does broccoli give you the best vegetable nutrition available,
it also gives you many ways to lead a healthier, longer life.
Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States
with cancer as the second, and broccoli gives you many ways to
help fight and prevent these and other diseases. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><u>Broccoli and Cancer</u></FONT></B>
<br><b>
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States.
Unfortunately, most cases go undetected for years before symptoms
appear and that limits the amount of therapies available. The
best medicine is preventive medicine, in the health outlook, and
that is where nutrition plays the largest role. Eating a healthy
diet, low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables, does not guarantee
that you will not become infected with the disease, but it definitely
lowers your risk. Broccoli has multiple cancer-fighting properties
including vitamin C, beta carotene, and fiber. It is also rich
of phytochemicals which appear to offer us protection against
certain cancers and heart disease. Indole carbinol and sulforaphane
are two different phytochemicals that are found in broccoli. 
<BR>

<br>
A medium size stalk of broccoli provides 220% of your daily value
of vitamin C. That same medium stalk of broccoli provides 15%
of your daily value of vitamin A, in the form of beta carotene

byproduct of everyday metabolism, but in excessive number, free
radicals may be a factor in diseases as cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's,
and heart disease. A study done by Dr. Harman of the University
of Nebraska College of Medicine, suggests that free radicals play
a significant role in the aging process: cataracts, heart disease,

<B><font size=4><u>Fiber and Cancer</u></font></B>
<br>
Colon and rectal cancers are the second leading cause of cancer
deaths in the US. These types of cancers are also lower in countries
where a diet low in meat and high in fiber. Although there is
no study showing exactly how fiber prevents cancer, there are
a few theories which make a lot of sense. One is that food moves
faster and with greater bulk, therefore reducing the concentration
of carcinogenic substances in the bowel. The second theory is
that fiber reduces transit time through the colon, thereby reducing
contact time between fecal carcinogens and the colonic mucosa
on the walls of the colon. The last theory is that increased fiber
in the diet decreases the amount of bile acids in the intestines
and bacterial metabolism to decrease carcinogen production.<BR>

<B><font size=4><u>Indole Carbinol and Cancer</u></font></B>
<br>
Broccoli is rich in indole carbinol, which is a substance that
breaks down estrogen, and comes from the phytochemical family.
Estrogen is a hormone which seems to promote the development of
certain breast tumors, among many other physiological functions.
Some researchers believe that a cup of broccoli a day is0 enough
indole carbinol to help ward off these tumors.<BR>

<B><font size=4><u>Sulforaphane and Cancer</u></font></B>
<br>
Dr. Paul Talalay of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine developed
a simple cell-culture test which showed that certain cruciferous
vegetables increase the activity of protective enzymes that fight
cancer, one in particular was<I> quinone reductase</I>. The responsible
chemical in the broccoli that made this enzyme increase is sulforaphane.
Sulforaphane is found in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli,
kale, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts (as well as non-cruciferous
vegetables, such as carrots and green onions. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><u>Broccoli and Diabetes</u></FONT></B>
<br>
Diabetes, short for diabetes mellitus, is a disease which alters
the endocrine system, which controls all of your hormones. It's
characterized as an inability for cells to metabolize glucose
effectively resulting in hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose
levels). The elevated glucose levels is a direct result of an
absolute or relative deficiency in insulin. Broccoli helps battle
diabetes because of its high fiber content. Eating a diet high
in fiber improves the control of blood sugar and can therefore
decrease the need for insulin and other medications. Soluble fiber
seems to delay the emptying of the stomach and therefore slows
the absorption of glucose in the intestine. If you are diabetic
or know anyone who is, eating a high fiber diet only helps control
diabetes, <I>it is not a replacement for insulin injections or
medications</I>. Please consult your medical doctor or registered
dietitian if you have any questions.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><u>Broccoli and Osteoporosis</u></FONT></B>
<br>
The University of California's Wellness Letter indicates that
broccoli has as much calcium, ounce for ounce, as milk. As mentioned
in Mann's Nutrition Report, calcium is an essential mineral in
building and maintaining bone mass, as well as controlling muscle
functions. It is critical to eat enough calcium rich foods during
childhood and young adulthood to build up adequate bone mass.
Many adults drink little to no milk at all and that is why there
must be an awareness that there are many calcium rich foods other
than milk--like broccoli. <BR>

<P>
At the age of thirty to forty the bone mass density begins to
decline, even if you have built adequate bone mass in your younger
years. This is even more critical for women because a lack of
calcium in the diet, combined with the body's inability to absorb
calcium efficiently, contributes to the onset of osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis is a drastic loss of bone mass and density that increasingly
makes bone more fragile. During and after menopause, woman's estrogen
production impairs the bones' ability to retain calcium. Many
other lifestyle factors affect this bone mass reduction including
exercise, heredity, and drugs. A recent study, according to University
of California's <I>Wellness Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition,
</I>found that eating adequate amount of calcium can help reduce
the risk of hip fracture by 50 to 60 %. For further inquiry, please
consult your physician about other preventative measures or call
the <B>National Osteoporosis Foundation</B> at 1-800-223-9994.

<B><FONT SIZE=4><u>Broccoli and Obesity</u></FONT></B>
<br>
Broccoli helps fight obesity by being a low-fat, low calorie,
highly nutritious vegetable option to any healthy meal plan. Eating
lots of broccoli fills you up with the bulk of high-fiber, and
without adding extra calories. Broccoli also plays a preventive
role in many of the other chronic diseases that come with being
obese: diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. In the United
States obesity is a growing concern for both adults and especially
children, which is why a healthy well-rounded diet with an exercise
program is so critical fo follow. Remember, you can't go on a
diet......you need to make lifestyle changes. 
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><u>Broccoli and Hypertension</u></FONT></B>
<br>
Hypertension is the clinical term for high blood pressure. High
blood pressure is defined as sustained elevated arterial blood
pressure measured indirectly by an inflatable cuff and pressure.
In correcting hypertension, most physicians will prescribe a diet
low in sodium or medication, like diuretics, to control water
balance in the body. Sodium restriction is only part of a program
to lower your blood pressure. Dr. Louis Tobian of the University
of Minnesota believes that most people do not get enough potassium
in their diet and says that a lack of potassium can also cause
a weakening of arterial wall, leading to potential cardiovascular
problems due to the stresses of high blood pressure. Broccoli
contains 15% of your daily value of potassium in a 2000 kcal/day
diet. Weight reduction, restriction of alcohol, modification of
fat intake, an exercise program, stress reduction, and avoidance
of tobacco are other therapies for high blood pressure. Broccoli's
role is that it's a nutritious vegetable to add to a diet low
in sodium, fat, and calories. The goal in controlling high blood
pressure is to reduce diastolic blood pressure to below 90 mm
Hg ( mm Hg=millimeters of Mercury) and to achieve and maintain
arterial blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg. Please contact your
physician or local health clinic to check your blood pressure.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><u>Broccoli and Heart Disease</u></FONT></B>
<br>
Heart disease consists of heart attacks, or congestive heart failure,
when the heart fails as a pump and cannot deliver and the adequate
amount of oxygenated blood to body tissues. Loaded in broccoli,
beta carotene lowers the risk of heart attacks. A study done by
researchers at Harvard Medical School report that men with clogged
arteries who were fed beta carotene supplements suffered half
as many heart seizures and strokes as did men given placebo pills.
The high fiber content also helps reduce the total blood cholesterol
levels, primarily by lowering the LDL or &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol.
It has also been reported that the folate content in broccoli,
along with the other B vitamin's, help protect against heart disease.
They help control homocysteine, an amino acid, which is produced
normally in the blood, but has currently been linked as a risk
factor for heart disease. Broccoli's role in preventing heart
disease is mentioned in all of the articles above: it's full of
vitamins and minerals; it's high in fiber, low in fat and calories;
and high in calcium and potassium which help with cardiac and
skeletal muscle functions. For more information on heart disease
please call the American Heart Association at 1-800- AHA-USA1.

<u><B><FONT SIZE=4>Parents and Educators </FONT></B></u><br>


There is a growing concern for the need to educate children on how to eat and live healthy lifestyles. The Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) reported on June 3, 1991 that more than 90% of children's television advertisements on a typical Saturday morning promoted food of low nutritional value. <BR>

<P>
One of the most critical ages is when the child is becoming a teenager, or their pre-teen years. At this age, children become more responsible in helping out in the household. It is also a period where children begin to develop life-long habits. That is why it's important to emphasize healthy eating habits, outdoor/indoor physical activities, and limited television viewing, as well as junk foods and fast foods in moderation. Parents are the role models for children and they will follow in their footsteps. Here's a few ways to get you and/or your family on the right track.<BR>

<P>
There are a lot of nutritional lesson plans already set up and ready to go for kids, it's just the matter of bringing them into action. The following are some educational resources for parents and educators to teach children healthy lifestyle habits in a fun and interesting way. <BR>

<br>
The Produce for Better Health Foundation and the National Cancer Institute have developed a nationwide program aimed at consumers to get everyone to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. A majority of states have their own programs set up through their Department of Health Services offering a variety of educational resources for everyone. The following are some facts gathered by the California Department of Health Services for their 5 A DAY Power Play Campaign aimed at targeting California's 9 to 11 year olds with nutrition education.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>What health problems of children are associated with a poor diet?<BR>
</B></font>

Poor diet contributes to obesity, high blood cholesterol, anemia, susceptibility to lead poisoning, low self esteem, and poor school performance. Good dietary habits may give kids a head start in reducing the risk of chronic diseases later in life (like certain common cancers, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis). <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Why do children need to eat fruits and vegetables?<BR>
</B></font>

Fruits and vegetables are the major dietary sources of many nutrients essential to growth and development, such as vitamins A, C, and folate, as well as dietary fiber and other protective plant substances. It is recommended that all children over the age of two years eat a low-fat, high fiber diet high in fruits and vegetables. <BR>


<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>How many fruits and vegetables should children be eating?<BR>
</B></font>

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the California Department of Health Services, and the California Department of Education all recommend that kids eat 5 servings or more of fruits and vegetables every day. Five servings a day is a national health goal for the year 2000. A recent study found that fourth, fifth, and sixth graders in California eat a little over 3 servings daily -- too few for good health.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Why do children need to have a special program?<BR>
</B></font>

Kids will not respond to a health campaign that looks like one for adults. They love humor, action, color, music, fantasy, and competition. Their authority figures are older kids, cool kids (like themselves), and celebrities they admire. They look closely at style and fashion, and they want to know what the immediate benefits are. They can be reached best through radio, TV, and popular culture, like music and sports.<BR>

<P>
Kids' fruit and vegetable preferences are also different. They like fruit. But in vegetables they that what they think is hard, tough, bland, or mushy. They like distinct texture, finger foods, strong flavors like Chinese, Mexican, and Italian, dips and sauces, soups, and salads. They like recipes that are easy to read and simple to prepare. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Why is the program aimed at 9 to 11 years old? <BR>
</B></font>

This is a transitional age. Control of the child's diet is shifting from total responsibility of the parent to shared responsibility with the child. Children are becoming more autonomous, and they are very impressionable. Health beliefs begin to solidify. Interest in nutrition is still high. The child is not yet buying much of his own food. Dietary quality may not yet have begun to decline.<BR>

The USDA created the Food Guide Pyramid as an adaptation from the basic four food groups. It has the base of a healthy diet at the bottom of the pyramid--Whole Grain Bread, Cereal, Rice, and Pasta: 6-11 servings. Remember that a serving is a half a cup of rice, a slice of bread, or a half a bagel. As the pyramid increases it visually relates the need for eating less of the food in the those categories. It is colorful and extremely easy to understand. <BR>
<P>

Print out a copy of the Food Guide Pyramid and have your children color it. Then hang it on your refrigerator, as a reminder for the entire family. Quiz your children, or class, about what was included in their breakfast, lunch, dinner, etcetera. Try to make meal time an educational time. <I>SHAPE </I>magazine reported that mealtime chats boost kids' vocabularies. It stated that, &quot;3 to 4 year-olds whose parents talk to them at dinner time and expose them to &quot;rare&quot; words--- terms such as gymnastics, amusement park and asparagus, for example---score higher on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at age five than children who don't get that stimulation.&quot;<BR>
<P>

Also, with all of the emphasis on eating healthy, don't forget to stress the importance of exercise and active living. When weather permits, go on a walk after dinner with the family instead of sitting down to watch television. Please also remember the importance of water as a key component to the Food Guide Pyramid. Drink a minimum of 8-10 one cup servings every day. For more fitness ideas, link to the fitness section of the site.<BR>

<p>

The American Heart Association is beginning their new Heart Power Campaign<B><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></B>in the Fall of 1996. HEARTPOWER! is a preschool through middle school program that includes a rich collection of materials -- each component is easy to integrate into day-to-day instruction. Every level of HEARTPOWER! is packed with fun, motivating activities to teach about nutrition, physical activity, how the heart works, and living tobacco-free. <BR>

<P>
The American Heart Association also has other programs designed to help us keep our hearts healthy from preschool to adulthood. Some of the activities include: Heart Partners, Hoops for Heart, Jump Rope for Heart, Hearty School Lunch, Heart at Work, American Heart Walk, and American Heart Month (February). <BR>

<img src="../images/HIGHFIVE.jpg" border=0>  <B><FONT SIZE=5><u>&quot;Natural High-Five&quot;:</u> Nutrition Calendar</FONT></B>
<br>
Manning Enterprises has created a Natural High-Five Calendar, a spin-off from &quot;Vinnie's Fruit and Veggie Friends&quot;, an educational play designed for children's theater. It's a story about a little boy who sees himself inadequate and undermines his ability to grow a backyard garden. One by one the characters, which are different vegetables and fruits, come alive to teach Vinnie how to build his self-esteem and become the person he dreams of being. In doing this, the characters also teach him about proper nutrition.<BR>
<p>

The calendar, which features the fruit and vegetable characters, is designed for children and their parents to work together at home, to reinforce the nutrition education the children have learned. The calendar is very interactive with a vibrant color scheme on each of the monthly sheets where you write in the dates. When they fulfill their Natural High-Five recommendations, they place a sticker that day. The calendar also has an outline of a hand print, listing the nutrient recommendations, where the child can give the calendar a &quot;high-five&quot;. Each of the monthly sheets are bordered with the fruit and veggie characters, types of grains, and milk. These are provided in black outline so the child can color his/her differently each month. The stickers provided for the calendar also coincide with the months, for example, July has flags and November has turkeys.<BR>

<P>
There is also a nutrition review sheet of major vitamins and minerals to help parents answer children's questions and a coloring book, posters, and a home video of the play coming soon! The calendar's name also enforces an underlying message to say no to drugs, yes to good nutrition! <BR>

<P><b>
Most children are wary of anything new and different that appears
on their plates.  At school, tasting parties and cooking experiences
are used to encourage children to try new things.<BR>

<P>
The following are some ideas to encourage a child to have a more
open and adventurous attitude toward food.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Set an enthusiastic example;  children learn by watching those
around them.  When they see older children eating broccoli enthusiastically,
they may decide to imitate them.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Serve a new food with familiar foods.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Serve small portions of a new food.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Do not make a fuss if the child doe not eat the food.  Encourage,
but do not force a child to taste the food.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Serve the new food again in a week or two;  during the next
serving attempt, the child may be more willing to try the new
food.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Have the child help in the kitchen or help with the shopping.
 It is hard for children to resist tasting something they have
helped prepare.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Start a small garden.  Children may be more willing to eat
homegrown vegetables they have picked themselves.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Try preparing the food a different way.  For example, if your
child does not like cooked vegetables, serve them raw as &igrave;rabbit
nibbles&icirc;.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Do not stop eating foods you like because your child does
not like them.  If you do, you may find yourself eating a monotonous
and restricted selection of foods.  Instead, continue to prepare
these foods.  One day your child will surprise you and join in
your enjoyment.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>BEING ACTIVE VS. WORKING OUT<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Americans have an obsession with work. If they aren't going to
work, they are working out, and even when studying, we're doing
homework. The problems that we've pointed out in the Fitness Facts
about American inactivity is that people look at activity as <U>work</U>.
We need to change our attitudes towards working out and look at
being active. Living an active lifestyle may include working out
at a gym, but more importantly, it means just getting out of the
house and moving. Some tips for improving your activity are:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
<li> Turn up the stereo and dance. Grab your spouse or children and
just get moving to your favorite tunes.<BR>

<P>
<li> Park your car at the back of the parking lot; the extra walk
will take as long as it would to circle to find a closer parking
space. <BR>

<P>
<li> Take your dog or children (or a neighbor's dog) on a walk. If
it's cold or rainy, bundle up and grab an umbrella. <BR>

<P>
<li> Go outside and do some yard work: plant a garden, rake leaves,
shovel snow, pull weeds, or clean out your garage or shed.<BR>

<P>
<li> Always take the stairs when you have a chance. Walking up and
down stairs is great exercise.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Self Esteem and Body Image</FONT></B>
<br>
There is a growing concern with body image and self esteem. With
one third of Americans being overweight and the government report
saying that 40% of women say they are overweight when in fact
they are not, has to do with unrealistic body images. Fashion
magazines are covered front to back with the so-called &quot;ideal&quot;
woman. These women models are genetically different from average
women. Why do you think there are less than a dozen Supermodels
in the world? <BR>

<P>
The ideal height for a model is 5'9&quot;(175 cm), when in fact
the average women is between 5'3&quot; and 5'4&quot; (163 cm)
. On the average a model's weight is about ten pounds under the
healthy recommended weight for her height. The average model at
a height of 5'9&quot; weighs 123 pounds (55 kg), when the upper
end of the recommended weight chart is 170 pounds (76.5 kg). The
women of average height , 5'4&quot;, weighs about 142 pounds (64
kg). Models even lack the adequate amount of body fat (17%) needed
for menstruation and childbearing. Even their hip measurements
of 34 to 35 inches are very rare in reality, but are an industry
standard. What women need to remember is that a model's body is
her profession.<BR>

<P>
Remember, how we feel about ourselves is how people will perceive
us. Having a positive attitude about yourself is the best way
to feel good about yourself. Better yet, it helps reflect your
positive attitude upon others. Laughing and smiling burns calories.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<img src="../images/bullets/redline.jpg">


<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Why should we exercise?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Exercise, defined by the <U>Oxford American Dictionary</U>, means
an &quot;activity requiring physical exertion, done for the sake
of health.&quot; There are two different types of exercise you
can engage in: aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercise means that
you are using oxygen. It usually is a sustained use of large muscle
groups for a duration. This duration allows the body to respond
to the increased need for oxygen the muscles that are working
require. Some believe that our bodies don't &quot;burn fat&quot;
until 20 minutes into our workout, but this is false. Our bodies
burn calories at rest, therefore any increase in activity will
burn additional calories, thus initiating a reduction in fat.
<BR>

<P>
Anaerobic exercise is defined as short burst of energy that does
not use oxygen and lasts 10 to 30 seconds. For the first 2 to
3 minutes of a workout our bodies are using the limited amount
of glycogen (sugar in the muscle) at the site of the muscle. Any
activity past that is aerobic activity, but each person differs
with there anaerobic/aerobic threshold. Meaning that someone may
take 2 to 3 minutes to reach aerobic exercise, while another may
take ten minutes. A person just beginning a workout program is
a good example of this.<BR>

<P>
Exercise is not just for you body, but critical for your mind.
Exercise makes you feel energized and puts you in a great mood.
After a great workout sometimes people mention a natural &quot;high&quot;
caused by a release of endorphins in the body. Exercise can be
a special time for yourself or time set aside with a good friend.
Remember to pick out types of exercises that you enjoy and always
vary so you don't get bored.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Strength Training and Endurance Exercises<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The benefits of strength training are numerous. Building lean
muscle mass helps prevent injuries by adding additional support
for the joints and to promote muscle balance for proper posture.
It also helps increase bone density and strengthens connective
tissues. Strength training helps you perform everyday tasks as
well as improve your sports performance. And best of all, it improves
your appearance and enhancement of lean body mass, which increases
your metabolism. When thinking of lean body mass, remember the
saying, &quot;use it or lose it,&quot; because if you stop working
your muscles, they will soon disappear. That's why it is so important
to do light strength training, as a minimum, especially for the
elderly. Read books on strength training (local library), rent
videos, or ask a certified personal trainer (at most gyms - check
for certification). <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Starting an Exercise Program<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When starting an exercise program please consult
your physician to make sure you are in good health. Ease into
a program instead of jumping full force, especially if you were

will lessen the chances of becoming really sore, discouraged,
and quitting. The following are various activities and the estimated

<P>
Some examples of fitness goals are: increase your physical activity;
lose some excess body fat; try to eat more healthy; or increase
your muscle mass. Once you determine them, be sure to make your
fitness goals realistic. They will be easier to stick with and
to get started. Below are some tips for beginning and maintaining
an active, healthy lifestyle. <BR>

</FONT></B>
<P><ul>
<li> Develop an exercise routine that easily fits your schedule.
It's easier to stick with.<BR>

<P>
<li> Don't diet. Make healthy dietary changes that are realistic.
An example is to not stop eating sandwiches, but say no to mayonnaise
and cheese and get lean turkey for your meat. <BR>

<P>
<li> Don't go to bed after a large meal. Either try and eat earlier
or go on a walk after dinner instead of hitting the couch.<BR>

<P>
<li> Consider exercise as an appointment with yourself. Treat it
like you would a meeting or lunch date.<BR>

<P>
<li> Find any form of exercise you enjoy, and do a variety of activities
regularly.<BR>

<P>
<li> Get a partner: a friend, spouse, child, or pet. It will keep
you both going.<BR>

<P>
<li> Take pictures to see results of your efforts and keep old ones
around for encouragement.<BR>

<P>
<li> Eat five to six small healthful meals a day to keep your metabolism
(starving shuts it off) running and to prevent you from ever getting
really hungry.<BR>

<P>
<li> Don't forbid anything. Allow yourself treats in moderation.
<BR>

<P>
<li> Listen to your body: if it hurts, stop; if it's hungry, eat.
<BR>

<P>
<li> Drink lots and lots of water. At least 64 ounces a day (2 large
water bottles); more on days you exercise intensely or when it's
especially hot. <BR>

<P>
<li> Take days off from exercise. Your body needs time to build and
repair.<BR>

<P>
<li> Make sure you are making these lifestyle changes for yourself
and no one else.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Healthy Eating Tips <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P><ul>
<li> Follow the USDA's Food Guide Pyramid. Emphasize the bulk of
your food sources from fruit and vegetables, then carbohydrates,
dairy and protein.<BR>

<P>
<li> Remember what a proper portion size is. The Food Guide Pyramid
recommends 6 to 11 servings of grain products, but a serving size
is half a bagel, half a cup of rice or pasta, or one slice of
bread. A lot of people see weight gain due to excessive intake
of carbohydrates, so, stick to whole grains and cereals, stay
away from refined bread, cereal, and rice, and remember serving
sizes.<BR>

<P>
<li> Try to eat a large breakfast and lunch with snacks in between
and less at dinner. Also, try and eat a more vegetable based dinner.
For example, focus your meal on a baked potato instead of steak
or chicken.<BR>

<P>
<li> Eat more servings of calcium rich foods like low-fat dairy products
or broccoli, and eat less protein, especially if you are a woman.
<BR>

<P>
<li> Remember to consume water. At least 64 ounces per day. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>How Many Calories Do You Need?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The following steps are tool to help figure out your daily caloric needs. Remember that this is just a guideline for you to follow and if you have any questions, please contact your doctor or a local registered dietitian.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step One:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Multiply your ideal body weight or present weight by 10 (use your ideal body weight if you want to lose body fat). How to find your ideal body weight is given below. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE: <BR>
145 (Present or ideal body weight)<BR>
<U>X10<BR>
</U>1450 (kcal you need daily to rest)<BR>
</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step Two: </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Find your activity factor in the list below and multiply it by your weight to get the calories you need to perform daily activities. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE:<BR>
145 <BR>
<U>X 5</U> (activity factor) <BR>
725 (kcal you need for daily ativities) <BR>
</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step Three: </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Add the sums from steps one and two to get the calories you need daily to maintain your present weight. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>EXAMPLE: <BR>
1450 <BR>
<U>+ 725</U> <BR>
2175 (kcal you need daily to maintain your present/ideal weight)<BR>
</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Step Four:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you want ot lose weight, subtract 250-500 calories a day and increase your exercise to burn an additional 250-500 kcal/day. This will allow a healthy weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. To gain weight add an additional 500 kcal/day and increase your strength training to ensure a weight gain of helathy muscle and not fat.<BR>

2175 <BR>

<P>
REMEMBER: These are only estimates. Individual activity factors and body frames vary from person to person and the individual's lean body mass. The most important thing to remember in reaching and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is to get to know your body and your body type. Every person who is 5'4&quot;, is not going to weigh 120 lb. The average person's body is on the upper end of the scale, around 135lb. So please, remember to personalize your needs based on the guidelines given.

<p>
<img src="../images/bullets/redline.jpg">
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Importance of Water</FONT></B>
<P>
The human body can only live a few days without water. Although
not classified as a nutrient, water is the single most important
factor to human life. More than half the body's weight is water
and it is the basis of all bodily fluids and most functions. Water
is the single most important factor in losing and maintaining
your weight. It helps the body feel full, while also suppressing
the appetite and helping the body metabolize stored fat. It helps
treat fluid retention, which is caused by too little water or
excess sodium. Water maintains muscle tone by giving muscles their
natural ability to contract and prevents dehydration during exercise.
<BR>

<P>
It is recommended to drink at least 64 ounces each day. That is
actually the minimum recommendation. During exercise of even mild
intensity, your body requires more water (2 cups every 15 minutes).
Cold water is absorbed more quickly than warmer temperatures and
some people believe it helps you body burn extra calories to warm
it up.<p>

</FONT></B>
<P><ul>
<li><B><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></B>Don't get compulsive about food.
It's meant to be enjoyed.<BR>

<P>
<li> Eat only 30 percent of your calories from fat, 55 percent from
carbohydrate and 15 percent from protein (includes dairy). <BR>

<P>
<li> Eat several small meals a day, instead of three big ones. <BR>

<P>
<li> Drink at least two liters of water per day (64 ounces). <BR>

A diet diary isn't something you always want to carry around and
obsess over, but it's great when you're staring a new healthy
diet plan to monitor exactly what, when and where you are eating.
You can identify when you become hungry during the day, so in
the future you'll know to bring a healthy snack. You can also
write down your exercise routine to estimate your daily caloric
expenditure. <BR>

Tom Livingston, the Director of Foodservice at Mann Packing Company, scored his first major foodservice success at the age of eleven. He found that adding a few ounces of his Dads Jack Daniels to his Mothers Toll House Cookie dough brought him fame if not fortune. At least, when he took the cookies to school, they made him the most popular kid in his fifth grade class.
<P>
After college, Tom, who likes to write, published a novel, took the money and went to live in Europe for six years where he learned first hand about French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian food and wine by eating and drinking as much of each as he could.
<p>
Later he became head of promotions for Saga Food Service, and still later, vice president of marketing for the health care and Canadian divisions of Saga Corporation. Saga, a $1 billion foodservice contract management and restaurant holding company was acquired by Marriott in 1985. At the time, it was the largest college feeder in the country.
</td>
<td valign="top" width="300">
Tom also served as senior vice president/creative director of a major San Francisco foodservice advertising agency, where he was responsible for creating foodservice ads for the Alaskan Seafood Marketing Institute, the Idaho Potato Commission, the California Strawberry Commission, the Idaho-Oregon Onion Promotion Committee, the California Date Advisory Committee,  the California Iceberg Lettuce Commission, Dole Packaged Foods Company, Farmland Foods, Inc., and the New Zealand Fruit Company.
<p>
He has served as a consultant for such clients as Marriott Corporation, Service America, Inc. and the Refectory Restaurants.

Q) What does Broccoli Wokly mean?</font></i><br>
A) Broccoli Wokly is the name of a random-cut broccoli florette introduced by Mann Packing Company in the mid-Eighties. It has a crown width that ranges from 1" to 2 3/4". It was named by David L. Stidolph, the "father of the fresh broccoli florette" and the Director of Foodservice for Mann Packing at the time. Dave was going to do a promotion for the florette with a company that manufactured Woks as he saw the application for the florette being used in stir frys. The promotion never took place, but its safe to say that Broccoli Wokly has higher name recognition than any broccoli product on the market.

  How long do you steam broccoli so that it is cooked, yet vitamins and minerals are retained?</i></font><br>
                            -Bryan, The Dolantos, Seattle, WA<p>

The best routes toward preserving the nutrients in fresh broccoli- and other vegetables- is to combine the least amount of water with the shortest cooking time.
<p>
<font color="green"><i>
What is the best method for cleaning broccoli?</i></font><br>
-Liz Nedeff, the Acorn Cafe, Austin, TX
<p>
Broccoli can be washed.  However, don't soak fresh broccoli if you hope to benefit from the B and C vitamins broccoli contains.
<p>
<font color="green"><i>
 Is it true that copper cooking pots can destroy certain vitamins in broccoli?</i></font><br>

Yes, 
Believe it or not, cooking pots lined with copper can destroy vitamin C, folic acid and even vitamin E.  Aluminum, stainless steel, enamel and glass are better utensils for cooking fresh broccoli and retaining nutrients.

  Experience the incredible number of uses for MANN's Broccoli Cole Slaw.  Serve it in a breakfast omelet or a take-out burrito.  Substitute it for lettuce in a taco or in a submarine sandwich.  Use it as a topping for baked potatoes, as a stir fry or as a relish for hamburgers, hot dogs or sausages.  As a classic cole slaw, either on-premises or as a take-out, dress it with a poppyseed or Honey-Mustard dressing and chill it for 30 minutes before serving.  Nutritious, innovative and usable in ethnic menu items from stir frys to tostadas to pizzas.
  <p>
A mix of Hearts of Broccoli&#174, carrots and red cabbage from MANN'S Foodservice gives you a menuing edge on your competition.

<applet code="cannon/cannon.class" width=600 height=300>

<h4> Your assignment is to hit the target under a variety of
different conditions.</h4>  You can adjust the following parameters:
<P>
<ul> <li> muzzle angle
<li> muzzle velocity
<li> gravitational field strength
<li> wind speed
<P>
</ul>
These parameters are adjustable in the window labelled Cannon.
If it has not appeared try reloading this page.
<P>
This virtual experiment is designed to let the student measure
the relation between muzzle velocity (which determines projectile
energy), gravitational potential and the effects of frictional
drag caused by wind speed blowing opposite to the direction the
projectile is moving in.  
<P>
Now try and hit the target.  When implemented, you will get a reward
for hitting the target depending on how many times it takes
you to be successful.  Currently you have 4 shots at the target
before automatic exit.

Like a phantom surfboard across a sea of green, broccoli harvesting machines and the crews operating them will pass through broccoli fields three different times (on average). Broccoli plants grow a number of shoots, not at the same rate. Usually growers will wait a week to ten days before going back into a field for an additional cutting.

Compact, hydraulic machines have replaced the traditional bunching machines that used twist ties. Today, rubber bands are wrapped around three to four stalks of broccoli with hydraulics. The invention of this portable machine made the broccoli packing houses obsolete and caused an influx of competition from growers that could not previously pack broccoli due to the lack of a packing facility.

We might also name this dish the Mother of all Comfort Foods because it  is so tasty and filling. It will also take the prize for creativity at the next potluck dinner you attend.  And, depending on whether youre a man or a woman, youll be a hero or heroine when you serve it to your family or friends. Using instant mashed potatoes also makes it a snap to put together. 
</font><p>

<img src="../../images/foodshots/hash.jpeg" align=right>

1 large red-skinned potato (about 6 ounces)<br> 
3 cups <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b><br>
1 1/2 cups prepared, well seasoned creamy mashed potatoes<br>
4 ounces turkey ham, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 cup)<br>
3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
<p>
1.Preheat oven to 350.  Grease a 9-inch square baking pan and set aside.  Scrub the potato clean and cut into a 1/2-inch dice.  In a medium saucepan, cover potato cubes with cold salted water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain in a colander. 
<p>
2.In a large bowl, combine the potato cubes with <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b>, the mashed potatoes and turkey ham, stirring to mix well. Turn mixture into the prepared pan and top with cheese. Cover with foil and bake until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Remove foil and bake until the top is lightly browned, about 5 minutes longer.

4 Servings<br>
Preparation Time:  15  minutes<br>
Cook Time:  10 minutes<br>
<p>
1 1/2 cups	Broccoli Wokly florettes<br>
4 		Burrito size flour tortillas (9-10 inches in diameter)<br>
1-6 oz. can	Tuna, drained and flaked<br>
2/3 cup		Tartar sauce, purchased or homemade<br>
2 1/2 Tbs.	Green onions, chopped<br>
2 Tbs.		Celery, finely chopped<br>
1 1/2 tsp.	Fresh lemon juice
<p>
Preheat oven to 35o degrees.  In a medium saucepan filled with boiling salted water, blanch broccoli by cooking just until it turns bright green.  Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water to set the color; drain again.
<p>
Wrap tortillas in foil and heat in the oven 10 minutes to soften.
<p>
In a medium bowl, mix together the blanched broccoli, tuna, tarter sauce, green onions, celery and lemon juice.  For each broccoli wrap, place about 1/2 cup of tuna salad just below the center of a tortilla.  Fold in one side and then fold up from the bottom, enclosing the filling.  Fold in the other side of the tortilla.  Serve at once, or wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 4 hours.

MANNS CRUNCHY BROCCO-BURGER</b></font>
<p><font color="#6A006A">
This may just be the best veggie burger youve ever tasted!  Weve given it a southwestern flair with a bit of taco seasoning; but feel free to vary the spices according to taste.  Serve patties plain topped with a bit of salsa, or serve on a whole wheat hamburger bun with thinly sliced onion, relish, lettuce, tomato and all the other traditional fixins. 
</font><p>

<img src="../../images/foodshots/brocco_burger.jpeg" align=right>

1 cup <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b><br>
1 cup freshly cooked brown rice<br>
1/3 cup drained canned kidney beans<br>
1/3 cup coarsely chopped mushrooms<br>
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br>
2 eggwhites<br>
2 teaspoons taco seasoning
<p>
1.Preheat oven to 500.  In a blender or food processor, combine the <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b>, cooked brown rice, kidney beans, mushrooms, 	Parmesan cheese, egg whites and taco seasoning.  Process, scraping 	down the sides of the work bowl once or twice with a rubber spatula, until the ingredients are finely chopped and well blended. 
<p>
2.Form mixture into 4 equal patties and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake until patties are firm and brown at the edges, about 10 minutes.  To serve, use a spatula to invert the patty so browned-side faces up.  (Alternatively, patties can be pan-fried in a skillet for 3-4 minutes per side.)

MANNS Brocco-Taco SALAD</b></font>
<p><font color="#6A006A">

This cool and crunch entree salad is a taste treat with the ground beef or turkey or without them. So it offers really versatility if you want something new and exciting for your veggie friends. Or, for more traditional tastes, it beats the heck out of a taco salad with lettuce because broccoli is so much more nutritious. Great to stick in the fridge for weekend lunches or suppers--or weekday dinners if youre in a hurry.
</font><p>
<img align="right" src="../../images/foodshots/TACOSALAD.jpg">
1 (1 pound) bag <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b>
	1 (8 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained<br>
	1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (4 ounces)<br>
	1 large tomato, diced<br>
	1 (2 1/4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained<br>
	1/4 cup finely chopped red onion<br>
	1/2 cup Thousand Island salad dressing<br>
	1/4 cup salsa<br>
	1 pound of ground beef or ground turkey (optional)<br>
	1 (10.5 ounce) bag corn chips, such as Fritos or tortilla chips<br>

Salt and pepper to taste



<p>

1. In a large bowl, combine Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw, kidney beans, Cheddar cheese, tomato, olives and onion, tossing to mix well. Add salad dressing and salsa, tossing again to coat. (Salad can be made up to this point 24 hours in advance, cover, and refrigerate.)
 <p>
2. (If using ground beef/turkey option) In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef, stirring to break up the chunks of meat, until nicely browned on the outside and no trace of pink remains, 8-10 minutes.

MANNS SPICY BUFFALO POTATO SKINS</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica" color="#6A006A">
Weve combined the best features of two popular appetizers to create this irresistible vegetarian snack.  For convenience, the potatoes can be baked up to 24 hours in advance; simply wrap them in a clean tea towel and refrigerate.  These are so good you may want to double the recipe!
</font><p>

<img src="../../images/foodshots/buffalopotatoskins.jpg" align=right>
<font face="Helvetica">
3 large russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds total), baked until tender
3 Tablespoons melted butter<br>
4 teaspoons hot pepper sauce, such as Franks Louisiana Red Hot Sauce, 	or more to taste<br>
1 1/2 cups <b>Manns  Broccoli Wokly Florettes</b>, cut in half lengthwise.<br>
6 Tablespoons blue cheese salad dressing, purchased or homemade
<p>
1.Preheat oven to 375.  When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut each in half  lengthwise. Scoop out center flesh from the potato halves, leaving a shell about 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the potato skins cut-side up on a baking sheet. 
<p>
2.In a medium bowl, mix melted butter with hot sauce until well blended.  Stir in the broccoli, tossing to coat with the butter mixture. 
<p>
3.Divide broccoli mixture evenly among potato skins, mounding if necessary.  Use the remaining butter in the bowl to drizzle over the filled potato skins.
<p>
4.Bake uncovered until the potato skins are nicely browned and the broccoli is crisp-tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  Just before serving, drizzle 1 Tablespoon of blue cheese dressing over each potato.  Serve warm. 
<p>
Serves 3 to 6

MANNS California Broccoli Home Fries</b></font>
<p><font color="#6A006A">
Potatoes in the morning always make breakfast seem special.  Wake up your taste buds by serving this colorful melange with sausages or bacon and eggs; or serve it alone, with buttered whole wheat toast or warm flour tortillas for impromptu breakfast burritos.  For convenience, potatoes can be cooked the night before, wrapped in a tea towel and refrigerated. 
</font><p>





<img src="../../images/foodshots/ca.broccolihomefries.jpg" align=right>

	2 medium red-skinned potatoes (about 8 ounces total)<br>
	1 (1 pound) bag <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b><br>
	1 large onion, chopped <br>
	1 large red or green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch squares<br>
	Salt and freshly ground pepper<br>
	Vegetable oil for cooking
<p>
1. Scrub the potatoes clean and cut into a 1/2-inch dice.  In a medium saucepan, cover potato cubes with cold salted water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain in a colander. 
 <p>
2. In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, broccoli cole slaw, onion and bell pepper.  On an oiled griddle or in a large skillet, working in batches if necessary, spread a single layer of the potato and broccoli mixture on the hot griddle, pressing down gently with the back of a spatula.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes total.  Serve warm.

MANNS ASIAN BROCCO BURRITO</b></font>
<p>
<font color="#6A006A">This cross-cultural favorite is a hit with both adults and kids. Gourmet sophisticates call it "fusion cuisine." Serve 1 burrito for a snack, or 2 as a main course--along with plenty of napkins!
</font><p>

<img src="../../images/foodshots/asian_burrito.jpeg" align=right>

4 teaspoons vegetable oil <br>
1 (1 pound) bag <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b><br>
1/2 cup chopped onion<br>
4 garlic cloves, crushed through a press<br>
1 lb. ground turkey<br>
8 burrito-size flour tortillas (9- to 10-inches in diameter)<br>
1/3 cup bottled Szechwan Spicy Stir-Fry Sauce<br>
1/2 teaspoon Chinese 5-Spice powder<br>
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese<br>
Bottled Chinese Plum Sauce
<p>
1.  Preheat oven to 350.  In a wok or large skillet, heat 1 Tablespoon of the oil until hot but not smoking.  Add <b>Manns Broccoli Cole Slaw</b> and cook, stirring and tossing, until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Using tongs or a large slotted spoon, transfer broccoli cole slaw to a large bowl. 
<p>
2.  In the same wok or skillet, add the remaining teaspoon of oil if needed. Cook onion and garlic over medium heat until onion is softened but 	not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, add 	ground turkey and cook, stirring to break up the chunks of meat, until the turkey is lightly browned on the outside and no trace of pink remains, 8 to 10 minutes. 
<p>
3.  Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in foil and heat in the oven for 10 minutes to soften. 
<p>
4.  Stir the turkey mixture into the cooked broccoli cole slaw, adding the 	Szechwan Spicy Stir-Fry Sauce and Chinese 5-Spice powder to coat. Mix in the cheese. 
<p>
5.  For each burrito, place about 3/4 cup of filling just below the center of a tortilla.  Fold in one side and then fold up from the bottom, enclosing the filling.  Fold in the other side of tortilla and serve warm, with Chinese Plum Sauce for dipping. 
<p>
Makes 8 burritos

Serve this mahogany-glazed vegetable medley alongside anything from chicken to meatloaf, and the vegetables will probably be the first thing to go!  It also makes a great vegetarian entree served over hot steamed rise.

3 Tablespoons bottled teriyaki glaze<br>
	4 teaspoons vegetable oil <br>
	1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger or 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger <br>

MANNS Quick-N-Easy Chicken Vegetable Pot Pie</b></font>
<p><font color="#6A006A">






A savory pie, hot from the oven, is one of lifes better comfort foods.  There is no need to tell anyone that you know a few shortcuts to arrive at such an aromatic delight!  In fact, if you dont have leftover chicken on hand, pick up a rotisserie-cooked chicken at the supermarket. 
</font><p>



2 1/2 cups <b>Manns Vegetable Medley</b><br>
	2 cups (8 ounces) cooked chicken, coarsely chopped, skin and bones 	removed<br>
	1 1/2 cups chicken gravy, purchased or homemade<br>
	1/4 cup finely chopped onion<br>
	1/4 cup canned mushrooms, drained<br>
	2 Tablespoons heavy (whipping) cream or half-and-half<br>
	1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme or 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme leaves<br>
	1 refrigerated all-ready 9-inch pie crust<br>
	Optional glaze:  1 egg yolk mixed with 1 Tablespoon cream

<p>
1. Preheat oven to 400.  In a deep-dish greased 9-inch pie plate, combine the vegetable medley, chicken, gravy, onion, mushrooms, cream and thyme, stirring to mix well.  Drape pie dough over the top, forming a decorative edge.  Cut several slits on top to vent. Brush with glaze, if desired. 
 <p>
2. Bake until filling is bubbly-hot and the crust is golden, 30 to 35 minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes before serving.

<p>
1. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and saut over moderate heat until translucent. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the skillet. Add the broccoli hearts and continue to saut until broccoli is tender
 <p>
2. Add the spinach and saut until it becomes slightly wilted. Add the prepared herbs, season with salt and pepper. Stir together and remove from heat.
 <p>
3. Combine the eggs and milk in a bowl and whisk until bubbly.
 <p>
4. Heat 1 tablespoon of margarine in a 9" non-stick skillet. When the skillet is hot, pour in half of the egg mixture. Tip the skillet so that the eggs coat the pan evenly. Keep tipping, lifting the omelets edge so that the loose eggs run underneath,. When the eggs are fairly set on top but still moist, quickly arrange half of the broccoli and spinach mixture and the Brie on one side of the omelet.
 <p>
5. Fold the omelet in half and slide it onto a plate. Repeat process for the second omelet.

<b>PROCEDURE:</b><br>
1. Melt the butter or margarine over medium heat in suitable size skillet.  Do not allow the butter or margarine to brown.<p>
2. Add the minced garlic and chicken strips, stirring to blend evenly with the butter or margarine. Cook the mixture just until the chicken surfaces are white, stirring occasionally to insure uniform heating.<p>
3. Add the Broccoli Wokly, mushrooms and red pepper, blending all ingredients together.  Continue cooking until the broccoli is cooked but still crisp.
<p>4. Add the Alfredo and Pesto sauces, stirring to blend all ingredients.
<p>5. Heat the sauces to a simmer, stirring frequently to prevent scorching or sticking.  Be careful not to overheat sauce, which could separate the oil from the Pesto sauce.
<p>6. When the skilled contents are hot, add the cooked, drained fettucini noodles and blend with the other ingredients.  Continue heating until the pasta is hot.
<p>7. Remove from heat, serve with grated Parmesan cheese.
<p></font><i>Notes:  Large batch preparation may require draining excess liquid from the chicken and vegetables before adding the sauces.  To expedite  cooking, the broccoli can be blanched, "shocked" and drained in advance.  The Pesto sauce can be prepared in advance and held hot until needed.</i>

Thalamic degenerations or dementias are poorly understood conditions.
The familial forms are (1) selective thalamic degenerations and (2)
thalamic degenerations associated with multiple system atrophy.
Selective thalamic degenerations share clinical and pathologic features
with fatal familial insomnia, an autosomal dominant disease linked to a
mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein (PrP) gene that causes the
substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid (178Asn mutation). We
amplified the carboxyl terminal coding region of the PrP gene from
subjects with selective thalamic dementia or thalamic dementia
associated with multiple system atrophy. Three of the four kindreds with
selective thalamic dementia and none of the three kindreds with
thalamic dementia associated with multiple system atrophy had the PrP
178Asn mutation. Thus, analysis of the PrP gene may be useful in
diagnosing the subtypes of thalamic dementia. Moreover, since selective
thalamic dementia with the PrP 178Asn mutation and fatal familial
insomnia share clinical and histopathologic features, we propose that
they are the same disease.

Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS) was diagnosed in a family with
presenile dementia by prion protein gene analysis. Extensive
histological examination of the brain of an affected individual from
this family showed no characteristic features of GSS or
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Thus &quot;spongiform encephalopathy&quot; (GSS
or CJD) cannot always be excluded on neuropathological grounds in an
individual dying of a dementing condition, and the true prevalence of
these diseases is likely to be underestimated. Screening by prion
protein gene analysis will help to determine the full clinical and
neuropathological phenotype in familial cases. This observation may be
relevant to the assessment of possible transmission of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy to man.<HR>

<h2>British Study Says Brain Patients Had Psychiatric Symptoms</h2>
<h5>By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN  ...  April 5, 1996</h5>
<p>Many of the 10 British patients afflicted with a new variant of
a fatal brain disease possibly linked to mad-cow disease had
behavioral and emotional changes that initially fooled doctors into
thinking they had psychiatric disorders, according to the first
published scientific report about the cases.
<p>   In nine of the patients, early symptoms included personality
changes, depression, difficulty sleeping, withdrawal, fearfulness,
and paranoia, said the report, being published on Saturday in The
Lancet, an international journal issued in London. Several patients
were referred by their doctors to a psychiatrist.
<p>   The doctors were also fooled because brain wave tracings of the
patients did not show the changes that are usually observed in
traditional cases of the human brain disease, known as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
<p>   The findings were reported to alert doctors to the unusual new
face of a rare disease. Creuzfeldt-Jakob Disease itself is so rare
that physicians find it hard to diagnose.
<p>   The report was also intended to alert doctors to the distinctive
pattern of waxy deposits known as amyloid plaques that were found
in the brain along with the usual holes that give the brain an
appearance of Swiss cheese.
<p>   Seven of the 10 British cases were not classified as probable
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease when first reported to the special
surveillance unit that the British government set up in 1990 to
look for any human version of mad-cow disease. If such a unit had
not been in place, it would have taken much longer for individual
doctors to compare notes to detect the new variant.
<p>   In 1989, a British committee concluded that inclusion of animal
protein from sheep afflicted with scrapie in commercial cattle feed
was the source of the mad-cow disease. A ban on such feed was
imposed at that time. If humans can acquire a variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from beef contaminated by mad-cow
disease, the exposure is believed to have been greatest in the
1980s.
<p>   In the latest research, several factors led to the recognition
that the patients suffered from a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease, the researchers, headed by Dr. Rob G. Will of Western
General Hospital, in Edinburgh, reported.
<p>   One was that patients also developed motor abnormalities such as
difficulty maintaining balance. A second was pain when a patient
was touched on the face, arms, and legs. One patient had pain in
the feet that persisted throughout the illness. Another factor was
the rapid course to death, averaging about one year from onset of
symptoms.
<p>   Still another factor was the chemical stains on brain tissue
obtained at autopsies for examination under a microscope. The
stains showed a distinctive pattern, being scattered throughout the
brain but most evident in the areas known as the basal ganglia,
thalamus, and cerebellum.
<p>   The plaques resembled those found in scrapie, the sheep disease,
and kuru, a human disease. Kuru is believed to result from
ritualistic cannibalism among the Fore group in the highlands of
Papua-New Guinea. The diseases are now thought to be due to rogue
proteins known as prions.
<p>   A striking feature of the six females and four males diagnosed
with the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease was their young
age, which ranged from 16 to 39 years at the time they fell ill
from February 1994 to October 1995. Health records showed that from
1970 to 1989, only four cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease occurred
in people younger than 34 years.
<p>   Examination of brain tissue collected at the autopsy of one of
the earlier cases did not show similar amyloid changes.
<p>   The researchers also searched for cases outside Britain and
found no similar pattern in countries that had a similar
surveillance system.
<p>   The overall incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease rose in
Britain in the 1990s, but most cases were in people older than 75.
The most likely explanation, the researchers said, was that
publicity had led doctors to be more alert to diagnosing it.
<p>   The researchers said they found the cluster of variant cases
over the last 10 months by studying possible cases reported by
physicians and looking at death certificates and newspaper
articles.
<p>   The researchers said that all 10 had eaten beef in the last 10
years but none was reported to have eaten brain. One had been a
strict vegetarian since 1991. One patient worked as a butcher from
1985 to 1987; another had visited an abattoir for 2 days in 1987.
None had ever worked on farms with livestock, although one patient
had spent a one-week holiday on a dairy farm where there was no
known mad-cow disease.
<p>   In an editorial, Dr. J. Gerald Collee, of the University of
Edinburgh, said that experts suspect that a teaspoonful of highly
infective cattle feed is enough to cause mad-cow disease. But he
said that if the disease can be transmitted to humans, the amount
needed for infection cannot be estimated.
<p>   The infectious agent causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob and similar
diseases is believed to be resistant to chemicals in the digestive
track and able to enter the body through lymph tissue in the tract.
Factors such as coexistent infection or foods and alcohol could
facilitate such entry.

<p> The <B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob Support Group</B> offers support to victims' families and is the only organisation campaigning for urgent research into the disease.<P>

ALL of us feel sympathy for those whose livelihoods have been seriously damaged by the BSE crisis. However, financial aid for the meat industry will run to billions of pounds yet only 4.5 million has been pledged for research into CJD, despite the possibility that unknown numbers of people may be afflicted by this appalling condition.
<p> Please support us by sending donations made out to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Network and by lobbying your MP and Euro MP to press for funding for research.

<B>Getting Help</B><P>
With the rise of BSE and the increase in CJD incidence, it was thought that more money would be derived from charity. So far this has not taken place. UK government has made it plain that an increase in funding would give the impression that there was a risk to humans.<P>

<center>See also  <a HREF="/~tom/gossip2.html">older rumors and gossip back to 1983 </a>--   quite instructive!</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Because it is gossip it must not be considered to be the

absolute truth until it is checked in some way.  This must not

be taken as an insult to anyone as none is intended.   There are

no evil people involved in the subject whatever and everyone has

taken large amounts of time and effort in carrying out what they

feel is the best.  However, what seems the best for the farmer may not seem the

best for the consumer and what is best for the politician to

keep the populus calm may not be the whole of the information

that the populus feels should have been given. (a lot of farmers

are, however, very honest and I would not pretend that it

applied  to all)."  -- SD</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>September 1996</B>

<DT><B>MRC failure in grants for BSE research.</B><DD>  It now

appears that from national advertising they only got 99

application for funding for research into BSE.  Of those, 9 were

from me!  Only 52 got short listed and it is expected that it

will be a further 6-8 months before anyone actually gets told

they will be funded.  Also, a number of major directions for

research were not even applied for.   Dont they realise that

most of the people that might have been involved in BSE research

kept out of it because of the politics of the last 8 years? Dont

they realise that they will have to do more than just ask for

applications?  Dont they realise that many of the people that

might have been involved were kept out because they might let

the data out to the public?  Dont they realise that things will

not be like fasionable research?  This is disastrous.







<DT><B>Neuropathogenesis Unit is having its core research fund

cut.</B><DD>  For some reason the core funding, which pays for

the basic scientist salaries is being cut so that administration

and many other aspects is being decreased to dangerous levels. 

Researchers are finding themselves spending most of their time

wasted on applications to groups that will not know whether they

are adequate or not.   The MRC Unit kept quite right the way

through the BSE epidemic about the risk that was being taken

with human lives.  They have kept quiet about the BSE epidemic

being likely to go on for much longer than recently predicted. 

What may well happen is that more information reaches the press

that MAFF do not like.







<DT><B>The Oxford group with Anderson may have opened a can of

worms.</B><DD>  One of the pieces of research that they made

open was the data showing that cattle fed larger amounts of

infection died after a shorter incubation period (mind you they

were being fed a very large amount).  One of the most important

factors, however is that the animals fed the same amount 3 times

died quicker than the cattle fed the same amount once.  MAFF

(and SEAC) has spent some time denying cumulative infection

despite it being the accepted viewpoint.







<DT><B>Groups are not happy about the safety of surgical

instruments.</B><DD>  It now seems that if humans are infected

with BSE, and it is a younger group that has done so, then maybe

the surgical instruments used for their appendicitis may

actually be infected and the ordinary autoclaving will  not get

rid of the infection.  







<DT><B>Various groups around the world have become interested in

the safety of UK blood for transfusion.</B><DD>  No further data

yet.







<DT><B>It looks as if the UK Government has backed down on

halving the payment to abattoirs to take cattle for compensation

payments.</B><DD>  Originally it looked as if it was going to be

a payment of 80 per animal but in Northern Irland this was cut

to 40 when MAFF thought they were making a profit on it all. 

The abattoirs simply refused to take the cattle.  It looks as if

that was going to happen all over the UK but MAFF seems to have

backed down. 







<DT><B>Legras (top civil servant in Agricultural Commission in

Brussels)  had received information about the risks involved in

BSE well before March 1996. </B><DD> It now seems that he had

been told that there was a risk to humans that should have been

considered under public health long before the information was

indeed considered.  It seems that I was not the only one that

sent him data suggesting that public health was at stake and

should at least be considered.  







<DT><B>Test for CJD in humans is on its way. </B><DD> Initial

publication of the results from California (which dont apply to

the new CJD2) are being published at the moment.  







<DT><B>French public health groups realise that BSE may not be

easy to deal with. </B><DD>  The reason being that the processes

used in the rendering industry are so basic that potentially

infected bovine offals may be simply left in the open and water,

soil, etc may well be allowed to become contaminated.  There

seems to be little information available with which to be sure

of safety.  A french group contacted me recently saying that

things are very difficult to handle.











<DT><B>Further action is taking place through the European

Parliament in Strasbourg concerned with BSE.</B><DD>  Not clear

exactly what is taking place but it seems that various

researchers are being called to give information to an

Enviromental committee and this would direct action to be taken

concerned with the subject. 







<DT><B>Various researchers unhappy with the predictions of

Nature article.</B><DD>  It is not exactly clear why but it now

seems that European researchers are looking at the paper from

Anderson's group in Oxford with cynical eyes.  It may not be

accepted by the statistics groups abroad.











<DT><B>Stan Prusiner states that 13 patients have died with the

new strain of CJD in UK at the ICAAC conferece in New

Orleans.</B><DD>  He may have meant that the figure included the

one in France but that is not certain.  Maybe he just has inside

news.  This was when he was receiving a prize and giving a

lecture for his work on prions. 







<DT><B>Goat offspring go down with BSE.</B><DD>  It seems that

all the kids of the goats that were given BSE have also

developed the disease.  I hear that this has been in 10 animals.

No further data but it suggests that MAFF should not have been

surprised at VT in cattle.







<DT><B>Insider groups are not at all surprised at the response

from the EU about the UK stopping the beef cull of 147,000.

</B><DD> Many people felt that there was never likely to be any

dropping of the ban on UK beef at all until the UK could

actually be shown to be BSE free.  One of the problems was that

there was always new bad news appearing  about BSE and if the EU

was taking UK beef at that time then again their own farmers

would suffer as beef sales fell again. i.e. the Europeans do not

want the same beef crashes as seen in the UK.







<DT><B>The UK Government are now determined that BSE will

disappear by 2001.</B><DD>  Anderson's Oxford group suggested

that  in their Nature article.  However, your statistics cannot

be any better than your data, which was derived from MAFF and

had various flaws, which the Oxford group will admit.  It seems

that the powers in office, however are grabbing it as the last

chance of a feel good factor with BSE.  







<DT><B>There may well be more to the potential tests for BSE.

</B><DD> A patent has been put in suggesting at specific method

for testing cattle and it is expected to cost around 15.







<DT><B>The Medical Research Council</B><DD> has now received

large numbers of applications for funding and was expecting them

to 'go to the next level' of decisions in which some are simply

thrown away as being valueless and the others go to even more

important people for determination as to who gets the cash.  The

problems have always been in that the subjects involved are

often only looked into by a small number of people and so they

must be both the jury and the recipients of money.  In BSE/CJD

this will be even more difficult as there are 'friends and foes'

of Government.  The gossip says that some people have been told

that they 'will almost certainly' get their money already.  What

happened was that MAFF's lab at Weybridge, the BBSRC lab in

Edinburgh, the CJD unit, and few other places did any work and

so they are likely to be the recipients.  However the reason

that they were used was that they could be kept quiet and so the

problem continues; still academic yes-men dividing the cake and

the population only hearing about what happens long afterwards.







<DT><B>It is still unclear as to how much money is being put

into BSE research. </B><DD> With MAFF vertually pulling out it

all seems that the disease is being put into the hands of the

academics, who have not really much experience of it.  4.6

million? Unlimited research money? Nobody has put a figure on

the table that appears valid. 







<DT><B>The Swiss have been advised by their own SEAC to cull

230,000 cattle.</B><DD>  But that will need to get past their

own Government.







<DT><B>At the moment Jeff Almond and Roy Anderson (both

academics in BSE) are on a trip to Australia to give talks about

BSE.  </B><DD>











<DT><B>It is now claimed that there are more cases of BSE in

France than they wish to admit.</B><DD>  A group of vets are

keeping information about the cases and say that there are more.

Mark Purdey is going over to France to see them.







<DT><B>The backlog for the slaughter of cattle over 30 months is

40 weeks.</B><DD>  This means that the farmers are going to have

to feed the cattle over the winter and it will cost money.







<DT><B>Farmers now admit that the advantages for reporting cases

of BSE are now not there.</B><DD>  The compensation for the

slaughter of a cow over 30 months is about the same as it would

be for a BSE case as those would be the price that it would be

when old.  Farmers are afraid that if they report cases then

their farms may not be able to sell cattle if the rules are

changed.  BUT if a cow develops symptoms just now, with the

backlog so long then the farmer may just have to admit to having

a case. 







<DT><B>It seems that the Swiss Government are accepting their

SEAC advice and are going to slaughter 230,000 cattle.</B><DD> 







<DT><B>The organophosphate story is coming to life

again.</B><DD>  It now seems that the Neurological researchers

in London are carrying out the research to see if thalamide

(that is associated with thalidomide) is involved in the

production of prions in vitro.







<DT><B>The NIH groups are now suggesting that meat and bone meal

is not used for bovine feed in the USA.</B><DD>  This now seems

very likely to go ahead. 







<DT><B>It now seems that the Chief Veterinary Officer, David

Meldrum, is being replaced?</B><DD>  An advertisement has

appeared for his post.







<DT><B>There has been a report of farmers claiming to have seen

similar clinical conditions as BSE starting in the late 1970s in

the UK.</B><DD>  This would make a lot of sense with the changes

of the manufacturing processes that took place early in the

1970s.







<DT><B>The Norwegians seem to have been some kind of 'outbreak'

of scrapie. </B><DD> This must all seem very odd for what is

partly genetic and does not seem to be passed from one sheep to

another in the same pen.  They immediately had a wide slaughter

of all the sheep around places where cases occurred with full

compensation.  Some cases came back and more appeared elsewhere.

The question must have arisen as to whether the UK had exported

BSE infected meal to them.







<DT><B>Professor Owen at Bangor University</B><DD> made it clear

that he was not happy with the results of the Oxford group as

being a certain future but he had to follow a long trail to get

any data out of MAFF with which to show this by calculation. 







<DT><B>Dioxins in the brain?</B><DD> Various farms in Cheshire

and Derbyshire seems to have been closed down because of the

presence of dioxins in the milk.  One group feels that the

dioxins may actually be related to BSE simply through bringing

the toxicity forward, although the actual reason has not been

fully explained.  ICI are apparently going to be looking into

this although this is yet to be confirmed.







<DT><B>Lancet editorial of 28th Sept.</B><DD>  This was

thoroughly damning of the Government's inadequate research into

BSE and its potential risks.  It seems that the editor did not

want the newspapers to know about it in advance and it simply

wasn't released to them.  It seems that there is now a growing

body of opinion in the scientific community that the handling of

BSE has been bad.







<DT><B>Meeting about BSE in Aberystwyth</B><DD> Farmers and

academics got together to discuss what they were actually going

to do in Wales about the various plans that had been put out by

MAFF.  Many farmers were simply saying that they weren't having

their cattle slaughtered and that they would find a way to get

them into market.  Also it seems that some farmers were still

just saying that the Meat and Livestock Commission must simply

sell beef harder and all will be well.

<B>August 1996</B><P>



<DL>


<P><DT>Farmers thought to be fiddling the ear tags on

cattle.<DD>  The fact that cattle slaughtered over 30 months

are worth a lot less may mean that some of the tags from older

cattle have been swapped with others, making them more valuable.

 Inspectors are determined that this is going on but dont have

proof.







<P><DT>Blood transfusion: a risk? <DD> Apparently Leeds

Radio found out about the article coming out in Transfusion

Medicine by ringing up Dr. Dealler and asking him about

something else and he presumed that it was a question about the

article!  It was put out the following morning as a major scoop. 







<P><DT>Diagnosis for the disease...it seems that MAFF are

basically runnign out of ideas<DD> on how to diagnose the

disease before symptoms appear.  This would be vertually the

only way of getting rid of BSE long before it would die out

(hopefully) anyway.  It looks as if  MAFF will put things out to

independent groups.  This is after 6 years of effectively

failure but hard work. 







<P><DT>Narang denies that he has heard from MAFF or DofH

offering to carry out his urine test<DD>.  It seems that

they have not done this and it is not clear what has gone on in

that SEAC seem to think that there cannot be a problem with

this. 







<P><DT>Methods of diagnosis on the way???<DD> Various other

groups now are looking into the problem and may well get funded.

 The group in Aberystwyth and at CVL seem to think there are

some specific methods.  MRC have received quite a lot of

applications for money to do this but of course some of the

people asking for the cash hardly have a lab in which to work as

they have not been 'in' people for some time. 







<P><DT>Blood transfusion problems with BSE.<DD>  This has

been on the desk for some time with SEAC and they have been in

contact with the National Blood Authority about reasonable

positions to take.  It is not clear, however, that the DofH are

catching up with the problem and their statements on the subject

are derived from before March 1996 i.e. they state that there is

felt to be no risk to humans from BSE.  A member of SEAC

actually had a copy of Dealler's article stating that a risk was

being taken in 1994. 







<P><DT>Mike Richardson seems to be moved out of BSE at CVL or

early retirement. <DD> Major researcher in BSE epidemiology.

 Why?







<P><DT>Maff now putting up signs to stop animals being fed at

the zoo.<DD>  If you go to Camelot the fairground in the

North for kids, you find signs telling you not to feed any of

theanimals with things that contain meat (because of BSE)...and

it is from MAFF!!!







<P><DT>DofH releases figures of CJD.<DD>   up to 1994, and

none of them include latest figures concerning the variant form.







<P><DT>European groups are now telling me that they expect the

ban on UK beef to be indefinite.<DD>  This seems a bit hard

but it shows more the anger that they feel towards MAFF and the

EC for not telling them what was going on earlier. 







<P><DT>The meeting in Sicily.<DD>  For some reason various

people were not even told about the meeting.  It seems that

Collinge is closely involved in the meeting and exactly why only

limited groups were informed is unclear.







<P><DT>On the 19th of July SEAC were told by Wilesmith and

Anderson that BSE was vertically transmitted.<DD>  What does

not seem to have gone through is that SEAC spent 2 hrs before

them arriving being told that VT fitted very well the pattern of

disease that was seen and it was necessary that various simple

pieces of research take place in order to look for it i.e. the

cohort study results were not actually necessary...and then

Wilesmith came in.







<P><DT>It looks as if people at CVL are being sacked who have

been working on BSE.<DD>  Exactly the reason seems unclear

but probably, as usual this is due to money.  The severe

argument that has gone on politically concerning MAFF doing the

research itself and then producing the results that it would

like to see is probably the result as much of the work is being

put out to academics outside.  It is however a pity as there

have been some quite excellent researchers there suddenly seeing

the end of their job. 







<P><DT>Still there is no idea as to the size of the funding that

is going to go into the disease research.<DD>  Various

researchers are looking worried that there is not enough to get

the research done that is necessary.







<P><DT>Milk infected. <DD> The newspapers are absolutely

determined to make a story out of it but it seems that even

Lacey drinks UK milk.







<P><DT>Vertical transmissio may be worse than we are

told.<DD>  What did not come out from the SEAC document is

that although 19 cattle from the 273 that had come from

asymptomatic mothers developed disease, this may not have been

because their mothers were not infected (and hence the disease

much have appeared from feed or environment).   In fact all 43

from the cohort group may well have been from infected mothers

and not exposed to external infection, in which case the VT rate

would be 15.7%....unfortunately this happens to be the rate

expected to be seen if all the cases of BSE were infected from

their mother.  More research is needed but it is clear that the

10% figure given is the lowest figure possible.







<P><DT>Vertical transmission is seen as disastrous.<DD> 

Behind the scenes the MAFF are absolutely struck by the thought

that they may not be able to export any cattle for a very long

time.  Certainly this 'all well in November' idea is completely

finished.  Even though officially they are putting over the idea

that all the cattle will be free of disease by 2005 this is

worked out by really bending over backwards with the statistics

and crossing fingers.  







<P><DT>Various European groups now seem to be unwilling to

import UK beef.<DD>  I have been contacted by the group form

Austria and Germany and this is not surprising considering what

is happening here. 







<P><DT>Sheep in France.<DD>  The banning of the brain and

spinal cord of sheep from human food in France has sent a chill

up my spine.  When the mathematics is carried out it seems that

by the time it was found that there was an epidemic of BSE in

the UK, it was already too late to carry out a major slaughter

policy to remove the disease (vertually the whole of the

national herd would have had to be slaughtered).  Dormont seems

determined to go ahead with his ban but the cost versus the

amount gained would be show it to be simply valueless....unless

there was imply more BSE in France than appears in the

statistics.


<P><DT>It may be that we have a treatment for BSE.<DD>  The

treatment for Alzheimer's disease, galanthamine that has just

put the Shires shares up to 27 million.  It seems that they have

been approached to look for TSE treatments with it.  So far no

luck apparently.  Unless the Government actually says that there

is a risk to humans from BSE and that this is likely to make a

drug company some money then the businesses do not seem to want

to put their drugs to the test.



<P><DT>The tartrazine dyes are thought to be unhelpful.<DD> 

Meat and non-SBM from cattle over 30 months are being sprayed

with a tartrazine dye (yellow) to make sure that it does not get

into the human food chain.  It seems that there has been little

effect from the dye as it is simply making the meat look like

older meat.  







<P><DT>A way of purifying run off water from abattoirs? <DD>

It may be that a monoclonal against PrP may be useful for the

purifying of water by attatching the immunoglobulin to an

exchange collumn and passing the water through.  The company

involved is keeping its head down at the moment and is getting

ready to pounce.  (unfortunately there is currently no adequate

way to test the purity of water and hence the usefulness of such

a collumn - Ed)







<P><DT>The group in Kent are getting ready for a battle about

the rendering plant.<DD>  This was the plant that simply

spread the effluent from the plant over the fields and allowed

it to soak in rather than putting it in the mains drainage.  The

groups seems to have EMPs involved and they are having a meeting

in Canturbury on 19th of September.  







<P><DT>Abattoirs are still only carrying out the regulations

under duress.<DD>  It seems from a number of sources as if

they still do not realise that there is a potential risk to the

population and the farming industry from their actions.  One

plant did things OK but could not see what good it did and

another carried out the directions but poorly and the person

that was watching from the Environmental Agency got the

impression that if someone was not actually watching it may  not

have been done. 

<P><DT>New information going to SEAC concerning environmental

factors of BSE.<DD>  It now seems that SEAC are receiving

information concerning the environmental factors that might have

either caused the disease or permitted it to pass from cow to

cow.  Pattison is clearly not just taking MAFF's views as the

ultimate science. <HR>
</dl>

<B>July 1996</B><P>
<DL>
<P><DT>There is now the CJD help line on 01380 720033.<DD> 

It is being organised by Dot Churchill and will hopefully be

getting funding from the Government along with books to send out

to people who are worried.  This is a very good idea.<P>


<P><DT>The Royal Statistical Society is irritated that quite

inadequate amounts of statistics have taken place concerning

BSE.<DD>  Apparently numerous attempts have been taken to

try to get the MAFF to look at its own data with a statistical

eye; but without success, at least publicly anyway.







<P><DT>The French are getting psyched. <DD>  It looks as if they are

eating low amounts of beef and that they are not picking

up. The French farmers are not liking this and almost

marching on Paris.  Quite a shock and I am told that they will

need someone else to blame...I wonder who!







<P><DT>Cattle being given BSE syndromes for compensaton.<DD>

It is now said that some farmers actually put bags over the head

of a cow to prevent breathing in order to cause the animal to

lose its brain capacity and appear to have BSE.  This was

reported to me from Northern Ireland







<P><DT>The vertical transmission rate as a proportion of the

number of BSE cases may well be rising rapidlly.<DD> 

Professor Anderson from Oxford said that it may be reaching 8%

and that this was being investigated further.  More information

concerned with VT is being investigated.







<P><DT>The urine test for BSE may be one the way. <DD> It

will not be the one from Narang, however as a group from France,

who say they have found a test using urine electrophoresis for

dementing illnesses.  Of course cattle do not get alzheimer's

disease so it will be only BSE in them...if it works.  







<P><DT>Statisticians are moving in.<DD>  After the meeting

in York it seems that other researchers involved in statistics

may seem to have new ideas on the methods of transmission. 

Watch this space.







<P><DT>The Meat Hygeine Service are being told of problems...and

are slow to respond.<DD>  The MHS are getting on with the

job (after all they have had a lot of money to do it with) but

it seems that they may not be aware that various things are

still going on.  For instance the use of various parts of the

spine for the production of mechanically recovered meat.  There

are sill problems with the MHS and what it can do if things are

not done that they say.  Can they act without the law.  This is

currently under review but rather a lot of gentlemanly demands

are being made.







<P><DT>Public Health should be top of the BSE priority. <DD>

Well of course. And it now seems to have got through that it was

not even asked for its opinion for a long time.  At the York

meeting Professor Pattison was asked about this and simply siad

that things had changed.  After this meeting there almost seemed

to be a breath of fresh air in the subject.  Pattison seems to

have managed to get the warring groups together.  Good luck to

him.







<P><DT>The glycoside problem is coming back.<DD>  Prusiner

seems to have ruled out the idea that the type of glycoside that

is present on the prion protein is of no significance.  It now

seems that the group in Montana are showing the opposite...and

if that is true then we will find that the glycosidase inhibitor

drugs may well be important as a treatment (at least as a

start). 







<P><DT>Books sold out. <DD> Dealler's book on 'Lethal

Legacy' has vertually sold out and certainly did at the York

meeting.







<P><DT>The expert of BSE at the Mail on Sunday is looking for

some more data<DD>...perhaps more articles are on the way. 

After his devastating ones in 1995 and earlier this year we may

have some more.







<P><DT>New sites for the storage of meat and bone meal before

incineration<DD>.  Alaxander dock site at Merseyside, Curry

Morrison in Belfast docks, Humberside docks, RAF Quedgeley, and

Greendale Barton (at Woodbury, Salterton) appear to be the first

few that have been released..  The inspectors are being told

that it is not 'waste' until it has been rendered from the

infected cattle and they are wondering why not.  Surely it is

potentially a risk before rendering more than after rendering. 

A further report is gong to be coming from the Advisory

Committee on Dangerous Pathogens 'soon' and this may stop this

anomaly as in the previous ACDP report on TSEs at work the

advice applied to everyone (apparently) except abattoirs, which

were supposed to have their own regulations (although I could

find none of significance). 







<P><DT>It seems that blood is still being used as non-infective

material from cattle slaughtered.<DD> Its use in fertiliser

has not changed.  MAFF say that there is no infection in it,

although it is not clear how they know this as no adequate

experiments have been carried out. 







<P><DT>The level of infectivity in meat and bone meal after

incineration is to be measured by looking for nitrogen in it.

<DD> However the method recommended is around 10 to 100

times too insensitive to pick up the levels of nitrogen that

they need to look for (according to MAFF and SEAC).







<P><DT>Of course the dyes that are sprayed on SBO do of course

get broken down by rendering.<DD>  And, of course it is then

impossible to look at the rendered product and say which is from

SBO and which is not.  Apparently MAFF are looking into it with

mass spectrometry (or at least that is how they should be doing

it) but to the man that is checking things that will not be so

easy. 







<P><DT>Health and Safety are quoted as saying that waste

products handled as currently are adequately safe.<DD>  They

do not seem to realise the ACDP report may not agree with this

and a definitive statement from HSE is still awaited by the

waste groups.







<P><DT>It seems that the Environmental Agency 01743 253593 are

now managing to point out various factors that MAFF did not

think of.<DD> e.g. SBM particles passing into drainage

systems.  Also, they have managed to find out that wastes passed

from abattoir to renderer are wates but not 'controlled' wastes

(and hence they are not a risk?).  It is n ot at all clear how

this seems to  have been decided and the EA seems to have its

finger on button. 







<P><DT>Apparently SEAC has advised the Government that BSE does

not pose a risk to the environment.<DD>  It is not

completely clear how they have decided this and the data is yet

to be shown.<P>

<h3><A NAME="Disease">Disease</A> is due to pressure on farming industry</h3>
BMJ No. 7050 Volume 313 LETTERS ... Saturday 20 July 1996
EDITOR, - I agree with A J McMichael's statement that bovine spongiform encephalopathy may in some way be due to the build up of pressure on the farming industry.(1) As a researcher into the disease I have had to investigate the reasons why it has occurred in Britain and apparently not elsewhere. It became clear to me that the economics of the highly efficient system in Britain were involved.
<p>
Farmers in Britain are commonly tenants, and so their rent can increase when profits increase (for example, due to the common agricultural policy)

As a result, no matter what the potential profitability of a method being used is, there is continuous high pressure on the system to become more efficient. This led to the use of the most productive cattle for lactation; the most effective pesticides for the price; the most effective rendering plants; and any good, reasonably priced source of protein in the bovine diet. The result was that over 95% of the dairy cattle in Britain were from three breeds and the vast majority were Holstein-Friesian, and the renderers were almost all owned by two companies and used a single method for producing feed. Profits were relatively low but reliable, as long as the European Union kept the prices up and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food supplied technical help and help with sales.
<p>
The problem with this is that if one thing goes wrong then the mistake or risk applies to the whole system, which collapses; the individual companies and farmers have little to fall back on. As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food believes that it must back up the farmers and bring back confidence, even when this confidence is not justified (eggs really were contaminated with Salmonella and pate with Listeria, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy infected large numbers of cattle being eaten and could not be assumed to be a low risk).
<p>
The emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy shows how pressure towards high efficiency leads to nationally organised, relatively fragile, single method systems that can collapse easily and may depend on the suppression or denial of information in the short term for such collapse to be avoided. What happens when a disease such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy appears that is potentially fatal to a considerable proportion of the population(2) but proof for or against this will not become available for several years? Under the current system either attempts are made to assure the consumers of the safety of the food (with inadequate justification) or the industry collapses. As McMichael states, it is the pressure on the system that leads to this, and it will happen repeatedly as the pressure increases.

<hr><h3><A NAME="Media">Media</A> coverage had short-lived effect on beef consumption by pregnant
women</h3>

EDITOR, - K D Gunasekera and colleagues comment on the public recognition of scientific uncertainty about the risk of developing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after eating beef? Their conclusion is supported by our data, which indicate that although <B>almost three quarters of women stopped eating beef in the week after the media coverage of the scare, this reaction was short lived</B>.
<p>
A study collecting information about folic acid supplementation by pregnant women is also collecting dietary information,(2) asking about food eaten in the past week; information is collected about 20 common foods containing varying levels of folates. During the 10 weeks 29 January to 21 April 1996, 409 pregnant women attending three  hospitals in Birmingham were recruited to the study. All were attending a maternity hospital booking clinic; 294 were in the first trimester of pregnancy. The ages of the respondents ranged from 15 to 46 (mean 27.9 years). The catchment areas of the participating hospitals have varied socioeconomic and ethnic compositions. 
<p>
Four hundred women (98%) completed the dietary section of the questionnaire; 105 reported that they had eaten beef during the previous week. The media coverage of the 10 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in young people occurred in the week beginning 18 March(3) In the five weeks preceding this announcement 59 (36%) of the 163 women recruited reported that they had eaten beef at least once during the previous week (table 1).

<p>
In the four weeks after the media coverage the
proportion of women reporting having eaten beef fell to 36 (18%) of 201 women (<I>chi</I>-2 = 15.6, P = 0.00008). Asians reported eating beef less frequently than other ethnic groups (4/44 (9%) versus 101/356 (28%); <I>chi</I>-2 = 7.52, P = 0.006). However, adjustment for weekly variation in the proportion of vegetarians (24 (6.0% of the study population)) and Asians
(44 (10.8%)) recruited does not explain the observed fluctuation in consumption of beef.
<p>
Data for the most recent week (beginning 15 April) show that the rate of beef consumption had risen to 23%, which suggests that it was reverting towards former levels. Possibly, pregnant women are more health aware than the general population. These data suggest, however, that the dramatic fall in beef consumption after the heavy media coverage was short lived. This could mean either that the public has identified the scientific uncertainty or that after an initial reaction most of the public rapidly reverts to usual behaviour patterns. If the latter hypothesis is correct this may have implications for government health warnings and health education policy.

<h3><A NAME="Doctors">Doctors</A> are less likely than patients to have stopped eating beef</h3>

EDITOR,- There has been saturation coverage in the media and several articles in medical journals about the possible relation between bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and consumption of British beef.(1-4) The speculation and hype surrounding this latest food scare have resulted in confusion about the true risks of eating beef. I conducted a study of 43 doctors and 44 patients to determine whether their beef eating habits differed during this crisis and what influence, if any, sex and socioeconomic status might have had.
<p>Table 1 shows my findings.

<p>
Patients were
     more      likely      to      have      stopped      eating      beef than doctors and to have stopped eating beef products. They were more likely not to allow young children to eat beef (33 (75%)) and beef products (40 (91%)) than were doctors (10 (23%) and 24 (56%) respectively). when patients' responses were analysed by occupational class those in classes IV and V were more likely to have stopped eating beef and beef products than their counterparts in classes II and III. None of those in classes Iv or V would allow young children to eat beef or beef products. When both patients and doctors were analysed by sex women were more likely than men to have stopped eating beef and beef products and less likely than men to allow children to eat these products.
<p>
It is not surprising that doctors, with their medical knowledge, have been less worried about bovine spongiform encephalopathy and whether to eat beef than have patients. If; however, the public realised that their own doctors were continuing to eat beef then they might be less concerned. My findings show that socioeconomic status influences eating habits; this possibly reflects educational background (and thus the ability to separate facts and risks from the hype) and sources of information (for example, broadsheet rather than tabloid newspapers).
<p>
An important issue is the power of the media to influence  diet.  If people in lower socioeconomic groups continue to eat less red meat, beefburgers, sausages, etc and to prevent their children from eating these then a fall in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease may result - an unexpected benefit of the saga.

<h3><center><a NAME="overview">Bovine</a> spongiform encephalopathy: its wider meaning for population health</center></h3>


<P>Worldwide intensive meat production is unsustainable Evidence from Britain that
the agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle may cause
neurological disease in beef eaters(1) and the consequent turmoil in the beef
trade have made compelling headline news across Europe. The ecological dimensions
to this public drama have, however, even wider implications for population
health.<p>
Three issues warrant discussion. Firstly, although the infective agent of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy and its effects may seem exotic, this episode
merely extends the long running narrative whereby changes in human culture induce
new infectious diseases. Secondly, the method of cattle feeding implicated in the
transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy seems partly to have arisen
because of supply-demand pressures in the world food production system. Thirdly,
the scare about bovine spongiform encephalopathy is the tip of a much larger
iceberg of adverse environmental and health consequences of the mass production
and consumption of meat.
<p>Firstly, incredulity that the mysterious transmissible agent responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy might "jump species" and
infect humans is misplaced. Microbes and their ilk are no less opportunistic than
any other species and are capable of rapid genetic adaptation.(2) We humans have
improved our survival prospects by widening the range of other species on which
we feed. Bacteria and multicellular parasites do likewise, as do the viruses and
prions that parasitise the intracellular molecular processes of animals and
plants.  Ever since humans made intimate contact with other animal species - by
intruding on their habitats, eating them, or domesticating them -  mutant strains
of zoonotic agents have opportunistically become infectious agents in
humans.(3)(4)  Thus have we acquired smallpox from cattle, measles from ungulates
or dogs. influenza from pigs, HIV from monkeys, and so on. <p>
This endless narrative is a condition of life on earth: it is simply anthropocentrism that sees many
tiny species as "pests and diseases" because they share our food supplies or
parasitise us. Modern intensive methods of agriculture, animal husbandry, and
aquaculture have opened up vast new ecological opportunities for microbes.(4)(5) 
Hence it would be surprising if transmission of the type that we think may be
happening with bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease did
not occur.(6) Recent sequencing of the prion protein in vertebrates indicates an
evolutionary connection between the forms in cattle and in humans.(7) <p>
Secondly,
modern methods of intensive farming reflect increasingly the tension between food
supply and demand. As populations have increased in size and affluence, so the
demand for food has grown, particularly for foods such as meat that are seen as
high quality. The expectation of cheap meat, helped by competition between
supermarkets and government subsidy, is spreading throughout the world's middle
classes. The resulting intensification in meat production requires heightened
inputs of energy, chemicals, water, and protein feed.(8)<p>
The use of protein
derived from ruminants for cattle feed increased in the early l98Os, as world
prices escalated for the then prevailing protein supplements, fishmeal and
soybeans. The price rises reflected faltering growth in per capita production of
those foods, after three decades of strong growth.(9)(10) The per capita
production of soybeans tripled between 1950 and 1980 while the per capita fish
catch doubled between 1950 and 1970, but neither has increased further since
those peaks. From the 1980s the growth in production of these and several other
foods seems to have fallen behind the growth in world population.(10)(11)  We
must therefore ask of our recent methods of food production: to what extent have
we been depending on unsustainable resource inputs? And of the future: can we
sufficiently boost production with genetically engineered plant, animal, and
marine foods? The answers bear strongly on the long term prospects for human
health. <p>
Thirdly, beef production is a very environmentally damaging form of meat
production.(8) If we are adequately and equitably to feed a world of 10 billion
people next century, compared with today's 5.7 billion, then beef-eating
Westerners cannot expect to continue dining at an elite high table. There is
insufficient land and protein supplement (whether as cereal, fish, or mammalian
scraps) to enable a beef enriched global diet. The supplies of fossil fuel energy
and water required for intensive livestock production are huge. So is the demand
for forests to be denuded to create pastoral land in Central America to produce
lean beef for McDonald's burgers.(12) A unit of beef energy produced in western
(and, increasingly, east Asian) factory farms requires an input of around 6-7
units of cereal grain energy.(8) Smil argues that "diets high in meat are a very
recent aberration unsustainable on a global scale."(11)<p>
Epidemiological studies
indicate that vegetarians live a little longer than meat eaters.(13)(14)  We
should therefore expect that a world diet of modest meat content would bring
widespread gains in human health - both directly and by averting the adverse
social and environmental consequences of intensive meat production.(14)<p>
These
complex ecological issues portend far reaching and challenging policy decisions.
Currently, however, we are preoccupied with the unsettling risks to public health
from British beef already eaten. And in the political arena the findings of the
parliamentary Joint Agriculture and Health Select Committee seem unlikely to go
beyond the puny immediacies of economic and political face saving. We thus risk
overlooking the wider ecological and public health implications of our mass
produced, meat enriched diet. For over one hundred millennia food supplies and,
more recently, food production methods have been central to the ecological
sustainability of human societies. In the coming millennium we will need to think
even more in those terms.

<H3><CENTER>Growth hormone deaths blamed on <A NAME="MRC">MRC</A> and DoH</CENTER></H3>
<I>BMJ 313 Saturday 27 July 1996</I>
<P>

A High Court judge last week held the Department of Health and the Medical Research Council to blame for the deaths of young adults from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had been treated with human growth hormone.
In the first compensation claim over a pharmaceutical product to succeed in the British courts, Mr Justice Morland ruled that the two bodies were negligent in not passing on concerns raised by scientists that would probably have led to the treatment's suspension from July 1977. The decision means that only the families of patients who started the treatment after 1 July 1977 will be entitled to compensation.
<p>
The judge held, in effect, that had the Department of Health and the MRC fulfilled their duty of care, patients such as Patrick Baldwin, who was treated between October 1977 and 1980, would never have undergone the treatment and contracted CJD. He died in 1992 aged 30, leaving two daughters now aged 9 and 10, who are in line for substantial compensation, which has still to be assessed. The test case was brought by eight of the 16 families of recipients of human growth hormone who have died from CJD since 1985, and by three others who are dying from the disease. In addition, 87 claimants in whom CJD has not been diagnosed but who are claiming compensation for psychological trauma, hope to have their case heard next year.
<p>
The MRC ran the growth hormone programme as a clinical
trial from 1959 until 1 July 1977, when the programme was taken over by the Department of Health. Nearly 2,000 children were treated with the hormone - extracted from the pituitaries of cadavers - between 1959 and 1985, until reports of the first deaths from CJD in the United States, after which synthetic hormone was used. The MRC retained responsibility for collecting and processing pituitaries until 1980. <p>

In October 1976 a veterinary scientist, Dr Alan Dickinson of the Agricultural Research Council, who was working on scrapie, telephoned the MRC to alert officials to the risk of transmission of CJD through human growth hormone. In a letter in February 1977 he made four suggestions to improve the safety of the hormone. Two were never acted on, a third was only partly implemented, and the fourth - excluding the use of pituitaries from cases with dementia - was not put into force until 1980. Two virologists, Professor Cedric Mims of Guy's Hospital and Professor Peter Wildy of Cambridge University, were consulted by the MRC, but not until December 1977. 
<P>
Professor Wildy replied: <B>"Any clinician who uses growth hormone must be made aware of the gruesome possibilities and their imponderable probabilities."</B> But while the scientific steering committee overseeing the manufacture of the hormone were told, <B>the clinicians' committee was "deliberately kept in the dark,"</B> the judge said. Charles Brook, professor of paediatric endocrinology at University College London Hospitals and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital and a member of the clinicians' committee, gave evidence that he had never seen the letters from Dr Dickinson and the two virologists before the trial and he was "appalled" by them.

<center><h3>Scientists find <A NAME="low">low</A> level transmission of BSE</h3></center>
<I>BMJ 313 Saturday 10 August 1996</I>
<P>

Maternal
transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) does occur at low levels, according to preliminary results of research carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Researchers from the epidemiology department at the central veterinary laboratory in Weybridge found that the risk of maternal transmission of BSE from cow to calf in their study was 10%. They say that outside of study conditions this would mean that 1% of calves born to cows which die of BSE will themselves die of BSE caught from their mothers. <p>
Final results of the study, which started in 1989, are not due until the end of the year, but the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) decided to break the code early and release the data. The committee decided, however, that no further action was needed to protect public health as Britain's eradication plan for BSE already recognised that maternal transmission was a possibility.
<p>
<p>
The results have received a mixed reaction from the scientific community and stirred up once again the controversial issue of maternal transmission of encephalopathies in any animal. Kenton Morgan, professor of epidemiology at Liverpool University's faculty of veterinary science, said: "Frankly I am not surprised at the results. How could anyone have thought anything else, with maternal transmission occurring in sheep, goats, and ruminants such as the kudu, an African antelope. It would have been more surprising if they did not find maternal transmission."
<p>
But Dr Rosalind Ridley, head of the Medical Research Council's comparative cognition team at Cambridge, who wrote a paper in the BMJ (311:1071) suggesting that maternal transmission of spongiform encephalopathy was a myth, remained sceptical. She said that the data do not seem to add up as similar results have not been seen in the field. "And if there is maternal transmission then why hasn't anyone found any evidence of infection in the bovine placenta?" she added.
<p>
In this latest study the researchers studied two groups of animals with over 300 cattle in each. One group consisted of offspring of mothers with confirmed cases of BSE, and in the other group were animals born in the same herd and in the same calving season whose mother had reached at least 5 years old without showing clinical signs of BSE. The animals in the two groups were kept until the age of 7 or until BSE or another disease intervened.
<p>
Of 273 animals born to mothers with BSE 42 were histologically confirmed, BSE themselves. Of 273 animals born to mothers who did not have BSE, 13 animals were confirmed as having BSE. Results are pending on a further 63 animals. The disease showed up in both groups because the cattle studied were born around the time of the ruminant feed ban in 1988, and so some at least would have been exposed to infected feed.
<p>
Four hundred and eleven of the calves were born within 13 months of the clinical onset of BSE in their mothers, and the great majority were born within five months of clinical onset. So the study does not provide a good estimate of the risk to animals born more than six months before the onset of BSE in the mother. But the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee said that the data do provide some evidence that there is an enhanced risk of maternal transmission in the last six months of the BSE incubation period.
<p>
"The  risk  of maternal  transmission observed in the study is likely to be greater than would be expected for the entire population of cows," the committee said. "Under field conditions, only a fraction of the BSE infected cows giving birth would be within six months of demonstrating clinical signs of BSE because of the long incubation period of the disease:'
<p>
The new research throws no light on the route of maternal transmission, which could be in utero, at birth, or soon after birth. Evidence of maternal transmission of scrapie in sheep has come from two sources. Firstly, infectivity has been detected in the uterus in a few affected sheep. Secondly, an embryo transfer experiment showed evidence of in utero transmission. The embryo from a sheep infected with scrapie was transplanted into a healthy ewe, and when that ewe gave birth the lamb went on to develop scrapie. Similar experiments are underway in cattle, but the results are not yet available. But no infectivity has been detected in bovine placenta, milk, or blood.
<p>
Dr Ridley, however, is still sceptical about maternal transmission in any animal and argues that the data from sheep were derived from only a handful of animals. while agreeing that the new data have produced a striking correlation, she argues that it could be explained by genetic susceptibility in the cattle population. "If you look at a whole herd which has all been fed on the same supposedly infected feed, from the same sack, it turns out to be only one or two cows per birth cohort which go down sick. This raises the question, why not all of them?" There is some genetic variation in the PrP gene, and a small analysis has suggested that this is not associated with BSE, but Dr Ridley says that this needs to be looked at further.
<p>
Dr Ridley also added that the comparison group tended to consist of the offspring of elderly cows. "Maybe the elderly cows had some resistance to BSE - there could have been some genetic selection going on."
<p>
The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee states categorically that there is no evidence from any of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that infectivity can be transmitted trough milk. Further research is, however, being undertaken.<HR>

<P>It has long been accepted that the pattern of occurrence of scrapie - the form
of spongiform encephalopathy associated with sheep - is determined mainly by
maternal transmission, and this view has had a profound influence on policy
decisions in the control of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and on public
concern over the risk to human health from this disease. The occurrence of
maternal transmission is, however, not predicted by modern knowledge of the
aetiology of spongiform encephalopathy, and even though claims of maternal
transmission have been reiterated frequently in the literature, reexamination of
the source data reveals that these data are extremely scanty, unreplicated, and
probably subject to ascertainment bias. The probability of maternal transmission
of spongiform encephalopathy in any species should be viewed with the greatest
skepticism.

<P>In assessing the risk to human health of the epidemic of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom, the Southwood Committee accepted the
view that in scrapie (the spongiform encephalopathy occurring in sheep) <B>"there is
transmission of scrapie from the infected ewe to lamb."</B> Maternal transmission
means the infection of the lamb by the dam through a mechanism which is specific
to this biological relationship prenatal or perinatal transplacental transfer of
infective agent or infection through milk, saliva, or the close contact of birth
and suckling.<P>The House of Commons Agriculture Committee on BSE concluded that if
maternal transmission also occurred in bovine spongiform encephalopathy then "its
elimination will be much harder and its implications for humans much more
uncertain" and "the policy implications would be substantial." In 1989 a long
term study was initiated to monitor the possible occurrence of maternal
transmission in bovine spongiform encephalopathy.<P> Alarm in the general public was
fuelled by Professor Lacey, who promulgated the view that for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy "vertical transmission should prolong the epidemic into an endemic
that would be effectively permanent" and that if bovine spongiform encephalopathy
were to cause spongiform encephalopathy in humans, then not only would many
people succumb to this disease, but their children would also be affected. The
issue of maternal transmission in spongiform encephalopathy is therefore very
serious and warrants close scrutiny. 

<P>Transmission of spongiform encephalopathy in
humans (kuru and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and animals (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, for example) does occur by specific mechanisms
involving food or other contamination, but the extent to which it is involved in
the pattern of occurrence of natural scrapie is currently unresolved and is not
the subject of this paper. 

<P>Many recent publications perpetuate the view that
spongiform encephalopathy in sheep (and therefore potentially in other species)
is maintained largely by maternal transmission. The source papers (see below) on
which this claim is based were published in the 1960s, when nothing was known of
the molecular genetics of scrapie or the molecular pathogenesis of spongiform
encephalopathy and the occasional familial occurrence of the only other endemic
spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans) was perceived but
poorly understood. It is therefore appropriate to consider briefly current
understanding of spongiform encephalopathy before reassessing the source data.


<H3><P>Pattern of occurrence of spongiform encephalopathy in species other than sheep</H3>

Spongiform encephalopathy can occur as either an epidemic or endemic disease.<P>
Epidemics consist of cohorts of cases acquired by contamination with material
(usually brain) from affected cases and have occurred in humans as the result of
cannibalism in Papua New Guinea (where it is known as kuru) or medical accident,
or in animals as the result of consuming feedstuff containing protein derived
from infected animals. <P>The last has occurred in cattle (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), cats, and exotic ungulates kept in zoos and fed on similar
material to the cattle.<P> A similar disease has occurred in farmed mink, captive
mule deer, and elk. There has been no evidence of maternal transmission in any of
these epidemics of spongiform encephalopathy. <P>The incidence of kuru dropped
dramatically in people born after the cessation of cannibalism in the mid-1950s,
and no children born after 1959 to any of the women who had or subsequently
developed kuru have themselves developed the disease. The preponderance of kuru
in women and their children is adequately explained by anthropological data
indicating that women and children partook of the brain and other internal
organs, and the men did not. <P>Although there has been a single report of
infectivity in placenta, blood, and colostrum from a pregnant woman with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this does not establish maternal transmission since
both the child in this case and two further children born to women with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease remain well, like the offspring of the kura patients.
Maternal transmission also did not occur from the mice used for transmission by
Tamai et al, nor has it occurred in the progeny of a large number of primates
used for the study of the transmissibility of human spongiform encephalopathy.
Nationwide surveillance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy has shown no greater
incidence in the offspring of dams with bovine spongiform encephalopathy than in
animals in the same herd whose dam did not have the disease, the incidence in
both being consistent with foodborne contamination within these herds.<P> In an
isolated cohort of 630 calves, half from dams with and half from dams without
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, 40 animals have so far developed the disease.
But all of these calves came from herds affected by the disease and many were
born before 1988 (during the period of exposure to contaminated food) such that
until the code is broken (in 1997) these data (supplied by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food) cannot be used to support the notion of
maternal transmission in cattle.<P> Although it might be thought that the occurrence
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals born after the ruminant feed ban
of 1988 suggests a non foodborne mode of transmission, the dramatic drop in the
incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows born after this date' shows
that food was the major source of infection. Affected animals born shortly after
the ban on the production of this feed have been partly attributable to the
"shelf life" of purchased material, and subsequent cases may have been due to
inadvertent contamination of cattle feed with banned material. <P>The specified
offals ban of 1990, which banned the use of certain bovine offals in all animal
feed, was designed to protect other species (in which spongiform encephalopathy
had not actually been seen) but would have reinforced the effectiveness of the
feed ban for cattle by preventing contamination with potentially infective
material. <P>That such contamination was occurring was shown by the geographical
association between the density of pig and poultry farming and the incidence of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle born after the ban. An analysis of
beef suckler herds which were not fed the contaminated feed but which had "bought
in" cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy provided no evidence of horizontal
transmission from animal to animal.<P> Spongiform encephalopathy in a kudu whose dam
also had spongiform encephalopathy was initially thought to indicate maternal
transmission, but the subsequent appearance of spongiform encephalopathy in
several more kudus which were not the progeny of affected animals, as well as in
five other species of exotic ungulates born in seven zoos in Britain suggests
that a more widespread source of infection was responsible. All these other
exotic ungulates had unaffected dams and were born either before the ruminant
feed ban of 1988 or between that ban and the more stringent specified offals ban
of 1990. No new cases have occurred since 1992. The animals born between 1988 and
1990 could have been infected by the supposed widespread, but low level,
contamination of many types of animal feed, which the specified offals ban seems
to have largely eliminated.<P> The only species apart from sheep (and possibly
goats) in which spongiform encephalopathy is an endemic disease is humans, where
the endemic disease is either sporadic or familial. <P>Familial cases occur in an
autosomal dominant pattern and are associated with one of a number of point
mutations or insertional mutations in the prion gene (PrP gene).<P> That the
mutation causes the disease (rather than conferring susceptibility to an
environmental agent) is indicated by the observation that transgenic mice
carrying the mouse equivalent of one of these mutations spontaneously develop
spongiform encephalopathy.<P>The great majority of sporadic cases of human
spongiform encephalopathy occur in people who are homozygous for a common
polymorphism in the PrP gene.

<H3><P>The molecular pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathy </H3>

One of the main
conceptual problems in the 1960s, when the notion of maternal transmission was
first propounded, was that it was believed that the "genetic" hypothesis of
spongiform encephalopathy denied the possibility of the existence of a
transmissible agent. <P>The  undisputed  transmissibility  of spongiform
encephalopathy under experimental conditions was, in that climate, a difficulty
for the genetic hypothesis of natural scrapie. Our current understanding of
spongiform encephalopathy is that it can be, under different circumstances,
genetic, idiopathic, or acquired in origin and that cases of genetic or
idiopathic origin give rise to an agent which is then transmissible. This is
confirmed by transgenic experiments. <P>In all the spongiform encephalopathies, a
normal host protein (PrP-c) undergoes a post-translational modification to an
abnormal form (PrP-sc).<P> This abnormal form has a high beta pleated sheet
conformation and spontaneously forms neurotoxic amyloid fibrils, which accumulate
in the brain. <P>The primary structure of the PrP protein determines the probability
with which it will form an amyloid polymer, so the disease is very rare when the
PrP gene is "wild-type" but occurs in an autosomal dominant pattern in cases
which carry certain mutations in the PrP gene. <P>Polymerisation can also be
"seeded" by contamination with exogenous PrP-sc  and this accounts for the
transmissibility of the disease. <P>Homozygosity for polymorphisms in the PrP gene
enables the protein product of both alleles to interact, making the disease more
common in homozygotes. <P>This hypothesis is strengthened by the demonstration of
the recruitment of PrP-c by PrP-sc in a cell free system. That natural sheep
scrapie should be a largely recessive genetic disease determined mainly by the
primary structure of the host PrP gene, but that tissues from affected cases
should transmit disease, both experimentally and occasionally in the field, is
wholly compatible with this current view of the spongiform encephalopathies.


<H3><P>The molecular genetics of scrapie</H3>

 Analysis of the PrP gene in sheep has shown
that susceptibility to scrapie is tightly linked to polymorphisms in this gene.
There are at least four polymorphic sites (codons 112, 136, 154, and 171), and
association between these and the occurrence of scrapie depends largely on the
breed of sheep. <P>Susceptible alleles are termed sA and resistant alleles are
termed pA, although different combinations of the possible polymorphisms permit
the occurrence of alleles of intermediate susceptibility.<P>Sheep with at least one
sA allele are susceptible to experimental scrapie after subcutaneous injection of
infectious material, and sAsA sheep sometimes show a shorter incubation than sApA
sheep, depending on breed-sA is dominant or partially dominant for susceptibility
to experimental, peripheral injection.<P> The pattern of occurrence of natural
scrapie is, however, more compatible with a mainly recessive inheritance with
only some involvement of heterozygotes. <P>In many breeds of sheep, pA alleles are
known to encode alanine at codon 136 of the PrP gene and account for more than
85% of the allele frequency in unselected sheep.<P> The allele frequency of valine
136 is greater than 95% in sheep with natural scrapie from at least several of
these breeds. <P>In cases of natural compared with experimentally induced scrapie,
sAsA homozygosity is over represented, accounting for the largely recessive
pattern of the natural disease. <P>In Cheviots, sheep encoding at least one valine
at codon 136 show short incubations on subcutaneous challenge with the scrapie
isolate SSBP/1,  whereas sheep homozygous for alanine at codon 136 survive,
irrespective of their genotype at codon 171; however, sheep which are homozygous
for glutamine at codon 171 show greater susceptibility (than those which carry at
least one arginine at codon 171) on experimental infection with another isolate,
CH1641, irrespective of their codon 136 genotype. <P>SSBP/1 comprises a pooled
sample of scrapie against which sA and pA alleles are defined and has been
subject to multiple passage in sA Cheviots. <P>The CH1641 isolate came from a single
natural case of scrapie from a "positive line" Cheviot flock which contained
sAsA, sApA, and a few pApA sheep and was subsequently passaged in pApA Cheviots.
Although this occurrence complicates the issue of susceptibility to scrapie, it
raises the possibility that this unusual isolate represents the involvement of
prion protein from a pA allele and is consistent with the extensive data that
different strains of mouse sustain different experimental strains of agent, even
though there is evidence that strain of agent can transcend strain of host.<P> Texel
sheep also show a complex pattern of susceptibility, with polymorphisms at codons
136 and 171 both making a contribution while in Suffolk sheep susceptibility
depends mainly on codon 171 genotype.

<H3><P>Embryo transfer experiments </H3>

Foster et al reported embryo transfer experiments
in which two sAsA and four sApA Cheviot sheep were injected subcutaneously with
scrapie agent and about six months later were artificially inseminated with sApA
semen. The embryos were transferred to 15 pApA sheep and one sApA sheep. Six of
the 20 surviving lambs were sAsA and all these developed scrapie at about 2 years
of age.<P> Eleven sApA lambs and three pApA lambs had not developed scrapie at the
time of publication. All six donor ewes but no recipient ewes developed scrapie.
The most parsimonious explanation of these data is that scrapie in the sAsA
animals is genetically determined irrespective of uterine and perinatal
environment. <P>To prove this conclusively it will be necessary to look for scrapie
in the sAsA progeny of unaffected ewes and rams transferred as embryos into pApA
ewes. <P>The only other relevant embryo transfer experiment is by Foote et al None
of the progeny developed scrapie, but the genotypes of these sheep were not
reported so no firm conclusions can be drawn.


<H3><P>Source data on the maternal transmission of scrapie in sheep </H3>

Source material
comprises only papers in which authors report their own data for the first time
These fall into two categories: distribution of the agent in tissues, and the
familial occurrence of scrapie.

<H3><P>DISTRIBUTION OF AGENT IN TISSUES</H3>

<P>Detection of infectivity in tissues requires induction of spongiform
encephalopathy in another animal after injection or feeding of that tissue.

<P>Studies in which the recipients have been sheep have been hampered by the fact
that if sheep resistant to scrapie are used then transmission is very difficult
and if sheep susceptible to scrapie are used then they are likely to develop
scrapie naturally. <P>Although scrapie occurred in 19 of 24 sheep susceptible to
scrapie that were fed or injected intracerebrally with placental tissue from
other sheep affected with scrapie, no data were given of the background level of
scrapie in the recipient flock at the time.<P>The incubation period after which the
sheep became sick varied widely but, surprisingly  did not depend on the route of
administration. Naturally occurring scrapie was subsequently reported in that
recipient flock, which had been especially bred for high susceptibility. Thirty
six goats (which were expected to be 95% susceptible to experimental infection)
were also used. <P>In the first report, one of the goats injected intracerebrally
and three dosed orally developed spongiform encephalopathy. A further four of the
goats dosed orally died of intercurrent disease. The fate of the remaining 24
goats was not mentioned in the subsequent paper. <P>A sensible interpretation of
these reports is not possible given the lack of data and the absence of knowledge
of the genotype of the recipient sheep. When assessed by transmissions to mice,
no infectivity was found in semen, ovary, uterus (including fetal contents),
fetuses, saliva, milk, colostrum, or mammary gland of sheep affected with
scrapie, nor in lambs under the age of 4 months or goats under the age of 11
months.<P> Hourrigan claimed transmission to mice from a small proportion of samples
from reproductive organs of affected sheep, but few data were given in this short
report. There is therefore no clear demonstration of the infectivity of the
placenta from sheep with scrapie. In reviewing skeptically the lack of evidence
for infection of the sheep placenta and its role in natural disease, Hadlow
remarked of some people, "For them, it is one of the facts about scrapie."
Infectivity has been detected in the lymphoreticular system of preclinical,
experimentally infected mice and it has been proposed that agent is transported
from there to the central nervous system by way of the splanchnic nerve and the
thoracic spinal cord. Infectivity has been found in the spleen and in other
lymphoreticular and intestinal tissues of Suffolk lambs (which on the basis of
their parentage might have been going to develop scrapie) but only those over the
age of 4 months. <P> However, Hadlow has pointed out that "We have no evidence
supporting the notion that in the natural infection, virus moves centropetally
along nerve fibres from Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, or spleen to the
the thoracic spinal cord."<P> Furthermore, other studies have failed to show
consistent levels of infectivity in extraneural sites in some other breeds of
sheep, and extensive studies in bovine spongiform encephalopathy have failed to
detect infectivity in any extraneural tissue of the naturally occurring disease,
including placenta (data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food),
although low levels have been found in the distal ileum of a few experimentally
challenged but asymptomatic calves.  <P>Thus the involvement of extraneural
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the disease is unclear. Since the PrP gene is
expressed in spleen, these findings cast little light on the mode of
transmission.


<H3><P>FAMILIAL OCCURRENCE OF SCRAPIE</H3>

<P>Dickinson et al compared the incidence of scrapie in the progeny of affected
and unaffected sheep taken, in the first generation, from commercial flocks and
subsequently mated to form another generation (see table I). The data are,
however, inadequately documented since in commercial practice, as well as in some experimental matings,
it is usual for a few rams to tup a large number of ewes, so that the number of
lambs reported gives little indication of the number of matings and particularly
the number of rams involved. Furthermore, because a few rams are used repeatedly,
allele frequencies may vary greatly between groups. Dickinson et al suggested
that data for the first generation should be ignored because, although the
incidence of scrapie in the progeny of affected dams was 66%, the incidence in
the offspring of affected sires varied from 12% to 71% per ram. This would be
compatible with some of the small number of affected rams being sAsA and others
being sApA. Similarly, the occurrence of some affected sApA parents could account
for the apparent lack of 100% affliction rate in the progeny in some but not all
studies in table I in which both parents were affected. In the second generation
of Dickinson et al's study higher rates of scrapie were found in the progeny of
"high risk ewes" mated with "low risk rams" (69%) than of "low risk ewes" mated
with "high risk rams" (10%).<P> However, when what seem to be the same high risk
rams were mated with high risk ewes the incidence in the offspring was only 41%.
Although 75% of high risk ewes in the first group eventually developed scrapie,
only 48% of those in the second group did so.<P> Furthermore, only 40% of the high
risk rams (two animals) actually developed scrapie. <P>This small number of rams
with scrapie makes these data essentially uninterpretable. <P>Furthermore, Dickinson
et al reported that it was relatively easy to find lambs with affected dams
because they run together in the flock, whereas the sire may have been sold or
culled-but in this sort of analysis the status of both parents is equally
important. Without rigorous assessment, lambs with affected dams are more likely
to have an unknown, affected sire than vice versa. Since the incidence of scrapie
where both parents are affected is extremely high any such ascertainment bias
would profoundly affect the perceived incidence. <P>It can be seen from table I that
the bias towards maternal transmission is much reduced when experimental matings
are assessed and is also much reduced in more recent publications. This secular
change, along with the current demonstration of the dependence of scrapie on an
autosomal gene, makes maternal transmission unsupported by the evidence. Parry
classified his sheep into three risk categories -"black" sheep, which were either
affected or had both parents affected; "white" sheep, which came from a scrapie
free line and which had already produced many progeny without scrapie; and "grey"
sheep, which were of less certain status.<P> The data were drawn from 25 years of
stock records of more than 2500 sheep. Thus although the number of sheep reported
is still small their choice has been extremely rigorous. Table II shows the
proportion of affected offspring in each type of mating. There is no suggestion
of maternal transmission in these data.

<H3><P>Conclusion </H3>

Familial patterns of occurrence of spongiform encephalopathy is
seen only in the endemic form of the disease, and this occurs only in sheep and
humans. With the exception of kuru and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the
epidemic forms in humans), spongiform encephalopathy in humans can be regarded as
idiopathic, the primary pathogenic event being the spontaneous post-translational
modification of prion protein.<P> In sporadic cases, the occurrence of this event is
largely confined (with extremely low penetrance) to people who are homozygous for
a common polymorphism in the PrP gene; in familial cases, this event is almost
inevitable in those with dominant mutations in the PrP gene. <P>In those breeds of
sheep in which it has been assessed, it is clear that natural scrapie is tightly
linked to polymorphisms in the PrP gene in patterns which are either recessive or
show partial dominance. <P>Thus the familial pattern of scrapie is explicable
largely or totally by genetics, and embryo transfer experiments suggest that the
perinatal environment is unlikely to be relevant to the pattern of occurrence of
natural scrapie. The debate between the role of genetics and perinatal infection
in natural scrapie which took place in the 1960s could not be resolved because
the genotype of the sheep could only be partially inferred from the eventual
occurrence of scrapie in any particular animal, and transmission studies were
hampered by the fact that sheep of unknown susceptibility to natural scrapie were
the recipients in transmission experiments. The independent determination of
susceptibility to scrapie by sheep genotyping now removes this difficulty and
points to natural scrapie being a recessive or partial dominant disease in
different breeds of sheep.<P> Belief in maternal transmission as the main mode of
acquisition of natural scrapie has held sway for 30 years on the basis of poorly
reported data on the occurrence of scrapie in a handful of sheep of unknown
genotype. The genetic basis of spongiform encephalopathy in familial cases in
humans, the absence of maternal transmission in any other form of spongiform
encephalopathy and the results of embryo transfer experiments all suggest that a
genetic basis for natural sheep scrapie is compatible with our current
understanding of spongiform encephalopathy. The onus should now be on those who
wish to maintain the importance of maternal transmission of spongiform
encephalopathy in any species to provide convincing data.

<H3>Commentary: Scrapie revisited </H2>

<B>RG Will</B><P>


<P>Scrapie is a naturally occurring disease of sheep, which has become the
subject of increased scientific and media interest as scrapie contamination of
feed was the probable origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Despite
research over the past 30 years the mechanism of transmission of natural scrapie
remains uncertain. <P>The literature on natural and experimental scrapie is
extensive and at times confusing with some authors arguing that scrapie is a
purely genetic disorder while others maintain that it is an infectious disease.
<P>The advances in molecular biology in recent years have provided new information
on scrapie, and Ridley and Baker provide a timely review, concluding that
maternal transmission of scrapie and other spongiform encephalopathies is a myth.
<P>There is no good evidence of maternal transmission in any of the human spongiform
encephalopathies, in experimental spongiform encephalopathy in laboratory
species, or in transmissible mink encephalopathy.<P> The occurrence of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy in cattle born after the feed ban in 1988 has led to
speculation regarding maternal transmission of this disease, but epidemiological
evidence provides little support for this hypothesis and concern about possible
continuing contamination of cattle feed has led to new legislative measures.
Maternal transmission in kudu, a breed of captive zoo ungulate, was originally
suspected but is now uncertain.<P> Only with natural scrapie is there evidence of
maternal transmission. <P>However, Ridley and Baker question the evidence that shows
infectivity in the placenta of sheep with scrapie, and they provide alternative
interpretations of embryo transfer experiments and the important breeding
experiments carried out by Dickinson and colleagues.1 There are therefore cogent
reasons for reconsidering the importance of maternal transmission in natural
scrapie, although as Kimberlin has pointed out maternal transmission may be
masked if there is a high level of lateral contagion.' In scrapie, and other
spongiform encephalopathies, the occurrence and phenotype of disease is
influenced by host genetics and agent characteristics and by the level of
infectious challenge and route of exposure. In scrapie, analysis of the prion
protein (PrP) gene in sheep has shown that susceptibility to disease is linked to
polymorphisms of the PrP gene. <P>The genetics of scrapie susceptibility, summarised
by Ridley and Baker, are complex, with the type of inheritance (dominant,
partially dominant, or recessive) varying by breed of sheep.<P> Crucially, there is
also evidence of an interaction between host genotype and strain of scrapie
agent, indicating that selective breeding for resistance to scrapie may be
problematic and that regarding scrapie as a simple genetic disease may be an
oversimplification. <P>One of the peculiarities of the epidemiology of scrapie is
that the large sheep population in New Zealand has been scrapie free for decades.
If scrapie is primarily genetically determined, the current analysis of genotypes
of sheep in New Zealand may provide important data - for example, it might be
predicted hat all tested sheep will be of resistant genotype. <P>However, in 1979
Hourrigan and colleagues reported he development of scrapie in two out of 20
sheep imported from New Zealand following contact with locks known to be affected
by scrapie, and 39% of he progeny of the inbred New Zealand flock also developed
scrapie.<P> Despite molecular biological research, the mechanism of transmission of
natural scrapie remains unclear, and control of this important endemic disease
cannot currently be based solely on genetic manipulation. Even if maternal
transmission is a myth, the complexities of the interaction between host genetics
and agent train, together with the evidence for lateral transmission, indicate
that eradication of scrapie may be difficult to achieve. <P>One important
implication of the paper by Ridley and Baker is that previous assumptions about
scrapie may have to be reevaluated, and further research on the epidemiology and
transmission characteristics of the natural disease will be necessary if scrapie
is to be eradicated.<P> Even if the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
declines and disappears early in the next century as predicted, scrapie will
remain as a potential source of animal zoonoses in many countries where it is
endemic.

<H3><CENTER>Austrian <A NAME="Rise">Rise</A> in CJD due to better reporting</CENTER></H3>
BMJ 313 Saturday 17 August 1996
<P>


The rise in the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the human form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, is more likely to reflect increased awareness among healthcare professionals than a true rise
in the number of new cases, according to Austrian researchers. <P>


Although the incidence of CJD cases reached a peak in the United Kingdom in 1994, with 59 definite or
probable deaths reported to the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, the UK figure remained only 62% of the
number of cases confirmed by postmortem examination in Austria in the same year. The number of
neurologically confirmed cases in 1995 totalled 1.25 per million of the Austrian population, a figure which
was considerably higher than any other European country, including the UK, according to researchers writing
in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (1996;61:139-42). <P>


"Since our figures for the first half of 1996 are comparable to those of 1995, we are confident that we are
missing very few cases of CJD," said Herbert Budka, professor of neuropathology at the University of Vienna,
one of the study's authors. "However, in many other parts of Europe, including the UK, there may still be a
considerable degree of underreporting." 

Between 1985 and 1994 the total number of reported UK cases more than doubled, from 28 to 59 cases, which
the researchers attribute to better reporting. <P>


However, the researchers exclude the 10 cases of a new CJD variant in people under the age of 42 (average age
27), described in March by the UK's CJD Surveillance Unit. Although two of the 79 patients diagnosed as
having CJD in Austria between 1969 and 1995 were 27 and 30 years old, both had classic features of CJD.
"The new CJD variant appears to be evidence of increased incidence, rather than a reporting artefact.
Furthermore, it appears to be unique to Britain at this time," Professor Budka said. <P>


Not a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been reported in Austria, so CJD is unlikely to be
linked to consumption of contaminated beef products there. Austria does have many more neurologists and a
higher rate of routine necropsy than Britain. 

"We autopsy 70% of suspected CJD cases, but we could still improve on this figure," said Dr James Ironside,
senior lecturer in pathology at the University of Edinburgh. "While the unit is willing to help as much as it
can, and we frequently perform autopsies or examine neural tissue of suspected CJD cases, we still depend on
initial notification," he added. <P>

THE Carnivores Club, the anti-vegetarian society set up by Groupe Chez Gerard deputy chairman Laurence Isaacson, is preparing a bash for British beef. It has booked Butchers Hall on October 23 and hopes to interest the Meat and Livestock Commission. "It is at the planning stage," says Isaacson. "But we expect more than 150 City people to join us in celebration." The club plans to add extra spice by bringing along a bull and promises it will not be the dinner.

<H3><CENTER>IMF warns UK Chancellor on <A NAME="tax">tax</A> cuts BSE hits Agriculture</CENTER></H3>
>By Graham Bowley in London and Robert Chote in Washington<BR>
The Financial Times    ...   Saturday July 27 1996<BR><BR>
The International Monetary Fund has warned Britain's Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, that he has no scope for tax cuts in this year's Budget and that he needs to do more to bring the public finances under control.<BR><BR>

The IMF's conclusions coincided with weak official figures yesterday which showed that the UK economy grew only slowly again in the second quarter of the year, as manufacturing stagnated and agriculture was hit by the BSE, or mad cow crisis. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product grew 0.4 per cent between the first and second quarters, at the same rate as in the previous two quarters.<BR>

<H4><CENTER><A NAME="Germans">Germans</A> lay low after beef gaffe </CENTER></H3>

BY ROBIN YOUNG 6.6.96 London Times


<P>



THE golden rule when dealing with Germans was not to mention the war. This week in Wellington, Somerset, it is British beef that is taboo.

The party of Germans visiting Wellington from its twin town of Immenstadt in Bavaria won international notoriety with their request that their hosts should not serve any beef during their stay.

<P>

The "No beef, please, we are Germans" request was made by Hans Stumpf, the Immenstadt party leader, who said: "Our people were concerned, and begged me to ask their English hosts not to serve beef."

<P>

Now the German group are equally concerned about the furore their request has aroused. The issue has been debated in the House of Commons, and in Wellington itself there is no shortage of people flying the flag for Britain.


The request infuriated many local people in Wellington, but the visit is going ahead under a veil of secrecy.

<P>

A member of the Wellington Twinning Association said yesterday: "The whole visit is being kept low key because of the publicity. Our guests are having a good time but beef seems to be a taboo subject."

<P>

The low profile for the Germans' week-long visit was established as soon as they arrived. Instead of the usual welcome in the town centre their coach was met at a nearby motorway service station and the Germans were then ferried to their hosts' homes by car. Details of the visit were not released in advance to avoid any embarrassing incidents.

<P>

Yesterday the German party of 19 adults and 12 children were kept well out of the way, being dispatched on a day trip to Land's End. A German television crew scouring Wellington for German visitors' reactions to life in BSE-stricken Britain drew a blank.


<P>

The town's Blue Mantle Hotel has been garlanded with pro-British beef slogans and red white and blue bunting by the publicans, Peter and Murium Green.

<P>

A battered Union Jack, proudly carried by Mrs Green's late father through the Second World War in North Africa and European campaigns, flutters outside. Mrs Green said yesterday: "We want to make a statement in support of British farmers while the Germans are in town. It is appalling that Wellington has had to adopt undercover tactics to get the German guests into town. After all we are civilised and are making them welcome. There has been no goosestepping or <I>Sieg Heil</I> salutes."

FROM BEN MACINTYRE IN PARIS<BR>
London Times 12 June 96<P>




POLITICIANS exchanged insults in the French parliament yesterday as Left and Right accused each other of exposing people to "mad cow" disease.

<P>

Hitherto, anger in the National Assembly over the beef crisis has been directed largely at the British Government, but yesterday deputies turned on each other. Goaded by Opposition taunts, Philippe Vasseur, the Agriculture Minister, accused the Socialists of allowing BSE-tainted beef to be sold in France when they were in government before 1993.

<P>

"You put meat from those herds on the market, so shut up," the normally pacific M Vasseur bellowed. He followed with an earthy saying from his region in the north of France: "If you climb up a tree you should make sure your underwear is clean." That was a red rag to a bull for the Opposition, which has accused the Gov ernment of endangering the health of consumers by supporting a gradual easing of the European ban on British beef exports. Philippe S&eacute;guin, the somewhat bovine Speaker, called repeatedly for order, but was almost drowned out in a stampede of angry deputies.

<P>

M Vasseur insisted angrily that the Government had always made public health a priority, adding that in the next few days it would "offer a Bill on the safety and hygiene of food products".

<P>

Consumer groups have strongly criticised the Government of President Chirac for its conciliatory line on the beef ban, particularly after a French scientific report last week emphasised the health dangers of BSE-infected beef and sparked new public anxiety.<HR>


A French consumer association yesterday called for a boycott of British foods containing beef tallow or gelatine, after the lifting of the embargo on beef by-products from Britain. The boycott would affect mainly biscuits, sweets and cakes, the association said.  London Times 7 June 96

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Commission">Commission</A> believes agreement on beef crisis can be reached quickly</CENTER></H3>




FROM CHARLES BREMNER

 

IN BRUSSELS

<BR>London Times ... 12 June 96
<P>

 THE European Commission believes that it can wrap up an agreement within days that will defuse the beef crisis and allow Britain to drop its campaign of obstruction, Jacques Santer, the Commission's President, said yesterday.

<P>

A hectic bout of Euro-diplomacy and meetings between British and Commission officials should clear the way to an accord at a foreign ministers' meeting in Rome on Monday, Mr Santer said. However, the Commission said it needed more proposals from London to complete the package ahead of the EU summit in Florence next week. Senior British officials said John Major would insist on a concrete plan as the price of calling off Britain's blocking tactics.

<P>

 Britain yesterday applied its veto to four proposed EU measures, all relating to culture, bringing the number of initiatives blocked in the beef war to 78. On its side, the Commission formally ordered the lifting of the ban on the export of the by-products gelatine, tallow and bull semen. Only the semen is back on the world market because stringent controls must be applied in Britain before gelatine and tallow will be certified for export.

<P>

The Italian Government, which hosts the EU summit on June 21-22, is working with the Irish, who take on the EU presidency next month, to save the Florence gathering from being taken hostage by Britain's beef demands. John Bruton, the Irish Prime Minister, who met Mr Santer yesterday, was more cautious. "I consider that the objective can be achieved if there is goodwill on all sides," he said.

<P>

"John Major is going to be handed a ladder which he can climb down," a French official said. "He should be grateful for that, but it will still be a very long haul." Mr Bruton said the EU could give its blessing to a "scaffolding" but "filling in the gaps" would come after Florence.

<P>

Britain's senior veterinary official voiced doubts on likely progress in Brussels. Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, said the Standing Veterinary Committee, the body which must approve all steps in the beef affair, would vote on Friday on whether Britain's programme of eradication was acceptable as a starting point for easing the ban. "Whether the British plan will get support is a moot point," he said.

<P>

The veterinary committee, representing member states, has been regarded by Britain as the villain in the beef affair since it rejected the original proposal to lift the ban.

British beef exports worth nearly &#163;600 million have been blocked since March 27 when the European Union imposed a global ban after fresh scientific evidence linked "mad cow" disease to a similar fatal brain condition in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<P>


Four leading supermarket chains were accused by farmers and the Government of sabotaging the culling of cattle over 30 months old, regarded as more likely to have BSE. The four chains said they would not accept beef from abattoirs that took part in the cull.

<P>

Tony Baldry, the junior Agriculture Minister in charge of the cull, said: "This could mean that some of the biggest and most efficient abattoirs will go bust because they will not be viable unless they can slaughter older animals and those intended for the food chain."

<P>

The move by the supermarkets was initiated by David Simons, chief executive of the Somerfield chain, who issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was "naive" to believe that meat from older cattle could be kept out of the food chain without total separation of the killing processes.

<P>

Speaking at a rally of more than 300 farmers in Westminster Cathedral Hall in central London, Sir David Naish, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said he was "furious" with the statement by Mr Simons. He added: "It is very irresponsible and could cast doubt on the whole scheme in the eyes of consumers."

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture says abattoirs can slaughter both older and younger cattle provided they do not do so on the same day and wash down the plant between operations.

<P>

 THE Asda supermarket chain last night announced that it was banning all foreign beef from its shelves. Archie Norman, the company's chief executive, said: "British beef is the best and safest in the world and our shoppers want to buy it."

FROM ROGER BOYES IN BONN ... 11 June 96
<P>

 GERMAN politicians signalled yesterday that they were ready to defy the European Commission and uphold a unilateral ban on British beef throughout the summer and beyond.

<P>

The threat came at a highly charged meeting in Berlin between ministers from Germany's 16 provincial states and Horst Seehofer, the federal Health Minister. Germany is justifying its current ban on British beef and its derivatives on the basis of a six-month emergency decree allowing it to override European free-trade legislation. But it cannot be extended beyond September.

<P>

Baerbel Hohn, Agricultural Minister of North Rhine Westphalia, said: "We must keep this ban in place, even beyond September, unless there is a convincing case presented that British beef products are safe. At the moment this seems unlikely."

Herr Seehofer is strictly against any relaxation. According to a leaked report by a German member of the inspection team in Britain, British selection procedures were sloppy. "There is no proper separation of animals. That puts the whole system in question."

<P>

The German Government is demanding that the Commission set up an expert committee of scientists, vets and doctors in an attempt to reach a definitive and objective assessment of the potential health risks of BSE.<HR>

BY CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS AND JILL SHERMAN ... The Times: Britain: 10 June 96<P>

AN EMOTIONAL attack on London by Jacques Santer, President of the European Commission, raised the pressure in the beef war yesterday. It was clear that John Major's obstruction campaign over beef is fuelling continental ideas for sidelining Britain in a new-look European Union.

<P>

Mr Santer's blast, in which he spoke of an approaching "moment of truth" if Britain contined to sabotage EU business, testified to the extreme exasperation which the Government's beef tactics are generating in all 14 other member states and the Commission. "We are going as far as the limit of our possible tolerance and all the members' tolerance," the normally emollient Mr Santer said in an interview in <I>The Observer.</I> People were now asking, he said, whether "Europe would be better off without Britain".

<P>

Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime Minister of Belgium, said over the weekend that Europe would never yield to "British blackmail". The word "blackmail" is also being wielded by officials from Nordic states.

<P>

A senior British diplomat in Brussels said that Britain's desire was a rapid return to business as usual. "This policy is intended to be a lever, not a bludgeon," he said. The best outcome would be a decision by EU leaders at the Florence summit on a framework for winding down the ban, which would then be administered by the Brussels Commission. However, resistance is so stiff from Germany and its allies that all the signs are pointing to a Florence debacle.

<P>
Portugal, an old ally, has joined Germany in the hardline camp over beef. President Chirac, who sided with Mr Major in the drive to lift the beef by-products ban, has shifted back towards Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, after sounding off to visitors on what he saw as the folly of Mr Major's campaign.

<B>Poll: More want to leave Europe</B> 


The public's growing antipathy towards Europe is highlighted in a Gallup poll in <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> today which shows that 43 per cent would vote to pull out of the European Union<I>.</I> A year ago a similar poll found that only 37 per cent wanted to pull out.<HR>

Britain again <A NAME="clashes">clashes</A> with EU on beef ban</CENTER></H3>

LUXEMBOURG -- Britain went head-to-head Monday with its increasingly angry European Union partners over the ban on British beef, but it eased off slightly from blocking all EU measures.
<P>

Britain has vowed to obstruct each EU measure requiring unanimity until the EU announces when it will lift the beef ban, instituted March 27 because of fears over mad-cow disease in Britain that scientists say may cause a fatal brain ailment in humans.

<P>

Britain's 14 EU partners are increasingly annoyed with the obstructionist tactics: ''The time has come for the British to become level-headed'' before it further harms its interests, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said Monday as EU ministers met.

<P>

Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo was even angrier: Britain has a ''shortsighted view of the problem . . . (It) seems to think it is the only one being damaged by the export ban. The truth is we all do.''

<P>

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind did signal a partial easing of policy Monday. The foreign ministers faced 20 measures requiring unanimous approval. Rifkind said he would veto all but three: an association accord with Slovenia, the granting of $3.6 million for elections in Bosnia and a draft EU-Algeria trade pact.

<P>

Britain, which already has slaughtered 160,000 cattle in the mad-cow scare and said a total of 1 million would be destroyed, treats the beef ban as a trade dispute, one that lacks scientific basis and has unfairly brought to a halt an annual beef trade worth $855 million.

FROM CHARLES BREMNEr IN BRUSSELS  8 June 96  London Times<P>


 BRITAIN'S top civil servant at the European Commission took the highly unusual step of going public last night with a blunt defence of Britain's place in Europe and implictly blaming the Government for the BSE crisis.

<P>

David Williamson, who as secretary-general of the Commission is head of all its staff, said that he wanted to correct the picture because of the "current European witch-hunt". He extolled the benefits that he said Britain gained from its membership of the European Union.

<P>

In a speech due to be delivered to a solicitors' conference in York last night, he summed up the EU as "370 million friends and the largest market in the world, for 2p a week." That was the net price paid per head in Britain for all the benefits that accrued from the single market, an entity which he defined as "Britain's greatest achievement in the Community".

<P>

Mr Williamson, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, said "the best cure for Euro-scepticaemia is a dose of common sense". His speech amounted to a <I>cri de coeur</I> from a man who rarely expresses a view in public. It reflected the indignation widespread among British EU staff over the Government's handling of the BSE affair.

<P>

The crisis, Mr Williamson said, was "a British problem". He hoped that the disease could be eradicated quickly and noted that the EU would spend more than &#163;1 billion this year "as a direct consequence of the British authorities' announcement on BSE".

<P>

Ministers played down expectations of reaching agreement over the beef crisis before or at the Florence summit on June 21. Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, returned from a tour of six European capitals and indicated that there was only a slim chance of the EU agreeing to a framework for a phased lifting of the beef ban within the next two weeks.<HR>

</CENTER></H3>



BY PHILIP WEBSTER ...  London Times 7 ... June 96
<P>

 JOHN MAJOR said yesterday that the Government was not seeking a date for the dropping of the beef ban, as ministers raised hopes of a speedy settlement.


The Prime Minister told Tony Blair in the Commons: "As far as the negotiations on timescale are concerned, what we are seeking is not an arbitrary calendar date but the steps that need to be taken ... to enable us to remove the ban."

<P>

Amid increasing signs that the Government is looking for an early end to the dispute with the European Union, Malcolm Rifkind today underlines an apparent readiness to compromise as ministers seek a "framework" deal for the lifting of the export embargo.

<P>

The Foreign Secretary, writing in <I>The Times</I>, suggests that lifting each part of the ban could be linked to the effectiveness of the measures that the Government has introduced and their certification by the European Commission: "We are not asking other European countries automatically to accept what we say."

<P>

In spite of pessimism in Brussels and elsewhere about the prospects of an agreement, ministers appeared determined to "talk up" the chances of an end to the beef conflict within ten days. The moves strengthened the feeling at Westminster that the Government is anxious to seize as early as possible a deal that it can sell to its backbenchers.

<P>

The feeling was reinforced last night by a new poll showing Conservative fortunes again on the decline, with voters disapproving of EU disruption tactics. The Gallup poll for <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> today shows the Tories on 22.5 per cent &#173; down two points on last month. Labour's support rose to 57 per cent, with the Liberal Demo crats trailing on 16 per cent. Asked for their views on the campaign of non-cooperation, two out of three voters said it would fail. Only 23 per cent of Tory voters backed the campaign, with 55 per cent against.

<P>

Mr Rifkind emerged from a meeting yesterday with President Chirac of France saying he hoped a solution could be found "within a matter of weeks". French officials, however, quoted M Chirac as saying that a plan to ease the embargo must follow an agreement by both the European Commission and the European Council on a culling prog<I>r</I>amme for British herds.

<P>

Mr Major will face criticism from Euro-sceptics if he abandons the policy without what they consider to be a satisfactorily firm deal. Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor, urged him to ignore defeatist comments by the Confederation of British Industry, "who want to throw in the towel and seem so indifferent to the plight of small businesses and farmers".<HR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Brussels">Brussels</A> keeps up pressure over British beef crisis</CENTER></H3>
 
FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS London Times 6.6.96<P>



THE European Commission welcomed yesterday Britain's framework plan for phasing out the European Union beef ban, but insisted that for the scheme to pass the Government must produce convincing new proposals on eradicating "mad cow" disease and restoring public confidence.

<P>

Jacques Santer, the Commission President, gave its response to Malcolm Rifkind as the Foreign Secretary embarked on a tour of EU capitals to try to convince Britain's partners of the merits of its case. The Commission, which last week criticised Britain's blocking drive, said the framework plan "amounted to an opportunity to move along the path long advocated by the Commission".

<P>

Mr Rifkind and the Commission made clear, however, that, given the mechanics of EU decision-making, the beef crisis would continue for weeks, if not months, and at least up to the Florence EU summit on June 21.

<P>

The Commission sounded a note of caution and puzzled British officials by insisting after Mr Rifkind's departure that Britain must still back its latest plan with more stringent measures to eradicate BSE and restore confidence. "The ball is with the British," Mr Santer's spokesman said. Only an hour before, Mr Rifkind and Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, had argued before the European media that Britain had done everything within reason to achieve both goals.

<P>
After Monday's failure of EU ministers to endorse the move by the required majority, the Commission is due today to order the easing of the ban on gelatin, tallow and bull semen, with stringent conditions that will require compliance to be monitored. Spain's unexpected decision to vote in favour of lifting the embargo on British bovine by-products may have been taken in the hope of a future quid pro quo with Britain on fishing rights.

<P>

Germany, however, which remains fiercely opposed to lifting any part of the ban, said yesterday that some of its constituent states were likely to disobey the Commission's order to lift the by-products ban. As ministers in London welcomed the imminent raising of the embargo on beef by-products, John Major called for an early start to the gradual lifting of the export ban on British beef.

<P>
A big hurdle is the necessity of putting all proposals to lift every separate aspect of the ban before the standing committee of national veterinary experts, which caused Britain so much trouble by resisting the relaxation on by-products.

<P>
Under EU rules, a qualified-majority vote must come from the veterinary experts before the 14 other governments can move to a political decision on the scheme. With continental governments insisting on the primacy of the scientific experts, there is a big risk that the British plan could be bogged down in the veterinary committee.

<P>

Mr Hogg said Britain wanted governments to agree to give the Commission power to confirm whether conditions were satisfied for each phase of Britain's plan. The first step is to end the ban on exports to non-EU countries. Then follows the exemption of grass-fed cattle from herds certified free of BSE.

<P>

After that, Britain wants agreement to the export of calves born after July 1, the date from which the strictest controls against the animal-based feed will be enforced.<HR>


<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Farmers">Farmers</A> risk fines over suspect feed</H3></CENTER>

BY PHILIP WEBSTER ... London Times 6 June 96<P>

FARMERS and suppliers will face fines of up to &#163;5,000 if they keep beyond the end of next month suspect animal feed that could spread BSE. The decision to criminalise the possession of livestock feed containing animal remains was Mr Hogg's latest effort to convince the rest of Europe of the effectiveness of Britain's anti-BSE measures. Farmers and suppliers would be prosecuted under the 1981 Animal Health Act, which provides for fines of up to &#163;5,000 and a month's imprisonment for repeat offences.<P>



Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, announced the move yesterday as he sought the lifting of the EU ban on the export of the beef by-products tallow, gelatine and semen. Mr Hogg presented a 120-page dossier to EU farm ministers in Luxembourg set ting out Britain's plans to eradicate BSE.
 In the document, Mr Hogg also proposes a "selective" cull of about 80,000 cattle, mainly from dairy herds, which are considered to be at particular risk of BSE. This would be in addition to the ongoing slaughter of all cattle over 30 months old.
<P>

Feed suppliers said they would face a loss of about &#163;1.5 million, representing the value of unsold stocks of banned feedstuff. Farmers and feed manufacturers have until the end of next month to dispose of their remaining supplies.

The use of ruminant animal protein in cattle feed was banned as long ago as July 1988, but about 27,000 of the 162,000 cattle that have caught BSE since 1986 were born after that date. It is presumed that they must have been exposed to infected feed.<P>

Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said: "I see nothing in this latest proposal to persuade me that it will substantialy reduce the incidence of BSE, and certainly not enough to justify the decimation of many dairy herds."

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="European">European</A> ministers' vote will ease ban on British beef</H3></CENTER>

BY CHARLES BREMNER  AND PHILIP WEBSTER ... London Times 6 JUNE 96<P>

 EUROPEAN opinion on the beef crisis shifted in Britain's favour last night as farm ministers from nine of the 15 states lined up in support of the proposal to ease the EU ban on beef byproducts.
It was not enough to win the immediate lifting of the ban on gelatine, tallow and bull semen, but the Commission will now have to enforce the measure by itself, against the wishes of Germany and five of its allies. This could happen within days. Spain was the only country to shift sides from the last vote, last month. But it was not enough to overcome opposition from Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal.

<P>

The negative political fallout for Britain, however, promises to be intense. Public opinion in Germany and even France, which supported Britain, remains fiercely opposed to easing any aspects of the ban.

<P>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, fought hard to convince doubting states of the merits of Britain's case yesterday, as Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, and Eric Forth, the Employment Minister, continued the campaign of obstructing EU business.


As Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, arrives in Brussels today on the first stage of his "charm offensive" to explain Britain's case, it was clear that the obstruction campaign was making Britain no friends on the Continent.<P>

Ministers and officials from other EU states were universally critical in their condemnation of Britain's conduct. Ivan Yates, the Irish Farm Minister, said: "The countermeasures have been totally counterproductive." He deplored the "atmosphere of retaliation and bad blood" created by John Major at a time that the Commission and other ministers were trying to broker a compromise.

<P>

Attention will now swiftly switch to Britain's efforts to get the wider embargo removed. It emerged yesterday that a lifting of the ban on beef from specialist herds and that on sale to countries outside the EU is the price Britain is asking for calling off its campaign of obstruction.


The view in London is that once the ban is partially lifted &#173; particularly in relation to specialist beef &#173; the rest of it could go over a period of months.<P>



Last night's decision in Luxumbourg was expected and ministers will come under pressure not to give way until a clear timescale has been set for the removal of the world wide prohibition on the export of British beef.<HR>

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... June 27 1996<BR>
FROM BEN MACINTYRE<P>

 IN A bizarre link between the Battle of Waterloo and the beef war, the French press has uncovered a report by Victor Hugo describing how Britain used human and animal remains from Napoleonic battlefields to nourish its cattle.

<P>

In his work <I>Things Observed 1847-1848</I>, Hugo recorded that British farmers were grinding up bones left behind from the carnage at Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815) to fertilise the fields of Yorkshire. "Thus the last residue of Napoleon's victories are being used to fatten up English cows," Hugo said.

<P>

"At last the true origin of BSE has been revealed," the satirical French weekly <I>Le Canard Encha&icirc;n&eacute;</I> said yesterday. "If English cattle have turned mad, the cause is historical ... the cows across the Channel were nourished on flour made from old soldiers and war horses."

<P>

About 32,000 Frenchmen died at Waterloo, with 15,000 English and 7,000 Prussian troops. Citing British newspapers, Hugo wrote: "Several million bushels of human bones arrived at Hull from the Continent."

<P>

He added: "These bones, mixed with the bones of horses, have been collected from the battlefields of Austerlitz, Leipzig ... and Waterloo.

<P>

"They were transported to Yorkshire where they were ground into powder and then sent to Doncaster where they are being used as fertiliser."

<A NAME="Irish">Irish</A> PM rules out changes over beef 
</CENTER></H3>



BY AUDREY MAGEE ...IRELAND CORRESPONDENT
<BR>The Times: Britain: July 1 1996<P>

 THE Irish Government has ruled out any renegotiation of the package of measures to end the European Union's ban on British beef exports, during its EU presidency.

Dick Spring, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, said the five-stage plan to lift the ban on British beef, imposed after fears over the possible risk to humans from BSE, would remain, regardless of pressures on the British Government from Euro-sceptics or farmers.

<P>

Mr Spring said: "If people try to unravel that package &#173; given the hostility in Europe and the difficulties there were putting this package together &#173; you would open the crisis again." There were dangers in implementing the BSE eradication measures, as the programme included a larger cull of cattle than Britain had envisaged. The Irish presidency intends keeping the plan on course so that the ban is gradually lifted.

<P>

Mr Spring said he was relieved that the BSE crisis had been resolved. It has cleared the way for Ireland to preside over some of the most difficult decisions the EU has to take as it prepares for further integration and to admit new member states.

<P>

But Mr Spring remains concerned at the possible impact of the Tory Euro-sceptics on British policy. "There is a nagging doubt in the back of our minds about the attitude of the British Government to Europe. My personal view is that John Major is pro-Europe and would want to have a strong Britain in Europe. But there is division in the Conservative Party and that is a matter for the British Government. I hope that division will not make things more difficult."

<P>

* A counselling service is to be set up to help farmers to cope with their worries over the impact on their livelihood of the crisis over BSE, it was announced yesterday, on the eve of the four-day Royal Show, the annual showcase for British agriculture. The service will be based at the National Agricultural Centre, at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, where the show is held.

<P>

The threat to the industry has cast a shadow over this year's event, to be opened today by Franz Fischler, the European Agriculture Commissioner, whom many farmers blame for their troubles. He will share the rostrum with Douglas Hogg, the embattled Agriculture Minister.

<P>

Beef farmers have suffered badly from falling cattle prices. Dairy farmers are deeply anxious about the cull due to start in the autumn.

<P>

Charles Runge, chief executive of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, said there had been a marked increase in calls for help from farmers since the Government disclosed a possible link between BSE-infected beef and CJD, which affects humans. It is intended to build up a database of counsellors to whom farmers could be referred in their area.

PRESIDENT CHIRAC announced yesterday he would press fellow world leaders to increase funding for medical research into epidemics such as "mad cow" disease, Aids and Ebola virus at the Lyons summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations.

<P>

In an interview published yesterday, the French President said that battling such epidemics should be made a priority, and gave a warning that "other diseases may be waiting in the shadows". He also singled out hepatitis C as a crucial area of medical research. "It is urgent that the major powers are aware of this problem at the highest political levels. The G7 summit gives us an opportunity," M Chirac said, adding that research into epidemic viruses and bacteria had been neglected in recent years.

<P>

The crisis over "mad cow" disease (BSE) has proved particularly devastating for farm ers in France, where beef sales have dropped by up to 40 per cent, according to latest figures. France's largest farm union yesterday condemned the European Union aid plan for beef producers as unsatisfactory and said that extra compensation was needed.

<P>

M Chirac also criticised America yesterday for failing to give sufficient help to developing countries and confirmed that he would make aid for the Third World a central issue at the summit. "The current trend is for major nations, particularly the US, to pull out. This is unacceptable," M Chirac said.

His Foreign Minister, Herv&eacute; de Charette, said "the growth of selfishness of rich countries is becoming unbearable". He noted that while France and Japan give the largest amounts in development aid, the proportion of gross domestic product that America donates is dwindling.<HR>

BY Ben Macintyre<BR>
The Times: Britain: June 28 1996<P>

The French Government announced a ban yesterday on all British animal feed containing animal parts in the latest move to stamp out "mad cow" disease.

France prohibited the use of animal feed containing bonemeal for ruminants in 1989, a year after Britain, but it is still permitted for pigs, chickens and fish.

<P>

A scientific committee led by Dominique Dormont, a brain-disease specialist, presented the Government with a report saying that animal feed containing the remains of British cows infected with BSE was the principal potential source of "mad cow" disease.

<P>
British farmers are to get an additional &#163;112 million in aid to cope with the beef crisis under a deal agreed by European Union agriculture ministers in Luxembourg. The aid, part of a &#163;705 million package granted to all EU farmers, is intended to compensate beef producers for low prices caused by consumer fears of "mad cow" disease. Most of the money will be used to increase existing EU subsidies for beef cattle, but the Government has the discretion to distribute &#163;28 million to the worst-affected producers and to add a matching amount from national funds.<HR>


<H3><CENTER>Major tells <A NAME="Hogg">Hogg</A>: well done and your job is secure</CENTER></H3>
 
BY ARTHUR LEATHLEY, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT<BR>
The Times: Britain: June 28 1996
<P>

JOHN MAJOR told Douglas Hogg last night that he would keep his job as Agriculture Minister despite calls from senior colleagues for him to be sacked. Mr Hogg, who has faced intense criticism from senior colleagues for his handling of the beef crisis, has also received a letter from the Prime Minister praising his work in recent months.

<P>

Mr Major is said to be annoyed that the continuing speculation surrounding Mr Hogg is raising widespread uncertainty about a Cabinet reshuffle. He has told colleagues that a reshuffle is his responsibility and he is not going to be "bounced" into making changes.

<P>

A reshuffle of non-Cabinet ministers remains inevitable since the announcement by the ministers Steven Norris and Tim Eggar that they are standing down as MPs at the general election. The reassurances offered to Mr Hogg make any Cabinet changes much less likely, as senior ministers had suggested that he was the most obvious trigger for a reshuffle.

<P>

During a 30-minute meeting with Alastair Goodlad, the Government Chief Whip, Mr Hogg was told that he had the full confidence of the Prime Minister and that he could expect to retain his current post through to the election. In a personal letter to Mr Hogg, Mr Major wrote: "The last three months of the crisis over beef have not been easy for many of us, but I am conscious that they have been most difficult for you and your department, faced with the multiple challenges of an issue with huge agricultural, trade and politicial ramifications."

<P>

Mr Hogg's meeting came as Labour increased the pressure for his dismissal. Brian Wilson, a leading member of Labour's campaign team, said: "Mr Hogg has had it &#173; and all the Tories can think about is getting the chance to add the post of Cabinet minister to their CVs before the Government goes the way of a clapped-out old milker."

<P>

Mr Hogg is reported to have been frustrated that last week's agreement of EU leaders on a framework for lifting the beef ban did not put an end to speculation about his future. One friend said: "He is pretty robust, but he is fed up that there has been no let-up and it is affecting the morale of his department."

<blockquote>
     A major new inquiry today raised fresh concerns about the risks to
human health from mad cow disease.  The risks include contamination of
drinking water from the corpses of buried cattle and risks for the use
of certain pharmaceuticals.<p>


     The inquiry before a joint session of the European Parliament's
committees on public health and agriculture took evidence over two days
from world experts.<p>

     Inquiry chairman Ken Collins, who heads the EP's all-party public
health committee, set out an EU action plan including the creation of an
independent EU food agency, a cattle registration system -- linked to a
culling programme -- and research on human health questions such as
Alzheimer's Disease and CJD.<p>

     He said:  'Everyone agrees that there is an urgent need for greater
information and that the information has to be brought into the public
domain. <p>

     'The most crucial information we need to know centres around three
questions.  First, how soon can a tried and tested live test be
developed?  Next, how long can the agent of the disease exist for
independently and could it contaminate groundwater?  And are by-products
such as animal cells safe to use or not?'<p>

     EU research funds would have to be increased to answer questions
such as whether or not the disease can ever be eradicated.<p>

     Mr Collins (Lab., Strathclyde East) highlighted the decline in
consumer confidence in food.  'There has been a long-term decline in
confidence in foodstuffs as successive food scares have dented consumer
trust.  From growth-promoting hormones in meat to salmonella in eggs and
poultry and high levels of residual pesticide in fruit and vegetables,
it is not surprising that consumer confidence in food production is
declining.'<p>

     Oxford University Professor of Zoology Roy Anderson told the hearing
of three possible causes of new cases of mad cow disease since the
British Government introduced a ban on contaminated animal feed.<p>

     These were that the ban was ineffective, that the disease was passed
on from cow to calf or that pastures were contaminated.  Said Mr Collins: 
'On the basis of the evidence we have heard, the second and third
possibilities are unlikely.'<p>

    Criticising delays in resolving the mad cow question, Mr Collins
said:  'Public health protection and consumer protection are not
political problems to b e resolved with a slogan and a photocall.'  He
added:  'We should devise a food production scheme that will result in
wholesome food, healthy animals and production methods that do not turn
our stomachs.'</blockquote><HR>

<H3><CENTER>Ag Minister to be <A NAME="Sacked">Sacked</A></CENTER></H3>
 

<BLOCKQUOTE>BY PHILIP WEBSTER AND ANDREW PIERCE

<BR>The Times: Britain:June 24 1996<P>

JOHN MAJOR will tell MPs today that the European Union ban on British beef exports across the world should be lifted completely "within months".

He will also say that separate parts of the embargo, including that on prime beef from grass-fed herds with no history of BSE and young calves, should be raised as early as the autumn. He will say that he wants the ban to countries outside the EU, including South Africa, to be lifted sooner.

<P>

The Prime Minister's high- risk decision to put estimates for the first time on the removal of the ban, comes despite the absence of a timescale in the peace deal that ended the beef war at the Florence summit. The move comes as Cabinet ministers are increasing the pressure on John Major to sack or move Douglas Hogg from his post of Agriculture Minister. At least five ministers, including Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the party chairman, and Roger Freeman, Public Service Minister, are leading the opposition to Mr Hogg.

<P>

 They have expressed their views to Alastair Goodlad, the Chief Whip, and the Prime Minister is aware of the disquiet. A reshuffle of middle-ranking ministers will be held next month. Mr Major has made clear he has no intention of changing his Cabinet.

<P>

His Commons statement will be welcomed by Conservative MPs who have been under pressure from farmers to give them hope of an early lifting of the ban. It is also designed to counter Labour claims that the embargo will still be in force at the time of the election.

<P>

The Prime Minister is also preparing for another con frontation with Europe by opposing any further moves towards integration. He has decided to use the EU's decision to hold two summits rather than one during the Irish presidency, which begins next month, to set out a sceptical platform highlighting the differences with Labour.

<P>

Mr Major is expected to say that he will not allow progress in the inter-governmental conference (IGC) unless it shows it is prepared to take action to prevent the use of health and safety rules to impose the social chapter on Britain by 

the back door. He claims that the directive imposing a 48-hour week on Britain, on which the European Court is shortly to rule, is being foisted on this country through improper use of the rules. The Prime Minister's advisers have welcomed Dublin's desire to stage a special summit to give impetus to the IGC in the middle of October after the Tory conference. Mr Major is pushing for a draft IGC treaty to be available at the second Dublin summit in December.

<P>

Mr Major intends to maintain and perhaps harden the tough line he has already taken in the White Paper preparing for the IGC. He will refuse to accept any prospect of extending the use of the veto or the powers of the European Parliament. He is to press for the principle of subsidiarity, taking decisions at the lowest possible level into the EU treaties, and he wants to reform the common fisheries policy. He will also block any plans to integrate European, foreign and home affairs policies.

<P>

Speculation over the future of Mr Hogg was fuelled yesterday by his withdrawal, at one hour's notice, from an interview on the BBC <I>World at One.</I> A BBC radio car arrived at the minister's London home to take him to the studio at midday, but it was turned away by his wife, Baroness Hogg, the former head of the Downing Street policy unit. According to BBC sources, Lady Hogg explained that Downing Street had intervened and asked Mr Hogg not to go ahead with the interview.

<P>

Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, was giving a live interview on BBC1 television about the end of the beef war 30 minutes earlier. He was asked twice on the programme, <I>On the Record</I>, whether he had full confidence in Mr Hogg, but declined to answer.

<P>

A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture said: "Mr Hogg withdrew because Malcolm Rifkind went to the summit and is regarded as the spokesman on the issue." But it was David Davis, the Foreign Office Minister whose reported threat to resign from the Government was linked to the performance of Douglas Hogg, who had been scheduled to take part in the radio programme. He dropped out only when Mr Hogg agreed to take part on Saturday night.
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Ceasefire">Ceasefire</A> in beef war leaves EU's battle lines unchanged </CENTER></H3>
THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... June 24 1996 ... GEORGE BROCK<P>


AS THE smoke drifted from the last battlefield of the brief beef war, I remembered Winston Churchill's description of watching Ireland's endless conflict emerge from the cataclysm of a world war which had destroyed the rest of the Continent's way of life.

<P>

"The dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone" appeared again, Churchill said, and the integrity of their quarrel was quite unaltered. And so with the nations of the European Union: the integrity of their struggle about the distribution of power between the states and Brussels is unscathed. John Major may not have won much; but in the rest of Europe he has not lost all that much either. The battle lines over "Maastricht II" and the single currency are drawn just where they were. No continental politician could credibly claim that the British work-to-rule in Brussels revealed to them for the first time that Mr Major can be difficult. Ah, say the savants, but there has been a "hardening" of the mood against Britain. In my experience of a dozen EU summits, no journalist ever had difficulty finding an under-employed prime minister to claim that Britain is going to pay a terrible price down the road for its outrageous obduracy.

<P>

"Things like this will be remembered," hissed Goran Persson, the Swedish Prime Minister. Don't forget that since the Swedes are suspected of being infected by British doubts, Mr Persson has to work extra hard to disown Mr Major. We need to find a way of decommissioning the odious national veto, said Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium. Mr Dehaene, let us not forget, was the loser two years ago when Mr Major blocked his nomination to succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the European Commission. Mr Dehaene uttered the same, vague "never again" threats then.

<P>

There is no doubt that both Mr Major and Britain have lost sympathy &#173; and thus the benefit of the doubt in a tight corner &#173; over the past six years. But that is the result of three underlying causes. Mr Major's party is split on the single currency, his ministers made plain that they hoped another country would sabotage the Maastricht treaty because they did not want to be caught doing so and because Britain will not start bargaining over amending the Maastricht treaty.

<P>

Mr Major's European partners think that his "serial vetoes" are merely a symptom of these structural weaknesses. They live in hope that Tony Blair will not suffer from the same defects. Moans about unilateral British obstruction over beef will fade because the moaners have no practical solution. If majority voting is extended to new fields next year, it is clear that most existing national vetoes will stay.

<P>

Even the EU, which has staged a fair number of ludicrous pantomimes in its time, would blench at the idea of turning some future summit into a kangaroo court to put a national government on trial for deviant behaviour.

<P>

Attempts to audit the profit and loss to British interests and influence in the beef war quickly vanish into arcane speculations. Wandering into the Piazza della Signoria in Florence at the weekend I came upon a sight which you do not see in Britain: a procession in favour of a federal Europe.

<P>

Policemen from Palermo and postmen from Pistoia marched to the amplified sound of Beethoven. One sign-writer had made a brave attempt to link federalism and everyday worries: "Division=unemployment" said his placard.

<P>

Only a few hours before Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, had been saying the opposite. Herr Kohl had been slapping down ideas that governments should dip into their pockets for European Commission job creation schemes and insisting that public spending was the business of national governments.

<P>

"Serial vetoes" are less of a problem than the embarrassingly evident fact that the EU keeps holding serial summits which promise to do something about unemployment but fail to deliver any jobs.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>'<A NAME="Clapped-out">Clapped-out</A> old milker' finds few friends in his hour of need </CENTER></H3>

The Times: Britain:June 25 1996<P>


 For an appalling moment in the Commons yesterday, as Michael Jopling questioned the Prime Minister on the beef agreement at Florence, the nightmare seemed to be spinning out of control. Mr Jopling, a former Conservative Agriculture Minister, asked about "the ultimate solution" for the British herd. Happily, we had mistaken his meaning.

<P>

The fate of poor Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, seemed even more uncertain. We say "poor" advisedly, for this is the word politicians use of other politicians whose life-support machines they have decided to cut off. The affection the word might imply if you or I used it is absent. To say "poor Mr Hogg" at Westminster is the equivalent of staring at your shoes and emitting a low whistle at the sound of the name.

<P>

Question 1 to the Deputy Prime Minister brought Labour's Don Foster to his feet within minutes of kick-off. Foster dared Mr Heseltine to express confidence in Hogg, whom he called a "clapped-out old milker". Heseltine rode less than magnificently to his chum's defence, simply insisting, in tones of mild reproach, that everyone in the Cabinet was friends.

<P>

Minutes later, Simon Hughes (Lib Dem, Southwark &amp; Bermondsey) told MPs that Mr Hogg was "in a huge hole". Tony Blair rose to allege that ministers were "hanging the poor Agriculture Minister out to dry, to get him to resign".

<P>

"Where is he? Where is he?" Labour backbenchers shouted. In fact, Mr Hogg was said to be in Luxembourg, at a meeting. The clapped-out old milker, hung out to dry, in a huge hole, in the Grand Duchy, must present quite a spectacle to the normally sedate Luxembourgeois. If people carry on demanding the Agriculture Minister's dis missal like this for much longer, poor Mr Hogg may survive, for John Major is one of those boys who <I>won't</I> be told.

<P>

There being little of note going on, Monday was a day for violent language, extravagant metaphor and personal remarks. Labour's Win Griffiths (Bridgend) accused Michael Heseltine of having once "baled out of the Army to fight a by-election". Nobody raised an eyebrow. Politics must be different in Wales, whose MPs seem to resort to impugning each other's honour almost before breakfast and the instant Prayers are over.

<P>

Sir Wyn Roberts (C, Conwy) accused Labour of shaping up to become "dictators at home and appeasers abroad". Peter Pike (Lab, Burnley) prophesied "the slaughter of the Agriculture Minister". David Howell (C, Guildford) declared he detected "the whiff of sour grapes" among Labour.


The Liberal Democrat leader compared John Major to Chamberlain, then accused him of "a puerile policy of posturing."

<P>

Paddy Ashdown has learnt about alliteration. On Thursday it will be all the Qs and Major will stand accused of joining a querulous quartet of Quislings. Mr Major, who is more prosaic, said Ashdown knew all about posturing. He told Tony Blair that when in London he didn't have the guts to oppose Tory tactics, and when in Bonn he didn't have the guts to support them. Sir Teddy Taylor (C, Southend E) called Blair Herr Kohl's lackey.

<P>

Blair told Major he was ("I may say") "utterly incompetent". "I may say" is Mr Blair's new buzz-phrase. Douglas Hurd called Mr Blair a confused mischief-maker.


It was, in short, another Monday. Nobody was hurt. Nothing happened. Nothing was said.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Major <A NAME="resists">resists</A> call to sacrifice Hogg over beef crisis </CENTER></H3>

The Times: Britain:June 25 1996 ...PHILIP WEBSTER<P>

 JOHN MAJOR said yesterday that Britain would have fulfilled the European Union's conditions for lifting most of the beef ban by November, as he resisted mounting Cabinet pressure for the sacking of Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister.

<P>

The Prime Minister won backing from Conservative MPs for the peace deal secured at Florence after telling them that the bans on meat from certified herds and young calves could be lifted as early as October and that on all animals aged under 30 months by the following month, opening the way for the resumption of exports worth &#163;530 million a year.

<P>

The only remaining prohibition would be on the export of meat from cattle older than 30 months, the sale of which is also banned in Britain. Mr Major put the cost of the crisis over the next three years at &#163;2 billion. The figure is understood to include all compensa-tion and eradication measures.

<P>

His estimates of the time it would take Britain to fulfil the conditions required by Brussels to lift parts of the ban were met with scepticism by Labour. Conservative MPs, who also cast doubts upon whether Europe would act as swiftly as Mr Major hoped, were nevertheless pleased that they had been given a broad timescale to sell to their farmers and constituents. Mr Major defended the Government's non-cooperation policy, which ended at the Florence summit on Friday, as a "decisive factor" in the deal.

<P>

But with the future of Mr Hogg again under question after the disclosure that several Cabinet ministers were urging his dismissal, Mr Major let it be known that he was in no hurry to give in to calls for his head. Even so, ministers including Brian Mawhinney, the party chairman, are strongly in favour of Mr Hogg being moved from his job.

<P>

Mr Major is also said by colleagues to be irritated at attempts by some ministers to undermine the position of Gillian Shephard, the Education and Employment Secretary, by suggesting that she is at odds with the Prime Minister. Sources close to both Mrs Shephard and Mr Major denied yesterday that there had been a rift over the plans for expanding the number of grammar schools, to be unveiled today.

<P>

Roger Freeman, the Public Service Minister, said Mr Hogg had been doing a magnificent job defending the interests of Britain's beef farmers and would continue to go on doing so. MPs will focus on Mr Hogg in a Commons debate today when the Liberal Democrats argue a motion calling for a cut in the minister's salary.

<P>

Yesterday in the Commons Tony Blair said the Government had failed to intervene properly when the crisis flared, failed to compensate and inform farmers, failed to announce the link with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with any proper consultation, and failed to get the ban lifted. "And the truth is whatever fig-leaf you have today, the damage will be with this country for many years to come."

<P>

Mr Major admitted that the targets he had set were ambitious, "but it is now up to us and the farming and ancillary industries to ensure we meet them".


Tory Euro-sceptics gave Mr Major broad support. The strongest attack came from George Walden, the former minister, who declared: "We have lost prestige, we have lost money and we have lost umpteen thousand more cows. If we feel big after that, we must have been feeling rather small before."

<P>

But John Townend, MP for Bridlington, and chairman of the right-wing 92 Group of Tory MPs, urged Mr Major to use the non-cooperation tactics again if British interests were at risk.

<H3><CENTER> Britain Freezes <A NAME="Diplomatic">Diplomatic</A> Relations over Beef Ban</CENTER></H3>

<FONT SIZE=-2>REPORTS BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT</FONT><BR>

The Times: Britain: 22 May 1996<P>

A MEETING between John Major and Kenneth Clarke, the Cabinet's leading pro-European, at 1 1am yesterday was crucial to the Prime Minister's dramatic announcement four hours later that Britain was effectively freezing relations with the European Union.

<P>

Cabinet ministers had been aware for about three weeks that the policy of non-co-operation was the one most likely to be adopted if the Government's hopes of a breakthrough were not realised.

<P>

A study by Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, which was completed last week, concluded that all the other measures being canvassed by Tory Euro-sceptics &#173; including retaliatory trade bans, withholding Britain's payments to the EU, or even going for de Gaulle's "empty chair" policy of not turning up to meetings &#173; would either be illegal or counter-productive.

<P>

Neither was there great enthusiasm for the policy announced yesterday of blocking progress on all business. According to Whitehall sources, the full Cabinet discussed the options on several occasions. But the decision to go for broke yesterday was the Prime Minister's. He told colleagues: "Enough is enough."

<P>

With Conservative MPs baying for action, he was well aware that the failure of veterinary experts to lift even partially the ban on beef on Monday night would be seen as yet another kick in the teeth. According to a friend: "He knew that Douglas Hogg (the Agriculture Minister) would be torn limb from limb if he merely told us that it was unfortunate but that he was still trying and that, yes, the ban would soon be lifted." So at 8am yesterday he had a "conference" telephone call with Mr Hogg, who was in Brussels preparing for another farm ministers' meeting, and Mr Rifkind, who was in Strasbourg. It was agreed to go ahead with a plan that would almost certainly never have been unwrapped had the veterinary experts come to a different decision.

<P>

It was, according to sources close to Mr Major, a decision taken "more in sorrow than anger". But he was also said to be genuinely upset at the way Britain had been treated. "He felt that a lot of people were letting him down &#173; saying one thing, doing another." He told one friend: "I have been through merry hell to keep this Europe show on the road. I have shown good faith to them. They have done nothing to help me."

<P>

He was particularly irritated at the behaviour of Spain, Portugal and The Netherlands, who had indicated that they would support a lifting of the ban but changed their minds at the last moment. He told another friend: "Britain is being pushed around and I am not having the country treated like this. We are a big player."

<P>

The Prime Minister first had to confirm that Mr Clarke was on side. He had every reason to believe that he would be. The Chancellor apparently accepted during extensive correspondence that such action might eventually have to be taken.

<P>

But Mr Major had to be sure. He would not have been able to announce the plan for a single currency referendum early in April without Mr Clarke's backing. Throughout the beef dispute Mr Clarke, along with Michael Heseltine, the Cabinet's other big Euro enthusiast, have been constantly arguing for negotiation rather than retaliation.

<P>

However, according to his friends, Mr Clarke did not put up a fight yesterday. He accepted that the diplomatic avenues had been exhausted. The attraction of the blocking option was that it was not illegal, said friends. "The Chancellor would not have backed any action that was illegal," a source said. "He accepted, with regret, that this was the only course open."

<P>

After Mr Clarke was firmly on board, Mr Major then made sure that everyone else in the Cabinet knew what he was doing. Mr Rifkind arrived at Heathrow at 12.30pm and the two spoke again on the telephone. The Foreign Secretary then went to Downing Street for another chat with the Prime Minister. Mr Heseltine was informed in China. All other Cabinet ministers were informed.

<P>

By last night it was clear that Mr Major's move has changed the mood among Tory MPs. One said: "Whether it gets the ban lifted or not, I don't know, but at last we're doing something."


<HR><H3><CENTER><A NAME="Europe">Europe</A> says move unhelpful</CENTER></H3>

 THE European Commission voiced dismay yesterday over Britain's threat to obstruct EU business and suggested that it would only complicate its attempts to persuade member states to start lifting the ban on beef products.

<P>

Officials said that talk of British retaliation was likely only to harden attitudes in Germany and the other six member states which on Monday blocked moves to ease the ban on beef products. "Perhaps John Major wants to crank up the pressure, but there's a danger he will upset the progress we are already making," an official said.

<P>

In a formal reaction, the Commission said that the beef problem affected all member states, not just Britain. "It is therefore a problem for the whole of the European Union and a solution can only be achieved through the proper functioning of the Union's institutions and procedures which is in all member states' interests to safeguard."

<P>

The Commission is expected today to endorse a fresh attempt to win over reluctant states at a farm ministers' meeting on June 3 in favour of a partial lifting of the ban. But there was no support for agreeing a timetable for lifting the overall quarantine on British beef.

<P>

Franz Fischler, the Agruculture Commissioner, who is leading the drive to ease the ban, said: "The Commission is doing everything in its power to try to convince the member states that our approach is the correct one." It was vital, however, for Britain to help to win back consumer confidence by being seen to comply with its commitments on eradicating BSE. Herr Fischler said that veterinary officials had come close on Monday to approving the by-products measure by the requisite weighted majority. "We almost had a qualified majority yesterday. It was very much on a knife-edge."

<P>

The strength of Mr Major's ultimatum sparked some alarm in the EU's institutions. No state since Charles de Gaulle's France in 1965 has undertaken a policy of total obstruction.

<P>

Greece, Spain, Italy and other states have all adopted blocking tactics to win concessions on single issues in recent years but not on the broad scale suggested by Mr Major. Even Margaret Thatcher's dogged and eventually successful campaign in the 1980s to win a rebate on Britain's budget contribution stopped short of obstructing business.

<P>

Greece has most often adopted the limited blocking tactic, notably over EU relations with Turkey. Italy refused to allow through the 1994 budget until it won higher milk quotas. Spain threatened to hold up the admission of new members two years ago until it won access for its vessels to the "Irish box" fishing zone.

<P>

The need for unanimous voting means Britain would have the power to block decisions on foreign policy, justice, immigration and asylum. On that front, the next target could be work on a common stand on racism and xenophobia early next month. Unanimous voting is also required to approve changes in taxation, in senior EU appointments and the allocation of state aid as well as the shifting of funds within the budget and research spending. A victim of this could be the plan by Jacques Santer, the EU President, to move excess funds in the farm budget to pay for job-creating investment in transport.

<P>

Diplomats from other states were incredulous that Britain could resort to such a policy over a crisis that is widely seen to be self-inflicted. As farm ministers left Brussels, several criticised Britain for continuing to fail to take the measures needed to begin restoring public confidence. "It's important that they don't just promise measures, but they also apply them," said Wilhelm Molterer, the Austrian minister.

<P>

While the Germans remained adamant that it was far too early to consider lifting any of the ban, Philippe Vasseur, the French minister, said France wanted to avoid alienating Britain further. Ivan Yates, the Irish minister, said: "It would be totally destructive of Britain to respond to last night's vote with recriminations."
<HR>




<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Against">Against</A> the Herd </CENTER></H3>

The barricades have risen. John Major's decision to >obstruct any progress in the European Union until the removal of the ban on British beef matches the growing exasperation of his party both in and out of Parliament. The audacity of the announcement reflects also the exhaustion of all other optionsThe Prime Minister has reasserted his command for the moment. He has also taken a great gamble. If, as before, strong words precede surrender then the consequences for his authority will be as before as well. But success could see the Tories recovering their reputation for resolution.

<P>

Since Stephen Dorrell's first, ill-fated, announcement of a possible link between BSE and a new strain of CJD two months ago the Government has been struggling to gain some kind of control over events. Maladroit ministers failed to take a consistent, coherent and confidence-building line. Europe's ban reflected the concerns of consumers in Britain and beyond.

<P>

Slowly, however, a sense of perspective has been restored. Domestic beef consumption has started to rise again. The EU Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, said there was insufficient scientific evidence to merit a ban on beef products. A majority of the Union's members voted on Monday to lift the ban on tallow, gelatine and semen. But a blocking minority of seven nations, led by Germany, insisted the ban should stay. All the attempts by the hapless Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, to bargain with Britain's EU partners were set at naught.

<P>

With quiet words in chancelleries having achieved so little, the Prime Minister was under pressure from his party to take Clausewitz's advice and continue diplomacy by other means. By choosing confrontation the Prime Minister has, for the moment, united the vast majority of his party. Even pro-integrationists feel the hot breath of angry rural voters on their necks. Whatever the rights or wrongs about beef and BSE the episode has encapsulated this Government's tendency to be driven by events beyond its control. By taking this stand the Prime Minister has a chance to use political alchemy to turn the vexed issue of beef into the clear question of who is John Bull.

<P>

Already he seems to have stolen a march on Labour. Tony Blair's response in the House was reasonable in its content but in contrast with Mr Major's command, he seemed a nit-picking lawyer. When he accused Mr Major of using strong words not backed by the necessary detail, he was throwing stones from a glass house.

<P>

When the Prime Minister carries the fight to Brussels there is a risk that he will be bogged down in the Flanders mud. A policy of non-cooperation risks alienating those allies on other European issues which Britain has sought to win. It could prevent progress on expediting business where Britain has something to gain. It will create a resentment that will, whatever this episode's conclusion, take some time to heal.

<P>

But, beyond all that, if carried through with confidence, a policy of non-cooperation will demonstrate that Britain is determined to fight hard to safeguard its national interests. When General de Gaulle risked the wrath of his allies by holding up the development of the infant European Community to secure France's national interests, he guaranteed that his country's words would carry extra weight for years to come. Britain's budget rebate was not won until Margaret Thatcher swung her handbag.

<P>

If Mr Major's gamble is to succeed then it should mark a new departure in British policy. A tenacious campaign of the kind outlined last week by the Home Secretary to see powers returned from Brussels to Britain must be pursued. The diplomatic strategy may also lead to a greater, political, gamble. By making Britain's relations with Europe the central political issue over the next few months, the Government could build on increasing disposable incomes, the threat from taxation and the recently, but vividly, established impression of divisions among the Labour leadership to rally the Conservative voters who delivered victory in the last four elections. They were won by boldness in the past. After drift and uncertainty they may yet be won by boldness again.


 
<H3><CENTER>German <A NAME="vote">vote</A> blocks bid to ease beef ban</CENTER></H3>


BY CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS AND ARTHUR LEATHLEY

<P>
May 21, 1996 ... The Times: Britain<P>

BRITAIN suffered an overwhelming defeat last night in its latest efforts to persuade its European partners to ease the embargo on beef exports &#173; and it may now be next year before the meat ban is lifted .

<P>

After a day of wrangling, veterinary officials from Germany, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Luxembourg thwarted a European Commission move to end the embargo on gelatin, tallow and bull semen. France and the other six countries backed Britain but under the weighted voting system, the German group's 39 votes far exceeded the 26 needed to block any change of policy.

<P>

Last night the Government insisted that it would fight on for the lifting of an "unjust ban" and Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, will voice British indignation at a meeting of farm ministers in Brussels today. But under EU rules, no new proposal can be put to their council until the Commission formally decides on its next step, probably tomorrow.

<P>

Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, put a brave face on the defeat, saying the meeting had made progress. "Not long ago it was one against 14. Now a certain number of countries are with us," he said. "It has been a long hard battle. This will be a battle of attrition and things will take a long time." It would probably take some days at least before a new proposal could be brought forward.

<P>

Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, reacted with anger to the decision to keep the full ban in force. He said: "My reaction to the news is disappointment tinged with anger. "Scientists examined the situation and the overwhelming evidence is for lifting the ban but it still seems to be a political decision. There is nothing constructive coming from other ministers or vets, they are just saying no."

<P>

The strong resistance to lifting what amounts to a relatively minor aspect of the overall beef ban bodes ill for any British hopes of real progress in the near future. Continental officials believe it could be months, if not until well into next year, before the meat ban is lifted.

<P>

Mr Hogg had been hoping to spend today arguing for a next step in the gradual easing of the ban, but instead he will be trying again to persuade his European colleagues that the decision to double the number of cattle most at risk of "mad cow" disease to be slaughtered should at least bring some respite for the by-products.

<P>

The blocking vote also amounted to a blow for Franz Fischler, the Austrian EU Agriculture Commissioner, who is firmly on the British side. He ran headlong into the Germans and Austrians who said there was still far too much uncertainty over BSE and, in particular, over Britain's handling of the disease. German and Spanish officials were outspoken in their criticism of what they said was Britain's failure to undertake an acceptable programme of eradication. Officials said the latest proposal for slaughtering 80,000 cattle was still far short of what was needed.

<P>

British officials noted that Belgium and The Netherlands had indicated agreement with lifting the ban on gelatin and tallow, but opposed exempting bull semen. Those who argued to keep the ban on all three products focused not so much on the technical mattters such as processing conditions, as on alleged shortcomings in Britain's overall strategy towards BSE. Continental officials complained that a decade after the epidemic was identified, Britain still seemed to be reluctant to take the radical measures needed to eradicate the disease.

<P>

Britain contended, however, that the nature of the disease and its dwindling levels made it pointless to adopt the mass slaughter advocated by Germany That would lead to the destruction of millions of cattle without necessarily speeding the disappearance of the disease.

<P>

Ministers will now have to prepare for a wave of criticism from Euro-sceptics demanding retaliation. Graham Riddick, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley, said: "Playing the game like English gentlemen has failed. It is time we took the gloves off. It is an appalling state of affairs and humiliating to see British ministers and officials going cap in hand to Brussels."

<P>

And Sir Teddy Taylor said: "This is an insult to Britain after all the efforts that have been made. It only proves that we are totally powerless to tell Europe what to do. After we have spent &#163;5 billion and sentenced thousands of cattle to their death, Brussels is not even prepared to make one minor change."

<A NAME="Monks">Monks</A> break habit of a
                            lifetime</CENTER></H3>
   BY HARVEY ELLIOTT <P>


     THE twin modern scourges of oil pollution and "mad cow" disease have
     persuaded 16 Cistercian monks to break their silence and make a television
     appeal for tourists to visit their island home and save it from economic
     disaster. 

     To meet the costs of running their monastery on the tiny island of
Caldy off   the Welsh coast, the monks need an income of about 300,000 a year. <P>
     Until now, most of the money has come from the 1,500 tourists who make
     the three-mile boat journey to the monastery each day and buy the monks'
     farm produce and perfume. But when the Sea Empress ran aground in
     February and spilt its cargo of thick crude oil across the beaches and
coves
     used by summer visitors, the tiny island suffered an immediate and near
     catastrophic decline. <P>


     The monks' almost unending prayers appeared to go unanswered and after
     an anguished appraisal of their problems, it seemed that the only way to
     balance the books was to sell some of their herd of 100 prize cattle.
     But, even as they drew up their plans, the BSE scare rendered the stock
     almost worthless. <P>


     So Brother Robert, Abbot of Caldy, turned to the modern "pulpit" of
     television and with the help of an accountant, the monks prepared
     advertisements. The abbot said: "We are not really publicity people. We do
     not speak at all for the first four hours of the day. However, we have
to live
     in the modern world." 

     The monks watch only two hours of television a week, on Sunday
     afternoons. But the abbot said: "We may make an exception for our advert."

<H3>German <A NAME="tabloids">tabloids</A>: Major  sowing the
                       seeds of hatred </H3>
<FONT SIZE=-2>FROM ROGER BOYES IN BERLIN</FONT><P>
                     

  GERMANY'S tabloids fired a new salvo in the press war with Britain
     yesterday, accusing John Major of sowing the seeds of hatred. The attack,
     which was unusually personal, follows a week of grumbling and howling
     protest, most of it aimed at The Sun. 

     Munich's Abend Zeitung was the latest to join the counter-offensive, making
     the obligatory shocked reference to The Sun's 20-point list of ways to
     irritate Germans and other continental Europeans. <P>


     "We Germans have come at just the right moment for the English. First we
     boycott British beef and now we want to grab the European championship
      on their very own island!" the newspaper said. 

     The criticism was rare in that it singled out the Prime Minister for
blame 
     "head of government Major has secretly sown the hatred". The German
     press usually gives kinder treatment to the Prime Minister than to his
     predecessor; but the Abend Zeitung editorial may signal a sea-change. The
     tabloids have already started to be enthusiastic about Tony Blair.<P>

     Yesterday, however, the hero was the Bayern Munich striker Jrgen
     Klinsmann, who has apparently agreed to tuck into British beef to
     improve Anglo-German relations. "Klinsi is Germany's best ambassador on
     the island," the paper said. <P>

     Serious papers are also talking in martial metaphor. "Major is losing the
     beef war on the home front," trumpeted the Bonn General Anzeiger,
     referring to the public doubts of George Walden. The Sddeutsche Zeitung
     tried to switch the idiom towards the game of poker. "Major's
declaration of
     war is emerging as a flop  he was wrong to think that moderate
     Conservative MPs would remain loyal. The anti-Europe cause was not a
     trump card. Indeed George Walden could call the bluff." <P>

     There was thus a clear division between mass-market German papers which
     thought Klinsmann could rescue Anglo-German relations and those who
     favoured George Walden. The venerable Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
     called on Britain to show more consistency and refresh its memory. <P>

     "The United States has not imported British beef since 1989 because of 
      BSE but nothing has been heard about 'obstructing' the Nato Council
     and there has been no sign of indignation in Washington. Could this be
     because only anger against the favourite enemy  Europe  promises
     improved popularity?" Politicians lined up to express their regret at the
     British campaign. Karl Lamers, the Christian Democrat foreign affairs
     expert, told Focus magazine: "The British are making a big mistake;
they are
     confusing Germany with Europe." British threats, he said, were unrealistic.
     Britain would not let things come to a test of strength, which it would
lose. <HR>


<H3><CENTER>BSE crisis could last <A NAME="six">six</A> years </CENTER></H3>

               <FONT SIZE=-2>  BY PHILIP WEBSTER AND MICHAEL DYNES</FONT> ... 28 May 96 London Times<P>


     BRITAIN stepped up its "beef war" with Europe yesterday, using the
     national veto 12 times to scupper measures that would normally have sailed
     through. 

     But as ministers blocked everything that came before them in Brussels, the
     man in charge of the Cabinet response admitted that it could be six years
     before all Britain's cattle were free of "mad cow" disease. <P>

     Roger Freeman was later forced to issue a statement insisting that he
had not
     meant to suggest that the beef export ban could last six years, but his
     remarks added to the confusion over the Government's policy and how long
     it would be enforced. 

     At the same time, a former minister renewed his warning that he would wipe
     out the Government's Commons majority if John Major turned the beef
     campaign into a wider battle against Europe. <P>

   
     Robin Cook, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, also urged ministers to avoid
     "the language of xenophobia and jingoism" over beef, but he
     nevertheless cautiously threw Labour's support behind the policy of
     non-cooperation. Ministers, however, rebuffed his demand to be consulted. 

     In his Times article, Mr Walden accuses Mr Major of "demeaning" the
     country and says the Government's unseemly stance will rebound on a Prime
     Minister "who felt weak enough to succumb to his own pique and to
     petty-nationalistic pressures". <P>

     The sense of uncertainty over how far the EU would be expected to bend
     remained yesterday, however, when Mr Freeman told BBC Radio that while
     the Government was not "setting deadlines", it did want a "timescale for
     implementation in the framework agreement that it is seeking". 

     Mr Freeman  one of three ministers on obstruction duty in Brussels  had
     earlier said that the policy was not "anti-German, anti-French,
anti-Italian or
     anti-European. We are saying there is a crisis in the British beef
     industry." <P>


     Asked how long that could take, he said: "It won't happen in the short
term.
     It certainly is not months. Because of the gestation period, it could
take four,
     five, six years. It may not be possible to say when the UK will be wholly
     BSE-free." <P>

     He accepted that some countries may refuse to take British beef "until
     the last BSE cow has been killed". But while it might not be practical
     to persuade every country in the world to take British beef as early as
     some others, the EU was preventing Britain trading anywhere at all.

London Times: 28 May 1996<BR>


         <FONT SIZE=-1> FROM CHARLES BREMNER AND MICHAEL DYNES IN BRUSSELS</FONT> <P>


     BRITAIN'S attempt to punish its European partners for their refusal to ease
     the beef crisis shifts into top gear this week with a series of moves aimed
     at disrupting the day-to-day affairs of the European Union. <P>


     Initiatives designed to limit the spread of Aids, assist refugees in
Asia and
     Latin America, protect the environment and boost the efficiency of the
single
     market are expected to run into the sand today as Britain drives home its
     policy of non-cooperation. <P>


     Later, Britain will have to decide whether to thwart longstanding
attempts by
     finance ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, to implement measures against EU
     budget fraud. Under BSE "war rules", should Kenneth Clarke, the
     Chancellor, veto a regulation giving EU inspectors powers to carry out
     cross-frontier checks in member states on anyone suspected of dishonest
     use of EU funds? As a leader in the fight against multibillion-pound fraud,
     Britain has been keen to promote the measure that would allow Brussels
     officials to enter premises unannounced, accompanied by local police. <P>


     British officials were uncertain yesterday whether Mr Clarke would be
     obliged to block the measure, which will be reviewed by finance ministers
     next month as farm ministers thrash out the "mad cow" ban in an adjacent
     room. "Britain has been rather eager for these inspections," an
official said.
     "A veto will show just how silly this campaign is." <P>



     Baroness Chalker of Wallasey, the Minister for Overseas Development, is
     expected today to halt EU programmes to combat Aids in the Third World,
     assist Asian and Latin American refugees and protect the environment. At
     the same time, Roger Freeman, the Public Service Minister, will be
attending
     a Brussels ministerial council at which he is expected to resist a
decision on
     measures aimed at streamlining the single market, another area favoured by
     Britain. <P>


     While EU officials have been working on ways to limit the damage from the
     British offensive, London has launched a counter-offensive against the
     publicity that BSE and its blocking campaign have earnt in the
     continental media. In newspaper articles published in several countries, Mr
     Rifkind explained that Britain wanted a "mature, level-headed approach to
     dealing with the beef issue, not one based on misplaced hysteria". The
     Brussels daily Le Soir published his article alongside an editorial
denouncing
     Britain's campaign as counterproductive and potentially dangerous. <HR>

                      POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT<P>
 
     CABINET confusion over the beef crisis became apparent yesterday as
     ministers sent out conflicting signals on how to force an end to the export
     ban. 

     The Government moved swiftly to "correct" a suggestion by Malcolm
     Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, that Britain would press for a precise
     timetable for the lifting of a ban before ending its campaign of
     non-cooperation with Europe. <P>


     Less than 24 hours after Mr Rifkind floated the idea of a timetable, the
     suggestion was ruled out by Roger Freeman, the minister co-ordinating
     Britain's campaign of non-cooperation. He said: "We have said we want a
     framework. We don't want a detailed timetable that inevit ably by a certain
     date certain things must happen." 

     Mr Rifkind said at the weekend that Britain was campaigning for "an agreed
     strategy which will provide for the lifting of the rest of the ban and the
     questions of timetable obviously will be part of these discussions". <P>


     Although senior Tories dismissed suggestions of a rift, the difference
     between the ministers was seized upon by John Redwood, the former
     Cabinet minister, who led Euro-sceptic demands for an agreed timetable
     before Britain ended non-cooperation. <P>


     Mr Redwood, visiting farmers in Somerset, said: "Farmers and people in the
     meat business would expect a timetable for the remaining threat to
their jobs
     and businesses to be lifted before the Government resumes normal
     co-operation with Europe."

Copyright  1996 The Associated Press 

BRUSSELS, Belgium (May 28, 1996 1:17 p.m. EDT) -- Britain blocked a dozen
decisions at a
meeting of European Union ministers Tuesday in its biggest protest yet over
the EU's global ban
on exports of British beef.

The vetoed measures included a free-trade agreement between the EU and
Mexico and a
proposal long supported by Britain to cut regulations on small businesses.<P>


The British tactics are designed to force the EU to ease the beef ban
imposed two months ago
because of fears about mad cow disease. An emergency meeting is scheduled
for next week in
Luxembourg.

"What we're trying to do is to explain clearly the urgency of the situation
and the need to make
some progress," said British Deregulation Minister Roger Freeman, a leader
in fighting the ban.<P>


"Hopefully our colleagues in Europe will concentrate their minds on the
problem," he told reporters
after blocking four decisions at a meeting on the EU's internal market.

At a separate meeting, Britain's minister for overseas development, Baroness
Linda Chalker,
vetoed eight proposals that had the backing of her 14 EU counterparts.<P>


European ministers downplayed the impact of the vetoes, stressing that
Britain supports the
substance of the proposals, which could be approved within the year.

"We made good progress with our work in preparing decisions that will be
made at a later date,"
said Italy's deputy foreign minister, Rino Serri, who chaired the
development meeting.<P>


Still, several participants criticized Britain for obstructing decisions
aimed at helping EU businesses
and development aid programs.

"I personally find it very regrettable," said Mario Monti, the commissioner
who oversees the single
EU market.<P>


Tuesday's ministerial sessions were the first since Prime Minister John
Major announced Britain
would obstruct decision-making until the EU relaxed the ban and agreed on a
clear plan to lift it
entirely.<P>


EU nations have refused to soften the beef ban despite a determination by
scientists that it was
safe to exempt three cattle products - tallow, gelatin and semen.

Both British ministers told their colleagues that Britain has already
enforced more than adequate
safeguards to eliminate any health risks from British cattle infected with
mad cow disease.<P>


Several nations led by Germany have demanded a tougher program to destroy
British cattle at risk
for the disease and restore public trust in beef before they will relax the ban.

Britain set off the beef crisis March 20 when it announced a probable link
between the cattle<P>

disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and a fatal human malady,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
The EU responded a week later by banning British beef exports.<HR>

               BY ANDREW PIERCE, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT <P>

     JOHN MAJOR'S confrontation with Europe started to backfire on him
     yesterday when a former minister threatened to wipe out the Government's
     Commons majority in protest at his "silly and cynical" approach. 

     George Walden said he was not prepared to be squeezed into a Little
     Englander straitjacket by a government riding a patriotic high horse, nor
     could he be associated with a "petty-minded nationalist party". <P>

     The Government would be at the mercy of the Ulster Unionists if the former
     Education Minister were to resign the party whip, and his remarks
reinforced
     the Conservatives' determination to be ready for an autumn general election
      even though the Prime Minister would still prefer to wait until May. 

     Conservative leftwingers' concerns about the beef "war" were
     meanwhile underlined by Jacques Santer, the European Commission
     President, who said that the British tactics would be self-defeating. <P>

     Mr Santer insisted that he would not give in to demands for a timetabled
     programme to lift the ban on beef exports and said: "I am very
     concerned about the, perhaps, anti-European atmosphere and climate in the
     UK. I am also concerned about an anti-British atmosphere between the 14
     other member states. I don't think it is very good for the UK to be

<H3><CENTER>Major stands <A NAME="firm">firm</A> over beef bust-up</CENTER></H3>
 Lancashire Evening Telegraph home page

JOHN Major is to warn troublesome Tories that he will not be blackmailed at
home or abroad
over the beef wars that have badly damaged Lancashire's meat trade. 
His fightback comes after one senior Conservative - ex-Minister George
Walden - threatened to
wipe out the Prime Minister's fragile Commons majority. <P>
And the latest twist to the crisis coincided with fears that Mad Cow Disease
might still be in the
food chain, despite all the Government's sanctions aimed at reversing the
beef ban. <P>
Meanwhile the Minister of Agriculture has promised an investigation into
so-called "private kills"
under a loophole in the current regulations.

 Simon Jenkins May 28 London Times<P>

   Yesterday a British expeditionary force crossed the Channel and established
     contact with the enemy.
     The enemy was surprised and took heavy casualties. It retreated to lick
     wounds of hilarity and amazement. The day went to our boys. Thanks
     be to God and St George. <P>

     The first engagement of the <STRONG>Great Beef War</STRONG> left a number of corpses
     on the battlefield. There will now be no further moves on Aids in the
     Third World, no help to Asian refugees and no steps to cut red tape for
     small firms. Ahead lie bolder horizons. British ministers will next fight
     efforts to curb Euro-fraud. They will veto a plan to counter drug
     dealing and improve liaison between police forces. With this salient
     secured, John Major may next commit his divisions against reforms to
     the common agricultural policy and a wider European Union.
     Europhobia is coursing his veins. The howls of the tabloids ring in his
     ears. No foreigner is safe from the thin red line of heroes when veto is
     in the air. <P>

     Never was it more true that politics is war by other means. The British
     Cabinet faces an enemy, has an objective and (we assume) has a war
     plan. The enemy is made up of the member governments of the
     European Union. <STRONG>The objective is ending the ban on British beef </STRONG>.
     The war plan is a secret, but Downing Street confirms that there is a
     war cabinet and a secretariat in place. Hostilities have been brought
     forward from next month's Florence summit. Operation Moo is under
     way. <P>

     The first threat to any plan comes not from the enemy but from
     Generals Mishandling and Hindsight. They have their uses. Back in
     March, when the BSE story broke, the Government found British
     beef instantly banned by the French, Dutch, Belgians, Portuguese
     and five German states. These bans were illegal. They were imposed by
     the relevant authorities with obvious glee, supported by farm lobbyists
     eager to wipe out competition. (This has proved counter-productive:
     even farm lobbyists can make mistakes.) Given the limited nature of
     the "provocation", the bans were a gross abuse of the collective unity
     of the common agricultural policy. <P>

     All trade bans are evil. They are usually imposed by governments to
     prove their virility to some interest group. But some may be necessary
     evils. I suggested in March a swift retaliatory ban on continental beef
      , to bloody the noses of continental producer interests and to level the
     field for subsequent court action. If other governments chose gunboat
     diplomacy to exploit Britain's tentative (and honest) scientific research
     into BSE, the best reply was more gunboat diplomacy. A British
     ban against a country in which Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is more
     prevalent than in Britain (such as Germany) would be as defen sible as
     Germany's ban against Britain. The fiasco could have gone to the
     European Court and awaited the outcome, with both sides bleeding. <P>

     Mr Major  bided his time and had to watch
     mortified as the rest of Europe marshalled its forces against him. He
     retaliated only last week, and after the failure of the veterinary
     committee to lift the ban on British beef by-products. He eventually
     declared war over tallow and semen. That beats even the strange war
     of my namesake's ear as an absurd casus belli. <P>

     European
     delegates are meant to gasp as Roger Freeman, Lynda Chalker and
     Peter Oppenheim patrol the Brussels committee rooms reading out
     their BSE message, like gay rights demonstrators at an Anglican
     synod. The foreign ministers are expected to crawl home and plead
     with their farm lobbies to see reason and welcome British beef back
     into their freezers. I am at a loss to see why they should. French and
     German beef can be sold in Britain, but their producers are
     protected from reciprocal competition. If I were a continental farmer, I
     would not give an inch. I would pour cash into my consumer groups
     and lobbyists, insisting that British beef is unsafe and always will be,
     until every British cow is a cinder and every British farm is set aside
     for rambling. <P>

     Non-cooperation may be magnificent to the chteau generals of
     Downing Street, but it is not what I call war. The engagement seems
     phoney. It smacks of Tweedledum and Tweedledee: "Let's fight till six,
     and then have dinner." Cohorts of Eurocrats must be smirking behind
     their hands. As for the war plan, its course seems indeterminate. The
     "framework" demanded by Britain of the Council of Ministers for
     ending the ban is unlikely to help British beef back onto world
     markets. Yet its compensation cost of 2.4 billion is indefensible. This
     cannot make sense. Such money would be better spent on marketing,
     when the hue and cry has died down, than on slaughter. <P>

 Hostilities in the beef war were not opened by a
     scientist setting out a conundrum. They began with a French customs
     officer ripping apart a British beef lorry without legal authority. That
     is what sent British forces into Belgium yesterday. They have gone as
     fools. They had better come back as heroes. <HR>





<CENTER><H3>Beef <A NAME="prices">prices</A> paid to ranchers at 10-year low<HR></H3></CENTER>

<P>   SIMLA, Colo. (May 11, 1996 3:41 p.m. EDT) -- As the barbecue season unfolds across America, the low-priced steaks sizzling on backyard grills are the despair of producers at the opposite end of the food chain, the nation's ranchers.<P>


   "We cut costs down to the point where isn't anything left to cut," said Glenn Benjamin, whose broad-brimmed cowboy hat failed to conceal a furrowed brow.<P>

   While his younger brother, Lee, weighed yearling heifers and steers before hauling them to summer grazing land, the rancher listed the cost-cutting measures taken at his family's 7,700-acre ranch here: no summer hired help, no tagging of calves and no conditioning shots for calves prior to shipping to feedlots this fall.<P>

   With prices paid to ranchers at a 10-year low, "prices are lower than costs of production for 95 percent of cow-calf producers," estimates Chuck Lambert, economist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a Denver-based group that represents 250,000 cattle ranchers.<P>

   Nationwide, beef sales are the largest revenue source for agriculture. Here, in the wide open spaces of America's cattle country, rock-bottom beef prices are rippling through local economies: ranchers are postponing bank payments and purchases of tractors, pickup trucks and fencing lumber.<P>

   "Bankers are starting to sweat," said Jim Taylor, a ranch real-estate broker in Billings, Mont.<P>

   In Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, drought has compounded the effect of low prices. There, farmers are selling off their herds, keeping prices low through the summer and eroding the tax base of ranching counties.<P>

   "In some rural counties, livestock taxes account for half of the taxes," said Al Schneberger, executive director of the New Mexico Cattlegrowers Association, a private group. "Herd liquidations hurt schools, roads, libraries, ambulance services."<P>

   "I've been talking to people who remember the 1930s -- the Government coming out paying $8 a head, digging a hole, and shooting the cow," said Schneberger, a rancher from Albuquerque. "I wonder if we are not so far away from that now."<P>

   Historically, beef prices have followed 10-year cycles of price dips and rises.<P>

   Overproduction, the past culprit for collapsing prices, is at work today. Beef production through the third week in April was 24 percent higher than during the same period in 1993, a recent peak price year, according to the beef association.<P>

   At the same time, Americans are grilling far fewer steaks than 20 years ago.<P>

   In 1976 annual per capita beef consumption peaked at 94.5 pounds. In the 1990s, it has stagnated at around 66 pounds. It is unclear whether Britain's mad cow disease will have any effect on the consumption of American beef.<P>

   Ranchers like to blame today's plunging beef prices on floods of cattle from Mexico and Canada, on price gouging by supermarkets and on monopolistic prices of meatpacking companies.<P>

   But last year, imports accounted for just 2.2 percent of the 104 million cattle in the nation's herds. During the first quarter of this year, imports were 19 percent below the same period of 1993.<P>

   Ranchers complain that while they face foreclosures, IBP Inc., the world's largest meatpacker, has nearly tripled its profits since 1993, reaching $256 million in 1995. Next month, a committee appointed by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is to report on the meatpacking industry, where IBP and three other companies hold 82 percent of the market.<P>

   But defenders of the meatpackers -- and they are few in barbed wire country -- note that the big four slaughterhouse companies enjoyed the same market share in 1993, when prices were at a peak. A large part of the profits, those defenders add, stem from record beef production levels, which keep processing plants operating near capacity.<P>

   As for grocery stores, retail prices have gradually bumped downward and are expected to stay low during the summer, the nation's peak beef-eating season.<P>

   In tribute to the barbecue culture, beef sales during Memorial Day weekend are 25 percent higher than daily averages during the rest of the year.<P>

   But low cattle prices are not the only cloud over the Benjamin ranch, an 80-year-old homestead in bare, mustard-colored plains 60 miles southeast of Denver.<P>

   "Feedcake went up 50 percent in six months, from $150 a ton in October to $220 a ton now," Ileta Benjamin said, as her two sons herded the balky yearlings into a weighing stall.<P>

   The nation's cattle business is the largest single user of grain, largely corn in the shape of cakes or pellets for winter feed. But last year's drought created a corn shortage, pushing corn prices up to a 20-year high this spring.<P>

   This year's corn crop is expected to bounce back to normal, swelling by 27 percent over last year's level, to 9.4 billion bushels, according to the Agriculture Department.<P>

   To ease the squeeze in an election year, President Clinton announced measures on April 30 to allow ranchers this summer to graze cattle and to cut hay on land previously set aside under a federal soil conservation program. With more grass available, ranchers would be able to reduce corn purchases.<P>

   As money from the ranch has dwindled, Lee Benjamin now earns most of its income from a job appraising farmland, and a part-time job his wife has started in Denver.<P>

   "The only way for a person to get into ranching today is to inherit it or marry it," Lee Benjamin said glumly from the dusty cab of a battered pickup.<P>

   In a business affected by dozens of variables, economists see two bright spots that may speed ranching's recovery from its cyclical trough.<P>

   This year's corn crop is expected to be strong. And beef exports are expected to grow.<P>

   Once dismissed as negligible, U.S. beef exports increased sevenfold in value in 15 years. In 1995, they added up to $3.3 billion, about 11 percent of the wholesale value of domestic beef production.<P>

   Although sales to Mexico fell by half last year, strong sales to Russia and South Korea helped American beef exports post an overall increase of 18 percent.<P>

   Mrs. Benjamin is hedging her bets about ranching's recovery.<P>

   Five years ago, four men worked full-time running this ranch, which averages about 400 head of mixed-breed cattle. Today, the same operation is run by Mrs. Benjamin and the ranch manager, Bob Blake. Her sons give occasional help.<P>

   "Two years ago, I told the hired men that they were taking the gravy off my income," the 67-year-old ranch owner recalled. "Today, I'm doing what the hired men used to do -- branding, fencing, opening the gates."<P>

<P>    BRUSSELS (May 20, 1996 08:47  a.m. EDT) - The European Union might take a first step on Monday towards easing a worldwide ban on British beef exports if London accepts strict terms and makes extra efforts to curb mad cow disease, EU officials said.<P>


    The EU's Standing Veterinary Committee resumed examination of a European Commission proposal, based on advice from the World Health Organisation, to allow sales of beef by-products gelatine, tallow and semen.<P>

    The committee, made up of senior national officials, suspended discussions last Wednesday to allow the Commission, the 15-nation EU's executive, time to amend its proposal and for Britain to present details of further measures to combat the fatal cattle brain disease.<P>

    "We believe there is every justification for voting in favour of the proposal," a Commission spokesman said, adding that a gradual relaxation of the ban was in line with the unanimous approach agreed by EU farm ministers on April 30.<P>

    Britain was due to give the committee details of plans to double a programme to slaughter to up to 80,000 cattle, which may have been at risk of developing the disease, known medically as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).<P>

    "I hope we are going to get a decision today," Britain's chief veterinary officer, Keith Meldrum, said on entering the meeting which was expected to last all day.<P>

    Meldrum declined to give details of the extra British measures before presenting them to the committee.<P>

    Regarding the beef by-products, Britain would have to ensure gelatine and tallow were treated at high temperatures, remove certain animal parts, such as the brain and intestine, and list authorised meat processing plants.<P>

    Germany and Austria remain strongly opposed to an immediate easing of the ban, saying that Britain's ability to trace and eliminate all animals at risk to BSE remained uncertain.<P>

    "We hope there will be no change today," Werner Zwingemann, head of the German delegation, told reporters. "There is still conflicting scientific evidence," he added.<P>

    But other countries, which have been sceptical about British measures to stamp out the disease, may be changing their views.<P>

    Dutch veterinary official Stan van der Meys welcomed Britain's readiness to extend the slaughter programme.<P>

    "It was a helpful contribution," he told reporters. "It's important that we have a good (British) plan not just to stabilise but to eradicate the disease."<P>

    The Dutch government ordered on March 27, the same day as the EU banned British beef exports, the destruction of 64,000 calves imported from Britain and disposal of the carcasses to ensure they did not enter the food chain.<P>

    If the veterinary officials did not support of an easing of the British ban, the proposal would be referred to EU farm ministers, who hold a regular monthly meeting later on Monday, the Commission spokesman said.<P>

    The officials were also unlikely to vote before consulting ministers in what is seen as a highly political decision.<P>

    The EU banned British beef exports at the end of March to calm public fears after the British government said there was a likely link between BSE and the deadly human brain disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.<P>



<CENTER><H3>Will <A NAME="Europeans">Europeans</A> Ever Lift  Ban?</H3></CENTER>
May 16 1996 ... London Times<BR>


BY CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS AND PHILIP WEBSTER<P>


MINISTERS voiced hopes last night that the ban on British beef would be eased next week in spite of a suspension of talks in Brussels.

Europe's scientific veterinary experts decided not to push plans for a partial end to the ban to a vote after eight hours of negotiations because of objections from Germany and other countries to an immediate lifting of the embargo.

<P>

The further delay infuriated Conservative Euro-sceptics last night. But after a day on which President Chirac swung his support behind the partial lifting of the ban during his visit to London, the Government said that important progress had been made.

Officials spoke of growing support for Britain's position and expressed confidence that the ban on gelatine and other by-products would go on Monday after Britain has provided more details of its measures to combat BSE.

<P>

The Cabinet will review the suspension this morning but informed sources were last night ruling out any retaliatory measures. "We are slowly getting there by negotiation and this is not the time to up the ante," they said. After the talks Keith Meldrum, the British chief veterinary officer, said he was confident that Britain would be able next week to provide the guarantees that other states were requiring before giving the nod to the proposal from the European Commission to exempt the products from the ban.
"I'm very optimistic," he said. "We are a lot nearer than we were two months ago." His view was shared, in more cautious terms, by officials from other states.

<P>

In a Commons debate on agriculture, Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said there were some technical issues that needed to be sorted out but added that "good progress" had been made at the talks.

<P>

Britain must offer precise details on how it will monitor the manufacture of the by-products and abide by strict conditions on temperature treatment and other matters required by the Commission. Some Continental officials said approval would be tied to the presentation of Britain's full programme for eradicating BSE.
<HR>

</CENTER>9 May 1996<P>


A PLAN for lifting the worldwide ban on British beef by-products was put forward
by the European Commission yesterday, but there were strong doubts it would be accepted by EU states. <P>


Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, won the approval of his colleagues for making the
necessary formal proposal on gelatine, tallow and semen. Britain would be required to comply with
strict processing conditions for the by-products. The Commission agreed that once these were in place
and monitored the ban could be lifted.<P>
 

However, it seems unlikely that the move will be endorsed by the veterinary committee, the voice of the
member states, which meets next Wednesday and must vote by qualified majority before the Commission
can start easing the ban.<P>
 

The Commission's move was welcomed by Downing Street yesterday as a move in the right direction. The
Ministry of Agriculture said it was "an encouraging step" but cautioned against too much optimism. Ian
Gardiner, policy director of the National Farmers' Union, said: "Our problem for some time has not been
with Brussels, which has tried to be helpful, but with other EU member states. There is a very real
danger that their representatives on the veterinary committee will turn down even this limited
relaxation of the ban." <P>


Germany, France, Italy and other member states remain opposed to any softening of the draconian
restrictions on British beef and by-products until more
scientific evidence is produced to confirm their safety. With domestic beef
                                   markets badly hit, continental governments are reluctant to do anything which
could fuel further consumer fears over the meat. <P>


Jochen Borchert, the German farm minister, said earlier this week that his country would oppose any
easing of the ban on the by-products for the time being. Philippe Vasseur, his French counterpart, had
said that any such move would be premature and could trigger a consumer boycott of all French 
                                 beef.<P>
 

At the same time, European leaders are anxious to defuse a crisis that has helped to spur anti-European
feeling in Britain and further strained London's already difficult relations with the rest of the EU. They
want to calm the dispute before the EU summit in Florence on June 22, but are unlikely to agree to a
suggestion from John Major that they convene a special summit to tackle the BSE
                                   problem before then. <P>


In London, senior officials played down suggestions that Mr Major was on the point of demanding such a
summit. But if the Commission's recommendation is not accepted next week, attitudes in the Government
are certain to harden and Mr Major could be expected by his colleagues to take a firmer line and demand
a summit. <P>


It was confirmed yesterday that he had written to Jacques Santer, the Commission President, suggesting
a summit would be an option if member states refused to lift the ban. 

Herr Fischler bases his case for beef by-products on a finding
by the World Health Organisation, endorsed by EU scientific experts, that they carry no risk of
contamination provided they are subject to specific treatment. If the Commission proposal were to be
approved next week, the ban could be lifted "as quickly as the British authorities get the controls and
procedures in place", a spokesman for Herr Fischler said. <P>


The Meat and Livestock Commission said last night that a
lifting of the ban would boost confidence in British beef
products. It estimated the value of gelatine exports last year at 29 million, tallow 4 million and
semen 857,000.
<HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Tougher">Tougher</A> Measures agreed to</CENTER></H3>

<I>The Times May 01 1996</I> ... BRITAIN agreed yesterday to consider European  demands for tougher measures to eradicate  "mad cow" disease as a condition for the  gradual lifting of the global ban on British  beef. <P>Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister,  gave the undertaking, which could lead to  a wider slaughter than the selective cull  of 42,000 cattle proposed by London, as  part of a formula agreed by EU farming ministers  that would allow the export ban "to be progressively  lifted". <P>

No timetable was given after  the two days of intensive talks but Britain  hopes the process will begin with a review  next week of the ban on gelatine and tallow,  both beef by-products. The Irish and several  continental ministers noted that lifting  the ban would be a long process and one doubted that even the by-products could  be cleared for some time yet. <P>

The EU  ministers welcomed as "a step in the right  direction" a plan outlined by Mr Hogg to  slaughter up to 42,000 cattle identified  as most likely to develop bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). <P>

But the ministers  added a string of requirements, calling  notably for additional measures particularly  aimed at herds where a significant number of cases of BSE had been detected. This  appeared to reflect German and French demands  &#173; repeatedly dismissed as unacceptable  by Britain &#173; for the slaughter of all  the animals in herds that have had a high incidence of BSE and their replacement with  fresh stock. <P>
There was, however, no timetable  for lifting the ban. Ivan Yates, the Irish  Agriculture Minister, said he assumed it  would still be in effect in the autumn at  least. By agreeing to join the other 14 members states in the farm council's  formal conclusions, Mr Hogg committed Britain  to joining the Commission in investigating  additional measures that went beyond London's  slaughter policy. Asked about the French  proposal for wider slaughter in affected  herds, Mr Hogg said Britain was "prepared  to talk along these lines". <P
>On the question  of when Britain would commit itself to a  selected cull, currently in proposal form,  Mr Hogg said the issue was part of a process  that was "moving in parallel" with the steps  towards lifting the ban. He said Britain  had accepted the request to consider stronger  measures and these would be examined over  coming weeks. Only France, he said, was  pressing for the slaughter of whole herds  that had suffered a BSE outbreak. <P>
Philippe  Vasseur, the French Farm Minister, said  Britain seemed to have changed its tune  at Luxembourg after talking tough since  the ban was imposed. "We felt political  goodwill. I felt it since yesterday. There  was no will to harden things," he said.  "The English have understood that lifting  the embargo is less simple than they had  thought." <P>
Earlier a meeting of veterinary  experts from member states had dismissed  Britain's slaughter plan as "inadequate"  by a vote of 14 to 1. The lone vote in favour  came from Kevin Taylor, Britain's Deputy  Chief Veterinary Officer. The veterinary  officials said the proposal lacked detail,  offered inadequate controls and did not  contain a reliable method for identifying  animals at the highest risk of developing  BSE.

<H3>Beef <A NAME="farmers">farmers</A> take Europe to court: 4 May 96</CENTER></H3>




<FONT SIZE=-1>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT</FONT>

<P>

 FARMERS and meat exporters launched a legal challenge to the European Union's ban on British beef yesterday. Their High Court action came as the Government's planned slaughter of cattle older than 30 months ran into deeper trouble.

<P>

Mr Justice Turner said the challenge required a ruling from the European Court of Justice on whether the export ban, imposed after the BSE scare, was disproportionate and a misuse of power under the Treaty of Rome. The challenge was initiated by the National Farmers' Union, but the judge allowed the International Meat Trade Association and the British Association of Sheep Exporters to make their own appeals because of the knock-on effect on all meat exports. The NFU will lodge its appeal with the European Court next week, arguing that the ban, which has halted exports worth &#163;600 million a year, was illegally imposed in an attempt to allay consumer panic and not because of a scientifically proven risk to human health.

<P>

At home, the cattle cull may not get fully under way for a further week or more. Livestock auctioneers are threatening legal action because they say the scheme is weighted unfairly against them. Supermarkets have caused further delay by refusing to take beef from abattoirs that also slaughter the older cattle.

<P>

Martin Burtt, a farmer in North Yorkshire who chairs the NFU's livestock committee, said: "It is frustrating. We should be up and running by now, but nothing is happening. The Ministry of Agriculture is behaving like Pontius Pilate and washing its hands of the whole mess.

<P>

"We need a central co-ordinating body, such as the Meat and Livestock Commission, to take charge of the allocation of animals for slaughter, otherwise we could face chaos if everyone offers their animals at once. But the Government says it is up to the industry to sort out its own problems." The &#163;630 million slaughter scheme should have begun on Wednesday. The Intervention Board, the government agency administering it, has licensed 105 auction markets as collection points and 44 abattoirs to slaughter them.

<P>

Scotland yesterday became the only place in Britain to report the slaughter of animals older than 30 months, at an abattoir in Larkhall. Slaughterhouses and markets elsewhere said they still had no clear instructions on how to take part in the scheme.

<P>

Auctioneers are furious because they calculate that farmers will get up to &#163;100 an animal more in compensation if they send over-age bullocks directly to an abattoir than if they send them to slaughter via an auction market and are paid liveweight.

<P>

Jim Watson, managing director of Midland Marts, which owns the Banbury market in Oxfordshire, the biggest in the country, said: "This is grossly unfair to auction markets which are already in dire financial straits. We are taking legal advice and are considering slapping an injunction on the Ministry of Agriculture unless they agree to top up the liveweight payment."

<P>

Tony Baldry, the junior Agriculture Minister, said that there were still many logistical problems to overcome. The biggest bottleneck was limited rendering plant capacity.

Excessive use of an organo-phosphate pesticide over 10 years ago could have caused Britain's epidemic of mad cow disease, a farmer-researcher told the Edinburgh International Science Festival Saturday.<P>
   Organo-phosphate chemicals are widely used as pesticides in agriculture, horticulture, fish farming, forestry and veterinary medicine and in the home for medicated shampoos, fly-sprays, and flame retardant clothing or bedding, Mark Purdey said.<P>
   He said farmers were forced to use phosnet - a blend of organo-phosphates and base of the drug thalidomide - in the 1980s to combat warble fly infestation. <P>

The most vigorous argument for the possible involvement of
organophosphorus(OP)  compounds in BSE is made by Dr Douglas Latto,
Chairman of the British Safety Council. He points out that that "Mark
Purdey showed that the highest incidence of BSE has occurred in areas
worst hit by warble fly"  (for which sheep dip containing OP is used).
He argues that the role of OP is not directly in  interacting with
prions,  but in weakening the immune system, and make the cow's
central nervous system  more susceptible to the action of prions, and
he has called for their use to be discontinued. He can be contacted through the
British Safety Council's  journal "Safety Management", 70 Chancellors
Road, London W6 9RS  [Tel: +44 (0)181 741 1231]<P>

There is epidemiological evidence
linking BSE with warble fly.  Circumstantial evidence exists linking warble fly treatment using OPs with BSE. In the UK BSE appeared after the introduction of compulsory warble
fly treatment. The major product used was called Phosmet. In Europe the UK
has the highest incidence of BSE followed by Switzerland which, coincidentally,
was the only other european country to use Phosmet to any extent.<P>

                 BRITAIN put the brakes on the EU machine yesterday, blocking its first action at
                 ministerial level while the continental media succumbed to a tide of indignation over
                 London's beef campaign and the bellicose chorus from the British popular press. 

                 A taste of the obstruction to come was delivered to a ministerial council that was to approve
                 measures on civil protection in man-made and natural disasters. David Bostock, Britain's
                 deputy EU ambassador, gave the gathering an announcement that is to become ritual as long
                 as Britain's beef is subject to an open-ended export ban. "The British Government is
                 obliged to approach today's agenda in the wider context of the crisis on BSE," he was quoted
                 as saying. 

                 That meant Britain would refuse to endorse all three items which were due for unanimous
                 approval. Britain's envoys and ministers will thus be injecting beef into every
                 decision-making forum, from foreign policy to transport. 

                 Although Britain had long been reluctant to approve EU co-operation on civil protection, it
                 had been expected to go along with the measures. The impact was described by Franco
                 Barberi, an Italian secretary of state and chairman yesterday, as "paralysis". "I am very
                 disappointed," he said. 

                 Meanwhile, Stephen Wall, the Ambassador, told his colleagues on Coreper, the acronym for
                 the powerful ambassadorial council that runs EU business, that Britain would not sign an
                 accord on company insolvency and would withhold support from preparations for the
                 Europol convention. The final go-ahead for the EU police agency was to be one of the main
                 items at the EU summit in Florence on June 21. Britain will attend ministerial meetings in
                 Brussels next week on the single market and development, but again will refrain from
                 endorsing any decisions. 

                 The scale of Britain's action seemed to have sunk in across Europe yesterday, generating a
                 backlash of public anger. While politicians railed at what they depicted as
                 counter-productive folly, commentators voiced shock at the virulence of the
                 anti-continental sentiments coming from the tabloid press and some British politicians. 

                 The German press was especially stung by what it reported as an anti-German campaign in
                 Britain, complete with every caricature from wartime days. 

                 Frankfurter Rundschau said that Mr Major was panicking. Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung
                 said the Prime Minister's ultimatum was really "a cry for help, aimed at Europe". In
                 Brussels, La Libre Belgique said the tabloids seemed to be "sowing the same seeds of
                 madness which led Germany to Nazism".

 <H3><CENTER> <A NAME="Abattoirs">Abattoirs</A>' lawsuit on older  cattle exposes rifts within farming community </CENTER></H3>
                                               BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT 

                 A GROUP of abattoir owners and farmers won permission in the High Court yesterday to
                 mount a legal challenge to the centrepiece of the Government's strategy for restoring
                 consumer confidence in beef. 

                 The Quality Meat and Live stock Alliance, which has some 50 members, contends that the
                 Government acted unlawfully in banning the sale for food of cattle that are more than 30
                 months old at slaughter. Lawyers for the group say the Government has failed to show there
                 is any risk to health from eating these older cattle, the only ground for banning them under
                 the Food Safety Act. Mr Justice Carnwath said: "It seems to me that there is certainly an
                 arguable point." 

                 The full application for judicial review of the ban is likely to be heard in July. The
                 challenge, if successful, would throw the Government's policy for dealing with the crisis in
                 the beef industry into even greater disarray. It has also opened rifts within the farming
                 community. Richard Macdonald, director-general designate of the National Farmers' Union,
                 said: "This challenge is not helpful and we do not support it. Culling animals older than 30
                 months is politically and commercially important as a solution to our problems." 

                 But Ewen Cameron, presi dent of the Country Landowners' Association and a leading dairy
                 farmer, said the legal move could be useful if it increased pressure on the Government to
                 exempt slow-maturing beef cattle from the cull. "We believe it is extremely important
                 that this very wholesome beef should be excluded from the ban." 

                 The alliance estimates that 800,000 older dairy cows and 500,000 prime beef cattle will
                 be withdrawn from the market and destroyed this year under the scheme, at a cost to the
                 taxpayer of more than 700 million. 

                 Richard North, an adviser to the group, said: "Farmers are having to destroy perfectly
                 sound meat and perfectly good animals. Very shortly we could be facing a serious beef
                 shortage in Britain." 

                 The ban on cattle older than 30 months was announced at the end of March after the
                 disclosure by Stephen Dorrell, the Health Secretary, that some people might have
                 contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  the human equivalent of "mad cow" disease  from
                 eating beef infected with BSE.

                                     BY ARTHUR LEATHLEY  POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT 
  
                 SENIOR Labour figures sent out conflicting signals yesterday over how to react to the
                 campaign of non-cooperation in Europe. As Tony Blair voiced muted support for the
                 Government's position, colleagues expressed fears that Britain's action smacked of
                 party-politicking. 

                 The Labour leader, visiting Rome, said he would back the Government's efforts to have the
                 beef ban lifted. "The Government has embarked upon a strategy in which the national
                 interest is now engaged. I will not undermine it, provided it is measured and lawful, and
                 backed by a massive exercise in negotiation and diplomacy." 

                 At home, his colleagues emphasised that the Tories were trying to woo their Euro-sceptics.
                 Baroness Blackstone, Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman in the Lords, accused the
                 Government of "indulging in the folly of going to war with Europe in order to placate the
                 European sceptics in the Conservative Party". She asked Baroness Chalker of Wallasey,
                 Overseas Development Minister, "whether we are going to war with the US, Australia and
                 Canada, at least one of which banned British beef before the EU?" 

                 Gavin Strang, the Shadow Agriculture Minister, said: "There is a lot of suspicion  and this
                 extends beyond the Labour Party  with regard to this Government's motives." 

                 Austin Mitchell, a Euro-sceptic Labour MP, thought the party's tactic "will be to pretend it
                 is not happening because we don't want to be portrayed as the pro-Europe party even
                 though we are".

                 BRITISH officials yesterday dismissed suggestions that the Government would use its EU
                 blocking campaign to obstruct the project for monetary union but they believe it could hold
                 up business on some of the preparatory work. 

                 Technical preparations for EMU are gathering pace in Brussels and Frankfurt but no
                 government decisions are imminent. The monetary committee, the team of senior finance
                 officials in charge of the project, is continuing to meet under Sir Nigel Wicks, its British
                 chairman. Britain's separate representative would be expected to note Britain's
                 reservations on any decisions. 

                 If there is no solution to the beef crisis, Britain will probably withhold its endorsement
                 next month of an interim report on the creation of a new exchange-rate mechanism to
                 accompany the euro's launch, due in January 1999. Britain has already dissented from the
                 scheme favoured by all the other states. 

                 If John Major turns the Florence summit into a debate on beef, as he threatens, he will
                 presumably refuse to sign a planned joint statement on preparations for EMU. 

                 In the longer term, despite its opt-out from the project, Britain will be required to give
                 assent to the framework for denominating bonds during the transition period and the design
                 of the coinage that is due to be phased into circulation in six years' time. 

                 Although British blocking could hold up a decision on that, the matter could wait for a year
                 or two. A British official said the beef crisis should be over long before such decisions
                 became urgent.

 By Reuters News Service

  BONN -- Germany's popular press cried ''Major flips out'' on Thursday, while its serious newspapers looked
  down with disdain at the nationalism whipped up over Britain's mad-cow crisis. 

  Some dailies reprinted screaming British headlines about Prime Minister John Major ''going to war'' against
  the European Union after Germany and other EU countries refused to lift a worldwide ban on British beef
  exports. 

  The respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung took a reverse ''don't mention the war'' approach, analysing
  Major's stand as ''The English Disease'' while discreetly glossing over the anti-German tone struck in the
  media. 

  But all papers, from right to left, cringed at the jingoistic rhetoric that Germans used to be known for and now
  consider the worst political faux pas possible. 

  ''Anti-German campaign in England -- and just before Euro '96,'' the front page of the mass circulation Bild
  moaned. 

  Under another headline ''English in crazy rage,'' Germany's most popular daily told its readers about the tricks
  London's Sun tabloid suggested to get back at Germans for Bonn's beef ban.

<HR>

<I><A NAME="From">From</A> Mr David Gladstone

<P>

</I>Sir, How pleasing to find myself, for once, in full agreement with William Rees-Mogg ("Monty Python politics", May 23). And how dispiriting to find that this once great country is preparing to go to war under a banner inscribed TGS (tallow, gelatine and semen).

<P>

Has the Conservative Party, unlike our EU partners, learnt nothing from the history of the past 150 years? Are we for ever to be ruled by the ghosts of Lord Palmerston and jingoism as we march to the xenophobic drum-beat of Mrs Teresa Gorman and Mr John Townend? Have we lost all our equally traditional sense of the ridiculous?

<P>

My worst fear is that Mr Major's posturing may appear to pay off, that a lifting of the ban on TGS, which was anyway on the cards, will be claimed as a triumph of gunboat diplomacy and that the Germans and others will overlook the insults being heaped on them and try to help us. There could be nothing more shaming than to be forgiven by the grown-ups across the Channel for our childish tantrums.

<P>

Yours faithfully,

<br>

DAVID GLADSTONE,

May 24 ... London Times<P>
Sir, Before this country rushes headlong into a pointless confrontation with its fellow European nations, ought the Prime Minister not to reflect one last time both on the causes of the present crisis and the only way it can be resolved?

<P>

<I>The Times</I> reported on March 21 a new and threatening discovery in respect of a relationship between BSE and CJD. Dr John Pattison, chairman of the committee advising the Government on BSE, said he had never seen the variant before, and was quoted as saying: "It is totally unpredictable, but at one extreme there is a risk of an epidemic."

<P>

Dr Robert Will, head of the CJD surveillance centre, stated: "I believe this is a new phenomenon. There is reason for major concern." The trusted <I>Times</I> doctor reminded us that CJD was highly infectious, adding: "I shall in future avoid all beef, whether roasted or minced, until scientists can be truly reassuring."

<P>

Finally, your Science Editor spoke of "smoking gun" evidence that pointed to a link between BSE and CJD. He noted that the incubation period of the disease could last for decades, concluding: "If the new form of CJD follows this pattern, it will be almost the middle of the next century before we can be sure that no more new cases will emerge."

<P>

No wonder people are worried.

<P>

At the heart of the beef crisis lies a fundamental lack of faith in the declarations of politicians. Four fifths of our beef exports go to other EU nations. EU consumers must be won over. This can be done only by telling the truth &#173; and from within the European Union &#173; respecting the justified fears of the consumer, whether German, Dutch or British. To paralyse the work of the Union will do nothing to whet their appetite for beef.

<P>

Yours faithfully,

<br>

Dr. ANTHONY GLEES,

<br>

<hr>

FARMERS joined furious Tory backbenchers and Euro-MPs yesterday in calling for an end to the EU ban on British beef after a senior Brussels official admitted it was safe to eat.

Franz Fischler, the European Agriculture Commissioner, said the ban, which has halted exports worth &#163;600 million a year, had been imposed to calm consumer panic over "mad cow" disease and not because British beef was a health risk.

<p>

"I would not hesitate to eat beef in England", Herr Fischler said in an interview with Reuters in Absam, his home village in the alpine region of western Austria. "I see no medical reason not to."

He added: "For [public safety alone] a ban would not have been needed. We also wanted to make sure that the whole beef market did not collapse as dramatically as was unfortunately the case in Britain".

<p>

Herr Fischler, who has been tipped as a future Austrian president or federal chancellor, suggested that trade in some beef-derived products, such as gelatine and tallow, might be allowed to resume before the overall export ban was lifted.

<p>

Commenting on Herr Fischler's remarks, Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said: "British farmers have been under siege because of a decision by the Community, and it is just unacceptable to me if that was taken for purely political reasons."


A leading Tory Euro-sceptic, Sir Teddy Taylor, said: "Now that Fischler has admitted that he made a horrendous mistake and did it for all the wrong reasons, I hope other members of the EU Commission will listen to his abject, penitent and pathetic words of apology and remove the ban forthwith."


Sir Gerard Vaughan, Tory MP for Reading East, said: "This is an absolutely astonishing situation. Here is the man who has made Britain a scapegoat ... now conceding that all this has been done just for the convenience of Europe."


Edward McMillan-Scott, Euro-MP for York, called for an urgent review of the export ban. "This is a very encouraging message from a key figure. If he had said this earlier ... a lot of damage to the British and European beef sectors might have been avoided."

<p>

In Brussels Herr Fischler's press spokesman insisted the commissioner had disclosed nothing new: "If we really thought British beef was unsafe its sale would have been banned in Britain as well as everywhere else in the world. Besides, it was not Herr Fischler who closed the borders but ministers." The rumpus over Herr Fischler's confession came as the Ministry of Agriculture was finalising details of a plan to keep all cattle older than 30 months out of the food chain. These animals are considered more likely to be infected with BSE.

<p>

Supermarkets say further improvement in beef sales; now running at about 80 per cent of their pre-scare level; will depend on the credibility of guarantees given to shoppers that all the meat now on offer comes from young animals. But the British Veterinary Association warned against the "needless destruction" of thousands of healthy animals, and the NFU appealed for fair compensation for farmers who stand to lose prime beef cattle.

<p>

Ian Gardiner, the NFU's director of policy, said: "We accept the need to destroy old cows and the proposed basic compensation of 86p per kilo liveweight is fair. But we are pressing for top-up payments for owners of prime beef stock over 30 months old."


Abattoirs and meat proces sors also want the Government to compensate them for stockpiles of beef worth some163 pounds ;80 million which they cannot sell because of the export ban and the age limit on the cattle from which the meat comes.

<p>

Mark Ashworth, finance director of Midland Meat Packers, one of Britain's biggest beef exporters, said. "We have had to make 90 of our 530 employees redundant and lay off more than 300 others. The only solution is for the Government to buy up these stores of unwanted beef and destroy them."

<hr>

<center><h3> Mad Cow Disease and the <a NAME="Decline">Decline</a> of UK Beef</h3></center>
April 8, 1996<p>


<i>Following are several news items related to the current developments
regarding 'Mad Cow Disease'.'</i>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>Several EU countries have banned the import of British beef products and
live animals. These countries include France, which makes up 50 per cent of
the British export market.
<p>

The price of cattle at England's biggest cattle auction suffered a severe
drop today.

Many British schools have declared beef "off the menu" until further notice.


Public confidence in  the beef industry, in the UK, is said to be "hanging
by a thread."

<p>
Despite the admission that a connection between CJD and BSE is likely,
the government is STILL claiming that British beef is safe to eat
because since 1989 cows diagnosed as having BSE have been destroyed
and all specified bovine offals, thought to contain the infective
agent, have been removed and not passed into the human food chain.
<p>
Previous independent studies have shown that for every one infected
cow discovered and removed from the slaughter house, at least two more
infected cows get passed as safe and do enter the food chain. 

Scientists have also begun to say that the infective agent is not
limited to the specified bovine offals but is found throughout the
carcass.

The number of countries which have joined a boycott of British beef products
has now risen to 11.
<p>
 A meeting, being held in Britain, will decide whether or not parents should stop feeding beef products to children
-- there are fears that the new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is
more prevalent in younger people.
<p>
To date 158,882 cattle, from 33,292 farms, have been killed
due to being suspected of having BSE. The scientific panel which advises the
British government on BSE are expected to decide this weekend whether or not
to recommend the slaughter of all 12 million cattle in Britain.
<p>
Amongst the human deaths were Michelle Brown, a 29 year-old who was pregnant
with her third child at the time she began displaying symptoms of the
disease, and Peter Hall, a 20 year-old student who had become vegetarian some
time before dying of the disease.

There have been reports of similar diseases showing up in cats, dogs, mink
and other animals.
<p>
In the meantime, feed manufacturers have been ordered not to use any mammal
meat or bone meal in agricultural feedstuffs.

<p>
There is a possibility that Canadian and US consumers could be at risk,
according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine's president,
Dr. Neal Barnard. Barnard points out that the feed given to North American
cattle includes the remains of other animals.
<p>
In another report, British farmers are complaining that the Government is doing
little or nothing to help them with the drop in value of cattle, or on what
to do with thousands of cattle that are now ready for market.
<p>
Some are also complaining that it is costing 450 pounds per day to feed
grain to the cattle, that it is too soon to put them out to grass, and that
there is a severe shortage of hay due to last summer's drought in Britain.
They say that they cannot continue to go on doing this for much longer
without emergency funding from the Government.
<p>
Paul Temple, a farmer in Driffield, East Yorkshire stated, in an interview
with the Telegraph, that farmers suspected that BSE was more widespread
throughout Europe than is admitted. He claims that in France, cattle with
BSE were being diagnosed as suffering from magnesium deficiency which, at a
certain stage, makes cattle unable to stand.
<p>

CBC radio reports that the British Government, acting on the advice of their
scientific advisory committee, has decided that there is no need to order any
extermination of the British cattle herd. They also decided that no other
further action, apart from what they announced last week, is necesary.
In the same report, it was revealed that a herd of cattle in France has been
destroyed following the detection of one cow in the herd with BSE.

<p>
The EU today decided on a total ban of all British beef, beef
products and the import of live cattle and semen. Burger King and Wimpey
burger restaurants have banned the use of British beef in their burgers
together with McDonalds.

Also in Britain, it is reported that all cattle auctions were closed today,
as the price of beef was thought to be too low to make a sale justified.
<p>
In an interview with CBC Newsworld's Early Edition, Franz Fichler, the EU
Agriculture Commissioner, also attacked the British Government for their
statements over the weekend suggesting the possible slaughter of part, or
all, of the cattle herd, then making a statement today stating that they
would not be doing so.


Fichler, in response to a question about the slaughter of a herd in France,
stated that all cases of BSE in France and other EU countries were directly
linked to the United Kingdom, either because they were imported from the UK,
or were fed on food manufactured in the UK.
<p>
In another interview Professor Richard Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds
University, stated that he believed the Government had been misleading the
public since BSE first emerged, and that all the measures that are now in
place should have been taken at the start of the outbreak. 
<p>
"They seem to be banning cows one bit at a time," said Lacey. "First you
can't eat the brain, then the internal organs and now the head, minus the
tongue. What is next?", asked Lacey.

A WHO Consultation on public health issues related to human and animal spongiform

encephalopathies was held in Geneva on 2-3 April 1996.  The consultation made

recommendations, based on the latest scientific information, to minimize transmission of

BSE among animals and to reduce as completely as possible any exposure of humans to the

BSE agent.  See also the<a HREF="#press"> 4.3.96 Press Release on Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease</a>.<p>



Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)<p>



</b>In the light of the 10 human cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported by

the United Kingdom on 20 March 1996, a WHO meeting of international experts in

neurology, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, epidemiology, veterinary science and

public health is being organized on 2-3 April 1996 to review the present situation and to

make further technical and public health recommendations as required.  In particular, the

meeting will identify those technical and scientific issues which must be addressed in

developing best practices that will protect the consumer.  WHO recommends that if similar

disease is identified in any other countries, the national health authorities should be

immediately notified.   The conclusions of the meeting will be published in the Weekly

Epidemiological Record.<p>


The UK has analyzed cases of CJD that have occurred in 10 adults below 42 years of age

during the past year. The disease in these cases differs from classical CJD in several respects:<p>


<ul>

  <li>early age (CJD is usually a disease of older people)</li>

  <li>differences in pathological changes in the brain</li>

  <li>absence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical CJD)</li>

</ul>

	There is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and bovine spongiform

encephalitis (BSE).  However, in the absence of any apparent cause, the most likely

explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control

measures were instituted in the UK in 1989.  The measures now in force in the UK are

considered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef.<p>



	No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any other country

although BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland, France, Portugal, and Switzerland. 

Precautions have been taken in these countries to avoid any possible risk to people from beef

consumption.<p>



	WHO recommends that national health authorities be notified if any unusual

occurrence of CJD is recognized in any other country.<p>

<h3><center><a NAME="MEASURES">MEASURES</a> TO LIMIT

SPREAD OF BSE AND REDUCE  HUMAN HEALTH RISKS</h3>

</center>





	At a consultation organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva on 2-3 April

1996, a group of international experts reviewed the public health issues related to bovine

spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the emergence of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob

Disease (CJD)

<hr>


<h4>Appearance of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (V-CJD):</h4>

<p>

<blockquote>

	The group reviewed the clinical and pathological data from the 10 cases in the UK. The

disease has occurred at younger ages than is usual for classical CJD and shows several

clinical and pathological differences.  Based on findings in these 10 cases, the group

established a case definition to facilitate better surveillance, which is necessary to determine

the incidence and distribution of this syndrome. <p>



	The group concluded that there is no definite link between BSE and V-CJD, but that

circumstantial evidence suggests exposure to BSE may be the most likely hypothesis.

Further research on both diseases is urgently required.<p>


	Exposure to BSE has already been greatly reduced by measures taken in the UK. 

Implementation of the recommendations by this consultation should further reduce risk from

exposure to BSE to minimal levels.<p></blockquote>
<h3>Variant CJD Recommendations</h3>
<blockquote>1  The geographic distribution of V-CJD, although reported at present only in the UK, needs

to be further investigated.<p>



 	2  While the most likely hypothesis at present for this newly recognized variant is exposure

to the BSE agent, further data from scientific studies on these variant cases are urgently

required to establish a link. More monitoring and surveillance studies on all forms of CJD are

required throughout the world, modelled on current European collaborative studies.<p>


	 3  Exposure to BSE from beef and beef products has already been substantially reduced by

the measures taken in the UK.  Exposure to BSE has always been lower in other countries.

The group considered that implementation of their recommendations will ensure that any

continuing risk of exposure to BSE in beef and beef products will be reduced to a minimum.<p>

As surveillance worldwide is increased for both BSE and V-CJD, more information will

become available in the coming months. WHO will keep these developments under review

and update the recommendations as appropriate.

</blockquote><hr>

<h3>TSE-Infected Meat Recommendations</h3>

<blockquote>

1. No part of any animal which has shown signs of TSE should enter any food chain, human

or animal. All countries must ensure the slaughter and safe disposal of TSE-affected animals

so that TSE infectivity cannot enter any food chain. All countries should review their

rendering procedures to ensure that they effectively inactivate TSE agents.<p>


2. All countries should establish continuous surveillance and compulsory notification for BSE

according to recommendations established by the Office International des Epizooties in Paris.

In the absence of surveillance data, the BSE status of a country must be considered as

unknown.<p>



3. Countries where BSE exists in native cattle should not permit tissues that are likely to

contain the BSE agent to enter any food chain, human or animal. <p>




4. All countries should ban the use of ruminant [cow, sheep, goats] tissues in ruminant feed.<p>


5.  With respect to specific products:<p>

<ul><li>Tests on milk from BSE-infected animals have not shown any BSE infectivity, 	and there is evidence from other animal and human spongiform encephalopathies 	to suggest that milk will not transmit these diseases. Milk and milk products, 	even in countries with high incidence of BSE, are therefore considered safe.<p>
<li>Gelatin is considered safe for human consumption since its preparation involves 	a chemical extraction process that destroys BSE infectivity.</ul>
<li>Tallow is likewise considered safe if effective rendering procedures are in place.

6.  With respect to medicinal products, which differ from food in that they can be injected

as well as taken orally, measures to minimize the risk of transmitting the BSE agent were

developed at a previous WHO consultation in 1991 and continue to be applicable.
<p>
<ul><li> The importance of obtaining materials destined for the pharmaceutical industry from

countries which have a surveillance system in place and which report either no or  sporadic

cases of BSE is reiterated.
<li>Removal and inactivation procedures contribute to the reduction of the risk of infection. 

But it must be recognized that the BSE agent is remarkably resistant to physico-chemical

procedures which destroy the infectivity ogf common microorganisms.
</ul>




7. Research on TSE should be promoted, especially on rapid diagnosis, agent

characterization, and epidemiology of TSEs in humans and animals.<p></blockquote>

<h3>U.N.'s <a NAME="WHO">WHO</a> Seeks Barriers Against Mad-Cow Disease</h2>
<h5>By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN  ...  April 4, 1996</h5>

<p> NEW YORK  --  Reacting to the epidemic of mad-cow disease in
Britain, the World Health Organization on Wednesday recommended a
worldwide ban on feeding sheep, goat, cattle, and other animal
tissues to livestock. The aim is to prevent the infectious agent
that causes mad-cow disease from expanding further in the animal or
human food chain.
<p>   The health agency also urged all countries to intensify efforts
to monitor for mad-cow disease and its human version, a fatal
malady known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It destroys memory and
many motor functions, like maintaining balance.
<p>   Sweeping action is needed because "a new disease is
frightening" and the uncertainty it has created "is very
worrisome," Dr. David L. Heymann, an agency official, said in an
interview.
<p>   Because the geographic extent of mad-cow disease is not known,
the health organization urged every country to set up "continuous
surveillance and compulsory notification" of cases. WHO also urged
each country to conduct scientific studies to determine more
accurately how often Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affects humans.
Earlier studies and surveillance have found the incidence to be one
case per million people in the world.
<p>   One aim is to detect additional cases of a new variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that British officials have reported in
10 young people and tentatively linked to mad-cow disease. The
malady in cattle is believed to have resulted from feed containing
an agent that causes a disease in sheep known as scrapie.
<p>   Application of the recommendations is up to each member country
of WHO, an agency of the United Nations. Although WHO has no powers
to enforce its recommendations, its scientific advice is widely
followed.
<p>   On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would
expedite regulations prohibiting all protein from cud-chewing
animals, or ruminants, in ruminant feeds. Anticipating the move,
the livestock industry and veterinary groups established a
voluntary ban on the use of such feeds.
<p>   In 1994, the FDA proposed banning use of sheep tissue in animal
feed. But it took no action because of opposition from some
elements of the livestock industry and for lack of inspectors to
enforce such a ban.
<p>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is
responsible for tracking communicable diseases in this country,
said that it supported moves to step up surveillance for
Creutzfeldt-Jakob and related diseases. Such measures could mean
adding Creutzfeldt-Jakob to those diseases that doctors must report
to health departments, said Bob Howard, a spokesman for the federal
agency in Atlanta. However, only state health officials, and not
CDC, can make such a decision, he said.
<p>   Although some countries have a surveillance system for such
diseases, most do not.
<p>   Wednesday's recommendations were made by a committee of experts
that WHO convened in Geneva to deal with widespread alarm over the
safety of eating beef. The alarm resulted from an announcement on
March 20 by the British government that an expert committee had
said for the first time that the two diseases may be linked.
<p>   The WHO committee agreed with the British committee's conclusion
that a link to the mad-cow cases was the most logical explanation
for the 10 cases, though scientific proof is lacking.
<p>   WHO also said that milk is safe to drink, even in countries
where mad-cow disease is found. The agency endorsed the safety of
gelatin, which is derived from bovine tissue, saying that the
manufacturing process destroys any possible infectivity of such
material.
<p>   Because the 10 British cases affected people younger than 42
years, many people are concerned about the possible dangers of
feeding infected material to children. But Dr. Joseph Gibbs, an
expert at the National Institutes of Health, who headed the WHO
committee, said that "there is no evidence that children are at a
greater risk than adults."
<p>   WHO said there was an urgent need for scientists to develop a
rapid diagnostic test to detect the diseases in animals and humans.
The only way doctors can now diagnose the bovine or human disease
with certainty is to use special chemical stains in examining under
a microscope brain tissue obtained in a post-mortem examination.
<p>   The only laboratory test now available is to inject material
from a suspect animal into mice or other laboratory animals in
experiments that take a long time to complete.

<h2>Mad Cow Epidemic Puts <a NAME="Spotlight">Spotlight</a> on Puzzling Human Brain Disease</h2>
<h5>By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. .... April 2, 1996</h5>
<p>  The epidemic of mad cow disease in England has focused worldwide
attention on the human version of the ailment, the fatal malady
known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It is one of a small group of
obscure diseases called spongiform encephalopathies because they
produce holes in various areas of the brain, giving it a pitted
appearance like Swiss cheese.
<p>   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affects on average about one person in
a million worldwide each year. Now that an expert British committee
has tentatively linked it to mad cow disease, a question is raised:
how many, if any, of these cases are caused by something in the
diet or environment.
<p>   The natural history of the mysterious malady may shed light on
its cause, and may also help clarify the nature of other
brain-destroying diseases like Alzheimer's, to which
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease seems related by symptoms and pathology.
With both diseases, waxy deposits known as amyloid plaques are seen
under the microscope in stricken nerve cells.
<p>   Until now, the best known of the spongiform diseases has been
kuru, believed to result from ritualistic cannibalism among the
Fore group in the Highlands of Papua-New Guinea. It has largely
disappeared now that such practices have ceased.
<p>   Dr. D. Carleton Gajdusek's Nobel Prize-winning research proving
that kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were transmissible to
animals opened a new era in the investigation of what had been
previously thought chronic degenerative diseases.
<p>   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually strikes people in their 50s
and 60s, after taking years or even decades to develop. But once
symptoms begin, the course is swift and relentless. Destruction of
brain cells impairs an individual's ability to think, see, speak
and move. Muscles go into spasm, becoming rigid and jerky. Balance
is lost. The dementia that develops mimics Alzheimer's disease, a
related disorder that is not classified as a spongiform disease.
<p>   Doctors have found Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease everywhere in the
world they have looked. Among its most famous victims was George
Balanchine, the choreographer, who died in New York City in 1983.
<p>   Dr. Paul Brown, an expert in spongiform diseases at the National
Institutes of Health, has cited two age-related riddles that, if
solved, could help point to when the disease is acquired: Why is
middle age the most common time for symptoms to develop? And why
does the incidence of the disease suddenly drop around the age of
75? In contrast, the incidence of a more common dementing disorder,
Alzheimer's disease, continues to increase with advancing age.
<p>   Researchers ask another question: Does some seemingly trivial
event that occurs at a young age herald Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
much later in life?
<p>   Like Alzheimer's, the spongiform diseases can be diagnosed with
certainty only after death by pathologists who peer through a
microscope to detect the distinctive pattern of brain damage. Such
tests have created the latest mystery about spongiform diseases.
<p>   An expert British committee has identified a cluster of 10 cases
of a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people younger than
42, some in their teen-age years. The committee concluded it was
dealing with a variant form because of the unusual microscopic
appearance of diseased neurons. The committee said that although
scientific proof was lacking, it was tentatively linking the
cluster to mad cow disease.
<p>   But many scientists are confused about the strength and
importance of the link, and they have criticized the committee and
the British government for failing to immediately disclose all the
scientific details they have about the cases.
<p>   One undoubted mode of transmission is through exchange of
tissues. Over the last 20 years, doctors have documented
transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease through injections and
transplants of tissue like corneas and the dura that covers human
brain.
<p>   Worldwide, at least 62 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have
been traced to injections of growth hormone once derived from
pituitary glands obtained from thousands of human cadavers. Sixteen
of those cases resulted from human growth hormone distributed to
more than 6,200 people in a program sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health. The lengthy incubation period suggests that
the number may grow with time.
<p>   Additional cases have resulted from re-use of chemically
disinfected electrodes that had been implanted to record the brain
wave patterns of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. All
transmissions in these and other surgical procedures have
apparently involved contamination of human tissues from or near the
brain and central nervous system.
<p>   
<p>   Officials of the Food and Drug Administration and blood banks
have recently expressed concern at the possibility that
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease might be transmitted through the blood
supply, although there has been no documented case so far. The
concern in part reflects potential litigation and wariness over
criticism of the way these organizations handled the issue of
transfusions of blood contaminated with the AIDS virus in the early
1980s. Last year, an advisory panel to the drug agency recommended
notification of recipients of blood that had been donated by
someone before they developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
<p>   A few medical personnel who work with brain tissue have
developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although such cases raise
questions about occupational hazards, experts say the number
reported is within the range of what would be expected by chance
alone.
<p>   Other cases of Creutzfeldt-Jacob seem to be clearly hereditary
in nature. For example, the disease is 60 times more common than
usual among inhabitants of a certain region of Slovakia, and 40
times higher among Libyans who emigrated to Israel many years ago.
There is also a high incidence among Sephardic Jews who immigrated
to France from Tunisia and Algeria.
<p>   These cases, thought to be hereditary, account for up to 10
percent of all Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is named after two
German doctors, Hans G. Creutzfeldt and Alfons Jakob, who
independently reported the first cases 75 years ago. Many
hereditary cases can be traced to a mutant gene on chromosome 20.
In the hereditary group, each child born to an affected parent has
a 50:50 chance of developing the disease. But it is not known
whether diet and other environmental factors are important
co-factors in producing the disease.
<p>   The overwhelming majority of Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases occur
sporadically and with no clue as to how they are transmitted.
<p>   A better understanding of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been
hampered by the lack of a central registry and the reluctance of
many pathologists and clinicians to handle patients with the
disease, Dr. Frank O. Bastian, a pathologist at the University of
South Alabama in Mobile, said. "Many possible cases have been
buried without" a correct diagnosis, said Dr. Bastian, who has
written a book on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
<p>   The prevailing belief is that spongiform diseases are caused by
rogue proteins known as prions that are thought to be abnormal
variants of the prion proteins normally present on the surface of
nerve cells. The disease-causing prions are believed to convert
their normal counterpart protein into the abnormal form. Normal
prion protein is produced by a gene that is widely found in nature.
But its function is unknown. Prions lack the DNA and RNA that are
the hereditary material of other transmissible disease agents.
<p>   The prion theory is based on the work of Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner
of the University of California at San Francisco. His studies were
at first regarded as heretical because they invoked a bizarre
concept that infection could be caused by an agent without genetic
material. Many scientists are now convinced that prions cause
spongiform diseases. The problem, Prusiner said, is that "we don't
know how they cause disease."
<p>   Partial evidence for the theory comes from experiments in which
purified prions have caused a spongiform disease when injected into
laboratory animals. Material in which the prion was destroyed and
then injected were not infectious.
<p>   "About 100 laboratories around the world are working on
different aspects of these diseases," Prusiner said in an
interview.
<p>   The agents that cause spongiform diseases have unconventional
biologic properties. They provoke none of the immune reactions in
the body that result from other infections. So scientists have been
unable to come up with a practical test to detect the agent in
healthy but possibly infected humans or animals.
<p>   Thus it is not known whether there are many more people in
Britain who may be infected with the mad cow disease agent but have
not yet developed symptoms. One known difference between the agents
that cause spongiform diseases and conventional infectious agents
is their prodigious resistance to heat, ultraviolet light,
radiation and many chemical disinfectants. Thus there is no
guarantee that food processing technologies like cooking,
pasteurization, sterilization, freezing, drying and pickling will
destroy the spongiform agent if it is present in foodstuffs.
<p>   The new uncertainty about spongiform diseases is a reminder that
some diseases affect many more people than their rarity implies.

<h2>Britain Asks Europe to <a NAME="Pay">Pay</a> Most of Cost of Killing Cows</h2>
<h5>By ALAN COWELL ... April 2, 1996</h5>
<p>   
LUXEMBOURG  --  In an effort to rebuild its shattered beef
industry, Britain pressed its European partners on Monday to
finance 80 percent of the cost of destroying some 4 million cattle
over the next five years.
<p>   They have proposed the culling  --  at a cost estimated at $700
million or more  --  as part of a strategy to contain mad-cow disease,
coax consumers back to British beef, and get the European Community
to end the ban on British beef exports that it imposed last week.
<p>   As the European Union's 15 agriculture ministers considered the
British proposal into the night here, though, it was apparent that
the export ban would not be lifted any time soon. That ban was
imposed after British government ministers said mad-cow disease in
cattle might be linked to cases of a similar, fatal degenerative
brain disease in humans.
<p>   The statement sent panic waves throughout Britain and Europe,
and beef sales  --  even those of non-British beef in countries
including Germany and France  --  plummeted as consumers suddenly
perceived beef as a possible health hazard.
<p>   The apparent determination of Europe to continue the ban for now
reflected the widespread sentiment that radical measures were
required both to sanitize Britain's 11 million cattle and to
restore confidence in British and European beef around the world.
<p>   "The ban is part of the effort to restore confidence," a
European Commission official said.
<p>   Britain has deeply resented the European imposition of the
export ban, arguing that it was unjustified. Its European partners,
seeking to limit damage to the cause of European unity, pledged at
a summit meeting in Turin, Italy, on Friday to help Britain out of
the morass.
<p>   Britain's proposal was being debated late into the night here,
and European officials indicated that in addition to negotiations
about how much of the cost of the cattle-culling program Europe
would share, Britain's European partners wanted stronger action,
including much tighter controls in abattoirs and strict rules for
the selective culling of herds in which the disease, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, had been detected.
<p>   Britain's plan for culling would involve mainly older dairy
cows, which would be incinerated rather than slaughtered for meat
products as they reached the end of their milk production. Milk
products have not been found to be potentially dangerous.
<p>   Britain has also offered selective culling of younger cattle in
herds suffering certain levels of the disease, but there has not
been detailed discussion of its proposal or how many diseased
cattle in a herd would trigger its total destruction, European
officials said.
<p>   "The mood is, we want radical action," a European official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
<p>   British officials said the total figure of 4 million older dairy
cattle was derived from a proposal to cull and destroy some 15,000
head of cattle over 30 months old every week for the next five to
six years, at a direct cost to farmers of $700 million a year.
<p>   Officials said some European countries argued that 80 percent of
the cost was far too much for the European Union to bear.
<p>   The European Commission, the European Union's main executive
body, had earlier suggested some $250 million a year as Europe's
contribution. But British farm officials argued that the European
Union had financed 70 percent of the costs of combatting swine
fever in Germany several years ago.
<p>   Additionally, other costs not mentioned in the British proposal
on Monday would include compensation for British animals
slaughtered elsewhere in Europe because of the mad-cow crisis,
mainly the Netherlands, and most of all, the huge cost of buying up
stocks of European beef and putting them into cold storage until
the Continent has fully gotten over its fears of mad-cow disease.
<p>   German farmers have complained that the crisis has halved the
market value of their beef, and many European nations argue that it
will now be necessary for Europe to build a "beef mountain" of
stored beef until the market recovers from the mad-cow disease
crisis.
<p>   It was not clear from Monday's British proposal how many
additional costs were likely to arise from the actual slaughtering
and incineration of cattle, nor whether Britain has the facilities
to destroy and dispose of so many cows without disrupting its
production of beef for consumers.
<p>   With its latest proposal, Britain is trying to secure European
financial support for an approach already proposed by its own
farmers: eventual destruction of cattle now over 30 months old,
which are seen as most likely to have been exposed to mad-cow
disease.
<p>   Under the British proposal, dairy cattle now 30 months old or
more would be slaughtered when they reach the end of their economic
usefulness, when they are around 6 years old. Then the carcasses
would be incinerated. Previously, older dairy cows were used to
produce various meat and bone products.
<p>   "These animals would normally be slaughtered anyway," the
European official said. "The difference is that they will be taken
out of the food chain."
<p>   In addition, the Europeans have suggested that beef cattle
destined for consumer markets all be slaughtered before the age of
30 months, which is already true in the vast majority of cases.
<p>   European officials said Britain's partners were pressing for a
broad package of measures that would include new regulations for
butchering carcasses, the formal prohibition of meat sales from
cattle now over 30 months old, and requirements that offal destined
for use in other products be rendered at higher temperatures than
at present.
<p>   British officials told reporters that Britain's latest proposals
went "far beyond what the veterinarians suggested."
<p>   But Germany's agriculture minister, Jochen Borchert, said other
European countries "are not prepared for half-hearted measures."

<h3><center>Beef Producers Blame <a NAME="Dairymen">Dairymen</a> for Losses</center></h3>
London Times ... 15 Apr 1996 ... by MICHAEL HORNSBY, agricultural correspondent<p>


BEEF farmers fear many of them could be ruined by plans for the cull and disposal of all cattle over 30 months old, which the Government is expected to announce this week.


Tens of thousands of prime steers and heifers reared for the beef market have become virtually worthless because the animals happen to exceed this age limit and can no longer be used for food. Beef producers believe they are being asked to carry the can for dairy farmers whose herds account for 90 per cent of the nearly 160,000 confirmed cases of "mad cow" disease so far recorded.

<p>

Under the cull plan, agreed with Britain's EU partners, farmers will be compensated at a rate of 86p per kilogram liveweight, which will average at about &#163;480 per animal destroyed. The EU will pay 70 per cent. This is roughly the market price dairy farmers would have got for the 15,000 barren old cows sent for slaughter every week at the end of their working lives. The carcasses will now be burnt.

<p>

Dairy farmers can sell milk from their cows. Their steers and heifers are eligible for sale as beef provided the animals are slaughtered before 30 months, which they normally would be.

By contrast, beef farmers are estimated to have up to 100,000 prime steers and heifers for which there is now no market because the animals are older than 30 months. Many would go under if they were paid no more for these high-quality animals than the going rate for a worn-out dairy cow.

<p>

James Burnett, one of the biggest cattle farmers, has never had a case of BSE in the 1,400-strong herd of pedigree Charolais and Belgian Blue cattle he and his brother rear at Burridge Farm, near Newark, Nottinghamshire. In normal times, they kill up to 5,000 steers a year at between 33 and 34 months, the slaughter age for these Continental breeds, to supply beef to France and Italy. Since March 26, exports have been banned by the EU and the cattle are now too old to be sold for beef here.

<p>

"The cattle would normally fetch up to &#163;1,100 each," Mr Burnett said. "If we are compensated at the same rate as for old dairy cows we would lose up to &#163;400 per animal. As our profit margin is only &#163;30 a head, we would be ruined. All our cattle are fed on vegetable waste and have never been given the kind of rations that caused BSE."

<h3><center>EU Countries <a NAME="May">May</a> Have to Eat it</h3></center>
FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN STRASBOURG AND MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT<p>


THE European Commission brushed off Britain's legal challenge to the beef export ban yesterday but Brussels officials privately admitted that aspects of their case might not stand up in court.

<p>
The French Government is to pay compensation to the owners of 76,000 calves of British origin quarantined on French farms in the wake of the "mad cow" scare. The animals are to be destroyed over the next two or three months.<p>




John Major is expected to press demands for an early lifting of the ban with Jacques Santer, the President of the European Commission, when they meet in Moscow this week at the G7 nuclear safety summit. A Commission spokesman said: "Mr Major will be heard by Mr Santer, but the position has been made very clear. We have a ban for which there is a legal basis and it will be for the European Court of Justice to deal with that matter."

<p>

In London, Welsh farmers said they would take up arms to protect their herds if further culling was Europe's price for removing the ban. Leading a delegation to lobby MPs at Westminster, Bob Parry, the president of the Farmers' Union of Wales, said: "The Commissioner has said British beef is safe to eat, so why are we suffering? Our farmers are willing to protect animals by getting guns if necessary." Franz Fischler, the European Agriculture Commissioner, precipitated the British legal challenge by his statement last weekend that he would have no hesitation in eating British beef and his admission that the ban had been imposed in response to consumer panic.

<p>

Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty allows for "action which supports and supplements the policy pursued by the member states to protect the health, safety and economic interests of consumers." The Commission said yesterday that public health was the central issue.

<p>

Legal experts were also combing the EU's founding treaties to justify a ban on exports to non-EU countries. Officials repeated that this was to protect consumers from re-imports of suspect beef.

<h3>Supermarket beef sales draw  <a NAME="poor">poor</a> </h3>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY ... April 10 1996 ...  London Times

<p>

 BEEF sales are rising as fears of catching Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease subside, traders said yesterday.
In Brussels today, European Union veterinary experts may approve a partial lifting of the global ban on British beef products, an EU spokesman said. The move is expected to be limited to declaring beef-derived gelatine safe.

<p>

Supermarket sales were strong during a week-long promotion of prime cuts of beef at one-third off the usual price. "We have been surprised by the strength of demand, especially for prime joints and steaks," a spokesman said. "Sales of sausages and mince, which many people associate with BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy], have been much slower.  Customers seem to be reassured by our guarantees that all our beef comes from animals under 30 months of age."

<p>

Under a deal struck with other European Union countries in Luxembourg last week, no meat can be sold for human consumption from animals older than 30 months. Hardly any animals younger than this have ever developed BSE, which has been linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

<p>

Gelatine, used in a variety of products, was affected by the total ban on British beef exports imposed by the EU last month. Aspects of that ban are to be considered by the EU's Scientific Veterinary Committee. The World Health Organisation insists that gelatine poses no risk to people.

<p>

However, at the Smithfield wholesale market, Tony Riley, of the superintendent's office, said: "Beef sales are still so low that at the moment we are not even bothering to quote prices." About 31,500 tonnes, worth &#163;79 million, is being held in abattoir chiller-rooms and warehouses both here and abroad and on ships at sea because there is now no market for it, according to a survey by the Meat and Livestock Commission.




<h3><a NAME="Tighter">Tighter</a> Curbs on Mad Cow Disease (BSE)</h2>
by David Fletcher 4.16.96 <i>Electronic Telegraph</i>
<p>

New controls to prevent meat contaminated with mad cow disease getting
through to consumers are expected to be imposed today.
<p>
The move follows a disclosure by Douglas Hogg, Minister of Agriculture,
yesterday that he was considering tighter safeguards on abattoirs after 17
incidents in which traces of spinal cord -- a material banned from the human
food chain -- were found on beef carcasses in slaughterhouses. Several
breaches of the rules had been uncovered by state veterinary surgeons since
Mr. Hogg summoned abattoir operators to his office in Whitehall three weeks
ago for a dressing down. He demanded 100 per cent compliance with the rules
to protect public confidence on the safety of beef.
<p>
Mr. Hogg told farmers yesterday at Smithfield FarmTech, the new-look London
winter agriculture show, that he would be considering further measures to
tighten abattoir controls. He repeated, on the eve of Budget Day, that the
Government would not pay a penny to abattoirs to help with the cost of
complying with the strict hygiene controls to keep beef safe.
<p>
Mr. Hogg said he could not give a "100 per cent categorical guarantee" that
mad cow disease could not spread to people. But, he added, the scientific
evidence suggested that BSE could not be transmitted to humans. The
evidence suggested, he said, that Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) was not
the result of "the ingestion of beef and related material".
<p>
As part of the Government's controls against BSE, which has caused the
deaths of more than 155,000 cattle in Britain since 1986,
specified offal --
including the spinal cord, brain, thymus and spleen -- are banned from the
human food chain and must be destroyed. These materials are deemed the most
likely areas where the deadly BSE agent is found. BSE has never been found
in beef itself. But with beef sales now showing signs of damage from a
string of TV programmes and newspaper articles about increasing CJD victims,
ministers and farmers are dismayed about abattoir lapses which threaten to
undermine consumer confidence. The state veterinary service recently made
surprise visits to 193 abattoirs and in  92 found failings in the handling
of the high risk offal, While most breaches were "comparatively mild" -- such
as inefficient staining of discarded offal to keep them out of the food
chain -- there were 17 more serious breaches. In one case, a third of an
animal spinal cord was found attached to the beef carcass after it had been
dressed by slaughtermen.
<p>
Mr. Hogg regretted the current dispute between farmers and abattoir
operators who are trying to impose a 3.50 pound levy per animal on farmers
to meet the cost of disposing of unwanted offals.

<em>Daily Telegraph 10.4.96, p16</em>

<p>In France it was reported that the brain of a 26-year-old man who died in January in Lyon showed signs of CJD similar to those in the 10 British cases [see below]. The Health Ministry said that CJD would become a classified illness that had to be declared to the authorities to aid future studies of the disease. In Portugal a parliamentary inquiry was called for into the incidence of BSE in the country after allegations were made of a cover up. It was feared that the incidence of BSE and CJD had been inaccurately reported.  CJD was not a notifiable disease in Portugal until very recently. The Health Ministry released the names of 36 people who had died of CJD between 1980 and 1995. The figures were below the world average but contained cases among people aged 32 and 40 and 3 cases in the same area. A 66-year-old man was reported to have died in Italy from CJD, the first death from the disease in Italy for 3 years. It was not known how he contracted his disease but the case was not out of the ordinary for the population of the area, Verona.<br>

<p>Seven lectures given at the 28th meeting of the Swiss Society of Food Hygiene in 23 November 1995 have been published for German readers. They include: the history and epidemiology of prion diseases; the molecular basis of prion diseases; CJD in Switzerland and its risk of transmission; and risk analysis and epidemiology of BSE in Switzerland. The first case of BSE was first diagnosed in Switzerland in November 1990 and the numbers of cases have risen each year (9 in 1991, 15 in 1992, 29 in 1993, 64 in 1994 and 64 up to 7 November 199573 cases were estimated to occur in that year). A ban on animal-derived protein in feed was implemented in December 1990. The current peak of the epidemic and the incidence rate of the epidemic since the feed ban mirrored that seen in Britain and was in accordance with calculations made in 1991-92. No case of CJD acquired through treatment with growth hormone or gonadotrophins has been recorded and based on available epidemiological data the transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies through meat consumption was of no importance in the aetiology of CJD either.<p>

<a NAME="3"></a><h3>Prevention of spread of BSE</h3>

The World Health Organization has recommended a worldwide ban on feeding tissues from sheep, goats, cattle and other animals to livestock to prevent the further expansion within the animal or human food chain of the agent that causes BSE. WHO has also urged all countries to set up continuous surveillance and compulsory notification of cases of BSE and CJD and to conduct scientific studies to determine more accurately how CJD affects humans. The detection of additional cases of the new variant of CJD was also a goal.  The US Food and Drug Administration said that it would expedite regulations prohibiting all protein from ruminants in ruminant feeds.<p>


<em>International Herald Tribune 5.4.96, p5</em><br>





<p>The new Environmental Agency in the UK called on farmers to halt the practice of spreading blood and intestinal content from cattle on their land as fertiliser as there is the suspicion that any agent that causes BSE may enter the water supply through runoff into rivers, reservoirs and seepage into the water table. The urged a ban until the risks have been fully assessed. The ban was supported by an independent microbiologist and by the Institute of Waste Management. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) said that it had considered the risks and thought the risk was low. The National Rivers Authority, like the EA, had been alerted by residents of local use of waste contaminating water courses. Failures in slaughtering processes might have allowed banned offals from being mixed with permitted waste.<p>


<em>Sunday Times 31.3.96, p1.2</em>



<p>A farmer in the UK who had falsely claimed that 4 cows sold at auction were from a BSE-free herd was fined 10,000 on 15 April.<p>


<em>Independent 16 4 96, p2</em><br>





<p>Robert Rohwer, who studies spongiform encephalopathies at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, said that MAFF scientists theory that a highly resistant strain of scrapie had escaped inactivation in rendering plants and caused BSE was plausible but criticized them for not having conducted experiments similar to those done in Iowa, USA, in which scrapie-infected tissue was injected into cattle. In the Iowa experiments conducted since 1990 cattle have consistently become sick but not with an illness recognizable as BSE. Dr Rohwer suggests that BSE is a new disease which arose in a few cows which with repeated recycling through cows being fed with rendered cattle carcasses built up from levels too low to cause symptoms finally to emerge as an epidemic. If his theory were correct the ministers opinions on the risk to human health had been misguided. Other scientists have also expressed their view that the government had been too eager to accept the view that BSE was unlikely to affect humans, based on limited scientific understanding.



<p>Dr Sheila Gore of the Medical Research Councils biostatistics unit at Cambridge warned that there was a serious need to quantify the risk of maternal infection now that  cases of CJD were being seen in women of childbearing age. Such women might pass the disease on to their children before their symptoms manifested themselves. Dr John Wilesmith of the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge was conducting studies into the possibility of maternal transmission of BSE among calves born to cattle with BSE and to those without. Some 45 animals in the experiment had already died from BSE. Dr Gore called for the study to be unblinded and the results to date assessed.<p>

<p>Despite the EC offer to buy British beef into storage the British Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers said that it made no sense to put top quality beef into storage and that it was banking on the revival of the home market. The EC offered to buy 50,000 tonnes of European beef in April but only 140 tonnes were offered by British meat traders, compared with 4000 tonnes from Germany.<p>


<em>Guardian 13.4.96, p7/Daily Telegraph 13.4.96, p8/Financial Times 13-14.4.96, p4</em>



<p>The UK Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, told Members of Parliament that there might be a case for a tightly targeted selective culling policy to reduce the incidence of BSE. The policy is likely to involve herds most at risk from BSE. Consultations with farming organizations were to be held to devise cost effective proposals. The selective cull would be in addition to the cull of cattle aged over 30 monthssome 15,000 of which, mainly dairy cows, are slaughtered each weekthat may have been exposed to BSE. Mr Hogg said that there was no justification for wholesale slaughter of herds where there might have been some small degree of infection. However, the definition of which herds should be culled was a cause of deep concern to farmers. Owing to the structure of EU financing, some 66% of EU aid for compensation to farmers for the slaughter of cattle was likely to be deducted from the UKs rebate on it EU contribution in 1997, thus reducing overall Treasury receipts in 1997. Mr Hogg said that he was considering legal action against the EU over its continued ban on British beef exports.

<p>The UK government made up to 118 million of support available to livestock renderers following a call from the renderers association for government funds to pay for the removal of bones, offal and fat from abattoirs. Abattoir waste was now banned from animal feed, leading to up to 20,000 tonnes of waste going uncollected. Mr Hogg said that without such aid there was a significant risk that animal carcasses would be dumped, leading to serious environmental risks. Initially the government had announced temporary assistance of only 1.5 million. According to the Meat and Livestock Commission around 4000 people, almost 50% of the workforce, had been laid off by the 90 largest abattoirs and processing plants. Many plants had stopped operations or switched to part-time working. The crisis has hit not only abattoirs but auctioneers, processors and meat hauliers.



<p>Rules designed to keep cattle aged over 30 months out of the food chain have been worded in such a way to cover both domestic and imported beefthe UK is one of the main markets for Argentinean beefand refer not to the specific age of the cattle but to the number and type of teeth which can roughly identify the age of a cow. This wording has led to the virtual ban of beef imported from Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. As one meat trader put it: The meat we bring into this country from Argentina doesnt have teeth. Following complaints from farmers and butchers that the teeth pattern criteria were not working the ruling was redrawn.<p>

<p>In France, as a preventive measure, the government banned all offal from cattle more than 5 years old. All offal products from cattle born before 31 July 1991 were to be withdrawn from sale.

<ul>

<li>1.5 million a week was to be injected into the rendering industry which disposes of slaughterhouse waste;

<li>between 50 and 100 million (depending on uptake) would be made available for market support for beef in the form of an aid for the slaughtering of young male calves from dairy herds;

<li>the sale of beef from animals aged over 30 months was banned until specially licensed plants supervised by the Meat Hygiene Service had been established. This meat would then be deboned before it was put on sale. The trimmings would be kept out of any food chain;

<li>a new Specified Bovine Material Order had been made introducing the requirement that the whole head (including cheek meat) of cattle over 6 months of age, except for the tongue (provided that it is removed without contamination) should be treated as a Specified Bovine Offal.

</ul>

<p>Mr Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, also announced that final livestock headage payments would be 35 million more this year than last. SEAC announced that meat and bone meal should not be used as fertilizer on land to which ruminants have access.<p>

<a NAME="6"></a><h3>Cattle cull</h3>

The British Veterinary Association warned the government that its members would refuse to take part in a mass cull of cattle in the attempt to eradicate BSE. It said that widespread killing of healthy cattle could not be justified scientifically or morally and was comparable to the burning of witches. The Association did not believe that the needless destruction of animals would accelerate the already fast decline in cases of BSE. Mr Bob Stevenson, the president of the Association said that We cannot burn cows to convince European politicians that pubic health is safeguarded. The price of allaying public concern cannot be killing fields. Individual farmers had responded to the possibility of culling of healthy cattle by warning that they would barricade their farms to prevent the slaughter taking place. The delay in any announcement by the government of what it proposed to do was blamed for causing confusion. Consumer organizations pointed out that mass slaughters as gestures to help public confidence do not work, citing the mass slaughter of chickens after the salmonella scareafter the slaughter of 3.5 million chickens and the closure of 9800 poultry businesses, cases of salmonella had still increased.<p>

<p>In March the owners of the less than 20 incinerators in the UK that are equipped to deal with the destruction of infected cattle met at a meeting of the Licensed Animal Slaughterers and Salvage Association to discuss what could be done if a cull were called. Any of the proposed options would put a strain on the system. Other suggested means of disposal such as burial in pits, burning in open fields or in power stations, or rendering and dumping at sea met objections from environmental groups. The government denied reports that it had considered dumping at sea but proposed  the use of burial of minced possibly infected cattle parts in authorized pits.<p>

<p>The National Farmers Union said that cattle farmers were considering suing animal feed companies for negligence in causing the BSE epidemic through contaminated feed. However, any legal action would be complicated not only by the need to prove the link between cattle feed and BSE but by major changes in the structure and ownership of animal feed companies since the identification of BSE in the 1980s. Suppliers deny that there is any proof that BSE was transmitted by animal feed. In early April bankers and agricultural accountants urged farmers not to panic and said that loans were still available for farmers.<p>

<p>A US scientist who has devised a test for CJD suggested that it may be of use in the diagnosis of BSE-infected cattle and aid in selective slaughter.

He insisted that the decision on 23 March to stop using British beef was market driven by a collapse in customer confidence. He said that as soon as customer confidence returned McDonalds would resume buying British beef. Sir David Naish, the president of the National Farmers Union, said that the BSE crisis had arisen from the drive for a cheap food policy dating back to the end of World War II. He expressed his regret that some parts of the industry had broken rules, including farmers who had allowed diseased cattle to enter the food chain.<p>

<a NAME="8"></a><h2>Product safety</h2>

A meeting of 30 international experts ruled that milk and gelatine were safe, even in countries with a high prevalence of BSE and that with adequate measures there was minimal risk from meat and beef products. The European Commission accepted the World Health Organization advice that gelatine was safe but EU veterinary experts refused to ease the restrictions on gelatine and tallow. The standing veterinary committee did not vote on the issue when it became clear that there was no support for the lifting of the ban. When the ban was first imposed the chairman of the technical committee of the Gelatin Manufacturers of Europe said that he was staggered and appalled by the decision as there was a lot of scientific data to show that gelatine is perfectly safe. There has never been any scientific question of gelatine being related to BSE.

Mad Cow Disease' and the Decline of UK Beef</h3>April 8, 1996<p>

<blockquote>Several EU countries have banned the import of British beef products and
live animals. These countries include France, which makes up 50 per cent of
the British export market.
<p>

The price of cattle at England's biggest cattle auction suffered a severe
drop today.

Many British schools have declared beef "off the menu" until further notice.


Public confidence in  the beef industry, in the UK, is said to be "hanging
by a thread."

<p>
Despite the admission that a connection between CJD and BSE is likely,
the government is STILL claiming that British beef is safe to eat
because since 1989 cows diagnosed as having BSE have been destroyed
and all specified bovine offals, thought to contain the infective
agent, have been removed and not passed into the human food chain.
<p>
Previous independent studies have shown that for every one infected
cow discovered and removed from the slaughter house, at least two more
infected cows get passed as safe and do enter the food chain. 

Scientists have also begun to say that the infective agent is not
limited to the specified bovine offals but is found throughout the
carcass.

The number of countries which have joined a boycott of British beef products
has now risen to 11.
<p>
 A meeting, being held in Britain, will decide whether or not parents should stop feeding beef products to children
-- there are fears that the new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is
more prevalent in younger people.
<p>
To date 158,882 cattle, from 33,292 farms, have been killed
due to being suspected of having BSE. The scientific panel which advises the
British government on BSE are expected to decide this weekend whether or not
to recommend the slaughter of all 12 million cattle in Britain.
<p>


There have been reports of similar diseases showing up in cats, dogs, mink
and other animals.
<p>
In the meantime, feed manufacturers have been ordered not to use any mammal
meat or bone meal in agricultural feedstuffs.

<p>
There is a possibility that Canadian and US consumers could be at risk,
according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine's president,
Dr. Neal Barnard. Barnard points out that the feed given to North American
cattle includes the remains of other animals.
<p>
In another report, British farmers are complaining that the Government is doing
little or nothing to help them with the drop in value of cattle, or on what
to do with thousands of cattle that are now ready for market.
<p>
Some are also complaining that it is costing 450 pounds per day to feed
grain to the cattle, that it is too soon to put them out to grass, and that
there is a severe shortage of hay due to last summer's drought in Britain.
They say that they cannot continue to go on doing this for much longer
without emergency funding from the Government.
<p>
Paul Temple, a farmer in Driffield, East Yorkshire stated, in an interview
with the Telegraph, that farmers suspected that BSE was more widespread
throughout Europe than is admitted. He claims that in France, cattle with
BSE were being diagnosed as suffering from magnesium deficiency which, at a
certain stage, makes cattle unable to stand.
<p>

CBC radio reports that the British Government, acting on the advice of their
scientific advisory committee, has decided that there is no need to order any
extermination of the British cattle herd. They also decided that no other
further action, apart from what they announced last week, is necesary.
In the same report, it was revealed that a herd of cattle in France has been
destroyed following the detection of one cow in the herd with BSE.

<p>
The EU today decided on a total ban of all British beef, beef
products and the import of live cattle and semen. Burger King and Wimpey
burger restaurants have banned the use of British beef in their burgers
together with McDonalds.

Also in Britain, it is reported that all cattle auctions were closed today,
as the price of beef was thought to be too low to make a sale justified.
<p>
In an interview with CBC Newsworld's Early Edition, Franz Fichler, the EU
Agriculture Commissioner, also attacked the British Government for their
statements over the weekend suggesting the possible slaughter of part, or
all, of the cattle herd, then making a statement today stating that they
would not be doing so.


Fichler, in response to a question about the slaughter of a herd in France,
stated that all cases of BSE in France and other EU countries were directly
linked to the United Kingdom, either because they were imported from the UK,
or were fed on food manufactured in the UK.
<p>
In another interview Professor Richard Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds
University, stated that he believed the Government had been misleading the
public since BSE first emerged, and that all the measures that are now in
place should have been taken at the start of the outbreak. 
<p>
"They seem to be banning cows one bit at a time," said Lacey. "First you
can't eat the brain, then the internal organs and now the head, minus the
tongue. What is next?", asked Lacey.

<h4>The <A NAME="Logic">Logic</A> of the 'Mad Cow' Scare </h2>
<h5>By JOHN DARNTON</h5>
March 30, 1996 ... Copyright NY Times
<p>   
LONDON  --  Politics and food intermingle. Ask any candidate who
has followed the campaign ritual through New York City, eating his
way caterpillar-like through the ethnic neighborhoods. The kosher
hot dog, the Irish soda bread, the cannoli, the kielbasa. Food as
tribal bonding: I eat what you eat; vote for me.
<p>   Food and politics involve trust. The mayor, the statesman, the
prime minister  --  all are entrusted to carry out the public will out
of view. The food consumed, so remote from the farm and the
slaughterhouse, is accepted as safe and healthful even though we
cannot see how it is prepared. That guarantee is one duty the
government normally fulfills almost without thinking.
<p>   And food can become a sounding board for politics. It can become
a slogan: "A chicken in every pot." An impulse to revolution:
"Let them eat cake." Or a derogatory nickname for an entire
tribe: the "limeys" of England, "krauts" of Germany or
"frogs" of France. You are what you eat.
<p>   For generations the French called the British "les rosbifs."
The mantle was worn proudly here for, as The Times of London noted
in a forlorn editorial last week, centuries ago beef had become the
metaphor for the emerging world power, John Bull. Lesser countries
on the continent raised swine to eat and used oxen as plow animals.
<p>   In England, blessed by luxuriant green pastures, the cow was
king and its flesh empowered the British navy, spread the empire
and, in the vision of artists like James Gillray and William
Hogarth, symbolized liberty.
<p>   "A nation of beefeaters was sturdy, handy with a knife or
sword, prosperous and free," remarked the newspaper. And today:
beef has become "another national institution in which the nation
has no confidence."
<p>   What happened in Britain, in the space of a week, was a new
phenomenon: a scare over a single product changed the eating habits
of a nation and spread throughout Europe and the world. Some felt
the fear of mad cow disease may have originated in vague and
free-floating anxieties over unknown hormones, additives and
food-processing techniques performed out of public sight.
<p>   Against this fear, the pleadings of government officials and
scientists  --  themselves responsible for much of that public
uncertainty  --  were futile. And thus the nation's trust in the food
supply was undermined in a thoroughly modern way.
<p>   The scare brought Britain to loggerheads with its exasperated
European partners at a summit meeting in Turin, and pushed the $6.5
billion-a-year British beef industry to the point of collapse. The
lack of confidence in beef became bound up with  --  and was partly
caused by  --  a lack of confidence in the Conservative government of
Prime Minister John Major, whose ministers defended the meat as
safe, shouting into the wind. Simply put, few believed them.
<p>   The cause of the furor was a government announcement of a
suspected link between a fatal brain disease in cattle, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, and a similar one in humans,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Scientists tracking the disease had
turned up 10 cases of a new variant that uncharacteristically
afflicted young people.
<p>   The story was not new: for six years there had been speculation
about a link between the two. The story of mad cow disease was an
on-again, off-again staple of the tabloids. But the problem was
always on the periphery. The government denied the link, and many
disregarded the reports as they dug into the traditional Sunday
"joint," or roast.
<p>   Not so this time. Sales of beef plummeted 70 percent, cattle
markets were deserted and the European Union imposed a ban on its
export worldwide. Major blamed "hysteria" and said it was whipped
up by the press and opposition politicians.
<p>   But truth was, there was not hysteria loose in the land. What
there was was deep concern, a calculated decision to stop eating
beef until the situation clarified, and a sudden, total lack of
confidence in what the government or its scientific experts were
saying.
<p>   The suspicions that had been building up for six years suddenly
reached a critical mass and the result was a spontaneous boycott.
Hamburger chains stopped serving British beef not because it was
deemed unsafe but because people refused to eat it.
<p>   
<p>   On a practical level, there was some reason for skepticism. The
government said beef products currently on the market were
risk-free because a 1989 law forced slaughterhouses to dispose of
the bovine offal  --  brains, spine and related parts  --  thought to
carry the infection.
<p>   But people know that laws are one thing and obeying them
another. Surprise random inspections in September showed that half
of the slaughterhouses were in violation of the regulations.
<p>   The problem began, many believe, when feed containing infected
sheep remains was fed to cattle as a protein supplement; farmers
were supposed to dispose of the infected feed, but some of them
undoubtedly used up their remaining stock.
<p>   Up until 1990 the government paid a farmer only 50 percent
compensation for a cow afflicted with BSE, so there was an
incentive for farmers to keep the disease hidden. Last week a
farmer went on trial in Dunster for 34 offenses of alterating
declarations that claimed  --  falsely  --  that his herd was free of
BSE.
<p>   The government's denials were not believed in part because many
feel that its machinery of enforcement was not up to the job. The
general lack of confidence in what government officials were saying
applied as well to what its inspectors and enforcers were doing.
<p>   Scientific advisers were asked to quantify the risks of eating
beef, or coming down with the disease from having eaten beef before
1989, and they were stumped. How were they to know if the 10 cases
represented a blip from an unusual and minor disease strain or the
beginnings of a massive epidemic? Some stammered inarticulately  -- 
which was itself taken as a sign of covering up  --  and others
blurted out nightmare scenarios.
<p>   Few understood that when it comes to safety in food, the
perception of risk is not mathematical. It's psychological. One
young man who gave up beef explained his decision this way: "They
say the risk of getting the disease is one in a million or about
the same as winning the lottery. And that may be true. But every
week I play the lottery."
<p>   A psychologist in a London suburb, who served American guests
fish last Sunday instead of the traditional roast, said she thought
the beef crisis crystallized "all our fears about what goes into
food, about hormones and chemicals and genetically engineered
tomatoes and all the other things in the environment that we can't
control."
<p>   In other words, runaway science itself was on trial. It was
undoubtedly a coincidence in timing, but only two weeks before the
scare over mad cow disease, which is thought to have originated in
the centuries-old disease in sheep called scrapie, the front pages
of newspapers carried photographs of two identical sheep.
<p>   They were clones produced from a laboratory-grown cell, and
occasioned a certain amount of clucking about the abominations that
man is perpetrating upon nature.
<p>   With public faith shattered, the British government's response
to the crisis  --  adopting a partial ban on the sale of beef from
older cattle  --  may not be dramatic enough to restore consumer
confidence. Without it, British beef, and so Britain itself, is
laid low.
<p>   As the Times editorial put it:
<p>   "Other nations have had their metaphorical mascots in nature
threatened. America has seen the bison leave the prairies, giant
redwoods felled and the bald eagle face extinction. The Russians
have seen the sturgeon, whose eggs proclaimed imperial greatness as
assuredly as M. Faberge's, succumb to pollution. The French saw the
vines that furnished their finest product blighted forever by
phylloxera, and the Irish search for self-sufficiency has always
been more urgently sought and more poignantly elusive since the
potato famine.
<p>   "But none of these nations has suffered a blow, so
precipitately, to its esteem as Britain this week."
<p>

<h2>Europeans <A NAME="Vow">Vow</A> to Help Britain Fight Mad-Cow Disease</h2>
<h5>By JOHN TAGLIABUE</h5>
<p>   
<p>  TURIN, Italy  --  Seeking to defuse a dispute that threatened to
drive Britain away from a united Europe, European leaders Friday
promised Britain financial aid to combat mad cow disease in its
livestock and reclaim its export market in beef.
<p>   The leaders of Europe gathered here Friday in a long-scheduled
meeting to advance the cause of unity. But all other questions were
overshadowed by the uproar over the possible risk to consumers of
eating British beef. The diseased beef has been linked to a rare
brain disease in humans.
<p>   British Prime Minister John Major, angry about the European
Union's ban on beef exports from his country but interested in the
group's financial assistance to help resolve the problem, had his
first face-to-face encounter with fellow European leaders since the
furor over so called "mad-cow" disease erupted.
<p>   He emerged from lengthy meetings sounding upbeat and relieved,
saying that Britain had been pledged "support, without any
qualification, across the board."
<p>   Other European leaders, who clearly wanted to prevent the beef
dispute from spilling over into other important negotiations about
the future of Europe, were also conciliatory.
<p>   Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini, the host of the meeting,
said the other leaders expressed "complete understanding and total
solidarity" with Britain.
<p>   He said the 15-nation European Union would provide technical and
financial assistance to help Britain eradicate mad cow disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and restore the public's
confidence in beef, an issue he said involved not only Britain, but
"the entire European Union and its beef markets."
<p>   However, no agreement was reached on the amount of aid that
Britain might receive to offset the cost of culling its herds and
to compensate its suddenly ailing livestock industry.
<p>   Continental leaders were especially anxious to end the dispute
with Britain quickly because Britain is already in many cases less
willing than some other countries to consider giving up sovereignty
to a united Europe, and the beef crisis threatened to widen the
gap.
<p>   As the leaders met, a separate working group including the
British agriculture minister and the European agricultural
commissioner was meeting in Brussels, discussing what measures
Britain should take to safeguard its beef and what financial aid
the European Union might provide.
<p>   It is widely expected that Britain will announce a program of
culling hundreds of thousands of older cattle in each of the next
several years, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars each
year.
<p>   Monday, all the union's farm ministers will meet in Brussels to
discuss measures to end the crisis.
<p>   The cooperative spirit evident Friday could disappear if they
cannot agree on specific corrective actions and the level of
European compensation.
<p>   In their one-day meeting in this industrial northern Italian
city Friday, the European leaders decided on a range of topics for
negotiations over the coming year to deepen European integration,
including proposals to require a majority vote, rather than a
unanimous one, for many key policy decisions, and to work toward
common defense and foreign policies.
<p>   They will also discuss ways to increase Europe's industrial
competitiveness and to combat mounting unemployment.
<p>   Echoing general satisfaction with the result, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said: "This is an important day for Europe."
<p>   If some leaders had come to Turin convinced that the
negotiations  --  Europe's most important deliberations since the 1991
Maastricht Treaty  --  would ultimately produce a two-track Europe,
where some nations led by France and Germany would proceed toward
unity faster than others, the group sought to dispel that fear.
<p>   "A two-speed Europe is not one of the community's aims," Dini
said at a news conference.
<p>   British delegates stressed that Major had come to Turin to seek
a lifiting of the ban on British beef imposed Wednesday. But the
most the other leaders would agree to was to examine the measures
Britain intends to take to restore its beef market and then decide
what sort of assistance to provide.
<p>   Following London's unexpected disclosure last week that a
neurological disease in British cattle might be linked to a
similar, fatal disorder occurring in humans, the European
Commission banned imports of British beef. There have been 10
recent cases of the human disorder in Britain recently, and 8 of
the victims are dead.
<p>   Major's government responded to the ban by assailing what it
termed hysteria in Brussels, the seat of the European Union.
<p>   For Major, the trip to Turin was a waltz throuigh a minefield.
Even as the prime minister sought financial solidarity, he and his
ministers insisted on their vision of Europe as a "partnership of
nations," rather than a kind of United States of Europe.
<p>   Among the measures the government leaders approved for
negotiation were a proposal to introduce majority voting in place
of unanimous voting on crucial policy questions and measures to
reduce unemployment in Europe, which at 11 percent, or 18 million
people, is roughly double the level in the United States.
<p>   
<p>   But several leaders, most notably the French President Jacques
Chirac, emphasized that efforts to liberalize labor markets should
not come at the expense of the traditional "European model" of
social security.
<p>   At a news conference, Major said Britain "sees no case" for
measures such as majority voting and reiterated his government's
opposition to what he called "back-door" steps to bolster
unaffordable social programs at the expense of European business
competitiveness.
<p>   Stressing the separation of debate on the beef crisis and on
other matters, Major's minister for Europe, David Davis, said:
"These are two completely separate issues."
<p>   Nevertheless, some European diplomats felt Major's words rang
stronger than the standing of his Conservative party back home.
They suggested the embarrassed plea for solidarity with Britain
created a debt that other European leaders would not hesitate to
call in in the future negotiations.
<p>   "Of course the European Union will provide help," said a
delegate from Germany, which backs majority voting and the defense
of social spending. he added: "Maybe this will teach people in
Britain that there is value in solidarity."
<p>   Kohl, however, was conciliatory, recalling at a news conference
how an epidemic of swine fever earlier this decade cost German pig
farmers $178 million in lost animals, of which $135 million was
reimbursed with European Union funds.
<p>   Like other leaders, Dini stresed that a firm link between mad
cow disease and similar disorders in humans "has not been proved,
and has not been disproved either."
<p>   He accused the press of whipping up "hysteria and panic" and
said that the leaders had lunched Friday on veal, "a beef meat,
without worries and without preoccupations."
<p>   European Commission president Jacques Santer said a decision on
the form of assistance for Britain would likely emerge from
meetings in Brussels on Monday of European agricultural ministers.
<p>   An agricultural fund of roughly $5 billion is available, though
Santer has said recently he sought to loosen perhaps half that
amount to pay for public works projects across Europe to ease
unemployment.
<p>   In any case, diplomats pointed out that Britain would stand to
forfeit about 60 cents of every dollar it now receives in aid to
its unprofitable farm sector as a result of payments to toward
resolving the beef crisis.

 Fact Sheet N1 ... 13 March 1996
</b><p>

<b>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)</b> first came to the attention of the

scientific community in November 1986 with the appearance in cattle of a

newly-recognized form of neurological disease in the United Kingdom.  

Between November 1986 and May 1995 approximately 150 000 cases of

this newly-recognized cattle disease were confirmed from approximately

33500  herds of cattle in the UK.  Epidemiological studies in the United

Kingdom  at that time suggested that the source of disease was cattle feed 

prepared from carcasses of dead cattle, and that changes in the process of 

preparing cattle feed introduced in 1981-1982 may have been a risk factor. 

Speculation as to the cause of the appearance of the disease in the food

chain of cattle has ranged from spontaneous occurrence in cattle, the

carcasses of which then entered the cattle food chain; to entry into the

cattle food chain from the carcasses of sheep with a similar disease.  <p>



  BSE is associated with a transmissible agent, the nature of which is not

yet fully understood. The agent affects the brain and spinal cord of cattle 

and is characterized by sponge-like changes visible with an ordinary 

microscope.  It is a highly stable agent, resisting heating to normal cooking

temperatures and even higher temperatures such as those used for

sterilization, freezing, and drying.  The disease is fatal for  cattle within

weeks to months of its onset.<p>


 By May 1995, BSE had been reported from 10 countries and areas outside

the  United Kingdom.  In one group of countries - France, Portugal, Republic

of  Ireland and Switzerland - the disease occurred in native cattle, and this 

was thought to be in part related to importation of cattle feed from the 

UK.  In another group - Falkland Islands, Oman Sultanate,

Germany, Canada,  Italy and Denmark - cases were only identified in cattle

imported from the  UK.<p>



 In July 1988 the UK banned the use of cattle carcasses in the preparation 

of cattle feed, and in 1989 the UK banned the use of brain and spinal cord - 

as well as tonsil, thymus, spleen and intestine - of cattle origin (known  as

Specified Bovine Offals or SBOs) in foods for human consumption.  Cattle

are continuously monitored for BSE in all affected countries, and BSE is

decreasing in the UK.<p>



 BSE is one of several different forms of transmissible brain disease of

animals.  Others include scrapie, a disease common in sheep; a similar

neurological  disease in animals such as the mink, mule deer and elk; and,

recently, neurological  disease in household cats, the majority of which

appear to have been in the United Kingdom.<p>



 Diseases in humans with sponge-like findings in brain under the

microscope, and with  severe and fatal neurological signs and symptoms,

include kuru, a disease  which appears to be transmitted by human ritual

handling of bodies and brains of the dead; and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

(CJD). CJD occurs in a  form associated with a hereditary predisposition

(approximately 10% of  cases); and in a more common, sporadic form that

accounts for the remaining  90%.  In recent years, it has been shown that

CJD can be transmitted to  humans by treatment with natural human

growth hormone or grafting of tissues surrounding human brain, and these

means of transmission have now  been controlled in the industrialized

countries where these procedures were  practised.  Another similar human

disease is Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome  which appears to be familial,

occurring in persons with an apparent hereditary predisposition.<p>


The most recent WHO meeting compared the annual number of cases of

CJD in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  This

comparison showed that rates were similar in all these countries 

(approximately 1 per million), as was the age distribution and duration of

illness prior to death.  Cases reported from the United Kingdom were those

which were identified through routine reporting and from an intensified 

surveillance system for CJD-like illness which had been set up in 1990.  <p>



Conclusions of this meeting were that the epidemiological evidence in

Europe did not indicate a change in the incidence of CJD that could be 

attributed to BSE; and that if the measures taken in the United Kingdom

regarding cattle feed and SBOs for human consumption, as well as other

precautionary measures at farm, slaughter and meat processing levels were

being strictly implemented, the risk of BSE transmission, and therefore of

possible transmission of BSE to humans, would be minimized. 

 <p>



 During the past ten months, 10 humans in the United Kingdom have been 

identified with what appears to be a variant of CJD.  The onset of the  first

case appears to have been as early as February 1994, and 8 of the 10 

patients have died to date.  These ten cases are all under the age of 42 

years and some have had behavioural changes at the onset.  All 10 cases 

have had a prolonged course of disease.<p>

 Results of patient interviews and medical history, genetic analysis and 

testing for other possible causes of this disease were reviewed by the 

United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Spongiform Encephalopathy which 

concluded that "although there is no direct evidence of a link on current 

data and in the absence of any credible alternative the most likely 

explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE 

before the introduction of the specified bovine offal ban in 1989".   On 20 

March 1996 the United Kingdom officially reported the cases and

conclusions of this Committee in a press conference. <p>


 In the light of the new information on the 10 human cases of variant CJD 

reported by the United Kingdom on 20 March 1996, a WHO meeting of 

international experts in neurology, transmissible spongiform

encephalopathies, epidemiology, veterinary science and public health  is

being organized at WHO Headquarters in Geneva on 2-3 April 1996. 


<hr>

<H3><A NAME="4">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</A></H3>

The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee announced that children are no more susceptible to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) than the rest of the population, after considering further genetic information on the 10 new cases of CJD and consultation with a paediatrician, an immunologist, and a gastroenterologist. According to government statistics there were 40 cases of CJD in Britain in 1995 compared with 54 in 1994. About 15% had a genetic basis, others were sporadic, for which no cause is known, usually in persons aged over 60. Some cases are still occurring in people who have been treated with contaminated growth hormone manufactured from human pituitary glands. Tests to establish whether the transmissible agent is related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are being done through the strain typing of necropsy material, results of which will not be known for up to 2 years. SEAC emphasizes that it cannot confirm that BSE is responsible for the new cases and that if it is there are still no date on the dose needed for infectivity and the magnitude of any species barrier that should theoretically limit transmission from cattle to humans. Editorials in the <I>British Medical Journal</I> consider the link between BSE and CJD, and failures in epidemiology.<P>


<EM>British Medical Journal, 1996, 312(Mar 30), 795/P Brown, ibid 790-791/S M Gore, ibid 791-793/Guardian 26.3.96, p1</EM><BR>

<P>The President of the Royal Society, Sir Aaron Klug OM, said that it was entirely possible that BSE could infect humans, other species fed on infected material have been infected with BSE despite the barriers against prions from one species infecting another. Although the sheep form of the disease, scrapie, is known not to infect humans, it has infected cattle, causing BSE. The new variant of CJD that has emerged recently could be related to BSE. BSE is particularly difficult to study and the present state of knowledge does not allow the estimation with any real confidence of the degree of risk that the BSE epidemic poses to human health. However, scientific experiments currently under way and due to be completed within the next year or so should help to establish whether there is a connection. Several possible approaches to inhibiting or treating BSE were being actively investigated. Sir Aaron pointed out that further approaches could emerge from the continuing basic research in the general area of prion diseases. Such basic research should therefore be supported fully and urgently. He added that rigorous implementation of regulations to remove infectious material from the human and animal food chains should lead to a considerable lowering of the risk of exposure of humans to BSE.<BR><HR>


<h3><A NAME="Patties">Patties</A> Face Uncertain Future</h2>

LONDON -- The mad cow scare has left huge stockpiles of frozen hamburgers at McDonald's and Wimpy, patties that face an uncertain future after the fast-food giants banned British beef.

   "It is more than likely everything will be destroyed," said Katherine Young, a spokeswoman for Wimpy International Ltd. "You're going to be looking at millions of burgers."<p>

McDonald's is not sure what to do with its unwanted Mcmeat as Britain's biggest fast-food restaurants wrestles with the logistical difficulties of switching to non-British beef. "They're still in the freezer," said McDonald's spokeswoman Veronica Foster. "Our first concern is to get the beef back in the restaurants."<p>

Both McDonald's and Wimpy, the No. 1 and No. 3 burger chains in Britain, put beef back on the menu today after three days of doing burgerless business.
McDonald's was frying Dutch patties at its British restaurants.<p>

The No. 2 player, Burger King, reacted more slowly than its rivals to the crisis fueled by the government's acknowledgement that several cases of an incurable brain disease could be linked to British beef.

Burger King said it will keep serving British beef until it runs out, although it plans by Saturday to be making Whoppers exclusively with beef from other European countries.<p>

 "I won't go to McDonalds any more," London cabbie Pete Hambri told a reporter on Wednesday. He went to Burger King instead.<p>

The switchover has thrown the burger companies into a frenzy, with trucks running all over the country to pick up British burgers than won't be sold, processing plants running flat-out to make burgers from foreign beef and workers rushing to stock the restaurants with the meat from anywhere but Britain.<p>

 The flight from British beef began March 20, when the government dropped its bombshell about a potential link between mad cow disease and the fatal human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Politicians from Prime Minister John Major on down insisted British beef was safe and said they plan to keep eating it, but worldwide reaction was swift and uncompromising.<p>

More than 20 countries banned British beef, and the European Union on Wednesday ordered Britain to stop exporting cattle, beef and beef products.
 The scare has affected not only beef from Britain but also from other European nations with a history of mad cow disease. Iran canceled orders for Irish beef today and last week Egypt banned all European beef.<p>



   Executives at Wimpy spent several nervous days assessing the situation, then carefully monitored customer orders last Saturday. They found up to half of their beef-eating customers had switched to chicken, fish, pork or vegetarian bean burgers.<p>



   On Sunday, Wimpy executives pulled all British beef out of their supply system.
   Considering all the burgers in the 271 Wimpy restaurants, plus those in the company's frozen food distribution system and manufacturing plant, untold millions of patties are being stockpiled in a freezer depot. They will likely wind up in an incinerator unless the government can assure their safety before the meat gets too old to serve.



   Wimpy moved quickly to buy beef in Ireland, with smaller amounts coming from Holland and France. It would not comment on whether foreign beef dealers took advantage of the situation by raising prices.

 Wimpy had no plans to increase the retail price and planned to swallow any short-term cost increases, Young said.<p>
McDonald's also announced Sunday it was yanking British beef off the menus at its 660 British restaurants and switching to other sources. McDonald's was too busy trying to get beef back on the menu to discuss the logistics of the crisis Wednesday.

 Neither company would comment on how much the decision to stop serving British beef has cost them.<p>

   Burger King, which announced Monday it was switching to foreign beef, was cagier about how its customers responded, although it said some were still eating British burgers at its 382 British restaurants.

"We've seen a doubling of chicken sales," said Burger King spokeswoman Alli Millitch. "I don't have the numbers of beef sales."



   She was unable to explain why Burger King would comment only on chicken sales during a crisis that threatens Britain's entire beef industry.<p>

<I>London Times 9 May 1996</I> ... Last year Tesco overtook Sainsbury for the first time in 15 years to become the country's biggest supermarket chain, and last month it announced higher sales and a 15 per cent increase in profits.<P>
 
Almost half of the decline could be put down to the cost of converting the recently-acquired

<I>The Times May 08 1996</I>...
SIR MICHAEL PERRY, chairman  of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group that owns Birds Eye frozen  foods, is the first leading City figure  to put pressure on the Government to take  more decisive action on the  crisis. <P>Sir Michael, speaking at yesterday's  annual meeting, said that the blame for  the fiasco over the BSE crisis lay with  the UK and not in Europe. He said: "There  is a tendency in some quarters to portray  the sources of the troubles in the BSE fiasco  as lying abroad, particularly in the hands  of our European partners. This is not where  they lie. They lie at home and it is here,  in the United Kingdom, where the solutions  must be sought." Sir Michael said consumer  confidence is the issue at the heart of  the BSE scare and the UK food companies  have sought to assure consumers of the quality  and safety of their beef products. <P>Last week Unilever  revealed that it had written off &#163;15  million for the cost of wasted stock after  it halted its Birds Eye frozen beefburger  production line. <P>The Birds Eye frozen  food operation stopped making beefburgers  at its factory in Lowestoft, Suffolk. The  1,000 workers at the plant were moved to  other production lines. <P>March's decision  came after the Government confirmed the  possibility of a link between BSE and CJD,  its human equivalent. <P>The cost effectively  wiped out the gain in profit made by the  rest of its European operations during the  first three months of this year.

A statement from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities that was to recommend that 

beef dishes be returned to school menus was withdrawn at the last minute. Some 10,000 schools 

and education authorities across England and Wales decided to remove beef from school menus. 

Others were reviewing their policy. This is the second wave of bans in schools in the past 3 

months. Bans had previously been put in place after Sir Bernard Tomlinson, a leading

THE Wimpy fast-food chain announced yesterday it is to lift its ban on British beef immediately &#173; the first good news the beleaguered cattle industry has had in weeks (Michael Hornsby writes).

Max Woolfenden, the managing director, said: "We have seen a great improvement in customer confidence." Wimpy, with 272 restaurants, said it would still sell burgers made from beef imported from Holland, France and Ireland, but customers could no longer be able to choose.

In the Commons, the Prime Minister said he was "delighted" by the news, the first sign that government measures to allay public panic over "mad cow" disease might be starting to work.

<CENTER><B><A NAME="BLAME">BLAME</A> FOR BEEF</B></CENTER> 
London Times ...  2 May 1996

The destruction of aged British cattle to take the most dangerous class of animals out of the food chain was officially launched yesterday, six weeks after the Government first disclosed that new evidence suggested a possible link between BSE and its human equivalent. This operation should have been planned with precision: it was the Government's opportunity to demonstrate that it was at last firmly in charge of events. The agriculture ministry needed to achieve three important objectives: to restore confidence in the meat industry,to reassure the public that all health risks were being decisively addressed and to convince other European Union countries that British management justified at least partially relaxing the export ban.

<P>

The task of competent reassurance should not have been an overwhelming one. In normal circumstances, 13,000 old dairy cattle and around 6,000 over-age beef cattle a week would be sent for slaughter at this season. The proposed programme is more complicated than normal slaughtering procedures since carcasses will have to be boiled down in rendering plants before incineration or burial. But six weeks should have been time enough to organise the properly supervised destruction of a slightly higher weekly total.

<P>

Instead, guidance appears to have been issued to abattoirs only on Monday. The Ministry of Agriculture's detailed guidance to farmers is being sent out only today. The general circulars so far issued to the union and the farming press are obviously inadequate. The result is the opposite of that which the ministry intended.

<P>

Farmers need to know where and how to dispose of their beasts. Markets are unwilling to take these cattle until they know which abattoir they can send them to; abattoirs need to know where the carcasses are to be rendered down. The result of the failure to ensure that every link in this chain was in place before the starting date is embarrassment in the Intervention Board responsible for the cull, gloom in the Cabinet alleviated only by Wimpy's decision to put British beef back on the menu, and a new crescendo of complaint from farmers.

<P>

The farming community is not, of course, a blameless injured party, as some of the more self-righteous rumblings from the shires would suggest. Had all farmers co-operated meticulously in abandoning contaminated cattle feed and been rigorously honest about declaring suspected cases of BSE, the epidemic would have been much less severe. The Government can be faulted for failing to order the destruction of old stocks of feed: its other failures to police the rules were underlined this week by the discovery that a few cattle-feed mills are still, eight years after the ban, using sheep remains in feed. Tougher policing became essential primarily, however, because the industry ignored too many public health concerns.

<P>

The likelihood now is that the operational problems will be sorted out within a week. The political damage will be more difficult to contain. For the Government, this has been another instance of the bunglings that have been a feature of the entire BSE saga. Ministers should start now to look around the next corner. This slaughter programme is less than radical and may not be enough to satisfy the EU's veterinary committee, let alone the EU agriculture ministers whose concern is not only public health, but the collapse of their own beef markets. The Government should give serious thought to destroying animals of any age which have been sold on from herds in which cattle have died from BSE.

<P>

There is no instant solution and the public is aware of that. What people demand is certainty that the steps being taken are sufficient to eradicate BSE, and that within a foreseeable period it will be possible confidently to certify herds as BSE-free. Meanwhile there is little gain in blaming Brussels or Britain's EU partners for this crisis. The public knows better.

<B><CENTER>How to <A NAME="rescue">rescue</A> British beef</CENTER></B><P>

London Times ...  2 May 1996 ... Clive Aslet<P>





The word "shambles" originally meant a slaughter-house. Nothing could better describe the implementation of the slaughter policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, supposed to begin yesterday.

<P>

As the nation contemplates the chaos amid which thousands of healthy cattle are going to their deaths, it has to be asked how much longer the ministry itself can survive. For years it has been trying to adjust itself to the modern world, in which maximising production is no longer an imperative and consumers are increasingly aware of what they are eating. But the new clothes never seemed to fit. Now the BSE scare has shown that the ministry is wearing no clothes at all.

<P>

Over the past decade, the policies established to combat "mad cow" disease have largely been right: hence the steep fall in new cases, from 1,000 a week in 1993 to 200 or so now. At Frome, in Somerset, in the heart of dairy country, an incinerator built especially to dispose of infected cattle in 1990 has been closed for 18 months. Now, plans to convert it for the burning of hospital waste have been shelved, and it is likely to reopen to help cope with the consequences of the slaughter.

<P>

The irony is not lost on local farmers. The other day I talked to one, with a herd of 400 beef cattle, who has never had a case of BSE. His cattle are raised entirely on grass and his own silage, and so reach prime condition more slowly than animals fed high-protein diets, including those that used to contain the remains of other animals. As he observed, "this is the food that the public says it wants". Now, no cow more than 30 months old can enter the food chain, so many of his best cattle will be killed for no purpose. The waste is heartbreaking.

<P>

If BSE had been eradicated entirely, we would not now be suffering humiliation by the rest of Europe. That it has not been is due to the authorities' failure to ensure that policies were enforced. Farmers were not obliged to destroy old stocks of feed; feed manufacturers were not adequately supervised to prevent cross-contamination of cattle feed with pig and poultry feed, which continued to contain animal protein until a few weeks ago.

<P>

Even before BSE, the Country Landowners' Association and others had argued that the existing ministry should be replaced by a "ministry of the countryside", which would better reflect the increasing diversity of the rural economy than one responsible solely for food production. Now, the end of the Agriculture Ministry should herald a reformulation of Britain's agricultural priorities.

<P>

For years, Britain's intensive farmers have been living on borrowed time. They have trusted that the consumer would not inquire too closely into how food is produced. Farmers do not see themselves as being at fault in this. Led by science and government policy, they have been satisfying the demand for cheap food. But certain practices would revolt the public, if they were aware of them &#173; as they are at last becoming. The new knowledge is causing consumers to search their hearts about the ethics of food.

<P>

The common agricultural policy, with its milk quotas and set-aside, has tended to encourage farmers to maintain their profits by squeezing ever more milk from dairy cows and ever greater yields from their remaining arable land. This is lunacy. Those who espouse the most readily identifiable alternative to intensive agriculture &#173; the organic movement &#173; complain that even that proportion of the CAP allocated to green causes has not been paid to them. Lobbying by the National Farmers' Union ensured that it was used to establish a series of other environmental programmes which did not challenge the interests of the union's members.

<P>

As yet, the supermarkets do not find much of a market for organic produce, although I suspect the BSE crisis will cause people to turn to organic foods. In some ways (such as its belief in homoeopathy), the organic movement is still a bit loony. Not all food that is humanely and naturally produced carries an organic label. Take Welsh lamb, for example. The first object of the new ministry should be to devise and police its own scheme, guaranteeing quality in both the product and the means of production. Consumers should know, for example, that the use of antibiotics has been kept to a minimum.

<P>

Part of this endeavour should be a system of labelling. At present, there is distrust of the premium-grade labels in supermarkets, since careful wording can bamboozle the unwary. The meat trade has not been sufficiently rigorous in maintaining the authenticity of labels such as "Scotch beef". Labelling should allow the consumer to trace the origins of food, in the manner pioneered by Safeway. There should be a government register of BSE-free herds.

<P>

Eventually, we may find that the BSE scare has been no more than that: a scare. The link between BSE in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in young people has not been proved. It is at least conceivable that the reason a dozen or so cases of this apparently new form of the disease have been identified in Britain is that research into CJD, which is very rare, has long been here more advanced than elsewhere. Scientists do not really know if this is a completely new disease, a mutation of an old one, or one that has been around for a long time but never adequately diagnosed. If it exists in other countries, doctors might not be able to spot it, or to collate their information as efficiently as the British have.

<P>

But even a scare can threaten an industry. Oddly, it is the continentals who have fallen into a panic. In Britain, sales of beef have returned to 85 per cent of their level before the BSE announcement. In France, where no British beef is now being sold, this figure is only 75 per cent, in Germany a mere 50 per cent. This does not say much for the faith French and German consumers have in their own agriculture. Ultimately, it should represent an opportunity for Britain. We are being made to suffer grievously for the incompetence of our officials. But from the ruins we must build a system of agriculture that is acknowledged as the safest and most humane in the world.

<P>

To do this, we must first establish a new national beef herd, providing a nucleus of BSE-free breeding stock. These should be only beef animals, without calves imported from the dairy sector. Meat from old dairy cows should be sold under a different name from prime beef. None of our competitors can boast an industry of such guaranteed quality. If we act with vision now, British beef could, in time, regain its position as a world-leading industry.

Telegraph    ...   Thursday 16 January 1997</FONT><BR><BR>
Scientists warn today that there remains the potential for an <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">epidemic</B></FONT> of new variant <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</STRONG></FONT>, approaching <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">100,000</B></FONT> cases, even though only four cases have been confirmed since last March.<BR><BR>
Although the link between &quot;<STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease&quot;, BSE, and the new variant <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> has yet to be proven, and scientists remain ignorant of the disease process, the team said &quot;substantial uncertainty&quot; over the potential shape of the epidemic will remain for five years.<BR><BR>
Making many assumptions and using simple mathematical models, scenarios are examined in today's issue of Nature by Prof Peter Smith and Simon Cousens of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with Dr Robert Will of the National <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> Surveillance Unit, Edinburgh.<BR><BR>
&quot;This is not an enormously reassuring paper,&quot; said Prof Smith. &quot;There are going to be more cases, whatever the cause.&quot; Since 10 cases of the new variant of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> were reported in March there have been a further four confirmed cases and one in France, and another probable case was reported last month in Britain, said Prof Smith.<BR><BR>
The following tentative conclusions are drawn, &quot;backcalculating&quot; from the number of known cases and making various assumptions, for instance that the number of people infected each year was proportional to the number of BSE cases, and about how peaked or flat is the distribution of incubation times.<BR><BR>
 Even though there have been only 14 confirmed cases in Britain, <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">we cannot rule out the possibility of an epidemic involving many thousands of cases</B></FONT> , if the average incubation period is long, say 20 years or more.<BR><BR>
 The number of cases with onset in each of the next years may enable preliminary estimates to be made of the eventual size of the epidemic, but uncertainty will remain.<BR><BR>
 If the number of cases with onset in each of the years 1996 to 1998 remains low, below about 20 per year, then we would become more confident that the eventual epidemic may involve 100 cases or fewer and, under the models we have examined, it is unlikely that it would exceed a few thousand.<BR><BR>
 However, if the number of cases with onset in 1996 is 25 or more and there is a doubling or tripling of new cases in each of the two following years, then this would be compatible with an epidemic of many thousands.<BR><BR>
 On the other hand, 20 or so cases with onset in 1996, 30-35 in 1997 and about 50 in 1998 would be compatible with an epidemic of about 1,600 cases under some scenarios or nearly 16,000 under others, depending on the shape of the distribution of incubation periods.<BR><BR>
 The <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">worst case scenario of 80,000</B></FONT> cases depends on there having been 32 new cases last year. Even though it can take up to a year to diagnose, this looks unlikely to be realised because there are fewer than 32 potential cases.<BR><BR>
 Even in three or four years' time there will still be &quot;substantial uncertainty&quot; about the future course of the epidemic.<BR><BR>
 Best case scenario if BSE is linked to <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> is 75 cases, assuming the offal ban was 100 per cent effective, a mean incubation time of 10 years, and a certain distribution of incubation times. The worst case scenario is 80,000 cases, assuming the offal ban was only 90 per cent effective, with a mean incubation time of 25 years. If the incubation period is longer, there could be even more cases.<BR>

Financial Times    ...   Thursday January 16 1997</FONT><BR><BR>
Mr Jacques Santer, European Commission president, yesterday accused the UK of &quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">threats and blackmail</B></FONT> &quot; in its attempts to get the global ban on British beef exports lifted.<BR><BR>
In his strongest public criticism of Britain's handling of the beef crisis, Mr Santer said his first phone contact with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to discuss the problem had been &quot;rather an argument&quot;. Mr Major, he claimed, had threatened legal action against any Commission attempt to ban beef exports, even before the ban was imposed.<BR><BR>
Mr Santer <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">rejected allegations</B></FONT> - in a draft report by the European Parliament's special inquiry into <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</STRONG></FONT> (BSE) or <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease - that the Commission had put the interests of the beef industry ahead of public health.<BR><BR>
The UK, not the Commission, he added, had put &quot;political considerations&quot; first, by pursuing its non-co-operation campaign with EU business to try to force a lifting of the ban before there was firm evidence British beef was safe.<BR><BR>
&quot;I had a lot of difficulties with the British government, I was threatened often but never did I cede,&quot; Mr Santer told the inquiry committee, which released its draft report this week. &quot;I refused to let myself be influenced by political pressure, <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I refused to give in to blackmail</B></FONT> .&quot;<BR><BR>
A Downing Street official said: &quot;The prime minister has taken a firm line throughout our dealings with the commission. Our view was that the action taken in banning beef exports was unnecessary and disproportionate.<BR><BR>
&quot;We have not seen a transcript of Mr Santer's remarks today, but if phrases like blackmail were used we would not think them appropriate. In the main our dealings with the commission have been constructive.&quot;<BR><BR>
Mr Santer's comments came in a week when relations between the UK and EU have again been frosty. The European Commission warned it would take Britain to court if it approved the planned alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, while the parliamentary inquiry threatened legal action against Mr Douglas Hogg, UK agriculture minister, for refusing to appear before it.<BR><BR>
The Commission yesterday rounded on the UK for &quot;distorting&quot; its view of the BA-AA alliance, saying its objections were based entirely on the need to protect consumers.<BR><BR>
But UK officials said that Mr Van Miert appeared to have misunderstood the basis on which the Department of Trade and Industry had considered the proposed deal.<BR><BR>
The department said it was &quot;puzzled&quot; why Mr Van Miert had analysed the merger on the assumption the existing Bermuda 2 agreement restricting competition at Heathrow remained in place. The DTI had stressed its analysis was on the basis of complete liberalisation and scrapping of Bermuda 2.<BR><BR>
Foreshadowing further tensions, Mr Hans Van Mierlo, Dutch foreign minister, who will play a central role in attempts to agree a new EU treaty by June's Amsterdam summit, said the EU had to escape from the &quot;tyranny of the veto&quot;. Mr Van Mierlo insisted qualified majority voting should be extended to areas such as justice and home affairs, and, particularly, common EU foreign policy. Mr Major, however, has said Britain will not surrender its national veto.<BR>

Evidence published today marks a <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">serious setback</B></FONT> for the most promising theory of what causes <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease and <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</STRONG></FONT>.<BR><BR>
Spongiform diseases fascinate scientists because the agent that causes them appears quite different to bacteria, viruses and other classes of infectious agent. Increasing numbers of scientists believe that these diseases are caused by an infectious protein - a prion - which, unlike any other infectious agent, lacks genetic material.<BR><BR>
Today, however, a team from the neurovirology service of the French Atomic Energy Commission, near Paris, undermines this idea in a paper published in the journal Science, which describes the results of the first detailed study of what happens when BSE adapts to a new host.<BR><BR>
Dr Corinne Lasmezas, one of the team, said: &quot;Our work suggests that the transmissible component of the agent is not the abnormal prion protein, though prions do have an important role.&quot;<BR><BR>
The team found that neuronal damage and degeneration can occur without the build-up of the abnormal prion, thought to be an abnormally shaped form of a protein usually found in brain cells. They repeated an experiment undertaken by two teams in Britain, introducing some BSE-infected tissue into the brains of mice, but with a different approach.<BR><BR>
Half of the genetically identical mice showing neurological symptoms consistent with the disease had no build-up of abnormal prion protein, called PrPres, in the brain, said Dr Lasmezas. Nerve death and damage occurred both in the presence and absence of the abnormal prion protein, although the characteristic spongy brain appearance only occurred when abnormal prions were present.<BR><BR>
The team also found that the BSE infection could be passed on to other mice from the brains that contained no abnormal prion protein. The findings do not mean the prion is irrelevant to the disease, said Dr Lasmezas.<BR>

Telegraph    ...   Friday 17 January 1997</FONT><BR><BR>
Proposals to win back consumer confidence in beef by keeping track of all cattle in Britain have been discounted by farmers as a &quot;paperwork nightmare&quot;.<BR><BR>
The rejection is a blow to Government efforts to persuade the European Union to lift its export ban on British beef on the grounds that everything possible has been done to ensure the meat is safe. Under plans announced last month by Douglas Hogg, agriculture minister, farmers would have to meet costs of up to 25 million a year to run a database after the Government spent 5 million to set it up.<BR><BR>
But producers say they will not pay for it because it does not use enough computer technology and relies too much on paperwork and red tape including &quot;passports&quot; for cattle being moved. Bill Madders, a senior figure in the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales and chairman of the National Cattle Database Working Group, said: &quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">MAFF's proposals will create a bureaucratic paper nightmare</B></FONT> . They have suggested a paper-based system which will result in duplication and will not give the assurance needed to create consumer confidence.&quot;<BR><BR>
He said farmers should contribute towards the cost of running a national database only if it met their requirements. Farmers' leaders want a tracing scheme introduced speedily and criticised Ministry of Agriculture suggestions that it should be phased in over a number of years.<BR><BR>
They also want a computerised scheme, using electronic scanning devices to &quot;read&quot; ear-tags on animals and eliminate a mountain of paperwork. Under the plans farmers would pay an annual registration fee of 40 plus between 5 and 10 for every cattle passport issued.<BR><BR>
They would also pay another 50p for each animal movement recorded on the system. The Government has asked farmers and others in the livestock industry to comment on the plans. Mr Hogg has told farmers that it is in their own best interests to &quot;embrace the scheme wholeheartedly and reassure their customers about the quality of British beef&quot;.<BR><BR>
He has also said the scheme would not be implemented until the EU Commission in Brussels decided the format for a European-wide livestock traceability system. Farmers' leaders in Britain argue that no common standards have yet been set for the specification of electronic scanners for livestock.<BR>

Doctors have had to wait until death or take a sample of brain tissue to diagnose the 15 cases of the new variant that have been linked to the BSE epidemic. Both <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> and BSE are caused by an abnormal form of a brain protein called a prion. Preliminary evidence that the prion can be detected in the tonsils was published yesterday in the Lancet by Prof John Collinge and his team at the Imperial College School of Medicine at St Mary's, London, and Dr James Ironside, of the National <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> Surveillance Unit, Edinburgh.<BR><BR>
The team detected the rogue form of the prion protein in tonsil tissue taken from a 35-year-old woman who had died from the new variant of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT>. Taking a sample of tissue this way, under local anaesthetic, is a much simpler and safer procedure than a brain biopsy.<BR><BR>
A tell-tale signature of the protein was made by a technique called Western blot analysis, in which a protein is identified by its ability to move through a jelly under the influence of an electric field. The Western blot analysis of the tonsil biopsy of the new variant <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT> patient is not very similar to other forms of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT>, but is similar to that found in BSE, providing suggestive evidence of a link between the diseases.<BR><BR>
This finding, if confirmed on other patients, may allow a <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">faster and much simpler</B></FONT> method for diagnosing new variant and other types of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</STRONG></FONT>, which is significant, given that early symptoms - such as mood changes - occur in so many other diseases. It is possible that this new method may allow diagnosis before symptoms show.<BR><BR>
Prof Collinge said: &quot;It is very encouraging that we have been able to detect the marker in tonsil, as this tissue can be sampled relatively easily, usually under local anaesthetic. We now need to extend this initial study and see how early in the disease this marker may be useful.&quot;<BR><BR>
Last year a Dutch team reported that it had developed the test on sheep. The team found that it could detect the abnormal prion protein of scrapie in biopsies from the tonsils of 10-month-old sheep which had not shown any symptoms.<BR>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, has rejected claims that he could be <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">prosecuted</B></FONT> for refusing to give evidence to a European Parliament inquiry into the beef crisis.<BR><BR>
Mr Hogg said that if Euro-MPs attempted to take action against him in the European Court of Justice it would fail, as there was no legal basis for it.<BR><BR>
Reimer Boege, a German Euro-MP who led the Parliament's investigation into the handling of the BSE crisis, threatened court action yesterday, claiming that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Mr Hogg had failed to honour his legal obligations</B></FONT> .<BR><BR>
Mr Hogg told BBC radio that Mr Boege was wrong to suggest that he was answerable to the court. &quot;British ministers are accountable to the House of Commons.&quot;<BR><BR>
Several Euro-MPs on the inquiry committee had &quot;aspirations to exercise a supervisory role over ministers of sovereign states&quot;, Mr Hogg observed. &quot;I don't share that view.&quot;<BR><BR>
The court threat came as the Parliament met criticism from the Government and the European Commission over its draft report, which attacks Brussels and London for mismanaging the crisis.<BR><BR>
The report accused the Government of &quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">blackmail</B></FONT> &quot; tactics in trying to get the beef ban lifted, of slackness in failing to enforce a 1988 ban on feeding meat and bone meal to ruminants and of negligence in allowing export of the banned feed.<BR><BR>
Mr Hogg admitted that &quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">there were things that we should have done that we did not do</B></FONT> &quot;, but overall the British response was &quot;reasonable and proportionate&quot;.<BR><BR>
 Susannah Herbert, in Paris, writes: British animal feed - banned from France since 1989 - was entering by a &quot;laundering circle&quot; in Belgium and Ireland, a French MP said yesterday.<BR><BR>
Jean-Francois Mattei, president of a parliamentary committee investigating BSE, has taken evidence from 60 people before compiling a 250-page report. He denounced British officials for lack of co-operation and European Commission officials for sticking to economic criteria alone.<BR>

Times    ...   January 15 1997</FONT><BR><BR>
A further <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">confrontation</B></FONT> between the Government and the European Union was triggered yesterday by Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, when he dismissed the threat of legal action over his refusal to give evidence to a European Parliament inquiry into BSE .<BR><BR>
Mr Hogg, in a defiant performance which cheered Tory Eurosceptics, said that European Parliament committees had no power to summon British ministers. &quot;British ministers are accountable to the House of Commons. A number of members of the European committee have aspirations to exercise a supervisory role over the ministers of sovereign states. I don't share that view. I don't think we should encourage those aspirations.&quot;<BR><BR>
Mr Hogg was one of a number of senior politicians and EU officials called to give evidence to the four-month inquiry last year. But twice, to the fury of the European Parliament, he refused. He sent instead Richard Packer, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Mr Packer angered the inquiry committee when he claimed that BSE had been caused &quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">largely by an act of God</B></FONT> &quot;.<BR><BR>
A draft report by the committee published yesterday was highly critical of Britain's handling of the BSE crisis. It listed <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">13 charges of maladministration, negligence and irresponsibility in dealing with the &quot;<STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT>&quot; outbreak</B></FONT> .<BR><BR>
Reimer Bge, chairman of the inquiry, said yesterday that Britain should be <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">taken to the European Court</B></FONT> over Mr Hogg's refusal to attend, which he said breached an agreement that member states' ministers should co-operate with the inquiry.<BR><BR>
Herr Bge added: &quot;The legal position is clear. In domestic terms this is explosive stuff.&quot; Herr Bge, a German MEP, repeated the challenge to Mr Hogg to face the committee. &quot;It is quite clear that the minister has to come to a committee of inquiry if he is invited. If we let this matter pass, we will be setting a precedent for the future.&quot;<BR><BR>
Mr Hogg's uncompromising stance won support from Tory MPs, many of whom have been criticial of his handling of the BSE crisis, and Brussels observers predicted that legal action was unlikely to materialise. They believe Mr Hogg was deliberately flexing his muscles on an issue he knew he would win.<BR><BR>
Speaking on The World at One on BBC Radio, Mr Hogg brushed aside the legal threat. The minister, whose stance has been supported by Cabinet colleagues, said: &quot;The question is whether a minister should be summoned by a European committee to give evidence. The clear answer to that is 'No'. There is no treaty basis for that. If they bring legal action of that kind, they will lose it.&quot;<BR><BR>
Herr Bge is planning to table amendments to the report outlining the options against Britain. The European Parliament will vote on the report on February 19, raising the possibility of legal action before the general election.<BR><BR>
* A French parliamentary report has found evidence that suspect British cattle feed, made from animal parts, may have been labelled as Irish and imported into France from Belgium in the late 1980s.<BR><BR>
The draft report of the National Assembly inquiry panel, leaked to Le Monde refers to a &quot;laundering circuit for British bonemeal, which was systematically relabelled as coming from Ireland&quot;.<BR>

Financial Times    ...   Wednesday January 15 1997</FONT><BR><BR>
Mr Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, is today expected to outline plans for <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">radical changes</B></FONT> in the way the EU copes with food safety in an effort to restore consumer confidence after the <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> crisis.<BR><BR>
Mr Santer's proposals follow the official release this week of an interim report from a European parliamentary committee that alleges the Commission sought to play down the threat of <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</STRONG></FONT> (BSE) in an effort to lessen its impact on the beef market.<BR><BR>
In a speech to the committee, Mr Santer is expected to outline plans to separate responsibility in the Commission for agriculture and consumer matters. He is expected to propose making one commissioner responsible for consumer affairs and food policy. At present, food and consumer safety issues are handled by four commissioners.<BR><BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The result would be to put all food safety issues in the hands of Ms Emma Bonino, commissioner responsible for consumer affairs</B></FONT> .<BR><BR>
Mr Santer is likely to argue that reform is necessary because of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">public distrust</B></FONT> of the way the EU manages food safety, and a belief that policies protect farmers at the expense of consumers.<BR><BR>
He is expected to propose expanding the Commission's 30-strong inspection team to establish an agency on food safety, responsible for ensuring member states act on EU laws.<BR><BR>
It would be created by and report to the Commission rather than to the agricultural directorate.<BR><BR>
Mr Santer will stress the need for extra cash for this, which would have to be agreed by member states and the European parliament. Calls for extra staff to boost the inspection services in the early 1990s were ignored by member states.<BR>

AP 6 Jan 97 and Jan 2 Wall Street Journal
<P>
Washington -- The government is preparing to ban slaughtered animal parts in livestock feed because of links to mad ocw disease -- an effort to ensure that cattle epidemics like the one that hit Britain never happen here.   Arguing that the nation would be at risk if even one US cow were somehow sickened and then used in feed, the FDA proposed the ban Thursday.<I> [This has likely been happening for decades <A HREF="/~tom/gibbs_principle.html">already</A> -- webmaster]</I>
<P>
"if we don't take preventive action today, we may regret it three to four years down the road," explained FDA Commissioner David Kessler.  " By saying that cattle and sheep cannot get fed any product that cause this disease, we are in essence <B>erecting a fire wall</B> that will reduce whatever risk humans have even further."   
     [Kessler has announced his resignation effective  in January. This may be one of his last acts as commissioner.]
<P>
Puttihng therse ruminant products in animal feed not only recycled otehrwise unueable parts of slaughtered animals, it added protein.  but last year, the livestock industryannounced it would voluntarily ban sheep and certain other parts from US animal feed.
<P>
The FDA's <B>proposed</B> ban goes further, ensuring no cow or sheep would eat feed mad with proteins from cows, sheep, goats, deer, elk, or mink -- species known to be vulnerable to these fatal diseases that literally eat spongy holes in their brains.  <B>The ban does not effect pet food or chicken or hog feed.</B>  The FDA also will continue to <B>allow cows' blood, gelatin, and milk as feed ingredients</B> <I>  [even though there is evidence that thse products might still carry infectious agent -- webmaster]</I>. The ban reportedly would also cover protein from  "four-D"
     animals--those that are dead, dying, diseased or disabled upon arrival
     at the rendering plant. 
  <P>
The cost to the rendering industry was estimated at $21 to $48 millilon dollars a year.  Don Franco, of the National Renderers Association questioned whether the ban was necessary in view of lower US sheep stocks and higher rendering temperatures for longer times.   Apparently, this proposal is less than what was requested by the
     American Feed Industry Association, which is afraid that such a narrow
     ban is unenforceable.
 Others worry include the disposal of the waste
     products (millions of tons of animals in already crowded landfills).
    The proposal will apparently not include incineration
     of these products.  Still others worry about public perceptions, and
     estimate that lost sales and disposal costs could reach $1.6 billion.
<P>
The public may comment of the FDA's proposed ban for 45 days.  Then, the FDA expects to finalize the regulation with months.  The full text of the proposed rule on "Substances Prohibited From Use in
Animal Food or Feed; Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed"

<BR>
</FONT>The European Commission sought to minimise the threat to consumers
from BSE, or <B>mad cow</FONT></B> disease, in a
way that &quot;could be construed as <B>misinformation</FONT></B>&quot;,
according to a draft report from a European Parliament inquiry.<BR>
<BR>
Accusing the Commission of <B>putting the interests
of the farming industry ahead of consumers</FONT></B>, the report calls
for a radical overhaul of the way the European Union manages food safety
and animal health. Reforms should include the creation of a &quot;<B>unit
for public health protection</FONT></B>&quot; and treaty changes to ensure
higher priority for consumer protection in future EU farm laws.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The British government is singled out for particular
criticism</FONT></B> for failing to take action to contain the disease.
The report asserts that it <B>failed to enforce a
ban</FONT></B> on feeding ruminants meat and bonemeal, one of the first
measures taken to limit the spread of BSE. Meat and bonemeal infected with
the sheep disease scrapie is considered the most likely source of BSE.<BR>
<BR>
The inquiry's draft report, by Mr Manuel Medina Ortega, a Spanish MEP,
is likely to be reworked before publication on January 22. It will be discussed
with Mr Jacques Santer, president of the Commission, a week before release.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The final report is likely to come out with different views. The
draft does not reflect the opinions of all the committee's members,&quot;
a European Union diplomat said.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Medina's report says <B>the UK was negligent on
several fronts</FONT></B>, including its failure to: neutralise the BSE
or scrapie agent in feed; prevent exports of meat and bonemeal; put in
place laws on cattle identification; enforce veterinary controls; and implement
the selective cull of cattle agreed by EU heads of government in Florence
last June.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Medina also asserts that the UK was guilty of &quot;<B>partial
reading of advice and warnings from scientists</FONT></B>&quot;, failing
to take into account the most critical views. As a result the &quot;grave
and imminent danger of possible transmission (of BSE to humans) was only
taken account of on March 20 1996&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The report attacks the Commission for putting the interests of farmers
and the agricultural industry before public safety. It argues that the
Commission carried out a policy of &quot;minimising the problem, which
could be construed as misinformation. All this was done to avoid disturbances
on the meat market&quot;.

<CENTER><H3>Louping <A NAME="ill">ill</A> in sheep/cow/people</H3>
</CENTER>
In the 1930's: 18,000 UK sheep were inoculated against louping ill, a brain inflammatory illness spread by ticks.  Despite formalin-treatment of the inoculated agent, the procedure gave rise to 1,500 cases of scrapie. Louping is a Scottish word for fleeing or leaping, related to loping.  In humans, louping ill is called Russian spring-summer encephalitis, a meningo-encephalitis with muscular tremors and spasms followed by varying degrees of paralysis.
<P>
One supposes brains of sheep harboring scrapie but exhibiting only louping ill  were homogenized, treated with formaldehyde, and injected intra-muscularly into sheep.  The sheep became immune to louping ill as expected but contracted scrapie, which was not inactivated, as a side effect.  A similar scenario has been put forward for polio vaccine and the origin of AIDS>
<P>
There are some intriguing parallels to prion disease, such as failure of the louping envelope protein to stimulate protective immunity, protein glycosylation, infectious focus in UK, and the association with scrapie. Here is what has become of louping illness (the best of Medline):

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Faulty">Faulty</A> Protein Linked to ALS</H3> </CENTER>   Gretchen Vogel <BR> Science Volume 274, Number 5293, pg 1612  <P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.--Neuroscientists gathered here late last month for their largest annual meeting ever. The presentations covered a wide range of topics, from spinal cord injury and obesity (Science, 29 November, p. 1466) to learning and neurodegenerative disease.<P>

   When scientists found the gene at fault in some cases of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a few years ago, the discovery was the first real clue to what might cause ALS. But mutations in the gene, which makes an enzyme called superoxide dismutase (SOD1), account for only about 1% of all cases of ALS--also known as Lou Gehrig's disease--which causes a gradual paralysis and usually results in death. And it is still unclear whether SOD1 defects contribute to unexplained "sporadic" cases, which are not inherited and which constitute 95% of all cases. Now a team led by Johns Hopkins University neurologist Jeffrey Rothstein has uncovered an abnormality that seems to be widespread in patients with sporadic ALS.<P>

   In a poster session here, Rothstein and his colleagues presented evidence that a brain protein called EAAT2 is improperly made in almost half of the patients they studied. If confirmed, Rothstein says, the finding would strengthen earlier suspicions that a deficiency of the protein, which deactivates and recycles the neurotransmitter glutamate, is a "potential cause or contributor" to the disease, because such a deficiency could lead to a glutamate buildup. Glutamate is toxic to cells in high concentrations, and some researchers have theorized that the paralysis of ALS might be caused by increased levels of the neurotransmitter and the resulting death of neurons that control the muscles.<P>

 ... Rothstein, postdoctoral researcher Glen Lin, and research associate Lynn Bristol discovered the EAAT2 defects while following up on earlier observations that many ALS patients have abnormally low levels of the protein in areas affected by the disease: the motor cortex and spinal cord. To track down the cause of that deficit, the Hopkins team examined the messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which provide the direct instructions for making the protein, in brain and spinal cord tissue obtained at autopsy from ALS patients. They found that those mRNAs were often edited incorrectly in precisely the same tissues where the low protein levels were seen.<P>

   Most genes of higher organisms contain non-protein-coding sequences, called introns, that have to be removed from the mRNAs before the proteins themselves are synthesized. But the Hopkins workers found that the machinery that removes the introns from the EAAT2 mRNAs made mistakes in 11 of the 20 sporadic ALS patients they tested. It either failed to remove an unneeded intron, or it deleted an essential protein-coding sequence, called an exon. As a result, the mRNAs make no EAAT2 at all or make a faulty version. Rothstein and his colleagues did not find the abnormalities in brain tissue from 12 normal subjects or in 16 patients who died of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Huntington's. This suggests that the EAAT2 defect is specific to ALS and not just a general consequence of nerve cell death.<P>

   Many questions remain unanswered. The researchers do not yet know what causes the mistakes in the mRNAs. It may be that a mutation in the EAAT2 gene gives the cell's RNA-processing machinery the wrong directions for removing the introns. Or the fault may lie in the processing machinery itself. Also unexplained, Rothstein says, is how the defect could be restricted to the motor cortex and spinal cord.<P>

<BR>
The inquiry's conclusions, drafted by Manuel Medina, a Spanish Socialist
MEP, are to be endorsed by the 19-member committee in Strasbourg after
an appearance by Jacques Santer, the Commission President, next week. The
report, which may be revised before its release, stops short of recommending
a no-confidence vote in the Commission.<BR>
<BR>
A list of 13 alleged British failings includes the attempt to end the embargo
by blocking European Union business last spring. That amounted to &quot;an
abuse of its rights and blackmailing of the Community institutions&quot;,
it said. Britain had exerted pressure on the Commission over BSE for the
past six years, refusing to allow veterinary inspections in the early 1990s
and <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">using British officials and scientists to
swing decisions in London's favour</FONT></B>, it said.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Since the EU's scientific committee advising on
BSE had been dominated by, and usually chaired by, Britons, &quot;it is
logical to have doubts about its ... capacity to be impartial,&quot; the
report said</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The big rise in the export of British animal-based feed after the national
ban amounted to &quot;a <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">failure to comply with
the principle of co-operation that must exist between all member states</FONT></B>&quot;,
it said. Britain had also refused to listen to scientists who judged the
epidemic to be more serious than officially acknowledged.<BR>
<BR>
The committee was <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">scathing about British officials</FONT></B>
who appeared before it, including <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Sir Keith Meldrum</FONT></B>,
the Chief Veterinary Officer, and it deplored the refusal of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Douglas

<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The Commission's consistent policy of playing
down the consequences of the epidemic &quot;could even be interpreted at

<BR>
John Collinge and his colleagues at Imperial College and St Mary's Hospital,

of the new strain of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> in a tonsil
sample taken from a woman who had died of the disease. The prion protein
was discovered by the same team last October in the brains of people who
had died with the disease. The new variant of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>
is different from other versions but virtually identical to BSE , or &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad

<BR>
Although there is currently no treatment for <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>

</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Demands for an independent food agency
with executive powers to protect consumers were rejected yesterday by Stephen
Dorrell, Health Secretary</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
He dismissed calls from Labour and the Liberal Democrats that a new agency
should be set up to maintain public confidence in food. He told the Oxford
Farming Conference: &quot;I am opposed to any proposal that executive responsibility
should be shifted from ministers to some executive agency. Responsibility
belongs to Parliament and the Government.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He was speaking after an Oxford Union Debate where he won overwhelming
support from farmers. He proposed a motion that decisions on food safety
should be taken only on the basis of food science. The motion was carried
by 277 votes to 155.<BR>
<BR>
It was the first large gathering of farmers attended by Mr Dorrell since
his announcement last March that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</FONT></B>

sparked Britain's worst beef crisis and led to the EU's export ban on British
beef.<BR>

Mr Dorrell argued that he had made the announcement only after hearing

director of the Consumers' Association, who called for an independent agency
that would make &quot;transparent decisions&quot; and provide a role for

<BR>
Telegraph ... Friday 10 January 1997<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Senior French health officials were accused yesterday of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">distributing
untreated growth hormones</FONT></B> that they knew could cause <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease</FONT></B> - the human form of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</FONT></B>
disease.<BR>
<BR>
According to a report in a French magazine, about 20,000 doses of the suspect
hormones, taken from pituitary glands of dead bodies, were given to children
suffering from dwarfism between July 1985 and early 1986. About 1,000 children
received the hormones, though it is not known how many started taking them
after a ban in June 1985. The report in L'Express has drawn silence from
Herve Gaymard, the Health Minister.<BR>
<BR>
Officially, the use of these stocks - which had not been treated to remove
the <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> agent - was banned after July
1985. It now seems that false economy meant the suspect pharmaceuticals
were not withdrawn. The five doctors and researchers involved may face
charges of poisoning.<BR>
<BR>
The incident, which is being investigated by a magistrate, hinges on the
key date of June 17, 1985, when the government pharmaceutical authorities
banned the use of the untreated hormone product. Henri Cerceau, then head
of France's Central Hospital Pharmacy, has told investigators that all
the suspect hormone stocks were destroyed by the date, as &quot;proved&quot;
by a July 1985 document. This has not yet been produced and the newspaper
Le Monde claimed yesterday that only part of the stocks were incinerated.<BR>
<BR>
The Central Hospital Pharmacy is a state-controlled distributor of drugs
and pharmaceuticals that supplies France's hospitals. Investigators have
established that it did not recall the untreated hormones from stores after
June 1985. They say officials of the agency claim no recall was demanded
by their suppliers, France-Hypophyse, nor by the government pharmaceutical
authorities.<BR>
<BR>
France-Hypophyse, a quasi-public organisation responsible for extracting
the growth hormone from pituitary glands collected in French morgues and
hospitals, was created in 1972 and worked smoothly until demand exceeded
supply. Then gland-collectors by-passed hospital morgues and bought unchecked
glands for 30 francs each from surgical assistants.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By Toby Helm, EU Correspondent, in Brussels<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>Britain has been accused of consistent &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">negligence</FONT></B>&quot;
over <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</FONT></B> disease and of trying
to <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">&quot;blackmail&quot; Europe into lifting the
beef ban</FONT></B> by a damning European Parliament report.<BR>
<BR>
The BSE crisis report, which will anger ministers and civil servants, also
accuses Britain of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">packing EU committees on BSE
with British officials</FONT></B> whose &quot;capacity to be impartial&quot;
it calls into question. Policies pursued by Britain - as well as those
followed by the European Commission - failed to recognise the serious health
threat for years, says the report.<BR>
<BR>
In addition the Government is scolded for its &quot;blackmail&quot; policy
of &quot;non co-operation&quot; over the beef ban and for refusing to carry
out a selective slaughter agreed at the Florence summit in June. Douglas
Hogg, Agriculture Minister, is <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">criticised for
refusing to give evidence</FONT></B> to the EU parliament's investigation
into BSE.<BR>
<BR>
The report, written by Manuel Medina Ortega, the Spanish MEP, is so outspokenly
anti-British that EU officials believe it will have to be toned down before
final publication next month. At one point, it suggests <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">British
officials are, by definition, incapable of impartiality</FONT></B>. Referring
to a &quot;massive&quot; British presence on committees, it says: &quot;It
is necessary to point out the BSE sub-group of the standing veterinary
committee has almost always been chaired by a British person, so it is
logical to have doubts about their powers of arbitration and capacity to
be impartial.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Several areas are listed where the British have shown &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">negligence</FONT></B>&quot;
and have applied undue &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">pressure</FONT></B>&quot;
which prevented the necessary policies being adopted. They include:<BR>
<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Failure to enforce a 1989 ban on feeding meat
and bone meal to ruminants</FONT></B>. &quot;Lack of control measures made
it possible for feed stored with ruminant protein to continue to be illegally
administered to ruminants.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Failure to prevent export of feed banned in
Britain</FONT></B>. The &quot;justification&quot; for exporting banned
feed given by Keith Meldrum, chief veterinary officer, (Mr Meldrum argued
that letters warning other countries had been sent out) was &quot;not acceptable&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Pressuring Brussels by packing committees full
of British officials</FONT></B>. &quot;Adding to the pressure through the
significant numerical presence of British civil servants and scientists
who acted more or less in the sphere and under the control of the Ministry
of Agriculture.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Failing to read the advice and warnings of scientists</FONT></B>.
Blame is also heaped on the Commission. Opinions of criticising scientists
were not taken into account.<BR>
<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Trying to &quot;blackmail&quot; the EU into
lifting the beef ban</FONT></B> by adopting the non co-operation policy.<BR>
<BR>
Such criticisms follow a row in October between John Major and Dr Klaus
Hansch, German president of the European Parliament, who accused Britain
of &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">blackmail tactics</FONT></B>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
At an EU meeting in Dublin, Mr Major rounded on Dr Hansch saying he did
not understand the first thing about British policy on BSE. Mr Major told
him his comments were &quot;deeply offensive&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The 18 Euro-MPs who have sat on the inquiry committee will consider the
draft report in Strasbourg on Monday. Britain's two members, Lord Plumb,
leader of the Tory Euro-MPs, and Phillip Whitehead, a Labour Euro-MP, are
expected to argue for milder language.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">It concludes that the BSE crisis did not result
from a lack of &quot;legislative measures&quot; by Britain but from the
Government's attitude &quot;which has not guaranteed their correct application
or carried out the necessary checks&quot;</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture said it had not yet received
the draft. &quot;We believe it contains some factual errors which we hope
will be corrected when the final report is drafted.&quot;<BR>

The Public Health Laboratory Service confirmed yesterday that its Sheffield

<BR>
The Which? report says: &quot;The PHLS scientists inspected 700 sheep carcases

beef</FONT></B> - one study found E coli 0157 in 22 per cent of raw beef
- but it is still of concern.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The laboratory said that a follow-up study also found E coli in lamb products
and both of the studies were published in the Veterinary Record. &quot;Our
advice remains the same,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;The bacteria is
killed by normal cooking. People should make sure that they cook meat properly.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Ironing">Ironing</A> Out the Wrinkles in the Prion Strain Problem</H3>
</CENTER>
Denise Grady Dec 20 1996 Science 274,2010 1996
<P>
The prion hypothesis--the famously heretical notion that naked protein particles, without a stitch of nucleic acid, can cause transmissible disorders of the nervous system such as mad cow disease and the similar Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans--has gained increasing acceptance in recent years. 
<P>
But even true believers acknowledge a major stumbling block: the existence of multiple strains of prions with different, and apparently inheritable, characteristics. &quot;This was the fly in the ointment for the prion hypothesis,&quot; says Glenn Telling, a molecular biologist who works at the University of California, San Francisco, with Stanley Prusiner, the leading proponent of the hypothesis. &quot;How can you have stably inherited information--strain differences--without a genetic component?&quot;<P>
Within the past year or two, a possible solution to that quandary has begun to emerge. Prions may consist of a cellular protein that has misfolded into an abnormal three-dimensional structure, so researchers have speculated that different prion strains consist of the same protein misfolded in different ways. The idea is that each one can impose its brand of misfolding on the normal protein by simple contact, thereby transmitting disease with unique strain characteristics. In this issue, Telling, Prusiner, Pierluigi Gambetti and their colleagues--working with prions from two human diseases--provide compelling new evidence for that idea.<P>
They show that a single type of normal prion protein in the brains of living mice can be converted into two different forms, depending on the type of abnormal human prion that initiates the conversion. The result is two different patterns of pathological changes, as would be expected for different prion strains. Dennis Choi, a neurologist at Washington University in St. Louis, calls the findings &quot;a very powerful piece of support for the idea that an abnormal protein can confer its abnormal configuration onto the host prion protein.&quot;<P>
 Prion strains may consist of differently folded abnormal versions of the protein that transmit their characteristics to the normal prion protein by forcing it to fold the same way.<P>
The puzzle the UCSF workers are addressing dates from 1985, when Prusiner's lab and others found that prions, the protein particles found in the brain in neurodegenerative disorders like CJD and kuru in humans, mad cow disease, and scrapie in sheep, are misfolded or &quot;flipped&quot; versions of cellular prion protein (PrP), a normal component of brain cells. That flipping, or conformational change, may occur in the brain spontaneously for unknown reasons or because of mutations in cellular PrP, and cause buildup of abnormal prions and nerve cell damage. But because some of the diseases are transmissible, Prusiner also proposed that infection with one of the misfolded versions can induce disease by forcing healthy PrP molecules to refold themselves into abnormal prions.<P>
But at the time, few other researchers would consider the idea of an infectious agent composed only of protein, a problem compounded by the existence of prion strains. They insisted that the disease-causing agent had to have some kind of genetic material, perhaps a virus lurking in the prion preparations. Then, in the December 1994 <EM>Journal of Virology</EM>, Richard Bessen and Richard Marsh of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, reported some of the first evidence that different misfolded conformations of the protein might explain the strains. 
<P>
Studying mink transmissible encephalopathy, a prion disease, they found two strains when the disease was transmitted to hamsters, each one associated with different incubation times, symptoms, and distributions within the brain--as well as with a distinct conformation of the hamsters' PrP. In a follow-up study in <EM>Nature</EM> in June 1995, Bessen, who had moved to the National Institutes of Health Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, Byron Caughey, and their Rocky Mountain colleagues showed that the two prion conformations could be spread to one type of cellular PrP when the proteins were mixed together in a cell-free system.<P>
Now, Telling, Prusiner, and their colleagues have extended the work to human prions in a mouse model. They used a strain of transgenic mice carrying a chimeric human/mouse PrP gene that was developed in their lab for susceptibility to human prions. They injected the animals' brains with extracts from the brains of patients who died either from CJD or from fatal familial insomnia (FFI), an inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the PrP gene.<P>
Prusiner and his colleagues knew that the prion proteins causing the two disorders differ in the way they fold because when they are cut with a protein-splitting enzyme, the CJD material gives a 21-kilodalton fragment, while that from the FFI patients yields a 19-kilodalton fragment. The question then was, would the prions produced in mice infected with the human prions yield the same protein fragments as the parent molecules? 
<P>
And indeed, the animals produced PrP fragments matching those of the original inoculants. &quot;Clearly, you can impart two different conformations to the same primary structure,&quot; Prusiner says. &quot;We don't know at this point whether we can keep propagating them in these mice. We suspect that we can, and that's the ongoing experiment.&quot; He also suspects that many more conformations are possible.<P>
No study involving prions goes undebated, however, and this one is no exception. At the heart of the criticism lies a problem that has dogged prion research since it first began: No one has yet been able to take the definitive step of generating purified prions in a system that would rule out the possible presence of viruses and show that they transmit scrapielike diseases. &quot;The group has taken a <B>relatively crude [brain] extract</B>,&quot; says Michael Harrington, who studies nervous system diseases at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. &quot;<B>Therefore, it's not defined.</B>&quot; The paper, he adds, is evidence that conformational differences yield strains, &quot;but it doesn't confirm it.&quot;<P>
To Prusiner and his colleagues, the failure of years of research to turn up a virus is powerful evidence that none is involved in these disorders. But Telling says, &quot;there are people who will go to their graves believing these diseases are caused by viruses.&quot; Prusiner concurs: &quot;Some will say that forever, and there's nothing to say to them except that the evidence is overwhelming. ... They can think what they want. I can't help them.&quot;

Glenn C. Telling, ... Pierluigi Gambetti, Stanley Prusiner<BR>
Dec 20 1996 Science 274, 2090 1996
<P>The fundamental event in prion diseases seems to be a
conformational change in cellular prion protein (PrP-C)
whereby it is converted into the pathologic isoform PrP-Sc.
In fatal familial insomnia (FFI), the protease-resistant fragment of
PrP-Sc after deglycosylation has a size of 19&nbsp; kilodaltons,
whereas that from other inherited and sporadic prion diseases is 21&nbsp;kilodaltons. Extracts from the brains of FFI patients transmitted
disease to transgenic mice expressing a chimeric human-mouse PrP gene
about 200&nbsp; days after inoculation and induced formation of the
19-kilodalton PrP-Sc fragment, whereas extracts from the
brains of familial and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients
produced the 21-kilodalton PrP-Sc fragment in these mice.
The results presented indicate that the conformation of
PrP-Sc functions as a template in directing the formation of
nascent PrP-Sc and suggest a mechanism to explain strains of
prions where diversity is encrypted in the conformation of
PrP-Sc.<P>

For many years the prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, were thought to be caused by slow-acting viruses (<a href="#B1">1</A>), but it is now clear that prions are not viruses and that they are devoid of nucleic acid (<a href="#B2">2</A>, <a href="#B3">3</A>). Prions seem to be composed only of PrP-Sc molecules, which are abnormal conformers of a normal, host-encoded protein designated PrP-C (<a href="#B3">3</A>, <a href="#B4">4</A>). PrP-C has a high alpha-helical content and is virtually devoid of beta-sheets, whereas PrP-Sc has a high beta-sheet content (<a href="#B4">4</A>, <a href="#B5">5</A>); thus, the conversion of PrP-C into PrP-Sc involves a profound conformational change.  Formation of PrP-Sc is a post-translational process that does not appear to involve a covalent modification of the protein (<a href="#B6">6</A>). <P>

The prion diseases are unique in that they may present as inherited and infectious disorders (<a href="#B3">3</A>, <a href="#B7">7</A>). More than 20&nbsp;different mutations of the human (Hu) PrP gene segregate with dominantly inherited disease; five of these have been genetically linked to familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD), Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) (<a href="#B8">8</A>). The most common prion diseases of animals are scrapie of sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy; the latter may have been transmitted to people through foods (<a href="#B9">9</A>).</P> 

To extend studies on the transmission of wild-type and mutant prions from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and fCJD patients, respectively, to transgenic mice expressing a chimeric mouse-human PrP gene [Tg(MHu2M) mice] (<a href="#B10">10</A>, <a href="#B11">11</A>), we inoculated these mice with mutant prions from the brains of patients who died of FFI. Transmission of human prions to Tg(MHu2M) mice involves the conversion of chimeric MHu2M PrP-C into MHu2M PrP-Sc through a process that is thought to involve the binding of PrP-Sc to PrP-C as PrP-C undergoes a structural transition (<a href="#B12">12</A>, <a href="#B13">13</A>). A point mutation of the PrP gene at codon 178&nbsp;[in which an Asp residue at position 178&nbsp;is mutated to Asn (D178N)] is the cause of FFI, but a Met residue must be encoded at position 129&nbsp;on the mutant allele for the FFI phenotype to be manifest (<a href="#B14">14</A>). The same D178N mutation segregates with a subtype of fCJD, but in this case, Val is encoded on the mutant allele at position 129.&nbsp;The D178N mutation is thought to destabilize the structure of PrP-C, resulting in its transformation into PrP-Sc (<a href="#B13">13</A>, <a href="#B15">15</A>). Some investigators have reported transmission of FFI prions to non-Tg and Tg(HuPrP) mice; the incubation times exceeded 400&nbsp;days, and only a minority of the inoculated Tg(HuPrP) mice expressing both human and mouse PrP-C developed disease (<a href="#B16">16</A>). These findings with Tg(HuPrP) mice are in accord with earlier studies showing that transmission of human prions to Tg(HuPrP) mice is inhibited by mouse PrP-C, and this inhibition can be abolished by ablation of the mouse PrP gene (Prnp-O/O) (<a href="#B10">10</A>, <a href="#B11">11</A>)

<P>Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice (<a href="#B17">17</A>) were inoculated intracerebrally with extracts prepared from brain tissue obtained after the death of individuals who died of FFI, fCJD(E200K) (with a mutation in which Glu at position 200&nbsp;has mutated to Lys), or sCJD. The mice developed signs of experimental prion disease about 200&nbsp;days after inoculation . At the time of writing, inoculation of Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice has resulted in primary passage of prions from at least one brain region from three of four FFI patients. As previously reported, Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice are susceptible to prions from patients who carried the E200K mutation (<a href="#B11">11</A>). Extracts from patients who died with fCJD(E200K) or sCJD(M/M129) (homozygous for Met at position 129) caused neurologic dysfunction in Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice between 170&nbsp;and 190&nbsp;days after inoculation. All samples were 10% (w/v) brain homogenates that were diluted 1:10 before inoculation. If the PrP gene of the patient carried<a mutation other than that found in FFI, then the mutation is noted after the patient's initials or identification code.  Transmissions previously reported (<a href="#B11">11</A>).   <P>

The failure to transmit disease with brain homogenates of frontal and insula cortices from FFI patient V-58 is apparently not related to heterozygosity at codon 129,&nbsp;because homogenate from patient IV-16, who has the same haplotype, transmitted the disease. Patients V-58 and IV-16 are phenotypically similar and exemplify the FFI phenotype of the codon 129&nbsp;heterozygotes with especially long duration (<a href="#B18">18</A>). The sleep disorder was comparable in patients V-58 and IV-16, and spongiosis was actually more severe in patient IV-16 than in patient V-58 (<a href="#B18">18</A>). It is noteworthy  that a homogenate prepared from the parietal cortex of a patient with fCJD(D178N, V/V129) has so far failed to transmit disease. whether the titer of prions in this particular sample is low or  the Val (V) residue at position 129&nbsp;in combination with the D178N mutation prevents transmission to Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice remains to be established.

 <P>Prion proteins in extracts from the brains of Tg(MHu2M) mice inoculated with FFI(D178N, M129) were compared with those inoculated with fCJD(E200K) or sCJD. Mouse brain homogenates were digested with proteinase K (100&nbsp;&#181;g/ml) for 1&nbsp;hour at 37&#176;C followed by denaturation by boiling in 3% SDS. The denatured PrP-Sc was then digested with glycopeptide  N- glycosidase (PNGase F) to remove Asn-linked oligosaccharides.  As previously described, the human brain extracts prepared from FFI patients yielded a 19-kD protein, whereas extracts from brains of patients with fCJD(E200K) or typical sCJD contained a 21-kD protein (<a href="#B19">19</A>). Because the amino acid sequences of HuPrP-Sc molecules from FFI and fCJD(E200K) patients differ at two residues, it was not surprising that the conformations of PrP-Sc as reflected by the size of the protease-resistant PrP fragments are different. In contrast, it was unexpected that PrP-Sc found in Tg(MHu2M) mice inoculated with FFI prions would be 19kD, whereas that in Tg(MHu2M) mice injected with fCJD(E200K) was 21&nbsp;kD (Fig. <a href="#F1">1</a>A). These findings demonstrate that the conformation of HuPrP-Sc in the inoculum is replicated in the brains of the Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice by conversion of MHu2M PrP-C into MHu2M PrP-Sc. Wild-type PrP-Sc in the brain extract from a patient who died of sCJD was found To be 21&nbsp;kD. Transmission of sCJD to Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice produced MHu2M PrP-Sc, also of size 21&nbsp;kD, again demonstrating the fidelity of the<conversion process whereby the conformation of MHu2M PrP-Sc in the Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse reflects that of HuPrP-Sc in the inoculum (Fig. <a href="#F1">1</a>B). 
<P>
We emphasize that whereas the primary structures of the PrP-Sc molecules in the three different human brain inocula are distinct, The amino acid sequences of the PrP-Sc molecules in the brains of inoculated Tg(MHu2M) mice are invariant. The MHu2M PrP transgene was sequenced and found to be the same as the construct used for microinjections during production of  the mice. Protein immunoblot analysis of PrP-Sc from brains of Tg(MHu2M) mice inoculated with FFI, fCJD(E200K), and sCJD. 
<P>
Homogenates of human or mouse brain were prepared as described (<a href="#B30">30</A>). (<B>A</B>) Comparison of fCJD(E200K) and FFI. Samples analyzed are from the<following sources: lane 1,&nbsp;fCJD(E200K) patient LJ1, frontal cortex; lane 2,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse inoculated with preparation used for lane 1; lane 3,&nbsp;fCJD(E200K) patient LJ1, frontal cortex treated with PNGase F; lane 4,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse inoculated with preparation used in lane 3; lane 5,&nbsp;FFI patient IV-16, frontal cortex; lane 6,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse inoculated with preparation used for lane 5; lane 7,&nbsp;FFI patient IV-16, frontal cortex treated with PNGase F; and lane 8,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse inoculated with preparation used in lane 7.&nbsp; Comparison of sCJD and FFI. Samples analyzed are from the following sources: lane 1,&nbsp;sCJD patient EC; lane 2,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M) mouse inoculated with preparation used in lane 1; lane 3,&nbsp;sCJD patient EC treated with PNGase F; lane 4,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M) mouse inoculated with preparation used in lane 3; lane 5,&nbsp;FFI patient IV-16, frontal cortex; lane 6,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse inoculated with preparation used in lane 5; lane 7,&nbsp;FFI patient IV-16, frontal cortex treated with PNGase F; lane 8,&nbsp;Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mouse inoculated with preparation used in lane 7. We also examined the regional distribution of PrP-Sc in the brains of Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice inoculated with prions from FFI patients as well as from fCJD(E200K) and sCJD patients (<a href="#B21">21</A>). Histoblots of coronal brain<sections through the hippocampus and thalamus as well as those Through the brainstem and cerebellum were developed. The pattern of PrP-Sc deposition in FFI-inoculated Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice was clearly different from Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice inoculated with CJD. 
<P>
 Regional distribution of PrP-Sc in Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice inoculated with extracts from FFI, CJD(E200K), and sCJD patients. Histoblots of coronal sections of the brain and brainstem of mice inoculated with extracts from FFI (<B>A</B> and <B>E</B>), fCJD(E200K) (<B>B</B><and <B>F</B>), or sCJD(M/M129) (<B>C</B> and <B>G</B>) patients were performed as described (<a href="#B21">21</A>). PrP-C was eliminated from the section by exposing the membranes for 18&nbsp;hours at 37&#176;C to proteinase K (400&nbsp;&#181;g/ml) in a buffer containing 0.5% Brij 35,&nbsp;100&nbsp;mM NaCl, and 10&nbsp;mM tris-HCl, pH 7.8.&nbsp;Immunostaining of PrP-Sc was enhanced by exposing the histoblots to 3&nbsp;M guanidinium isothiocyanate<for 10&nbsp;min at room temperature in 20&nbsp;mM tris-HCl, pH 7.8,&nbsp;then rinsing three times with TBST [10 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.0,&nbsp;150&nbsp;mM<NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20] before immunostaining with monoclonal antibody 3F4 to PrP (anti-PrP) (<a href="#B31">31</A>). Also shown are labeled diagrams of the coronal sections of the hippocampus-thalamus region<(<B>D</B>) and brainstem-cerebellum region (<B>H</B>). NC, neocortex; Hp, hippocampus; Hb, habenula; Th, thalamus; vpl, ventral posterior lateral thalamic nucleus; Hy, hypothalamus; Am, amygdala; GC, granular cell layer of the cerebellum; IC, inferior colliculus;R, dorsal nucleus of the raphe; LC, locus ceruleus.

<P>In FFI-inoculated mice, PrP-Sc deposition was most intense in the thalamus and the rostral part of the corpus callosum. In FFI patients PrP-Sc deposition and neuropathologic changes are marked in the antero-ventral and mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus (<a href="#B18">18</A>, <a href="#B22">22</A>). Intermediate intensities of immunostaining were found in the deeper layers of the frontal cortex and in the lateral portions of the caudate nuclei. Little or no immunostaining was found in the habenula or the hypothalamus. Staining in the hippocampus was also negative except for the stratum lacunosum molecularae where most of the spongiform degeneration and reactive astrocytic gliosis occurred. The absence of PrP-Sc deposition in the habenula is unique to FFI because deposition invariably occurs in this region in response to CJD and scrapie<prion inoculations (<a href="#B10">10</A>, <a href="#B23">23</A>).<</P>

 <P>In contrast to FFI-inoculated mice, inoculation of Tg(MHu2M) mice with fCJD(E200K) and sCJD prions induced PrP-Sc accumulation in many areas of the central nervous system (Fig.<<a href="#F2">2</a>, B and C). Although inoculation with fCJD(E200K) and sCJD as well as with iatrogenic CJD prions (<a href="#B24">24</A>) resulted in accumulations of PrP-Sc in the brainstem, that was not the case for FFI. These differences in PrP-Sc deposition reflect earlier studies on prion strains where the<patterns of spongiform degeneration and PrP-Sc accumulation were specific for a particular strain when assessed in isogenic animals (<a href="#B23">23</A>, <a href="#B25">25</A>).

<P>The neuropathologic changes in the brains of five Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice inoculated with prions from three different FFI patients were examined. They were characterized by moderate to severe spongiform degeneration and astrocytic gliosis in the deeper layers of the frontal cortex and rostral part of the cingulate gyrus, the thalamus, the lateral portions of the caudate nucleus, and in the white matter tracts of the cerebral hemispheres. Immunohistochemical examination of FFI-inoculated brains  showed that regions with the largest amount of PrP staining corresponded to the regions with the most severe neuropathological changes in both gray and white matter. The accentuated immunostaining resulted from multiple<primitive PrP plaques ranging in size from 10&nbsp;to 40&nbsp;&#181;M 
<P>
 Representative examples of neuropathologic changes in Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice after inoculation with human FFI prions. (<B>A</B>) Hematoxylin and eosin stain of a serial section of the thalamus shows mild To moderate spongiform degeneration of the neuropil, with vacuoles 10&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;&#181;m in diameter. Brain tissue was immersion-fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution after the animals were killed. The brains were embedded in paraffin and histological sections prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for evaluation of spongiform degeneration. (<B>B</B>) PrP immunohistochemistry of a serial<section of the thalamus shows multiple punctate PrP-immunopositive deposits, the largest being . PrP immunoreactivity was enhanced by immersing the sections in 1.3&nbsp;mM HCl and autoclaving them at 121&#176;C for 10&nbsp;min (<a href="#B32">32</A>). Immunostaining of tissue sections was performed as previously described (<a href="#B33">33</A>) with anti-PrP (<a href="#B31">31</A>).

 <P>Comparison of FFI-inoculated Tg- (MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice with the same type mice inoculated with prions from fCJD- (E200K) and sCJD patients revealed two main histopathologic differences. First, FFI produced no vacuolation in the hypothalamus, whereas a mild To moderate degree of vacuolation was found with both sCJD and fCJD(E200K) prions. Secondly, FFI produced moderate to severe vacuolation of the corpus callosum. In contrast, there was only mild vacuolation of the corpus callosum with sCJD and none with fCJD(E200K). Our studies show that human prions inoculated into Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice instruct with substantial fidelity the formation of distinct<MHu2M PrP-Sc molecules. Although the prions in patients with FFI, fCJD(E200K), and sCJD can be distinguished by differences in the amino acid sequence of HuPrP-Sc, that is clearly not the case for MHu2M PrP-Sc in the brains of the inoculated Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O mice. From our findings we contend that the different sizes of chimeric MHu2M PrP-Sc molecules found after limited digestion with proteinase K result from distinct secondary and tertiary structures. Whether these differences in PrP-Sc structure will be propagated upon serial passage of the chimeric prions in Tg(MHu2M)Prnp-O/O or Tg(HuPrP)Prnp-O/O mice remains to be determined.</P>

<P>If such properties are propagated, then this will suggest that different mutant human PrPs will have generated distinct strains of prions. The existence of prion strains has posed a conundrum as to the mechanism by which strain-specific characteristics are encrypted (<a href="#B23">23</A>, <a href="#B26">26</A>). Although differences in the size of protease-resistant fragments of PrP-Sc have not been a general characteristic of prion strains (<a href="#B27">27</A>), The hyper and drowsy strains of prions isolated from mink by serial<passage in Syrian hamsters do differ with respect to the size of the PrP-Sc molecules after limited proteolysis (<a href="#B28">28</A>). But unlike the studies<reported here, where prions were generated de novo in patients carrying the D178N or E200K mutations, the origin of the hyper and drowsy strains is obscure.</P> 

<P>Our results provide a plausible mechanism for explaining diversity in a pathogen that lacks nucleic acid; the biological properties of prion strains seem to be encrypted in the conformation of PrP-Sc. Because prion strains produce different disease phenotypes, such findings raise the possibility that deviations in the phenotypes of other degenerative disorders may also reflect conformational variants in pathologic proteins. Variations in the conformation of PrP-Sc are reproduced through templating of the PrP-Sc in the inoculum onto the substrate PrP-C. Deciphering the molecular events by which the conformation of one protein is imparted to another and the mechanism responsible for the apparently high degree of fidelity associated with this process should be of considerable interest. Indeed, the foregoing data violate the widely and long-held idea that amino acid sequences are the sole determinants of the tertiary structures of biologically active proteins (<a href="#B29">29</A>).</P>

Times    ...   December 21 1996</FONT><BR><BR>
The French Government yesterday bowed to pressure from its cattle farmers and extended its ban on beef imports to Switzerland, the country worst affected by &quot;<STRONG>mad cow</STRONG></FONT>&quot; disease after Britain.<BR><BR>
Farmers in eastern France have been pressing for such a ban, with some mounting a blockade of the border, on the ground that Swiss cattle could infect their herds and that importation of beef from the country was undermining consumer confidence. Austria, Germany and Italy have already taken measures to ban cattle from Switzerland.<BR><BR>
Yesterday, Philippe Vasseur, the French Agriculture Minister, said Paris would ask the European Union to establish a common policy on Swiss beef, as it has with Britain.<BR><BR>
&quot;This precautionary measure is taken pending the official position of the European Union. It is justified by the absolute priority we place on protecting consumers,&quot; M Vasseur said.<BR><BR>
Switzerland has reported 230 cases of BSE and Britain 160,000. The Swiss authorities say they will eradicate the disease through a SFr6.5 million (2.9 million) programme to slaughter at least 1,500 cows. But the programme was not enough to stem anger in France, where cattle farmers' earnings have fallen sharply this year.<BR><BR>
Paris at first tried to resist farmers' pressure, arguing that a nationwide ban was unnecessary. However, local authorities near the Swiss border paved the way for a government climb-down when they banned Swiss beef from the Doubs department in October.<BR><BR>
Yesterday M Vasseur said some Swiss beef products could enter France under &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; and tight sanitary conditions. But he said there would be no exceptions to the ban on Swiss cattle.<BR><BR>
Despite the ban, French farmers at the Swiss border said that they would not stop their blockade of lorries carrying cattle. They have forced several such vehicles to turn back to Switzerland since Wednesday.<BR><BR>
An official at the Swiss veterinary office said the French decision appeared to be motivated more by commercial and political criteria than by health matters. Last month 652 head of cattle were exported to France, as opposed to 28 between January and August.<BR><BR>
The Swiss Farm Producers Association accused the French of &quot;verging on hypocrisy&quot;. It claimed that French companies fraudulently relabelled contaminated British cattle feed and re-exported it to Switzerland before 1989, and that Paris had not taken action against them.<BR><BR>
Austria, Germany and Italy banned Swiss beef imports several months ago. With 68 outbreaks of BSE in 1995, and 45 so far this year, the epidemic is regarded as declining in Switzerland.

European Union farm ministers yesterday cautiously welcomed Britain's decision to slaughter 100,000 more cattle but said it could still be a long time before a ban on British beef exports was lifted. Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, told a farm ministers' meeting in Brussels that Britain would go ahead with a selective cull. He added that Britain would consider extending the cull to cover cattle affected by maternal transmission if this was scientifically justified.<BR><BR>
The ministers rejected by ten votes to five a proposal to ban sheep, goat and cattle offal from the human and animal food chains. The European Commission had claimed that the brains, eyes and spinal cords of cattle, sheep and goats over one year old were made of tissue most likely to be affected by BSE or scrapie. But most ministers said the measure was unnecessary and too expensive.<BR><BR>
 The farm ministers agreed to ban by 2006 the use of cramped crates for rearing calves over two months old and to improve the diet of veal calves, which have been given a milky diet lacking iron in order to produce white meat.

Telegraph ... Tuesday 17 December 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B>The early lifting of the world-wide ban
on British beef exports was ruled out</FONT></B> by the Government and
Brussels last night despite the reinstatement of plans for the selective
slaughter of about 100,000 cattle most at risk of <B>mad
cow</FONT></B> disease. Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, told MPs
that the removal of the ban was still a &quot;long way off&quot; and refused
to forecast when exports might be resumed.<BR>
<BR>
Franz Fischler, the EU commissioner for agriculture, emphasised that <B>Britain
had still to honour the conditions agreed at the EU summit in Florence
last June</FONT></B>. Other EU farm ministers made clear that they were
adopting a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to the British proposals.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Hogg angered Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons by admitting that there
was no scientific justification for the new cull, which will cost &pound;90
million on top of the &pound;3.2 billion the Government has already earmarked
for dealing with the crisis. He accepted that it was <B>the
political price Britain would have to pay for seeking progress towards
lifting the ban some time next year</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Tory MPs branded the move as &quot;appeasement&quot; of Brussels and expressed
dismay that Britain had received no firm guarantees from the European Commission
about the resumption of exports. The ban was imposed nine months ago after
the Government admitted a possible link between BSE and the human form
of the disease, <B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</FONT></B>
(<B>CJD</FONT></B>).<BR>
<BR>
Tony Blair, the Labour leader, accused the Government of <B>&quot;serial
incompetence&quot;</FONT></B> in the handling of the crisis. He said it
had not made a single piece of progress in having the ban lifted.<BR>
<BR>
On a day dominated by Europe, John Major surprised MPs by declaring that
Britain's relationship with the EU could be determined by decisions taken
over the next 18 months. Downing Street later denied that the Prime Minister
was threatening possible withdrawal, but was hinting at a more arm's-length
relationship with Europe if it developed into an &quot;embryonic superstate&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Major said that those who talked of Britain pulling out of Europe were
&quot;peddling a delusion&quot; and emphasised that he wanted more than
a trading relationship with Europe. But he made clear that the Government
would not be a party to Franco-German plans for an &quot;inner core&quot;
of states, emphasising that Britain would either stand aside or block such
changes if they put the rest of the EU at a disadvantage.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Major said the EU was approaching some historic decisions. &quot;The
choices made will determine not only the success and stability of Europe
as a whole, but Britain's relationship with it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Hogg's statement on the beef ban preceded the annual Commons debate
on European fisheries policy, which was the first test of the Government's
authority since it lost its majority as a result of Labour's victory in
the Barnsley East by-election last week.<BR>
<BR>
Ministers clearly hoped that the announcement of the cull would please
Ulster Unionist MPs, who now hold the balance of power in the Commons.
They have been angered that the Government has not managed to persuade
Brussels to lift the ban on certified grass-fed beef, which would help
Northern Ireland, where there is a low incidence of BSE.<BR>
<BR>
The selective cull was shelved nearly three months ago because of conflicting
scientific advice and opposition from Tory MPs. Mr Hogg insisted that proceeding
with it was an indispensable pre-condition to obtaining any lifting of
the ban.<BR>
<BR>
But he was unable to offer MPs any timetable. He said it would be a <B>&quot;difficult
and slow process&quot; to achieve a complete lifting of the ban</FONT></B>,
but there was a &quot;reasonable chance&quot; of at least a partial relaxation.
Mr Hogg told MPs that more than a million cattle over 30 months old had
been slaughtered.

<BR>
</FONT>Hogg: cull is the only way to make progress<BR>
<BR>
Brussels warns of no early end to ban on British beef<BR>
<BR>
Europe told Britain yesterday that the <B>world ban
on British beef would remain indefinitely</FONT></B>, in spite of the Government's
decision to slaughter 100,000 cattle most at risk from &quot;<B>mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease.<BR>
<BR>
Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said the Government was going ahead
with the &pound;150 million cull &shy; first mooted in July, then suspended
in September &shy; because it was the only way to make any progress on
lifting the ban. &quot;It is a political fact, not a scientific fact,&quot;
he told MPs. &quot;If we do not commit ourselves to a selective cull, then
we are certain not to see any progress of any kind.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But even before his Commons statement, the European Commission ruled out
any swift lifting of the ban and one senior Conservative believed it could
last for years.<BR>
<BR>
Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, made clear that Britain must
go through all the EU's decision-making hurdles before any softening of
the embargo. Mr Hogg, who will meet agriculture ministers in Brussels today,
admitted that Britain would not secure a timetable. He told MPs that they
<B>&quot;should not be under any illusion as to how
quickly a selective cull will lead to a resumption of exports of British
beef&quot;</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Herr Fischler said that he had not been told officially about Britain's
decision to cull an extra 100,000 cattle and it was up to the Government
to put forward a detailed request to start the machinery agreed at the
Florence summit in June. &quot;I don't see any need to depart from what
was agreed upon,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we need to move forward step
by step as agreed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That means that a British request, probably to ease the ban on grass-fed
herds certified as BSE-free, must pass through various committees including
the Standing Veterinary Committee. At best, that could take weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Euro-sceptics were glum about the announcement, seeing it as another U-turn
in the face of Brussels pressure. John Townend said: &quot;Many of us just
don't trust our European friends and we think they are going to keep this
ban going for year after year.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, welcomed
the announcement, while calling for extra financial help for farmers who
would lose a substantial proportion of their herds. &quot;We are not happy
at the idea of many thousands of healthy animals being culled,&quot; he
said. &quot;But we have long accepted that the Florence agreement had to
be honoured by Britain and that this was the only way to start lifting
the export ban.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Government undertook in Florence to slaughter
up to 147,000 cattle identified as being at particular risk of developing
BSE. These were cattle born between 1989 and 1993 and reared on the same
infected feed as animals that have died of BSE</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
In September the Cabinet shelved plans for the cull, citing new scientific
evidence that BSE would die out naturally around 2001 and that the slaughter
would do little if anything to bring this date nearer. The Government has
now been forced to return to much the same plan it rejected only three
months ago. One difference is that only about 100,000 cattle will need
to be culled because about 50,000 of those targeted in June have already
been killed.<BR>
<BR>
The Treasury will pick up &pound;90 million of the compensation bill and
the EU the rest.<BR>

Evening Standard ... Tuesday, 17 December, 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Government attempts to persuade Europe to lift the ban on British
beef by slaughtering an extra 110,000 cattle faltered today when EU ministers
warned it could be <B>the middle of next year before
the ban was even relaxed</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg went to battle yet again to get the ban
lifted, telling Brussels: &quot;The ball's in your court.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He flew in for meetings with fellow ministers in the wake of the Government's
controversial decision to press on with the cull of high-risk cattle.<BR>
<BR>
Irish farm minister Ivan Yates, who chaired today's meeting, warned afterwards,
however, that it could be <B>&quot;mid-year 1997&quot;
</FONT></B>before the ban was relaxed.<BR>
<BR>
He welcomed Britain's decision to undertake the selective cull as &quot;entering
a new phase of this whole process&quot;, adding that a lead could be taken
on lifting the ban in Northern Ireland.<BR>
<BR>
Asked, however, when the first phase of the easing might happen, he told
BBC Radio 4's World At One: &quot;I don't think one can predict with certainty
because we have to await the operation of the cull, decisions by the Commission,
the Standing Veterinary Committee, and subsequently the Council.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But indicative dates were set forward as a movement on the process
in January/February in relation to reporting back and the particular proposal
on the certified hard scheme being ready in February, and then we're talking
about mid-year before perhaps the full inspection process could be complete
and early decisions could be made round the mid-year of 1997.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Before the meeting, Mr Hogg admitted there was little hope of speedy progress
towards a timetable for lifting the worldwide ban, and that negotiations
would be &quot;difficult&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
He also confessed there was little or no scientific justification for the
new cull, which he said ministers had agreed to simply to persuade the
EU to move forward.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Hogg said: &quot;EU member states are facing a lot of internal pressure
not to lift the ban but we have now put the ball in their court.&quot;
Meanwhile, John Major was expecting a tough Question Time in the Commons
this afternoon with a fresh round of attacks on beef and the Government's
general stance towards Europe.<BR>
<BR>
The Government's victories in two votes on European fishing policy last
night, by wider margins than expected, won it four weeks' breathing space
before MPs end their Christmas break on 13 January.<BR>

Nonetheless, the votes demonstrated how much Mr Major's minority Government
depends on the nine Ulster Unionist MPs, who abstained last night.

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">by Steve Connor, Science Correspondent<BR>
Sunday Times ... December 15<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Scientists have extracted the first drug to treat human diseases
from the milk of genetically engineered sheep. The breakthrough could result
in scores of new medicines being produced by farmyard animals.<BR>
<BR>
The first clinical trials of the drug, which was drawn from sheep carrying
human genes, began last week. The drug will be used to treat lung infections
caused by cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic disease in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
It represents a turning point for the pharmaceuticals industry, which sees
the technique as a means of producing cheaply a new generation of medicines
which at present are too costly for widespread use.<BR>
<BR>
The process, known as &quot;pharming&quot;, promises to produce copious
quantities of up to 100 other drugs based on vital human proteins that
cannot be easily made by conventional methods.<BR>
<BR>
The breakthrough has been made by scientists at PPL Therapeutics, a small
biotechnology firm near Edinburgh, who injected a human gene into the embryos
of sheep, then bred a flock of 200 genetically engineered animals on their
secure farm near the city.<BR>
<BR>
From their milk, they have extracted a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin
(AAT), which can be used to inhibit the destruction of lung tissue in cystic
fibrosis patients. Enough medicine can be extracted from the milk of one
sheep to meet the needs of about 15 patients.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Diana Bilton, a consultant physician at Papworth hospital, Cambridge,
who will lead the clinical trials of the drug, said that until now only
small amounts of AAT could be extracted from human blood, which meant it
was costly and ran a slight risk of carrying blood-borne infections.<BR>

Other drugs likely to be produced in animal milk include fibrinogen, or
tissue &quot;glue&quot;, which can be used to form a biodegradable suture
over a wound, a natural antibiotic called lactoferrin, and a range of drugs
involved in promoting or dissolving blood clots.<BR>
<BR>
Genzyme, an American biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts,
is also close to producing a drug from the milk of genetically engineered
goats. The firm plans to use it as an anti-clotting agent in trials on
27 American patients undergoing heart-bypass operations.<BR>
<BR>
The company said that the drug, antithrombin-III, may also alleviate the
symptoms of a wide range of other disorders, including liver disease, septicaemia,
shock, burns and complications caused by organ transplants.<BR>
<BR>
Dr John Clark, one of the original inventors of the technique and a scientist
at the government-funded Roslin Institute, in Edinburgh, said the current
clinical trials vindicated his ideas: &quot;<B>Everybody thought we were mad.</B>
It was a case of 'don't call us, we'll call you'.&quot;

<BR>
</FONT>The European commission <B>systematically
covered up the danger to human health</FONT></B> posed by &quot;<B>mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease (BSE) over more than four years, an inquiry
by the European parliament has heard.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Its report will accuse the commission of yielding

farmers and the beef industry before consumers.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>Its author claims this amounts to a &quot;<B>consistent

officials up to Ray MacSharry, the former Irish EU farm commissioner.<BR>

which between 1990 and 1994 repeatedly <B>refused
permission</FONT></B> for EU veterinary experts to come to Britain to examine
the full extent of the problem. The report's release coincides with a government
attempt tomorrow to get the ban on British beef exports lifted with a pledge
to cull up to 125,000 cattle. Douglas Hogg, the agriculture minister, will
face a cool reception as other member states, led by Germany, want the
curbs to remain into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Manuel Medina Ortega, a Spanish lawyer and the
MEP responsible for drafting the report, said it was as if the EU at all
levels had been governed by omerta, the Italian mafia code of silence,
over BSE. Scientific evidence was kept quiet and scientists who claimed
there was a problem were disbelieved, so the official line was that nothing
happened</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Medina Ortega claimed MacSharry had admitted to the committee that the
commission did not push for action after 1990 because of government pressure.
In March this year British ministers admitted BSE was the most probable
cause of a new strain of <B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</FONT></B>,
a human brain disorder, and the EU imposed a global ban on British beef
exports.<BR>
<BR>
The 19-member committee report will be presented to the European parliament
in 1997. In one internal EU document, Gerard Castille, a former commission
official in charge of consumer protection, claimed that a colleague had
urged the commission to <B>adopt a &quot;policy of
disinformation&quot;</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most potentially embarrassing revelations con cerns comments
allegedly made by MacSharry at a meeting on September 18, 1990: they were
summarised as: &quot;BSE: stop any meeting.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The committee was also given access to a secret study by the commission's
inspectorate-general last year highlighting <B>shortcomings
in its veterinary services</FONT></B>. It claimed <B>political
pressure governed the awarding of contracts</FONT></B> to European laboratories.<BR>
<BR>
The commission has repeatedly rejected accusations of a cover-up. In his
testimony to the inquiry, MacSharry insisted that if there had been any
failure to implement community directives, then the responsibility lay
in London.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Managing the market was never, I repeat never, given priority over
measures to protect public health,&quot; MacSharry said. &quot;The potential
threat to human health was recognised and given priority treatment from
the very beginning.&quot; This weekend he declined to comment further.<BR>
<BR>
The British government has also denied accusations by members of the committee
that it tried to mislead the public. Keith Meldrum, the chief veterinary
officer, told the inquiry that suggestions of a cover-up were &quot;totally
untrue&quot;.<BR>

Telegraph ... Friday 13 December 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>The government is to announce a <B>major climbdown</FONT></B>
on BSE by approving the slaughter of up to 125,000 more cattle, it emerged
last night.<BR>
<BR>
Brussels has <B>refused to lift the EU's ban on British
beef exports</FONT></B> without a wider cull. Ministers are expected to
confirm on Monday that they are ready to go ahead with the deal struck
at the Florence summit in June for a selective cull of those cattle deemed
to be most at risk from BSE.<BR>
<BR>
In September, the Cabinet shelved plans for the selective cull after scientific
evidence showed BSE would be eradicated under the existing scheme to slaughter
beasts 30 month old. But the EU made clear it would not countenance lifting
the ban unless the further slaughter went ahead.<BR>
<BR>
The announcement of the Government's retreat, which could <B>cost
between &pound;150-&pound;200 million</FONT></B> is expected after agreement
was secured from the Treasury on Wednesday evening.<BR>
<BR>
Downing Street <B>attempted to conceal the news</FONT></B>
by saying that the issue had not been discussed at yesterday's Cabinet
meeting but Government sources <B>admitted </FONT></B>last
night that an agreement had been hammered out. The development is likely
to enrage Tory backbenchers who are already furious at the Government's
equivocation over British membership of a European single currency.<BR>
<BR>
Although the figure of 125,000 has been widely used, experts believe the
cull total could be considerably lower as many have already been slaughtered
under the existing scheme. The final figure for the selective slaughter
programme could be nearer 100,000, according to agricultural sources.<BR>
<BR>
One of the problems facing the Government will be tracing the cattle for
slaughter. One area where it will be easier is Northern Ireland, which
could lead the way in having the EU ban lifted - a move which should win
Mr Major added breathing space from the Ulster Unionists as he battles
to keep his Government in office.

Sir,<BR><BR>
Your leader &quot;Of genes and faked beans&quot; (December 6) uses the argument that if a government authority considers something entirely safe for people to eat, it must be entirely safe to eat; and, consequently, any reluctance to eat the product is due to inadequate public education.<BR><BR>
Have we learnt nothing from the BSE fiasco? Did not the government and its scientific advisers originally reassure the country that beef was entirely safe to eat, but are now not so sure that it was.<BR><BR>
Because I am privileged to be reasonably well educated in general science and mathematics I realise that when a government representative says something is safe, what is meant is that there are considered to be no significant indications to the contrary. It does not mean something is in fact safe. By not labelling all products containing, or possibly containing, genetically-modified food the public are being denied a key choice.<BR><BR>
On seconds thoughts, your leader was right: there should be better public education, but by school teachers and not by certain politicians and industrialists.<BR><BR>

<BR>
</FONT><B>Eating beef is almost back to the level
it held six months before a possible link was made between BSE and</FONT></B>
<B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</FONT></B> <B>in
human beings</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
During the third quarter of the year, household beef consumption was 101g
(3.53 oz) per person per week, 3 per cent down on the same period of 1995,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
Between the first and second quarters, consumption plunged by 23 per cent
from 111g to 85g per person per week. This followed the Government's announcement
on March 20 that eating beef infected with BSE was the most likely cause
of a new strain of <B>CJD</FONT></B> in people.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Beef-eating is still 23 per cent lower than in
1994</FONT></B>. The long-term decline is attributed in part to fears of
BSE but also to the cheapness of rival meats such as poultry.<BR>

The Guardian ... Friday, December 6, 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>A government adviser on brain and other nerve damage caused by sheep
dip has <B>resigned from his post because he has
been &quot;gagged&quot;</FONT></B> by a new code of conduct which he says
prevents him telling the full truth in court.<BR>
<BR>
Goran A Jamal, a consultant at the Institute of Neurological Sciences in
Glasgow, had been preparing to be called as an expert witness in cases
where <B>alleged victims of organo-phosphate exposure
were claiming damages</FONT></B>. However, a new code of conduct for the
Medical and Scientific Panel of the Ministry of Agriculture imposed in
February effectively <B>prevented him telling the
court the full truth of what he knew</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Jamal said yesterday: &quot;I was distressed and alarmed at the content
of the code that was imposed upon us. I made it clear it was a resignation
issue for me but they would not relent. There was a conflict between continued
membership and serving justice in a court of law. In effect, they were
forcing me to be economical with the truth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Ministry of Agriculture instructed sheep farmers
over many years to use organo-phosphate sheep dips even though there was
evidence they could be harmful.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>There is increasing evidence both from Dr Jamal's institute
and the United States that low level exposure to sheep dip <B>causes
neurological damage</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
It was Dr Jamal's pioneering work that first proved that low level exposure
to organo-phosphates caused <B>nerve damage</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
He said it was not until it became known he was prepared to give evidence
that the code of conduct was imposed.<BR>
<BR>
An all-party group of MPs is backing Dr Jamal. Its chairman, Paul Tyler,
Liberal Democrat MP for North Cornwall, said: &quot;Dr Jamal gave hope
to victims of organo-phosphate poisoning when he was appointed. It was
a major reassurance to them that he would be there to find out the truth
of whether they were entitled to compensation. <B>He
was the only independent member of the committee</FONT></B>.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Ministry insists the evidence available to the committee about damage
should be kept confidential and Dr Jamal accepted that. He believed, however,
that the code prevented him giving other evidence that would have assisted
claimants.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Tyler and Michael Meacher, Labour environment spokesman, are to see
Angela Browning, the agriculture minister, next week to demand publication
of the code.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Meacher said: &quot;A key scientist has been forced to resign as a result
of the ministry's gagging attempts.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A ministry spokeswoman said the code was intended to provide guidelines
for committee members giving evidence in court. It was intended to prevent
giving information that was not already in the public domain.

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By Toby Helm and David Brown<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>Keith Meldrum, the Government's Chief Veterinary Officer, yesterday
rejected as &quot;<B>completely and utterly untrue</FONT></B>&quot;
claims from a senior Brussels official that Britain had tried to cover
up the <B>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B>
crisis in the early Nineties.<BR>
<BR>
At a hearing of the <B>European Parliament's special
inquiry into the handling of the BSE crisis</FONT></B>, Mr Meldrum gave
a robust defence of the Government's strategy on the epidemic. He made
clear that it had never attempted to hide the seriousness of the problem
from its European Union partners. The denial came as European Commission
efforts to step up the fight against <B>mad cow</FONT></B>
disease were blocked by veterinary experts.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A move to ban from the human and animal food chain
all tissues which could cause BSE or scrapie was rejected by the Standing
Veterinary Committee in Brussels</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, said he would appeal to EU
agriculture ministers to overturn the &quot;unacceptable&quot; decision.
The new measures already have been implemented in Britain, France and Ireland.<BR>

The Times ... December 07 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Approval for a selective cull of older cattle is <B>expected
next week</FONT></B>, raising hopes of a relaxation of the European Union
ban on British beef .<BR>
<BR>
Plans for the cull were discussed with a delegation from the European Parliament,
which visited Britain to assess the effectiveness of measures to protect
public health against BSE .<BR>
<BR>
Lord Plumb, leader of the Tory MEPs, said after the six-man delegation's
three-day tour ended yesterday: &quot;I am hoping that in a matter of days
we should be getting some announcement on this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Phillip Whitehead, Labour MEP for Staffordshire and Derby, said that a
lifting of the beef ban would be &quot;much more probable&quot; if the
Government gave the go-ahead for the selective cull.<BR>
<BR>
The European Parliament delegation inspected abattoirs and rendering plants.
They met Roger Freeman, the Cabinet minister in charge of co-ordinating
BSE policy , Ministry of Agriculture officials, scientists, farmers' leaders
and consumer groups.<BR>
<BR>
The slaughter of up to 147,000 cattle identified as being most at risk
of developing BSE was agreed at the EU summit in Florence last June but
the Government put the cull on hold in September, voicing doubts about
its scientific justification.<BR>
<BR>
Some 1.2 million cattle have been incinerated under a separate scheme to
keep those more than 30 months old out of the food chain. This was aimed
at restoring consumer confidence rather than speeding the eradication of
BSE . Cattle under 30 months old are regarded as the least likely to have
eaten the infected meal thought to have caused BSE .<BR>
<BR>
The selective cull would involve older cattle, mainly dairy cows, reared
alongside animals that have already died of BSE and likely to have eaten
the same feed.<BR>
<BR>
Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, still disputes the scientific grounds
for the selective cull but is understood to have been persuaded by the
political arguments.<BR>
<BR>
Lord Plumb said he believed <B>the selective cull
should involve about 100,000 animals</FONT></B>, fewer than the original
number because some would already have been killed under the over-30-months
scheme. Ian Gardiner, policy director of the National Farmers' Union, said:
&quot;A cull of close to 100,000 animals would be about right, and we want
the the Government to get on with it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Compensation for farmers could top &pound;100
million</FONT></B>. The cost per cow would be high because many animals
would still have years of milking and calving left in them.<BR>
<BR>
The European Parliament delegation was impressed by the BSE safeguards
in place. Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, a German MEP, said the
export ban would not have been needed had the measures been enforced with
rigour from the outset.

<CENTER><H3>Report on <A NAME="Ceres">Ceres</A> BSE meeting in Washington DC December 12-13.</H3> </CENTER>  <I>The webmaster of this site was present:</I>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The meeting was well-attended by a wide mix of people and the
presentations were generally excellent.  Some of more talked-about talks:<P>

Veteran prion researcher Joe Gibbs of NIH laid it on the line about endemic
TSE:  expect it in all mammals at 1 per million per year forever, just from
background mutation.  There's no way of getting rid of it and no way to be
a "BSE-free" country.  Gasps from the renderers, yawns from the moly bio's.<P>

Beth Williams, a veterinary pathologist from Wyoming, gave a good update on
chronic wasting disease, the TSE on the loose in Colorado deer and elk.
The disease is confined to a small region, but the incidence is
disconcertingly high -- a few percent of the population.  Lateral
transmission seems like a done deal here, but how?  They are on a mix of
public-private land, mostly cattle.<P>

I hate process modeling and expected the worst from Dave Harlan's talk, but
actually it was quite good.  Rather than make belligerent all-or-none
assumptions and assertions about BSE titre in the US, Harlan's risk-factor
approach has a goal of a log or two or three reduction.  If the titre is
initially zero, so much the better; if it is not, knock it back as
efficiently as practible by hitting amplification and re-cycling, trying to
get titre below a disease-sustaining threshhold. In other words, that's the
best you can do in the real world -- better get used to it.  (And not just
for BSE.)The other focus besides feeding amplification recycling should be pooled products, like bovine pituitary extracts, for which one sick animal gets pooled with many healthy animals, tainting the whole product.  <P>

US rendering industry scientist Don Franko's position was, if sheep are the
problem, kill the sheep (industry).  If you don't live in the western US,
this could be lost on you: cattle- and sheepmen have been at war for a
century.  Sheep by the millions were driven across the public lands,
leaving devastation in their wake for the less mobile cattle.  Real men
don't herd sheep and all that.<P>

The British delegation (Wilesmith, Bradley, Zeidler, Will) stuck
disappointingly to previously disclosed information, at least at the public
sessions.  It seems that Zeidler and Will are literally the only two who
know the numbers of confirmed nvCJD victims and if you didn't hear it from
them, you didn't hear jack.  There was broad hostility to the British
refusal to release numbers of suspected cases.<P>

I especially enjoyed Gerald Collee's talk; no rubbish from this seasoned
Scottish gentleman.  Collinge said straight out that BSE caused nvCJD and
no one objected; he filled the rest of his time with the  mouse experiment,
now generally viewed as irrelevent.  Telling told me afterwards that the
the strain bands differ by proteolytic nibbling.
<P>
Linda Detwiler of USDA covered her subject most competently.  They have
only gotten onto the immunohistochemistry recently however, so really only
600-700 CNS cows (ok so I got the number wrong) have  been tested  instead
of the 9,000 we hear about.  I see a concern in the training of remote vets:
we should be looking for bovine TSEs, not British BSE.  There's a big
difference, especialy in view of Marsh's results.  Don't expect the
pathology to be remotely the same.  It is also scary to hear Linda describe
how the job they can do is limited by budget -- this is a favorite way of
US industry to throttle environmental enforcement.  USDA needs to get the
money they need in proportion to the task in front of them.  They are way ahead of other countries with IHC and of course there are competing demands on funds.<P>

Kurt Wuethrich (no email) of Switzerland gave an important talk.  His group
has a stranglehold on prion structure, which inconveniently needs a Cray
supercomputer.  He told me flat out that, despite requests from 50 groups
(make that 51), he wasn't giving out the coordinates until April 1997.
[Normally, journals require this before publication;  here, July 11, 1996,
Nature.]   Still, a most charming and likeable fellow.  They showed  cow
and human threaded onto mouse, plus computed the structural impacts of
familial CJD point mutants.  A side view showed prion protein to be a rather thin disk; overall about 35 x 35 x10 angstroms.  All very instructive.  Sounds like there is
more to the solvent-exposed tryptophan than he is letting on to.  He
suggested that the 4 residue beta sheet could be the nucleating seed for a
propagating sheet in prp-sc.  The N-terminal is said to be amorphous, but
they haven't included copper or zinc ion in the mix, which would tie the
repeats together.  In Wuethrich's view, therapy is best directed at surface
blocking on normal prion, because "by the time you get prp-sc formed, it's
too late."<P>
I missed a tacky orchestrated session bashing consumer groups as well as
the banker session, being out in the hallway talking shop with ass't profs
from the Prusiner - Weissman - Harrington empires.<P>

Arpad Somogyi, of the German Consumer Protection Institute, was said to
have given an excellent talk on the precautionary principle, in the
concluding remarks.
<HR WIDTH="35%" ALIGN=Left>
<A HREF="mailto:<eileen@aabb.org>">Eileen Church</A> also took some meeting notes:
<P>

     Collinge stated that a prion protein appears to be central to the BSE
     epidemic but may not be the sole cause.  His biggest concern, of
     course,  is "How does a protein encode phenotype," as evidenced by the
     various strains of SEs.  Some work is being done in that area by Glenn
     Telling et al and will be published in the December 20 Science.<P>


     There was a lot of talk about the British government not doing what it
     should to react to the BSE epidemic.  John Collee stated that
     appropriate actions were taken in a timely way.  He noted that
     problems in enforcement occurred because of cross contamination of
     facilities, continued use of the stored product, and "evasion and
     fraud."  Collee also stated that the govt will conduct a study to try
     to trace back to the "worse than average" rendering mills, although
     this will be difficult, as many smaller mills that sold to larger ones
     are now out of business.<P>
     Collee's view of the route the infectious agent took once consumed as
     follows:<P>
  <PRE>gut
     adsorption to lymphoid tissue in Peyer's patches
     internalization by macrophages
     transport to local lymph nodes
     access to organs such as spleen
     possible transfer via splanchnic nerves to spinal cord
     access to brain with the accumulation of abnormal PrP</PRE>

     According to John Wilesmith, in 1981-82, effective exposure commenced.
     Recycling drove the epidemic, ie, infectious material from infected
     cows reentering the cattle food chain.  Wilesmith and others,
     including Collinge, stated that this recycling was very much a reason
     why the species barrier was broken. (although Colllinge acknowledged
     that the species barrier does still protect to a great extent).<P>

     Wilesmith stated that maternal transmission could not maintain the
     epidemic.  There is no evidence of any mechanism of transmission of BSE
     other than food-borne that was capable of sustaining the epidemic, he
     said. Collinge also agreed that there must be a single source.
     Wilesmith stated that selection bias may have affected the outcome of
     the maternal transmission study.  Wilesmith also stated that he has
     plans for a study to expose British cattle to British sheep scrapie to
     see what happens (ie, whether BSE is linked to scrapie or inherent in
     cattle, as latent or mutant agent).<P>

     Although Zeidler did rehash what is already out there, he previously
     stated (at a November conference) that the v-CJD cases would peak in
     about 7 years.  That indicates that he believes that these cases are
     on the rise, as opposed to being the mid-point of the epidemic.  He
     said the cases we are seeing now reflect 1986-89 exposures to beef. (I
     know these two thoughts do not seem to correspond but that's what he
     said).<P>

     It is also interesting to see the discussion going on now re: the
     number of v-CJD cases and their future pattern.  That was also much
     discussed at the meeting.  It was explained that there could have been
     many people exposed, but they did not develop the disease, for
     whatever reason (no genetic disposition, not enough infectious agent,
     species barrier, true resistance, etc).  If that was the case, then it
     is possible that the cases we are seeing today reflect the results of
     peak exposure, and will fall or will rise slightly and fall.  On the
     other hand, these cases may represent just the beginning of a much
     larger epidemic that will peak at much higher levels.  What appears
     unclear is where these human cases correspond to the curve
     representing the cattle epidemic.  Many stated it is too early to
     tell. Although it appeared to me that many were operating on the
     assumption that there are more cases to come, none really tried to
     predict the future magnitude of the outbreak.<P>

<PRE> Other items thrown out at meeting:<P>
     --pigs don't seem to be susceptible to SEs
     --fetal calf blood does not appear to transmit BSE to mice
     --Frank Bastian stated his theory that spiroplasma(s) are the agents
     of SE transmission

     Collee also added these other possible routes of infection (in cattle)
     --ingestion
     --wound contamination
     --inhalation
     --nasal/mucosal  (If you've ever seen cattle eat MBM, this should not
     be a surprise)</PRE>

#SE1821 Comparative efficiencies of the bioassay of BSE infectivity in cattle and mice. 
      This has vertually been completed and a species barrier of about 1000 was found.
      What it showed, of course was that mice could not be used easily as BSE assays and this
      made much of the previous work of the groups looking for BSE infectivity in tissues
      invalid. <P>

* Information is now appearing that scrapie had been passed to other animals by
      the USDA. The data does not seem to have been published and some of it is really quite important.
      Exactly which animals I am not allowed to say but this may be revealed in USDA
      documents. <P> 

* Canadian woman dies of CJD -seems to be the new variant form. 
      She was around 63 yr old i.e. not of the young group of CJD-2 cases that we have seen so far. The worry is
      that she is also not Met-Met at PrP 129, that being an indication that we are all open
      to infection but in people with the wrong codon it just takes longer to appear. She was
      living in the UK until around 1994 and was not a vegetarian. <P>
* The MAFF are now looking in the fields in the UK for mites that may carry prions. The amazing results from Staten Island showing that the mites from the land in Iceland
      actually had enough prion chemical to be found using blotting, must mean that the
      agent might be kept in the land by these arachnids. The worry is, of course that the
      land might also keep BSE.

</CENTER> BLANCOU, J., MESLIN, F.-X. <BR>
Selected Plenary and Symposium Sessions<BR>
XXV Congress of the World Veterinary
Association<BR>
Yokohama, Japan, 3-9 September 1995.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since ancient times, the international movement of animals or human
beings has been an occasion for the exchange of pathogens. The
authors examine various concrete examples of the most serious
incidents which have occurred from antiquity to the present day.
The history of disease incidents is studied in relation to trade in
animals and animal products: the international transmission of
<B>pathogens linked to trade in cattle and products of bovine origin:</B>
<P>
* rinderpest<BR>
* foot-and-mouth disease<BR>
* bovine pleuropneumia<BR>
* cowdriosis<BR>
* bovine spongiform encephalopathy<BR>
* African swine fever <BR>
* African horse sickness<BR>
* sheep pox
<P>
To illustrate the
economic consequences of disease incidents associated with trade in
animals and animal products, examples are given of <B>economic losses
recorded from 1766 (875,000 cattle died from rinderpest in Europe)</B>
to 1991-1994 (more than <B>three million pigs died or were killed due
to classical swine fever (hog cholera)</B> in Europe during this three-
year period, representing over US$ 1 billion in losses).
The consequences of international movement for human health are
discussed by providing examples of human diseases resulting from
the movement of people since ancient times (cholera, dengue,
influenza, plague, yellow fever, etc.) and of those resulting from
the introduction of animal or animal products (brucellosis, rabies,
tuberculosis, etc.).
<P>
Tables and figures are presented showing data from antiquity to the
20th century. The authors conclude by emphasing the increasingly
serious risks of transferring human or animal diseases world-wide
and the necessity of taking the most appropriate measures to reduce
these risks: strengthening veterinary and medical surveillance
systems, and conducting research into and development of new
vaccines.

<I>Vicky Rimmer was the first person in the
UK to show these symptoms. She is still alive, in a coma. The brailn biopsy was
performed  because doctors were so confused about what the disease
was. After all, they'd not come across it before in someone who had not had
a brain op or HGH.
<P>
 One point about Vicky Lowther, the latest to die: if the newspaper
report (Daily Mail in the UK) is accurate, <B>the course of the disease was
unusually rapid: four months from onset to death.</B> That dosen't fit the
symptoms seen in other vCJD victims, who had something like 18 months from
onset of clinical symptoms (depression, etc) to death. Wondering if
it's a variation in the disease, or if the press reports got the timing
wrong.</I>

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By David Brown, Agriculture Editor<BR>
<BR>
Daily Telegraph ... Thursday 5 December 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Loneliness in the farmhouse is taking its toll on the lives of farmers,
according to a new report.<BR>
<BR>
While countryside isolation is well recorded as a main cause of depression
and suicide, researchers at Oxford say that more than a third of farmers
who kill themselves have marriage difficulties or other family problems.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The survey tarnishes the image of the farmer's
wife as loyal, caring and loving by revealing that many did not know anything
was wrong because &quot;they haven't spoken to their husbands for years&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>The report, released to coincide with yesterday's official launch
of the Rural Stress Network, an umbrella organisation designed to reduce
suicides among farmers and their families, shows that personal problems
in the home are the biggest factor behind the deaths after business worries.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Aslog Malmberg, of Oxford's Department of Psychiatry, told the Royal
College of Psychiatry in London: &quot;Many wives were not aware anything
was wrong. <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">One woman said she had not spoken to
her husband for 10 years</FONT></B>.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She said many farmers faced more than one problem with business, marriage
and family all interlocked. &quot;Because of the nature of the way farms
are run, many problems overlap. If there are financial problems it will
affect the marriage and if there is divorce, or children want to buy out
of the business, it affects the value of the property,&quot; she added.<BR>
<BR>
In carrying out a study, backed by the Department of Health, Dr Malmberg
confirmed research showing that farmers were more likely than any other
profession to commit suicide and said the beef crisis could worsen matters.<BR>
<BR>
Figures released yesterday showed that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">650 farmers
killed themselves in England and Wales in the 11 years up to 1992</FONT></B>.
But they also revealed that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">farmers' wives suffered
stress and depression, with 147 of them committing suicide in the same
period</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The survey looked at 84 farmers who had killed themselves and found that
53 per cent had experienced a variety of problems with work in the year
before their deaths, with 22 per cent suffering financial strain. Thirty-five
per cent had marital trouble and 28 per cent family problems.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Malmberg said the researchers had looked at coroners' reports on farmers
and had interviewed relatives to try to identify factors leading to death.
The 84 farmers - all but three aged around 56 - were &quot;probably suffering
from moderate or severe depression at the time of the suicide which had
gone unnoticed or was being undertreated&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Janet Pugh, a farmer's wife from Hertfordshire who works as a volunteer
with the Samaritans, is a founder-trustee of the Rural Stress Network.
She said: &quot;Farmers, particularly the older ones, find it difficult
to talk over their problems with their wives. They see it as a weakness
to ask for help.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Richard Kerkham, head of the Samaritans' rural group network, said: &quot;Since
March 20 when the beef crisis broke, farmers are talking to each other
more about their difficulties. They wouldn't normally do that with their
immediate neighbour - because he is a rival - but, with BSE, all livestock
farmers are in the same boat.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<I>Secrecy surrounds the extent of the epidemic.   Dr. Sheila Gore called for the Edinburgh  CJD Unit to releasing monthly or quarterly figures on suspected nv-CJD cases to other scientists, but they refused.   Because of increasing familiarity with nvCJD, false-positives are probably increasingly rare among the suspected category.  If even half of the 60 new cases are nvCJD, this would reperesent a huge acceleration in the epidemic. -- webmaster</I>

<H4><FONT COLOR="990099">Early symptoms of BSE:</FONT></H4>
Veterinary surgeon Richard Sibley (Tiverton, Devon) on early symptoms of BSE
(prefers worried-cow disease or anxious-cow disease):
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The character of the animal changes.  In fact, the symptoms of BSE vary
accorig to what the original nature of the animal was.  The mad cows have
generally been pretty mad before they got BSE.  If they're wild before they
get it, they suffer much more exaggerated symptoms.  The very quiet,subdued
animals tend to show lmuchmilder early signs..  The farmers all notice it.
cows are creatures of habit.  They tend to  come into the milking parlor in
the same order each times -- but these cows hang back.  They don't feed
quite as well.  they stop ruminating, they stopy cuddind, and that leds to
digestive upsets.  They lose condition and their milk production fallls.
All those things show up before they ever show any nervousness, or
madness."

<P>
'Shipley's cow video shows an animal looking "worried."  The cow's head was
hanging, and her movements had a quality that was sumultaneously jumpy and
slowed down.  She was frowning -- her brow was furrowed -- and her
movements were somehow tentative, she seemed to be nervous about where to
put her front feet..  When another cow came up behind her, she started and
looked alarmed.  There was a shaking movement across her shoulders. Later:
the affected animals rubbed parts of their bodies against walls or fences.
They began to shake and tremble, their sense of balance was impaired.
After about six months, they could no longer get to their feet.'</BLOCKQUOTE>

1930's: 18,000 UK sheep were inoculated against louping ill, a brain
inflammatory illness, spread by ticks.  Despite formalin-treatment of the
inoculated agent, the procedure gave rise to 1500 cases of scrapie. Louping
is a Scottish word for fleeing or leaping, related to loping.  In humans,
louping ill is called Russian spring-summer encephalitis, a
meningo-encephalitis with muscular tremors and spasms followed by varying

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Here, in the place where we don't want to be, we know that one of
three things will happen.  First, there's the theoretical possibility that
there is no connection whatsoever between BSE and the new human
disease.  Unfortunately, scientists aren't looking anywhere other than at
BSE for the cause of new-variant CJD, and a real consensus has
solidified on the existence of a link (which may well be as difficult to
'prove' as the link between tobacco and lung cancer).  
<P>
Second, there's
the apocalyptic scenario--that all parts of the infected cow are infective
and the species barrier is nonexistent.  In that case, anyone who had
eaten any part of the 729,000 infected cattle would come down with a
fatal brain disease -- <B>a disaster of Old Testament proportions.</B>  This, too,
seems highly unlikely, since there is no evidence that muscle tissue is
infective, and we already know, thanks to [John] Collinge's mice, that
some form of species barrier is in place.  
<P>
Third, it may turn out that BSE
does cause a fatal human disease but that the species barrier is such
that only a minority of those exposed to it succumb.  This seems to be
the most realistic prediction.  It means that over the next several
years--over the next decades, if kuru is any guide--the death toll will fall
between the current total of 12 and some other, darker figure."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><H3> <A NAME="Betraying">Betraying</A> the public over nvCJD risk</H3>
</CENTER>
Lancet  Volume 348 Number 9041:  Saturday 7 Decemeber 1996
<P>
Tuesday, Nov 26, contrasted the way in which risk information is brokered by scientists and the lay media. In the morning, the UK broadsheet newspaper <I>The Independent</I> had led its front page with an exclusive headlined "After the hype, the scientists' verdict: CJD to kill hundreds". In the afternoon, the Royal Statistical Society met in London to discuss the latest information about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its connection to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The same data are in question: whether or not the 14 known cases of new-variant CJD (nvCJD) arise from eating BSE-infected cattle and are the vanguard of an epidemic.

<P>
<I>The Independent</I> reported Dr James Ironside from the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, UK, as saying "It looks as though the total number of cases over the whole course of the disease will be in the hundreds, rather than the thousands". The sharp eye could discern in a dark and unidentified accompanying photograph an abattoir hook and a cloven hoof, which invited reinforcement of the suspected but unproven link between eating beef products and nvCJD. Dr Ironside told <I>The Lancet</I> that he had been quoted incorrectly. At the press conference after the statisticians' meeting, the expert panel was immediately pressed to predict the "size of the nvCJD epidemic". The answer was given by Prof Adrian Smith, the President of the society: zero to millions.

<P>
What makes that answer any more defensible than the previous estimates fed to the public by the media, which ranged from millions last April, to hundreds of thousands in the summer, to the latest "hundreds"? Zero to millions is correct because it is the best estimate available with the known information. In truth, a useful prediction is impossible. Crucial parts of the equation remain unknown, in particular the incubation period in human beings and the minimum infective dose of the prion organism. The only way to estimate either is by continuing observation. There will be no quick answer. At the current rate of finding new cases, 2-3 further years of observation will be needed, unless there is a rapid increase in finding new cases. Other unknown factors include the extent of the interspecies barrier between cow and human being, and the effectiveness of the 1989 UK offal ban. A new finding, which will restrict the population at risk, is that all the known cases are homozygous for methionine at position 129 of the prion. Only 38% of the total population carry this homozygosity. At the statistical meeting, Prof Smith reaffirmed that no predictions about nvCJD are possible from what is currently known. The same line was taken by another expert in epidemic modelling, Prof Roy Anderson, also on that Tuesday morning at a press conference held by veterinary experts (<A HREF="http://www.thelancet.com/lancet/User/vol348no9040/news/index.html#nvcjdmuscles">see <I>Lancet</I>, Nov 30, p 1505</A>).

<P>
What a newspaper such as <I>The Independent</I> has done is to assume that its readers cannot cope with the uncertainty of an estimate that runs from none to several millions. It was assumed that the public wants high precision. Yet this belief has led to needless confusion. If the "epidemic" is in the hundreds, the argument goes, the public will be reassured, even though no-one can say for certain which individuals will be affected. If the estimate is in the millions, then the chance of being affected is too high for comfort. Until there is good evidence that such assumptions are valid, we all must strive to balance prudent journalism with impartial accuracy.

<P>
The public rightly wishes to know about risks they take. The background in this case is that the UK Government, initially at least, denied any danger from eating contaminated beef products. What is less clear is what the public <I>needs</I> to know: absolute risk estimates or a range reflecting current uncertainties? When "don't know" is the correct answer, then that is what should be printed. Anything else betrays people's trust.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's an odd editorial that just came out in tomorrow's Lancet.  I say odd, because it focuses on bashing the Independent's article that quoted Ironside [on the supposed low side of eventual magnitude of the epidemic], rather than bashing Ironside for leaking to the media contents of an article submitted to Lancet but still out for peer review.  But I doubt that we will ever see the article in print, given its bashing by Anderson and Adrian Smith.   Indeed, the conclusions of the final paragraph are very much on target.

English science has split cleanly down the middle, acoording to whether they are funded independently by Burroughs-Wellcome or by the internally conflicted MAFF.  The later grantees, for whatever reason, anachronistically release a steady stream of face-saving analyses that don't sit well with the first group of scientists, who only recently got their hands on basic data (and samples!) after years of stonewalling (see Anderson Aug 29 Nature).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The truth of the matter is that from the moment BSE started to appear
in other species it apparent that there was a very real risk to
humans.  However the implications of this risk to the UK dairy and
beef industries was so horrendous that we have been desparately
clinging to the absence of absolute proof despite all the
circumstantial evidence.  Lacey may have been one
of the few scientists with the guts to put this in print but most
scientists in the SCRs and coffee rooms recognised the risk a long
time ago.  People died unnecessarily because we gambled that on the
unlikely chance that we would be immune.<P>
 
There appears to be a pattern to these incidents.  It starts with a
suggestion of a new danger to human life or health that has economic
consequences (BSE, HIV in Facter VIII).  Even before we know the
nature of the risk a government official denies (quoting unspecified
scientific advisors) that there is any chance of humans being
affected.  The worried industry sighs with relief, the consumers are
reassured and business continues as usual.  The few people who
publicly disagree are discredited.   The evidence mounts until the
facts can no longer be ignored.  The government finally admits the
problem but sactimoniously says that it could not have been
predicted.  Cost have been minimised, some additional people have
died and everyone has kept their jobs (except possibly the Lacey s of
this world).<P>
 
The process works very well for everyone except the people who die or
are injured but these people represent a very small % of the total
population who are unlikely to be able to vote or claim compensation
so they are not a problem. No true scientist would ever claim that there was no risk to humans simply because there was no proof of a risk to humans.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Origin">Origin</A> of Sporadic CJD</H3>
</CENTER>
<A HREF="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~listserv/archive/BSE-L.html">Listserve 12.01.96</A><P>

 I  assume that all so-called sporadic CJD can be put down to
infections, by blood-transmissions (CJD-infected blood) for example,
consumption of meat of cattle, sheep, and goat (BSE- and
scrapie-infected), scratching and licking by cats (FSE), gutting of game
(CWD) and so on.<P>
 
A first piece of evidence is the results of a study by Goodbrand et al.
(1995). They found out by immunostaining that a subset of the "sporadic"
CJD-cases showed a very similar staining pattern to the growth hormone
related cases. One could indeed assume that this subset was caused by an
infection with blood of a CJD patient, whereas the patterns in other
"sporadic" cases, very different from that one, could have been caused
by infection with animal TSE.<P>

It was in an article from the Bundesforschungsanstalt fuer
Viruskrankheiten der Tiere, Tuebingen, where I found the statement that
the lamb is mainly infected by the milk (O.C. Straub: Bovine spongiforme
Ezephalopathie (BSE), Deutsches Tieraerzteblatt 5, 1990). This institution is _the_ leading German institute for virus diseases (ranked as a ministry); they do active research on scrapie.
 <P>
Though in the German scientific literature, the paper has never been
revised, I was told by telephone only two days ago about the statement
not being necessarily true. I'll inform you as soon as I'll have got a
comment on it from Tuebingen

</CENTER><A HREF="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~listserv/archive/BSE-L.html">Listserve 12.07.96</A><P>
Here is something remarkable that came up with another neurodegenerative
disease that could have applicability to (some fraction) of sporadic CJD
(that comprises 85% of all cases).  That is, some sporadic CJD could be
genetic after all (even though the coding region of the gene is normal).<P>
 
The surprise with ALS is that a tissue-specific error (motor cortex and
spinal cord) is being made in mRNA intron editing. Either some non-coding
mutation is giving the cell's RNA-processing machinery the wrong directions
for removing the introns, or a mutation is in the processing machinery
itself (which would then have a component somewhat specific to this gene
product), or some somatic process is causing the problem (if these are
truly non-heritable).<P>
 
The prion gene also has introns, but these are upstream of the coding
region.  Prion protein itself would not normally be sequenced in a case of
sporadic CJD because it is so much faster and safer to work on DNA.  And
because of where the restriction endonuclease sites occur, only the ORF is
generally examined. But perhaps the ALS study will encourage researchers to
look at mature prion mRNA now.  There is some talk that Collinge's group
has indeed done this with interesting results.  However, the introns are
long tracts of DNA with little selective pressure, so expect a highly
unfavorable signal to noise ratio of irrelevent polymorphisms, which will
make it hard to isolate causative factors.  Each such case of sporadic CJD
might have its own separate genetic basis.  There are a variaty of reasons
why these might not show up as familial (penetrance only in conjunction
with other factors, etc.).<P>
 
Further, this mechanism might also only account for a fraction of sporadic
CJD.  The rest could be like nvCJD, e.g., from other strains of BSE or
other species than cow.

Science Volume 274, Number 5293, Issue of 6 December 1996, p. 1612
<P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.--Neuroscientists gathered here late last month for their largest
annual meeting ever. The presentations covered a wide range of topics, from spinal cord
injury and obesity (Science, 29 November, p. 1466) to learning and neurodegenerative
disease.
<P>
When scientists found the gene at fault in some cases of the neurodegenerative disease
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a few years ago, the discovery was the first real clue to what
might cause ALS. But mutations in the gene, which makes an enzyme called superoxide
dismutase (SOD1), account for only about 1% of all cases of ALS--also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease--which causes a gradual paralysis and usually results in death. And it is still unclear
whether SOD1 defects contribute to unexplained "sporadic" cases, which are not inherited and
which constitute 95% of all cases. Now a team led by Johns Hopkins University neurologist
Jeffrey Rothstein has uncovered an abnormality that seems to be widespread in patients with
sporadic ALS.
<P>
In a poster session here, Rothstein and his colleagues presented evidence that a brain protein
called EAAT2 is improperly made in almost half of the patients they studied. If confirmed,
Rothstein says, the finding would strengthen earlier suspicions that a deficiency of the
protein, which deactivates and recycles the neurotransmitter glutamate, is a "potential cause
or contributor" to the disease, because such a deficiency could lead to a glutamate buildup.
Glutamate is toxic to cells in high concentrations, and some researchers have theorized that
the paralysis of ALS might be caused by increased levels of the neurotransmitter and the
resulting death of neurons that control the muscles.
<P>
Albert Ludolph, a neuroscientist at the University of Ulm in Germany, is cautious about the
results, which are not yet published. "It's a promising finding that needs confirmation," he
says. "It's another piece in the puzzle we're trying to solve." Rothstein agrees. "We don't
believe there's only one cause" of ALS, he says, but if the defect does turn out to contribute to
ALS development, the finding could someday lead to a useful diagnostic test and perhaps to
improved treatments.
<P>
Rothstein, postdoctoral researcher Glen Lin, and research associate Lynn Bristol discovered
the EAAT2 defects while following up on earlier observations that many ALS patients have
abnormally low levels of the protein in areas affected by the disease: the motor cortex and
spinal cord. To track down the cause of that deficit, the Hopkins team examined the messenger
RNAs (mRNAs), which provide the direct instructions for making the protein, in brain and
spinal cord tissue obtained at autopsy from ALS patients. They found that those mRNAs were
often edited incorrectly in precisely the same tissues where the low protein levels were seen.
<P>
Most genes of higher organisms contain non-protein-coding sequences, called introns, that
have to be removed from the mRNAs before the proteins themselves are synthesized. But the
Hopkins workers found that the machinery that removes the introns from the EAAT2 mRNAs
made mistakes in 11 of the 20 sporadic ALS patients they tested. It either failed to remove an
unneeded intron, or it deleted an essential protein-coding sequence, called an exon. As a result,
the mRNAs make no EAAT2 at all or make a faulty version. Rothstein and his colleagues did not
find the abnormalities in brain tissue from 12 normal subjects or in 16 patients who died of
other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Huntington's. This suggests that
the EAAT2 defect is specific to ALS and not just a general consequence of nerve cell death.
<P>
Many questions remain unanswered. The researchers do not yet know what causes the mistakes
in the mRNAs. It may be that a mutation in the EAAT2 gene gives the cell's RNA-processing
machinery the wrong directions for removing the introns. Or the fault may lie in the
processing machinery itself. Also unexplained, Rothstein says, is how the defect could be
restricted to the motor cortex and spinal cord.
<P>
Nevertheless, says neurologist Wim Robberecht of the University of Leuven in Belgium, the
evidence for a common denominator in at least some sporadic ALS cases is exciting. Even if the
primary cause is "something completely unrelated" to glutamate metabolism--for example,
the buildup of damaging free radicals from a malfunctioning SOD1 protein--Rothstein's
findings "would finally give very conclusive evidence that an abnormality of glutamate
metabolism is indeed involved" in ALS, if only as an important secondary mechanism.

<H4>CJD in <A NAME="Oman">Oman</A>  - report of 2 cases</H4>
Scrimgeour,E.M.; Chand,P.R.; Kenny,K.; Brown,P.<BR>
Journal of the Neurological Sciences 1996; 142(N1-2): 148-50 1996
<p>Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was diagnosed in two Omani Arab men, aged 50
and 75 years respectively, both with a history of rapidly developing dementia and myoclonic
jerks. Illness developed over a period of 3 months in the first case and over six months in the
second. Electroencephalography in both subjects showed periodic triphasic sharp waves
characteristic of CJD. In neither case was it possible to obtain a brain biopsy or perform
autopsy (autopsy is contrary to Islamic practice in the Middle East), however,
electrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid from the second patient revealed the distinctive double
protein spots characteristic of CJD. This is the first report of CJD from Oman.

 <CENTER><H3><A NAME="Butcher">Butcher</A> sold meat after food poison warning </H3>
</CENTER>
The Times: Britain: BY SHIRLEY ENGLISH December 4 1996<P>

 THE butcher linked to the fatal food poisoning outbreak in Scotland supplied cooked meats to a party a day after he was told to withdraw his products, it was claimed yesterday. Strathclyde detectives began an investigation into the timing of the sale as a sixth person died from the suspected <I>E. coli 0157</I> outbreak.

<P>
Butchers John M. Barr &amp; Son, of Wishaw, supplied a party with turkey, boiled ham and roast beef on Saturday, November 23, despite being told to remove all cooked meats from sale the night before, Lanarkshire Health Board said. Twenty-two guests out of 104 who attended the eighteenth birthday celebration in The Cascade pub, Coltness, near Wishaw, more than a week ago have symptoms of <I>E. coli 0157</I>.
One is in hospital and six guests have yet to be traced. Strathclyde Police said: "We have been instructed by the Procurator Fiscal to look into the circumstances surrounding this sale."

<P>

The 72-year-old woman who died yesterday in Monklands Hospital, Airdrie, after being admitted to hospital on November 24, has not been named. A total of 168 people have now been confirmed as being infected with <I>E. coli 0157</I>, most of them in Lanarkshire. It is feared that as many as one in ten may develop kidney problems. Fifty-eight people are in hospital and 25 are seriously ill, including four children in Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital who are still receiving dialysis for kidney damage, as are two adults at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and a 60-year-old woman who is critical but stable.
John Reid, MP for Motherwell North, said he was devastated by the news that a batch of potentially contaminated meat had been sold after health warnings.

<P>

Hugh Pennington, who is head ing the Scottish Office inquiry into the epidemic, said yesterday: "This outbreak is unusual in that it was not associated with burgers, milk or water. We still have a lot to learn about the <I>E. coli</I> organism. "This is not just a burger bug." Professor Pennington has been asked by Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, to prepare his report by Christmas.

<P>

John M. Barr &amp; Son gave environmental health officers a list of outlets on Saturday, but more emerged over the course of last week. One further venue was disclosed on Sunday and then the eighteenth birthday party. The firm has now referred all enquiries to its insurers, Hamilton, Burns &amp; Moore, who yesterday said that they were not aware of any claims against the firm.

<P>
Legal aid has been granted to seven children, aged between 3 and 7, to prepare a ground-breaking legal action over <I>E. coli 0157</I> against the Government (Frances Gibb writes). The children, who suffered food poisoning and kidney problems in different incidents in England, say it failed to give warning of the dangers of undercooked beef and the risks of the bacterium. They will also be suing variously McDonald's Restaurants, a firm of meat suppliers and an abattoir. Their claims for damages will argue that the Government should impose mandatory labelling of beef products for the required cooking time and temperature. It should also impose mandatory steam cleaning of carcasses.

<P>
A spokesman for McDonald's said last night: "The danger from <I>E. coli</I> is well known and it is extremely important to cook all food at the right temperature and for the right length of time. We would like to reassure our customers that all McDonald's products are cooked to exacting standards and to the highest specification."

</CENTER>
The Times: Britain   December 5 1996 BY RUSSELL JENKINS<P>

 A FAMILY is considering legal action against the butcher at the centre of the Scottish food poisoning outbreak after 22 guests at a party fell ill.
The move came as a seventh person died from the outbreak. The unnamed man was 74 and came from Wishaw, North Lanarkshire.
Strathclyde Police are investigating how cooked meats were supplied by John M. Barr &amp; Son for Lauren MacFarlane's eighteenth birthday party, despite warnings from health officials that they were the suspected source of <I>E. coli 0157 </I> bacteria. William and Fay MacFarlane said they were considering the possibility of seeking compensation for distress to themselves and their daughter's guests.
<P>
The couple said yesterday that they had asked health officials if the cold meat was safe and had sought reassurances from the butcher. Paul Santoni, the family lawyer, said that they arranged through a relative to buy the meat from Barr's in Wishaw. The relative was assured that the food scare related only to meats of "a type not purchased by my clients".
Mr Santoni said Mrs MacFarlane had also checked with Law Hospital in Carluke &#173; where victims were being treated &#173; and had been told "to go ahead and have a good party".

<CENTER><H3>Germans shift panic on British food to <A NAME="salmon">salmon</A></H3>
</CENTER>
The Times: Britain: December 6 1996<BR>
BY ROGER BOYES IN BONN AND MICHAEL HORNSBY<BR>

THE German panic about British food yesterday shifted briefly away from infected beef to Scottish salmon, which researchers said may have been poisoned by neurotoxins. Fish experts in Hamburg said that Scottish salmon breeders had been using the poison Ivermectin to kill sea lice, which settle on the scales of the fish. The chemical is widely used against cow, sheep and horse parasites but can damage fish and is indissoluble, according to a newsletter from the Federal German Fish Research Agency.

<P>

The newsletter alleged that British salmon farms were getting around restrictions on marine use of the chemical by keeping small herds of sheep. The German press complained that farmers who used the chemical illegally were given only token punishment: one was fined &#163;500. <I>Die Zeit </I> claimed that the 1974 Control of Pollution Act had been amended to allow release of Ivermectin into open waters.

<P>

Salmon farmers reacted angrily to the claims. William Crowe, chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Growers' Association, said: "The German reports are scurrilous and false and we are taking legal advice." The farmers are allowed to use Ivermectin to control sea lice under strict conditions provided they get consent. Only four of the 343 farms have such consent.

<P>

Ministry of Agriculture tests found traces of Ivermectin in 10 per cent of salmon sampled in 1995, but Scottish farmers said that the tests did not distinguish between home-reared and imported salmon, which accounts for a fifth of all salmon sold in Britain. Irish, Canadian and Norwegian salmon farmers have used Ivermectin.

</CENTER>
European Parliament Socialist Group Press Release
 18 November 1996
<P>

EU consumer protection chief Ken Collins today set a three-point
plan to regain consumer confidence in the wake of the mad cow crisis.
Mr Collins, chairman of the European Parliament's all-party
consumer committee, told a London conference organised by Charter 88 and
the Independent newspaper:
<BLOCKQUOTE> 'It is possible that the BSE crisis may eventually serve a useful
purpose.  It must be hoped that the overwhelming sense of "never again"
experienced by so many concerned with BSE may be harnessed and provoke
reforms to the system for making food policy.'</BLOCKQUOTE>

Mr Collins (Labour, Strathclyde East) called for:
 <PRE> +     BOOSTED competence for the EU in making public health policy;
     +     INCREASED consultation and use of independent advisors; and
     +     ESTABLISHMENT of a European food agency.</PRE>
Said Mr Collins:  'In the context of the single market, consumer
protection measures must be uniform.  The codecision procedure, which
gives the European Parliament the power of veto should be extended to
this area.' This would weaken the ability of the Council of Ministers to 'stall
even the weak measures it so secretly produces.'
<P>
Policy makers needed independent, expert advise.  'In the case of
policy on BSE, this means allowing independent scientists and consumer
groups to access decision makers on a footing which is at least equal
to that of agriculture and industry lobbies.  Good policy usually
emerges from wide consultation rather than slavish devotion to the
deregulated market.'
<P>
Establishment of a European Food Agency was 'a matter of urgency,'
said Mr Collins.  'Only then will consumers feel that the EU has a food
market which is safe as well as integrated.'

>From Mr D.G. Feickert<BR><BR>
Sir,<BR><BR>
David Wighton reports (&quot;Onslaught begins on EU regulation&quot;, November 26) that Roger Freeman, the UK deregulation minister, will lead a drive for deregulation at a meeting of the internal market council in Brussels and that the UK is being supported increasingly by other member states. The mood has changed, Freeman claims.<BR><BR>
Could this be the mood change following the explosion of the BSE crisis in the EU and enhanced now by the Channel tunnel fire? The former is seen widely as originating in a &quot;deregulation too far&quot; in the UK meat rendering industry which is costing the EU and its member states Ecu10bn. The latter arises from the kind of health and safety deregulation advocated so strongly by the UK, which limited severely the safety design of the Chunnel on cost grounds.<BR><BR>
Can the EU afford any more UK-inspired deregulation?<BR><BR>

<P>

                                                <BLOCKQUOTE> On Nov 26, ten years to the day since the first reported
                                                 case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
                                                 veterinary experts at a press conference held to discuss the
                                                 epidemiology of BSE and scrapie found that the audience
                                                 were more interested in reactions to the latest media hype
                                                 on new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD).
                                                 According to a report in The Independent (Nov 26)
                                                 "hundreds of Britons will die every year from CJD caused
                                                 by eating BSE-infected food". <P>

                                                 Commenting on the newspaper report, Prof Roy Anderson
                                                 (Oxford, UK) said that he personally felt that to extrapolate
                                                 from 14 recorded cases of nvCJD when so little was known
                                                 about disease parameters was difficult and could not be done
                                                 scientifically at present. Prof Ian McConnell (Cambridge,
                                                 UK) agreed but added that he had not seen the data behind
                                                 the newspaper report . <P>

                                                 Returning to veterinary matters, Anderson reported
                                                 encouraging results about how soon BSE would be cleared
                                                 from the British herd. His latest estimates are that, if the
                                                 older animals are culled first, the epidemic may be
                                                 effectively over by mid-1998, rather than by 2001 as
                                                 reported in August (Nature 1996; 382: 77988) and that
                                                 only 150 cattle below the age of 30 months are currently
                                                 infected. <P>

                                                 Among the issues discussed was the possibility of clearing
                                                 scrapie from sheep flocks. The scientists stressed that this
                                                 should be a high priority because of animal health issues
                                                 rather than human health considerations. </BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

Financial Times ... Tuesday November 19 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>The world market for beef shows <B>little
sign of pulling out of its current depressed state</FONT></B>, the World
Trade Organisation says in its annual report on the international meat
markets.<BR>
<BR>
Beef prices have slumped this year due to the impact of <B>bovine
spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B> (BSE), or &quot;<B>mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease, on European demand, and a big expansion in
US production that will make it a net exporter this year for the first
time since 1945.<BR>
<BR>
In mid-1996 prices for manufacturing beef in the US were <B>20
per cent below their levels in early 1995</FONT></B> and <B>40
per cent below their levels in early 1994</FONT></B>, while returns from
<B>exports to Japan were down nearly 40 per cent</FONT></B>
over the year, the report says.<BR>
<BR>
The price outlook depends largely on the response of US producers to rising
feed-grain costs and the longer term impact of the &quot;<B>mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; scare, both of which are uncertain, the WTO points
out.<BR>
<BR>
In the European Union, beef consumption has plunged even in countries free
of BSE. EU intervention stocks, which were virtually zero at the beginning
of 1996, are now rising again, the report notes.<BR>
<BR>
However, <B>beef consumption is rising strongly in
Japan and South Korea</FONT></B>, while falling home production has lifted
Russian import demand. Japanese imports are predicted to top 1m tons this
year, overtaking those of the US to make Japan the world's biggest beef
importer.<BR>
<BR>
World beef trade is estimated at 4.86m tons in 1996, up 3.5 per cent from
1995.<BR>
<BR>
Low prices in the US market prevented Australia and New Zealand, the world's
biggest and fourth-biggest exporters, respectively, from benefiting from
this year's easier market access arrangements agreed in the Uruguay Round
global trade accords. At the same time, Canada's exports, mostly to the
US, have jumped by one-quarter.<BR>
<BR>
Argentina's beef industry has suffered from bad weather, declining domestic
consumption and lower shipments to the EU, its biggest customer, because
of the &quot;<B>mad cow</FONT></B>&quot; crisis.
But exports from Brazil and Uruguay have risen strongly in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
Uruguay has been helped by certification as a country free of foot-and-mouth
disease, which has enabled it to ship beef to the US.<BR>
<BR>
Argentina is also working towards FMD-free status, which should lift export
performance in Asia as well as North America.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#009F00">Beef ban: Brussels suggests UK could
have deal</FONT></H3>
<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By Caroline Southey in Brussels<BR>
<BR>
Financial Times ... Monday November 18 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Britain's European Union partners would <B>approve
a partial lifting of the beef ban</FONT></B>, the European Commission believes,
if the UK pressed for an end to the embargo on meat from herds which have
been free of <B>mad cow</FONT></B> disease. It would
be acceptable to all <B>bar Germany</FONT></B>, officials
think.<BR>
<BR>
Such a move would amount to a regional lifting of the ban, since incidence
of <B>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B>
(BSE) has been lower in Northern Ireland and Scotland than in the rest
of the UK.<BR>
<BR>
Northern Ireland and Scottish farmers have urged the government to pursue
the case for lifting the ban on &quot;certified&quot; herds. Their cause
has been taken up by Mr Ivan Yates, the Irish agriculture minister, and
they have had a sympathetic hearing from Mr Franz Fischler, the agriculture
commissioner.<BR>
<BR>
However, the British government has refused to lodge the request in Brussels.
Nor would it do so, said an official, until EU scientists had given their
views on the merits of a selective cull of British cattle aimed at reducing
incidence of the disease. This is not expected until early next year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Any lifting of the ban depends on us meeting the Florence conditions,
which include a selective cull. We can't decide on the cull until we know
what the scientists think,&quot; the official said.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Douglas Hogg, Britain's agriculture minister, will today brief his counterparts
at a meeting in Brussels on the steps taken to fulfil the terms of the
Florence agreement. &quot;We will try to impress on them we are trying
to push things forward,&quot; an official said. &quot;But there won't be
any dramatic new departures.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
EU officials believe the UK is stalling on the issue because of domestic
political considerations. &quot;They don't want to do anything this side
of the election. They would prefer to be able to portray us as perfidious
idiots who can't speak the language,&quot; said one.<BR>
<BR>
The British government also has been reluctant to act because of fears
of a political backlash in Scotland. Cabinet ministers are nervous that
Northern Ireland farmers would exploit markets traditionally supplied by
Scotland if the ban was lifted in Ulster first. &quot;Some are arguing
that it has to be all, or nothing,&quot; said the EU official.<BR>
<BR>
Commission and British experts have already begun discussing the conditions
under which the ban could be lifted, including a definition of a certified
herd and systems for tracing cattle. &quot;There would be common rules
for all. But some obstacles will be so high that only some will be able
to clear them,&quot; the official said.<BR>
<BR>
Northern Ireland in particular could easily meet the necessary conditions,
since there have been incidents of BSE in only 3 per cent of its herds.
It also has a sophisticated computerised database of all cattle and the
advantage of being separate from the mainland, making it easier to control
exports.<BR>

</FONT>Security will be tightened at the Royal Smithfield Show today for
a visit by Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Extra police and security guards</FONT></B> will
be at Earl's Court <B>to protect Mr Hogg</FONT></B>
after fears that he may face protests about the handling of the beef crisis.
Earlier this year he was jostled when he attended a farm show in the West
Country. Mr Hogg declined an invitation to open the show on the advice

himself open to further trouble</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
A total of 367 cattle and 249 sheep and <B>207 carcasses</B> have been entered
for the show, which runs until Wednesday and is designed to promote British
meat and livestock. Vegetarians and animal rights protesters staged an
anti-meat protest outside the show, blaming farmers for endangering consumers
by spreading <B>mad cow</FONT></B> disease.<BR>
<BR>
Farmers at the show voiced optimism about the future of the beef market.
Prices have been rising as demand increases in the run-up to Christmas.
Thieves opted for beef when they took hundreds of pounds' worth of joints,
steaks and mince from a supermarket's stand before the show opened, leaving
pork and lamb untouched.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>Farming leaders put pressure on Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister,
yesterday by demanding an <B>immediate start to a
cull of up to 147,000 cattle</FONT></B> to persuade the European Union
to lift its export ban on British beef.<BR>
<BR>
Even as the Government announced that its existing cull of cattle of more
than 30 months of age <B>will have destroyed more than one million animals</B>
by the end of this week, the presidents of the major UK farming unions
said this was not enough.<BR>
<BR>
They chose the Royal Smithfield Show at Earls Court, London, to issue a
statement saying: &quot;The farming communities . . . consider it essential
that the selective cull goes ahead forthwith to restore our export trade
in beef and beef products.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sir David Naish, President of the National Farmers Union of England and
Wales, Sandy Mole, President of the Scottish NFU, Greer McCollum, President
of the Ulster Farmers Union, and John Lloyd Jones, chairman of the Welsh
Council of the NFU, criticised lack of action by the Government to implement
an agreement made by John Major at the Florence summit to cull cattle deemed
most at risk of harbouring BSE. They warned that Britain had no chance
of securing a lifting of the beef ban until this was done. They urged the
Government to introduce statutory instruments to allow a selective cull
to go ahead.<BR>
<BR>
Visiting the show, where he met a farmers' delegation in private, Mr Hogg
defended the Government's performance over BSE and said he <B>recognised
the need to make a decision on a selective cull &quot;soon&quot;</FONT></B>.
He hinted that there might be an announcement before Christmas.<BR>

London Evening Standard ... Tuesday 26 November 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B>Hundreds of Britons will be dying every
year in about seven years time</FONT></B> - with burger-eating getting
the blame in most cases - according to a new report published as the millionth
cow is slaughtered to control <B>mad cow</FONT></B>
disease.<BR>
<BR>
Government scientists are behind the new death toll prediction for <B>CJD</FONT></B>
caused by eating BSE infected food, says the Independent. The prediction
is far lower than the 'doomsday-scenario' put forward by some scientists
when a link between <B>CJD</FONT></B> and BSE was
first mooted a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
Today, however, a Department of Health spokesman said Department officials
had not seen the paper by members of the <B>CJD</FONT></B>
Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh. The estimates in the Edinburgh paper, submitted
to the medical journal The Lancet for publication, are based on the 14
'new-variant' cases of the <B>CJD</FONT></B> brain
disorder recorded in the UK. The variants have been linked with the consumption
of food contaminated with the '<B>mad cow</FONT></B>
disease', BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Dr James Ironside, one of the papers co-authors, is quoted by The Independent
as saying that the new figures do not bear out the 'doomsday scenario that
some have predicted'. He said 'It now looks as though the total number
of cases over the whole course of the disease will be in the hundreds,
rather than the thousands'. According to the new calculations, <B>the
number of cases will rise gradually and reach a peak in 2003</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The risk of eating BSE infected food is seen as having peaked around 1988
and 1989 - before cattle brains and spinal cords were excluded from human
food. People who ate a lot of Hamburgers at that time, or were on tight
budgets and depended on food containing 'mechanically recovered meat',
are most at risk the experts believe.<BR>
<BR>
The report comes as the number of cattle slaughtered in the latest bid
to eradicate <B>mad cow</FONT></B> disease approached
the million mark this week. The 30 month cull, setup in May, in the wake
of the BSE crisis, was 'well-on-track' to eliminate the current backlog
by Christmas said Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg.<BR>

The Times ... November 27 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>An expert on infectious diseases cast doubt yesterday on predictions
that hundreds of people would die every year from the new strain of <B>CJD</FONT></B>,
the brain condition linked to eating contaminated beef.<BR>
<BR>
The forecasts of the likely death toll from the human form of &quot;<B>mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease are contained in a paper submitted to The
Lancet by scientists at the National <B>CJD</FONT></B>
Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh. The journal said yesterday that the paper
has been circulated for peer review and no decision has yet been taken
to publish.<BR>
<BR>
Roy Anderson, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious
Disease at Oxford University, said it was <B>impossible
to extrapolate forwards</FONT></B> when the incubation period of the new
strain of <B>CJD</FONT></B> was unknown and there
had been only 14 confirmed cases so far. &quot;<B>My
own view is that it is very difficult to say anything sensible scientifically
about this issue at present</FONT></B>,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Anderson also said that the Government's cull of cattle over
30 months old could eradicate BSE by mid-1998, three years earlier than
previously predicted. He estimated that about only 150 animals under that
age were still carrying the disease.<BR>
<BR>
The Department of Health said officials had not yet seen the paper. &quot;We
recognise the need to try to make predictions, but at this stage any forecasts
must be viewed with extreme caution,&quot; a spokesman said.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">Subsidies to rise for BSE hill farmers<BR>
<BR>
Daily Telegraph ... Wednesday 27 November 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Hill farmers worst hit by the beef crisis had their <B>cattle
subsidies tripled</FONT></B> yesterday as part of a &pound;60 million package
of aid delivered in the Budget.<BR>
<BR>
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances, one of the farm subsidies met directly
by the Treasury rather than by the EU farm budget in Brussels, were increased
from &pound;110 million to &pound;170 million from next year. These subsidies
are designed to maintain farmers in the hills and high moors of Britain
who rely mainly on livestock for a living. Keeping these farms in business
is also a priority as part of efforts to conserve the traditional environment
in the uplands.<BR>
<BR>
Douglas Hogg, Minister of Agriculture, said that subsidies in designated
Disadvantaged Areas would be increased in 1997 by &pound;46 to &pound;69.75
a cow. Subsidies in Severely Disadvantaged Areas will be increased by &pound;50
to &pound;97.50 a cow. HLCA subsidies for sheep remain unchanged. In addition
the Government took action to increase the financial ceilings which effectively
cap the amount of money which hill and moorland farmers are allowed to
earn per acre from subsidies. Under a complicated formula the money they
get for their livestock is translated into a value based on the amount
of subsidy per acre.<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday the government agreed to lift the financial ceiling from &pound;24.40
to &pound;39 an acre in Disadvantaged Areas and from &pound;35.50 to at
least &pound;51 an acre in Severely Disadvantaged Areas. The Government
said it would be spending an extra &pound;730 million next year to resolve
the beef crisis. Until now the figure has only been an estimate. Overall
about &pound;3.3 billion has been allocated for this task over the next
three years.<BR>
<BR>
Spending on BSE research will be increased over the next three years by
&pound;12 million. Mr Hogg said that this work was a &quot;priority&quot;.<BR>

Financial Times ... Wednesday November 27 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>The European Parliament's investigation into the handling of the
&quot;<B>mad cow</FONT></B>&quot; crisis over the
last eight years has unearthed some <B>startling
facts</FONT></B> which call into question the behaviour of national governments,
the European Union's veterinary experts and the European Commission.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There clearly was <B>a lot of mismanagement</FONT></B>,&quot;
said Mr Reimer B&ouml;ge, a German MEP and chairman of the committee of
inquiry into <B>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B>
(BSE) which wraps up next month and will deliver its final report in January.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>biggest mistake</FONT></B>, he believes, was
the attempt to &quot;try to minimise the problem&quot;. Chief among the
accused stands the UK. Evidence delivered so far <B>paints
a dismal picture of inadequate control and poor management</FONT></B> in
Britain, where the government failed to implement anti-BSE measures.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The most important of these was a ban on feeding
meat and bonemeal to cattle. This only came fully into force in July 1996
despite UK legislation in 1988</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There was a <B>real lack of control and management</FONT></B>
and UK officials have admitted that things could have been managed in another
way,&quot; Mr B&ouml;ge said.<BR>
<BR>
Evidence also points to <B>errors </FONT></B>on the
part of the council of ministers and the standing veterinary committee.
Both bodies <B>baulked at taking decisions to safeguard
human health</FONT></B> on the grounds that there was insufficient scientific
evidence to warrant drastic action.<BR>
<BR>
But the most sensitive findings relate to the Commission. The principal
accusation has been that Commission officials, including Mr Ray MacSharry,
farm commissioner between 1989 and 1992, and Mr Guy Legras, the EU's top
agriculture civil servant, <B>tried to keep discussions
on BSE to a minimum in an effort to protect the beef sector</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Mr MacSharry and Mr Legras both vehemently denied the charge when they
faced the inquiry. &quot;I have never exercised any pressure on anybody
not to disclose information about the problem,&quot; Mr MacSharry said.
He added that &quot;managing the market was never, I repeat never, given
priority over measures to protect health&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The inquiry has also discovered that the Commission <B>failed
to send EU inspection teams to meat and bonemeal plants in the UK between
June 1990 and 1994</FONT></B>. Inspections could have uncovered the UK's
lax behaviour and led to tighter controls on infected feed which scientists
believe was the main cause of BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Mr MacSharry and Mr Legras admitted the omission, but argued there was
an acute shortage of qualified inspection staff. The Commission had 12
staff in 1991 whose responsibilities ranged from ensuring implementation
of the single market to vetting third-country imports.<BR>
<BR>
Mr MacSharry said he had pressed, unsuccessfully, for the number to be
raised to 120.<BR>
<BR>
Mr MacSharry <B>blamed the UK</FONT></B> for negligence
in implementing laws designed to reduce the risk of <B>mad
cow</FONT></B> disease. &quot;When decisions are taken at community level,
it is the responsibility of member states to implement them,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
There is also evidence that conflicts between individuals and departments
in the Commission led to confusion and poor policy-making. <B>In
one instance, evidence has emerged that an inspection report critical of
measures being taken in the UK was not followed up</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The BSE inquiry is also attempting to unravel the real story behind the
Commission's decision earlier this year to lift the export ban on British
gelatine.<BR>
<BR>
MEPs will question Mr Franz Fischler, commis sioner for agriculture, on
<B>why he backed a decision to lift the ban on British
gelatine and tallow before he had received a definitive report on how the
products could be made safe</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The report, prepared by an independent research institute, found that <B>no
absolute guarantees could be given on the safety of gelatine</FONT></B>,
even after it had been subjected to special treatment.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Reinhard Schrieber, president of the gelatine manufacturers of Europe,
told the inquiry the Commission had been given the report before the decision
to lift the ban was taken. The Commission denies it received it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are inconsistencies,&quot; Mr B&ouml;ge said. &quot;We have
to establish the truth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the critical question for those in the dock is whether MEPs conclude
this all amounts to a conspiracy, or simply a series of errors.<BR>
<BR>
There is a great deal at stake. Mr B&ouml;ge believes the parliament's
reputation rests on the results of the inquiry, the first to be completed
by the parliament under powers given to it by the Maastricht treaty. &quot;If
we are successful, it will prove that the parliament can use this right
of inquiry to find the truth and uncover mismanagement,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
But there is increasing nervousness in some quarters about the outcome.
&quot;I think we have spent too much time looking back. There has been
too much of a witchhunt,&quot; said Lord Plumb, a British MEP sitting on
the inquiry.<BR>
<BR>
Mr B&ouml;ge is aware that a damning report, particularly one that singles
out the Commission, could have serious political consequences.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some fear that a bad result could be used by some member states to
argue that the Commission's powers should be curbed,&quot; he said. But,
he added, &quot;I want a balanced result. This should not be misused by
politicians.&quot;<BR>

Financial Times ... Wednesday November 27 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>The beef crisis will <B>cost the taxpayer
&pound;3.3bn over four years</FONT></B>, Mr Douglas Hogg, agriculture minister,
announced.<BR>
<BR>
The bulk of the projected funding, spelled out in detail for the first
time, will come from elsewhere in the Budget rather than from cuts in spending
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff), officials said.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Hogg justified the hefty expenditure in terms of the need to protect
the public and restore the beef market. &quot;Public safety is my priority
and the high level of funding allocated to Maff reflects that,&quot; he
said.<BR>
<BR>
However, Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, said he was not
convinced the &pound;3.3bn would be enough to cover the full cost of the
crisis over <B>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B>
(BSE).<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Past Conservative governments' mishandling of the BSE epidemic in
our cattle in the 1980s has resulted in this huge drain on the taxpayer,&quot;
he said.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Strang deplored planned savings in non-BSE research and development
to pay for an extra &pound;12m in spending on BSE-related research over
the next three years. Other Maff savings include a projected &pound;59m
drop in departmental running costs over the next three years.<BR>
<BR>
Spending on measures related to BSE has been set at &pound;730m for the
next financial year, following the estimated &pound;1.5bn cost of the crisis
in the current year.<BR>
<BR>
The &pound;730m includes more than &pound;300m for the destruction of cattle
more than 30 months old, &pound;245m for intervention buying to support
beef prices, and up to &pound;59m in further aid to abattoirs and rendering
companies.<BR>
<BR>
The government is providing for &pound;580m in 1998-99 and &pound;490m
in 1999-2000 to cover the continued costs of the crisis.<BR>
<BR>
On top of next year's BSE spending will be &pound;60m in funding for beef
farmers in difficult upland areas who have been particularly hard hit by
the crisis. This will increase funding on Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances
(HLCAs) to &pound;170m.<BR>
<BR>
The National Farmers' Union welcomed the fact that the additional money,
first announced in September, would not be clawed back from payments to
sheep farmers as it had feared. Sheep payments will be frozen at current
levels. The union was also pleased the government was raising the payment
ceilings on HLCAs to ensure most hill farmers would benefit from the higher
aid levels.<BR>
<BR>
Sir David Naish, NFU president, said many hill farmers were reporting a
fall in prices of up to 25 per cent at autumn cattle sales. The details
announced on the increased payments would help safeguard the future of
upland beef herds, he said.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>Extra funding of &pound;792m <B>to protect
the public and eliminate BSE</FONT></B> from UK cattle herds was allocated
yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said: &quot;Public safety is my priority
and the high level of funding allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture
reflects that.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About &pound;3.3bn has been set aside to protect the public and restore
the market in British beef. I believe that we have the best and safest
beef in the world. And my determination to get that world class product
back into world markets is unswerving.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This budget is good news for consumers, good news for farmers and
good news for the whole rural economy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Additional provision for BSE related measures has been set at &pound;730m
in 1997/98, &pound;580m in 1998/99 and &pound;490m in 1999/2000. These
include both programme expenditure and administration costs.<BR>
<BR>
These amounts are additional to those provided below for the Common Agricultural
Policy and UK Domestic Agriculture. The largest element relates to the
Over Thirty Month Scheme, under which all older animals are removed from
the human food chain.<BR>
<BR>
Planned UK expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy is expected to
fall to &pound;2.9bn in 1997/98, &pound;2.88bn in 1998/99 and &pound;2.89bn
in 1999/ 2000, a decrease of &pound;90m in 1997/98 compared with previously
announced baselines (News Release 422/95).<BR>
<BR>
Provision for spending on UK Domestic Agriculture has been set at &pound;1.02bn
in 1997/98, &pound;920m in 1998/99 and &pound;910m in 1999/2000, an increase
of &pound;30m in 1997/98 compared with previously announced baselines (News
Release 422/95).<BR>
<BR>
Priority in this year's Survey has been given to measures taken to support
beef producers and the disposal chain, and the lifting of the export ban.
The main elements of the government's package for 1997/98 include: over
&pound;300m annually payable to farmers and others as compensation and
disposal costs for the removal of all cattle over the age of 30 months
from the food chain; &pound;245m to support beef prices in the UK through
intervention buying; and up to &pound;59m further support to the disposal
chain, as slaughterers and renderers adjust to the changed value of animal
by-products.<BR>
<BR>
Baselines for these schemes have been brought into line with more realistic
forecasts of uptake.<BR>
<BR>
These still provide for a progressive expansion of the schemes including
a further &pound;5m worth of Countryside Stewardship agreements, to be
entered into in 1998.<BR>
<BR>
Departmental running costs are set to fall by &pound;59m over the three
years.<BR>
<BR>
Those areas of the department most affected by the BSE crisis will receive
additional provision.<BR>
<BR>
Reductions are also being applied to departmental capital spending. These
savings will be found, where possible, from further efficiency gains and
only essential capital works will proceed.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>The BSE or &quot;<B>mad cow</FONT></B>&quot;
epidemic <B>could be over by mid-1998</FONT></B>
if the current cull of cattle over 30 months old were adjusted slightly
to target those at greatest risk of infection, scientists said yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Roy Anderson and research colleagues from Oxford University's
centre for the epidemiology of infectious diseases told a London meeting
at the Wellcome Trust that the UK's existing &quot;over 30 month scheme&quot;
had gone further than expected in removing infected cattle from the food
chain.<BR>
<BR>
Only 150 cattle under 30 months old were still infected with BSE, Prof
Anderson estimated. About 1m animals were infected during the course of
the epidemic. He added that the existing scheme, which will have killed
more than 1m animals by the end of this week, had probably already met
the conditions set by June's European Union summit for a selective slaughter
of animals most at risk.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The only reason we cannot be certain is that we do not have data
for the ages of the animals culled,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Prof Anderson, a leading UK expert on the spread of infections, said it
was still too early to predict the course of any human epidemic of <B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease</FONT></B> caused by eating infected beef. So far there have been
14 confirmed cases of &quot;new variant&quot; <B>CJD</FONT></B>
linked to BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists at the National <B>CJD</FONT></B> Surveillance
Unit in Edinburgh have submitted a paper on the expected human death toll
to the Lancet. This reportedly concludes that, at the peak of the projected
<B>CJD</FONT></B> epidemic around 2003, hundreds
of people a year will be dying.<BR>
<BR>
But Prof Anderson said: &quot;<B>The scientific methodologies
are not available to extrapolate forward for a disease where the incubation
period is not known and there have only been 14 recorded cases</FONT></B>.&quot;<BR>

Daily Telegraph ... Wednesday 27 November 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B>mad cow</FONT></B> disease has been virtually
eliminated from younger British cattle and the epidemic could be over within
two years, scientists said yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
Between 150 and 200 cattle aged under 30 months now have <B>bovine
spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B>, and culling targets set by the European
Union have probably been met, according to Prof Roy Anderson, who has been
using mathematical models at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the Epidemiology
of Infectious Diseases, University of Oxford, to predict the course of
the epidemic<BR>
<BR>
&quot;<B>We believe that it is possible to take the
epidemic out by mid-1998</FONT></B>,&quot; Prof Anderson said. He was speaking
after a meeting held at the Wellcome Trust, London, where leading European
scientists participated in a review of the current knowledge of BSE and
scrapie, the sheep spongiform disease.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The rate of new BSE infections has been low since
1994 but he said that to reduce the disease to a trickle of cases by mid-1998
would require at least half of the current rate of slaughter - 60,000 head
of cattle aged over 30 months per week - to continue</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Prof Anderson referred to the Florence EU summit agreement in June and
said it was possible that the targets - 150,000 cattle in given cohorts
to be slaughtered - had been achieved. &quot;One's suspicion is that the
Florence agreement has been met,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
But he said that it was difficult to say with scientific certainty because
individual ages of the cattle over 30 months that were slaughtered had
not been recorded. Ministry of Agriculture scientists are now trying to
recover this information so that it can be fed into Prof Anderson's computer
model.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists at the Wellcome meeting said the EU should, as a matter of priority,
plan to eradicate scrapie as a long-term objective. They called for studies
to estimate the incidence of the disease in Europe. &quot;It potentially
is possible to breed resistant types of sheep,&quot; Prof Anderson said.
&quot;I only wish that were the case in cattle.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>John Wilesmith, of the Ministry of Agriculture's
Central Veterinary Laboratory, said scientists were also checking to see
whether BSE could somehow transfer back into sheep</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The scientists said there was a pressing need for diagnostic methods to
detect infection before the symptoms became manifest - work that would
require collaboration with industry. &quot;There are a number of interesting
avenues of research,&quot; Prof Anderson said.<BR>

Yesterday saw the leak of the results of a forthcoming Lancet paper by
the <B>CJD</FONT></B> Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh.
This predicted that hundreds of Britons would die each year from the new
variant of <B>CJD</FONT></B> - which has been linked
to BSE - with the peak of the human epidemic occurring in about seven years'
time.<BR>
<BR>
Prof Anderson pointed out that only 14 cases of the new variant of disease
had been recorded. &quot;To extrapolate forward, when we don't know the
incubation period - the scientific methodologies are not available to do
that,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
While it was trivial to say that the lower bound of the epidemic was 14,
the &quot;upper bound is virtually impossible to determine&quot;. He said:
&quot;My own view is that it is very difficult to say anything sensible
scientifically about this issue at present. It will be a number of years,
perhaps even decades, before we can say with any certainty what the size
of the potential epidemic is.&quot;

<FONT COLOR="009F00">By David Brown<BR><BR>
Daily Telegraph    ...   Friday 29 November 1996</FONT><BR><BR>
Pressure from supermarkets has forced a leading animal food manufacturer to stop using fish-meal in feed for beef cattle and lambs.<BR><BR>
J Bibby Agriculture said yesterday that, because of the beef crisis, retailers were increasingly worried about the use of animal protein in livestock diets. The company fears that major retailers will buy their meat abroad.<BR><BR>
The crisis broke when <STRONG>mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease, which is believed to have been caused by feed containing the contaminated remains of sheep and cattle, was linked to a new form of <STRONG>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</STRONG></FONT> in people.<BR><BR>
Earlier this year Bibby dropped fish-meal, used for its high food value, from its main brand of feed for dairy cattle. The ban now extends to cattle and lambs destined for the butcher unless farmers ask specifically for it to be included.<BR><BR>
Although the decision has been taken on food quality and safety grounds, it will help fish conservation by reducing commercial demand for sand eels.<BR><BR>
Research has shown that cattle and sheep can thrive on food containing soya and other ingredients instead of fish-meal. In one trial, at the Oatbridge College of Agriculture in Edinburgh, 140 lambs were divided into two groups and fed diets with and without fish-meal. These showed &quot;no significant differences&quot; in performance.<BR>

I am not looking for a disgnostic tool, when I ask for a statistical plot of
milk productivity against month before the detection of BSE. I am of course
not interested in the daily productivity of single cattle, but in the average
monthly decrease of productivity (and of fertility if possible) during the last
year of many BSE-cattle.
 <P>
With this data it would be possible to find out, if a decrease of the monthly
milk production as an early consequence of BSE infection can increase the
probability of slaughtering of cows in the last months before clinical signs
of BSE become obvious. This question is important because such an effect
would influence the BSE-statistics, the calculation of maternal transmission
and prognoses for the future of BSE.

</CENTER>
<A HREF="mailto:barrett_slenning@ncsu.edu">B. D. Slenning</A> 12.05.96
<P>

A great deal of interest lies in coming up with an early warning system for
identifying BSE animals.  Ideally, we would be able to catch them before
they show obvious neurological signs, because we know how long a period
that can take.  So, what we want (and what the above excerpt describes) are
"pre-clinical" signs of BSE that we can use to identify and deal with
infected cows.  This message is meant to show that these signs are
completely useless in that endeavor.<P>
 
If we take the first paragraph (starting with "The character...") to
describe pre-clinical BSE cases, and the second paragraph (starting with
"Shipley's cow video...") to describe clinical BSE cases, we can look at
the quality of information garnered by the signs displayed.  Note, the
first few sentences of paragraph 1, however, describe the clinical
neurological and behavioral manifestations of the disease, so cannot be
considered as "early" signs, but as signs highly suggestive of neurological
disorders.  So, the remainder of the signs for the pre-clinical cases
described are:<P>
      <PRE>          decrease feed intake
                stop ruminating/cudding
                digestive upsets
                loss of condition (i.e., weight loss)
                fall in milk production</PRE>
 
The two major signs displayed early in the course of disease, prior to the
manifestation of neurological signs, are [1] decrease feed intake (leads to
decrease rumination and digestive upsets and loss in weight), and [2] fall
in milk production.  Though not mentioned specifically, farmers will
describe cows that "hang back" or "change their patterns" as dull or
depressed.  That could be a third sign.<P>
 
I went to the Cornell College of Vet Med "Consultant" site (a search
algorithm that compares described signs and symptoms to known diseases),
and entered these signs in a hypothetical bovine:<P>
           <PRE>     anorexia                (decreased intake)
                dullness                (defined above)
                agalactia               (loss of milk production)</PRE>
 
The database kicked back 242 different infectious diseases, intoxications,
metabolic disorders, and neoplasias that can manifest themselves this way
(As an aside, this USA database does not list a spongiform encephalopathy
as one of the differential diagnoses).  Given this, the listed signs may
truly describe the "pre-clinical" BSE case, but they describe very many
more-common disorders as well.  As such, by themselves they are pretty
worthless in helping to screen a population for a spongiform
encephalopathy.<P>
 
Next, I added in Tremors, to account for the described "... shaking
movement across her shoulders ...".  I did not use the excitatory signs,
because, again, in most dairy cattle, anyway, those are not specific enough
to be of much value.  The database, using the first search criteria plus
tremors produced 48 different infectious diseases, intoxications, metabolic
disorders, and neoplasias that can manifest themselves this way.<P>
 
Granted, a list of 48 is easier to work with than one of 242, but I think
the point is made:  The signs and symptoms attributed to these early cases
of BSE are so generally shared by a multitude of other diseases that they
do not add any clinical decision making value by their existence.<P>
 
>From an individual animal perspective (i.e., the vet being called out to
look at a sick cow), the results from applying such a BSE screening test
are bad.  One way to evaluate this is by using the Odds Likelihood ratio of
the test.  Without going into its derivation, the OL ratio says that the
odds of a disease being present, given a positive test result, are equal to
the prior odds of the disease (i.e., its prevalence in the selected group
divided by 1-prevalence) times the ratio formed by taking the probability
of a test positive result given the presence of disease, and dividing that
by the probability of a test positive result given no disease is present.
This is a spin-off of Bayes' theorem for those of you into probability
games.<P>
 
Suppose our vet and owner understand that the prevalence of BSE in adult
cows in this area is 1% or less.  Given that the Cornell listing of 242
diseases covers well over 90% of the cases a vet is likely to see in sick
cows (my estimate, not theirs), then the probability of a test positive
result given no disease is present is at least 90%.  The probability of a
test positive result given the presence of disease is 100%, as assumed
above.  The odds likelihood ratio, then, would be:<P>
 
Probability the animal showing anorexia, agalactia, and dullness is
displaying pre-clinical BSE (i.e., it posterior odds of BSE) equals :<P>
 
<PRE> (prior odds) * (likelihood ratio) = 1/99 * 100/90  =  0.010 * 1.11 =  0.011</PRE>
 
In plain english, the probability assigned to this animal having BSE was 1%
prior to the test (1/99).  After running the test, the new likelihood of
the animal having BSE was 1.1%.  So how much value can we place on these
signs?  Very, very little.  This is true of the 242 diseases as well -- the
signs are not helpful in differentiating any of them.<P>
 
We often are handed diseases to work with where the diagnosis is defined by
"manifestational means" (what signs and symptoms is the animal showing?).
Unfortunately, when other diseases share those same manifestations, that
diagnostic definition fails us in our attempts to help make decisions.  We
all want to find an early warning system.  These manifestations are not
capable of giving us that device.

John Lanchester wrote in the 2 Dec New Yorker:<BR>
1930's: 18,000 UK sheep were inoculated against louping ill, a brain inflammatory illness, spread by ticks.  Despite formalin-treatment of the inoculated agent, the procedure gave rise to 1500 cases of scrapie. Louping is a Scottish word for fleeing or leaping, related to loping.  In humans, louping ill is called Russian spring-summer encephalitis, a meningo-encephalitis with muscular trmeors and spasms followed by varying degrees of paralysis.

There are some intriguing parallels to prion disease, like failure of the envelope protein to stimulate protective immunity, glycosylation, focus in UK, and the association with scrapie.  [Guess: brains of sheep with louping ill were homogenized, treated with formaldehyde, and injected intra-muscularly into sheep.]

<P>
Residues 109-122 of the human prion protein (PrP) are highly conserved across species,
and are predicted to be alpha- helical in PrPc, the cellular form. A computational search of
the potential for alpha-helical dimerisation has been made for residues 109-122. The
conformation which consistently scores highest in terms of burying non-polar surface area is
a tight association involving alanine, glycine and valine residues. A model of
heterodimerisation for PrPc and PrPSc (the misfolded form) is presented in which species
barrier mutations would arise from interaction specificities that would follow, at least in
part, the same framework as formation of a putative homodimer.

<p>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to analyse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from

challenge. Consistent changes were recorded in all CSF samples from the confirmed cases of
natural BSE and also from cattle showing early signs of experimental disease. The changes
consisted of an increased intensity of staining of apolipoprotein E and the presence of two
protein spots, as yet unidentified, of molecular weights 35 and 36 kDa, both with a pI of 5.5.
These changes were absent in the CSF samples from the normal cattle, from the clinically
suspect cattle which were not confirmed as BSE and from the experimentally challenged cattle
in the preclinical phase of infection.

Archives of Virology 1996; 141(N10): 1863-74 1996
<p>Scrapie in sheep has recently become again a target of control measures and eradication
programs. Crucial for the effectiveness of these measures is the detection of infected sheep
during the long and potentially hazardous incubation period. However, routine-diagnosis is
mostly limited to clinical examinations when disease: becomes apparent, and to postmortem
investigations. Through the detection of the scrapie-specific isoform of the prion protein
(PrPSc) by Western blot in the spleen and lymph nodes from scrapie- infected mice and
sheep, we have shown previously that diagnosis during the preclinical stage is possible. We
introduce here an improved method for the diagnosis of mouse scrapie shortly after infection.
Through a homogenization procedure that includes a collagenase digestion step, and through
extraction and salting-out of PrPSc by Sarkosyl and NaCl, respectively, we were able to detect
PrPSc in spleen tissue of intraperitoneally infected mice seven days postinfection. Moreover,
the new protocol makes sample- handling easier and reduces the hands-on time. We also
successfully enriched PrPSc from spleen tissue through immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (IMAC); however, for the diagnosis at the earliest stage of infection,
extraction of PrPSc by Sarkosyl and NaCl was more effective.

<p>Between 1989 and 1995, after having excluded rabies, histological examination of brains

Hungarian diagnostic institutes (Table). None of the cases were found alterations
characteristic for spongiform encephalopathies (BSE, scrapie, FSE) considering the
diagnostic criteria specified in the European communities and USA. These findings confirm
that Hungary remains free of spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, sheep and cats. In cattle and
sheep, most frequently listeriosis and other purulent meningitides and/or focal purulent
encephalitides caused by other bacteria, Aujeszky's disease, CCN, as well as encephalitis
caused by ruminal acidosis, alkalosis, methaemoglobinaemia, ketosis, certain toxic matters
and plants, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus and chlamydias were found associated with
the nervous symptoms observed. In cats, Aujeszky's disease and different poisonings
(toxicoses) were most frequently diagnosed. It has been pointed out that besides the
histological investigation of the brains directed to the diagnosis of spongiform
encephalopathies, the evaluation of clinical symptoms observed in vivo (the relatively long
course of the disease, extending weeks or more frequently months and the gradually
progressing, characteristic clinical symptoms) is also essential in each suspected case.

<p>The neurochemical alterations preceding neurological dysfunction and neuronal death in
prion diseases are not well characterized. Here we examined, using in situ hybridization
histochemistry, the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), an inducible and abundant
neuropeptide in mammalian brain with known neuroregulatory functions, and glial fibrillary
acidic a protein (GFAP), a marker for astroglial activation, in the hippocampus at different
time points following intracerebral prion inoculation in male CD-1 mice. Between 110 and
140 days postinoculation NPY mRNA expression was specifically up- regulated in CA3
pyramidal neurones, whereas expression of NPY in hilar neurones remained unaltered.
Up-regulation of GFAP mRNA was observed in the CA1 stratum radiatum at 60 days, and
spread throughout the hippocampus, cortex and thalamus between 110 and 140 days,
suggesting early accumulation of scrapie prion protein in these regions. The clinical
symptoms were first manifested 120 days postinoculation. Aberrant induction of NPY mRNA
in the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurones preceded the onset of neurological symptoms, and
may be involved in the regulation of glutamate release at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses
in scrapie-infected mice.

<P>
Antisense c-fos oligonucleotides injected into the neostriatum of conscious
rats selectively inhibited c-fos expression associated with compensatory increases in striatal
c-fos mRNA levels and also with increased expression of junB and NGFI-A mRNA, probably
as a result of regulatory phenomena. Dual probe in vivo microdialysis was used to investigate
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release in the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus,
which represent the terminal sites of the dopamine D1 receptor regulated striatonigral and
the dopamine D2 receptor regulated striatopallidal GABA pathways, respectively. Intrastriatal
infusion of the c-fos antisense oligonucleotide profoundly decreased dialysate GABA levels in
the ipsilateral substantia nigra within 60 min but did not influence the dialysate GABA levels
in the globus pallidus compared with the sham and control oligonucleotide treated groups. The
site of action of the antisense oligonucleotides was mainly restricted to striatal neurons as
shown by the distribution of locally injected fluoresceine isothiocyanate and radiolabeled
oligonucleotides. The findings demonstrate a facilitatory role for c-fos mediated gene
regulation in striatonigral GABA transmission and strengthen the evidence that the regulation
of neurotransmission is different in the striatonigral and striatopallidal GABA pathways.

PNAS Volume 93, Number 24; Pages: 14030-14035
<P>
Menkes disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of childhood due to the
absence or dysfunction of a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase encoded on the X
chromosome. To elucidate the biosynthesis and subcellular localization of this protein,
polyclonal antisera were generated against a bacterial fusion protein encoding the 4th to 6th
copper-binding domains in the amino terminus of the human Menkes protein. RNA blot
analysis revealed abundant Menkes gene expression in several cell lines, and immunoblotting
studies utilizing this antiserum readily detected a 178-kDa protein in lysates from these
cells. Pulse-chase studies indicate that this protein is synthesized as a single-chain
polypeptide which is modified by N-linked glycosylation to a mature endoglycosidase
H-resistant form. Sucrose gradient fractionation of HeLa cell lysates followed by
immunoblotting of individual fractions with antibodies to proteins of known intracellular
location identified the Menkes ATPase in fractions similar to those containing the
cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. Consistent with this observation,
confocal immunofluorescence studies of these same cells localized this protein to the
trans-Golgi network and a vesicular compartment with no expression in the nucleus or on the
plasma membrane. Taken together, these data provide a unique model of copper transport into
the secretory pathway of mammalian cells which is compatible with clinical observations in
affected patients and with recent data on homologous proteins identified in prokaryotes and
yeast.

Recently, we reported a polymorphism in the transcriptional control region upstream of the
5-HTT coding sequence. Initial experiments demonstrated that the long and short
variants of this 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) had different
transcriptional efficiencies when fused to a reporter gene and transfected into human
placental choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells . The 5-HTTLPR is located 1 kb upstream of the
5-HTT gene transcription initiation site and is composed of 16repeat elements. The
polymorphism consists of a 44-base pair (bp) insertion or deletion involving repeat
elements 6to 8(Fig. 1A). In the present study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
genotype analysis of 505subjects revealed allele frequencies of 57% for the long (l) and
43% for the short (s) allele (11). The 5-HTTLPR genotypes were distributed according to
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: 32% l/l, 49% l/s, and 19% s/s.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></CENTER> <P> <I>Introduction:</I> Many questions regarding BSE are as yet unanswered and perhaps unasked. Because of the slow nature of the disease, it will take years to obtain answers and it may be countered that by the time the answers are known, the disease may have been eradicated. However, these predictions are based on assumptions which do not necessarily hold true, either in the UK or elsewhere, such as the immutability of the infectious agent and its mode of transmission. Because BSE could become endemic, as is scrapie, and because it might be transmissible to man, as scrapie is not, we consider it advisable to collect as much critical information as possible at the present time. <P> The following questions are addressed: <P> <B>A. Questions related to practical aspects of BSE</B> <P> <B>1. Has BSE been transmitted to man perorally?</B> <P> Epidemiological evidence has raised the suspicion that so-called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is linked to the consumption of products derived from BSE-infected cattle. Moreover, the BSE agent is orally transmissible to mice, mink, cats, cattle, sheep, goats and various other ruminants. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Compare agent strains recovered from vCJD patients with BSE and &quot;normal&quot; CJD, GSS and FFI strains. <P> ---&gt; Extend surveillance program for CJD, monitor for linkage to consumption of cattle and sheep products <P> ---&gt; Primate oral dose response experiment (see below). <HR> <B>2. Risk assessment</B> <P> Assuming that transmission of BSE from cattle to human has occurred, a number of as yet largely unknown parameters must be determined to allow the estimation of the risk of transmission. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; a. Extend surveillance program for BSE to all of Europe. <P> ---&gt; b. Determine incidence of covert disease in cattle. <P> ---&gt; c. Determine infectivity titer of brain, spinal cord and other tissues of BSE-infected cattle before and after onset of clinical disease.  <P> ---&gt; d. Determine contamination level of meat with brain/spinal cord after standard butchering procedures.  <P> ---&gt; e. Determine oral and i.c. dose response to BSE agent in primates. <P> ---&gt; f. Determine whether multiple dosing is cumulative. <P> To estimate the past risk it is necessary to determine <P> ---&gt; g. The utilization of offal in different human food products prior to the ban and the consumption of such products by individual age groups and socio-economic criteria.  <P> <B>3. Is there infectivity in BSE-infected cattle-derived products other than SBO ?</B> <P> Infectivity has been found in brain and spinal cord of diseased cattle, and in the intestinal wall of calves infected orally with BSE brain. Other tissue showed no infectivity, however the assays, carried out in the mouse, are very insensitive. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Implement sensitive assay, examine all products entering the human food chain (muscle, milk, cheese, blood etc.) and used in pharmaceutical products (collagen, gelatin, etc.).  <P> <B>4. Maternal risk factors for BSE in cattle</B> <P> Recent data from the MAFF shows that offspring from BSE-sick dams have a higher incidence of BSE than controls (both were exposed to contaminated feed). The precise reason for this apparent transmission is not known. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <HR> ---&gt; Determine infectivity in placenta, blood, colostrum, milk, excrements of BSE cattle using sensitive assay. <P> <B>5. Did BSE originate in cattle and has it been transmitted to sheep in recent years?</B> <P> It is possible that BSE originated as a (rare) spontaneous event in cattle and that the BSE agent is different from the scrapie agent. If so, then BSE may have been transmitted to sheep via bone and meat meal from cattle and BSE infected sheep could transmit the agent to man. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Extend surveillance of scrapie in sheep to the EU. <P> ---&gt; Examine the infectious agent derived from recent UK cases of sheep &quot;scrapie&quot; in regard to its strain properties.  <P> ---&gt; Feed scrapie-infected brain from UK sheep to cattle and monitor for appearance of BSE-like disease.  <P> <B>6. Can BSE be transmitted orally to pigs ?</B> <P> Pigs can be infected with BSE by intracerebral inoculation. Peroral transmissibility of BSE from BSE cattle brain to pigs is being tested by the MAFF in the UK. However, these experiments should be complemented to ascertain whether BSE derived from experimentally BSE-infected pigs can be transmitted to pigs: <P> ---&gt; Feed and inject brain extract of experimentally BSE-infected pig to pigs. <P> <B>7. Diagnostic Research</B> <P> There is still no reliable, sensitive method to detect CJD or BSE other than by analysis of CNS tissue by infectivity assays. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Develop a sensitive assay in transgenic mice carrying cattle transgenes or cattle/mouse chimeric PrP genes.  <P> ---&gt; Explore surrogate markers for BSE. <P> ---&gt; Explore the presence of PrPsc in tonsils and spleen of man. <P> ---&gt; Sponsor a large-scale facility for assaying BSE infectivity in calves. <P> ---&gt; Institute strain typing of human-derived prions (CJD, GSS, FFI, BSE-derived), correlate disease susceptibility with genetic markers. <HR> <B>8. Inactivation of the BSE agent under different conditions</B> <P> There is a need for determining the efficiency of BSE agent inactivation by procedures used in food and pharmaceutical industry. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Determine inactivation kinetics of BSE infectivity under conditions used currently in industry and explore additional procedures.  <P> <B>9. Therapeutic Research</B> <P> Possible approaches to therapy are specific inhibition of PrP synthesis, or prevention of the conversion of PrPc into the pathological form PrPsc. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Develop rapid throughput assay for inhibition of PrP synthesis and<BR> PrPc--&gt;PrPsc conversion respectively; assay chemical libraries.  <P> <B>10. Predictive research</B> <P> vCJD and other forms of prion disease occur very rarely in individuals heterozygous for the methionine-valine heterozygosity at position 129. A PCR test for the 129 haplotype could be used to assess the susceptibility of individuals for vCJD <P> ---&gt; Monitor haplotype of vCJD patients, develop routine PCR assay <P> <B>11. Can BSE-resistant cattle and sheep be generated ?</B> <P> Inactivation of the PrP gene has no major detrimental effect on the mouse and confers absolute protection against the mouse-adapted scrapie. The same effect might be achieved for sheep and cattle. <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Determine whether sheep devoid of PrP are viable and resistant to scrapie. <P> ---&gt; Develop methods for generating cattle devoid of PrP. <P> <B>B. QUESTIONS RELATED TO BASIC RESEARCH ON PRION DISEASE</B> <HR> <B>1. Nature of the infectious agent.</B> <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Purify infectious agent from BSE-infected cattle brain and other sources and analyze.  <P> ---&gt; 3 D structure of complete PrPc (PrP-sens) from different sources. <P> ---&gt; 3 D structure of PrPsc. <P> <B>2. Multiplication of the agent.</B> <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Determine whether PrPc can be converted into the infectious agent (rather than only to PrPsc) in vitro.  <P> ---&gt; Determine which other components are required for propagation of the infectious agent.  <P> <B>3. Pathogenesis</B> <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Determine mechanism of pathogenesis. <P> <B>4. Transport of infectious agent</B> <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Determine how the agent moves from periphery to CNS and vice-versa. <P> <B>5. Strains</B> <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Elucidate the molecular feature of the infectious agent that determines strain specificity.  <P> <B>6. Susceptibility of the host to the infectious agent</B> <P> <B>Proposals:</B> <P> ---&gt; Determine which genetic factors contribute to susceptibility ? <P> ---&gt; Determine which factors other than the sequence of PrP determines the species barrier ? <HR> <CENTER><B>II. DETAILED DISCUSSION</B></CENTER> <P> <B>A. Questions related to practical aspects of BSE</B> <P> <B>1. Has BSE been transmitted to man perorally?</B> <P> <I>Arguments in favor :</I> <P> (a) Epidemiological evidence: The occurrence since 1994 of nine vCJD cases at ages 34 years or less in the UK and one in France) and none between 1990 and 1993 (despite intensive surveillance) is statistically highly significant on the basis of age (the odds are less than 1:10^7 reference D.Morrison]). vCJD shows a characteristic histopathology, in particular high incidence of PrP positive plaques. No archival cases of vCJD as characterized by histopathology have been found in recent searches 1. <P> Because BSE originated in the UK in the mid-eighties and has an incidence about 2 orders of magnitude higher than in any other country, a causal connection between BSE and vCJD is suspected. <P> (b) Experimental evidence: The BSE agent is experimentally perorally transmissible to mice, mink, cattle, goats and sheep. Strain specific properties of BSE agent are retained after passaging through a variety of animals such as sheep, pig, goats or mouse and differ from those of passaged scrapie agent. An agent indistinguishable from BSE agent has been isolated from cases of &quot;naturally&quot; occurring TSEs in domestic cats, kudu and nyala which are attributed to feeding of contaminated bone and meat meal. Experimental transmission of BSE to primates by intracerebral injection has been reported (Baker et al., 1993a: Lasmezas et al., 1996) and the appearance of vCJD-like neuropathology in macaques was noted (Lasmezas et al., 1996). However, there have been no experimental feeding experiments. <P> Scrapie agent experimentally transmitted from U.S. sheep to cattle caused a disease which is unlike BSE; strain typing is in progress (R.B., K.B., pers. commun.). If scrapie prions and BSE prions represent distinctly different strains, the argument cannot be upheld that the BSE agent is <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 1 Reported at the meeting of the EU Concerted Action on Neuropathology of Prion Diseases, Vienna, May 1996) <HR> not transmissible to man because it is identical with the scrapie agent (believed not to be transmissible to man on the basis of epidemiological data). <P> <I>Arguments against:</I> <P> (a) Mice containing human PrP transgenes as well as the mouse PrP wild-type background, when inoculated with BSE came down with scrapie-like disease but only PrPsc of murine and not of human origin was detected, suggesting that human PrPc was not being converted to PrPsc (Collinge, 1995 #3681). This experiment was not conclusive because there may be competition between human and murine PrPc in the conversion process (Telling et al., 1994). Moreover, the human transgene used had valine at position 129; the methionine allele should also be tested (underway in Collinge's lab). <P> Mice transgenic for the human PrP gene on a mouse PrP knockout background were inoculated with BSE agent (30 &#181;l of 1% medulla homogenate) and have not come down with prion disease 500 days after inoculation; inoculation with human CJD agent leads to prion disease after 200 days. This experiment is more persuasive than the first one if the mice remain free of prion disease permanently. However, differences in the PrP gene of humans may affect their susceptibility to BSE prions. Initiation of BSE disease in mouse may require more than just the presence of &quot;compatible&quot; PrPc. Moreover, it has to be considered that the nature of the cattle prions may vary with the PrP gene sequence of the donor (for example, in regard to the number of octa repeats) and hence differ in their transmissibility to humans. <P> <I>What experiments can cast more light on this question?</I> <P> ---&gt; Determination of the strain-specific properties of agent from the variant human CJD cases and the vCJD-like disease elicited in macaques (Lasmezas et al., 1996) after transmission to mouse. Such experiments are underway in the laboratory of John Collinge (with mice carrying the human PrP transgene) and in NPU (with normal mice).  <P> ---&gt; Determine whether infectious agent from vCJD or sporadic CJD cause BSE-like disease in cattle.  <HR> ---&gt; Extend surveillance program for CJD, monitor for linkage to beef and mutton consumption.  <P> ---&gt; Experimental peroral transmission of BSE to primates (see below). <P> <B>2. Assessment of risk associated with consumption of cattle-derived products</B> <P> One of the most important questions to be resolved is assessment of risk for the transmission of BSE to man as a function of BSE incidence in the cattle population and of consumption of cattle-derived products. The parameters required for assessment are: <P> a. The frequency of cattle suffering from overt BSE. <P> b. The frequency of clinically healthy cattle carrying BSE agent . <P> c. The infectivity titer in BSE-sick cattle of brain and spinal cord (these data are available of clinically ill animals 2) and of other tissues (these data are in part available but should be determined at higher sensitivity). <P> d. The decontamination level of meat with brain/spinal cord after standard butchering procedure. <P> e. The minimal infectious BSE dose for man; the best estimate will be from a primate oral dose response experiment. In this context we recommend elucidating whether peroral administration of brain from sheep experimentally infected with BSE causes disease. <P> f. The effect of repeated dosing with BSE agent. <P> To estimate the past risk it is necessary to determine: <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 2 Infectivity titer of BSE-infected brain and spinal cord (data: Wells, GAH, CVL, unpublished; CVO report for 1995): <TABLE> <TR><TD WIDTH=136>BSE brain:</TD><TD WIDTH=632>10^6 to 1 0^7 infectious units/g as assayed intracerebrally in calves <P> 10-100 infectious units/g as assayed orally <P> 3-4 logs less when assayed intracerebrally in mouse <P> (0.02 g insufficient to infect mouse perorally). </TD></TR> </TABLE> <P> Oral administration is usually 10^5 times less effective than i.c. administration (for calves), however in transspecies infection the relative efficiency of oral administration is increased (Fraser and Foster, 1994). <HR> g. The utilization of offal in different human food products prior to the ban and the consumption of such products by individuals of different age and socio-economic status. <P> To answer these questions, the following actions need to be implemented: <P> <B>---&gt; a. Extend surveillance program for BSE.</B> <P> Institute EC-wide reliable, standardized criteria for BSE. Include search for possible occurrence of &quot;spontaneous&quot; BSE. Search for possible cofactors 3. Determine whether the apparent incidence of BSE in European countries other than the UK is lower than expected on the basis of cattle and feed imported from the UK 4. <P> <B>---&gt; b. Determine incidence of covert disease in cattle</B> <P> It has been shown in the mouse that high titers of scrapie infectivity and PrPsc can be measured months before any clinical symptoms are evident, particularly when PrP is expressed at a low level (B&uuml;eler et al., 1994). The same is likely true for cattle 5. It is thus important to determine in several herds where there have been one or more cases of BSE (and if possible also herds, where no animals have fallen sick), the number of animals that show infectious agent in their CNS. To this purpose, brain stem homogenates should be analyzed for their content of infectivity at several dilutions and of PrPsc (by different assays: Western, ELISA or whatever is available at the time). In this connection the importance of establishing a reliable, sensitive and rapid assay for BSE should be reiterated. <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 3 It has been proposed that nematode infection promotes scrapie in sheep (Paris Meeting 1996) and that mites can carry scrapie agent (Wisniewski et al., 1996). <P> 4 It is said that in GB about 30% of &quot;suspected BSE&quot; cases turn out to be due to metabolic or other causes. However, in some other countries not even any &quot;suspected&quot; cases are reported, suggesting that surveillance could be improved. <P> 5 Narang has claimed in a recent review (Narang, 1996) that 29% of cattle brain (8 of 27 brains from an abattoir examined at random) were positive by his &quot;SAF touch assay&quot;; this assay has been checked by Stack et al.(Stack et al., 1995) as mentioned in a report from Dr.Bradley (&quot;Advice to the Minister&quot;) and is said to state that there were no false positives among 5 healthy cattle and that 2 (or perhaps 3) of 5 BSE cattle were correctly diagnosed. <HR> The cattle (clinically healthy, from affected and non-affected herds) to be targeted: <P> Animals &lt; 30 months, <P> Targeted cull animals, <P> Old dairy cows &gt; 30 months, <P> Random animals coming to slaughter. <P> <B>---&gt; c. Determine infectivity titer of brain, spinal cord and other tissues of BSE-infected cattle before and after onset of clinical disease.</B> <P> The data for clinically ill animals are available1 and will become available for experimentally infected cattle at various times after infection (MAFF). Infectivity measurements of other tissues of BSE-infected cattle are in part available but should be determined at higher sensitivity (See below, section 3). <P> The titer of a BSE agent preparation administered i.c. and orally should be compared in a variety of non-primate species. <P> <B>---&gt; d. Determine contamination level of meat with brain/spinal cord after standard butchering procedures.</B> <P> To what extent can BSE agent derived from brain and spinal cord contaminate meat, in particular &quot;head meat&quot;, during processing? Carcasses are decapitated and split longitudinally, opening the spinal canal; does this result in significant contamination? It should be possible to estimate the extent of contamination by &quot;mock-up&quot; experiments in which the spinal cord and brain are stained by a fluorescent dye 6 and the amount of fluorescent material deposited on meat cuts following standard butchering procedure is determined. Moreover, it has been claimed (Garland et al., 1996) that slaughtering with use of bolts may lead to brain emboli in the lung; could microemboli make their way to the periphery? What is the <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 6 for example the fluorescent lipid probe rhodamine phosphatidyl ethanolamine. Radioactive probes may be less sensitive and more difficult to use and measure. <HR> effect of stunning and pithing ? Devise a test for these conditions of slaughter. <P> <B>---&gt; e. Determine oral and i.c. dose response to BSE agent in primates 7</B> <P> Although experimentation on primates may meet with considerable opposition 8 on both ethical and economic grounds, and despite the objection that oral susceptibility data obtained with primates may not reflect susceptibility of humans, we believe this is the best approach to obtaining these data, which will be of greatest importance if more vCJD cases were to appear and if BSE were to become endemic. If and when this were to happen, it may well be considered a serious omission if no effort bad been made to collect the best possible data. <P> So far, it has been shown that marmosets inoculated with BSE brain homogenate (i.p. and i.c. simultaneously) came down with disease after 4 years (Baker et al., 1993b). Lasmezas et al. inoculated 3 cynomoulgus macaques with BSE brain homogenate i.c.; the macaques showed clinical disease after 4 years and presented histopathology similar to that of variant CJD (Lasmezas et al., 1996). <P> The experiments should comprise the following parts: <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 7 There are at least six primate centers in which the work could in principle be done:<BR> TNO (Holland)<BR> Porton Down; 100 monkeys, 20 macaques under P3 conditions<BR> G&ouml;ttingen: 18 animals under P3, 36 under P2 conditions<BR> Rome: 24-48 squirrel monkeys under P3 conditions<BR> Lyon<BR> Z&uuml;rich <P> Porton Downs facilities could be upgraded to P3. Perhaps the experiment would have to be spilt between several centers. <P> Estimated cost: purchase of monkey ca. Sfr. 3000,- <BR> upkeep: 365x12= Sfr. 4'400/yr <P> Assuming 100 monkeys have to be kept for 10 years: <BR> 10 x 4'400 x 100 = Sfr 4.4 million <P> 8 Three consultants from the UK considered primate feeding experiments without sufficient merit to warrant the expense and effort of implementation. <HR> (i) Determination of the titer of a BSE agent preparation 9 by end point dilution in mice. This should be done early on. <P> (ii) The dose response to BSE cattle brain homogenate administered by intracerebral injection (about 40 monkeys) and peroral administration10 is determined using about 6 different doses, 6 monkeys each 11. As controls, guaranteed healthy brain extracts (10 monkeys) are to be used at the highest dosage. <P> (iii) Dose response as above using brain of New Zealand sheep (in which scrapie seems not to occur or UK sheep with a scrapie-resistant genotype infected with BSE (about 20 monkeys). Inoculation of sheep with BSE, preferably orally, must be initiated early an (some sheep have been inoculated at MAFF: are they sufficient?). <P> -Choice of primate: The primate should be known to be susceptible to BSE by parenteral inoculation (CJD has been transmitted to squirrel monkey, macaque, chimpanzees and others), have a PrP sequence as close to the human as possible (although the importance of this parameter is not clear; only a few residues may be critical for the species barrier, and other, as yet unknown factors may be just as <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 9 A homogenate of BSE-infected brain stem (50 g each; titer: 10^3 to 10^5 LD5O bovine units/g). It is important that sufficient BSE brain stems be collected, pooled and aliquoted as soon as possible, because this invaluable material will become scarce as the epidemic subsides (inquiry has been addressed to Mr. Meldrum at MAFF and Mr.Schapps at the EC). The samples should be sterile: it should be ascertained early on whether heating at 80C causes significant loss of infectivity. <P> 10 There is some question as to whether the homogenate should be administered by stomach tube or by first starving the monkeys and then letting them feed autonomously (J.Gibbs has stated that with CJD or Kuru transmission occurred only in the latter case [pers.commun.]). Although it would seem from the experiment on cattle that orally administered BSE agent entered through the gut, it is not clear whether this only occurs generally or only under special circumstances, such as lesions in the Gl tract (see report that nematodes increase incidence of scrapie in sheep; Paris 1996). <P> 11 There will be no systematic multiple dosing experiments at this time; only where very large doses are to be administered, the material can be given in two or more sequential sessions. <HR> important), but availability, ease of maintenance and monitoring and cost will be important considerations 12. <P> It is to be discussed whether the experiment should (and could) be done with bath squirrel monkeys and macaques; the inclusion of a small number of chimpanzees should be considered. <P> The PrP genes of the experimental animals should be genotyped. <P> -Monitoring: <P> Inspection for ataxia, EEG. Infectivity in tonsil biopsy. <P> Assay for surrogate markers in CSF (14-3-3 protein) (Hsieh et al., 1996). <P> Sacrifice 2 animals of each group after 5 years and remaining animals after 10 years and determine infectivity in brain, spinal cord, spleen. <P> Determine whether BSE strain specificity is retained. <P> <B>---&gt; f. Determine whether multiple dosing is cumulative.</B> <P> In order to examine this important question, the end point titer of an agent preparation in a particular host must be known; therefore, the experiment cannot be carried out on primates at this time. However, it can and should be carried out on the mouse or hamster. <P> <B>---&gt; g. Determine the utilization of offal in different human food products prior to the ban.</B> <P> A survey of the industry in regard to the utilization in Europe and the UK in particular may be difficult because of fear of liability claims. <P> A survey in Australia or New Zealand may be more likely to yield information. <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 12 Tamarins (squirrel monkeys, marmosets), 200-500g, life expectancy 10-15 y, very sensitive, difficult to handle. Macaques (rhesus mulatta, cynomolgus fascicularis), 2-8 kg, life expectancy 20-25 y, robust. <HR> The consumption of offal-containing products by individual age groups and socio-economic criteria for .the period 1985-1990 and 1990 - present should be ascertained as accurately as possible. <P> <B>3.   Is there infectivity in BSE-infected cattle-derived products other than SBO ?</B>  <P> Infectivity has been found in brain, eye and spinal cord of diseased cattle, and in the intestinal wall of calves experimentally infected perorally with brain from BSE-infected cattle. <P> Other tissues, in particular muscle, spleen, lymph nodes, peripheral nervous system showed no infectivity, however the assays were carried out in the mouse. Moreover, the tissue was obtained from cattle sacrificed by barbiturate injection and not by the usual slaughtering procedures, which might result in microemboli of brain tissue in the periphery. In late-stage scrapie-infected sheep, peripheral organs had titers 10-100 times lower than brain. <P> If infectivity determination is carried out in the mouse, the volume that can be injected into the brain is small (about 0.025 ml). If for example milk contained 100 infectious units per liter, about 1800 mice would have to be injected intracerebrally in order to have a 95% probability of finding one sick mouse. There is an ongoing epidemiological analysis of suckled offspring from BSE-infected dams however the results are not yet available. <P> A similar question may be raised in the case of blood, nerve tissue, or in fact any tissue. It may be argued that if the infectivity is so low, then it is also of no concern for human health. On the basis of current knowledge this sounds reasonable, but this assessment lacks a scientific basis without an estimate of the lD50 for man. <P> ---&gt; The most sensitive assays available, i.e. intracerebral administration into calves, should be implemented for bovine products used for human consumption 13. Possibly intraperitoneal <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 13 A facility appropriate for such assays may become available in the Padua region (pers.commun. M.Pocchiari). <HR> injection may prove to be more sensitive 14. Simultaneous i.c. and i.p. has been used by MAFF. <P> Products from BSE-infected cattle to be assayed: <P> -mechanically recovered meat <P> -Colostrum, cells concentrated from milk and colostrum <P> -Blood, cells concentrated from blood <P> -Skeletal and heart muscle, heart valves <P> -Rennet <P> -Collagen, gelatin <P> -lung <P> <B>4. Maternal risk factors for BSE in cattle</B> <P> Recent data from the MAFF demonstrated a maternal risk factor in cattle. It is not clear whether one is dealing with actual agent transmission, as proposed, or with genetically based susceptibility to, for example, bone and meat meal. The experimental data suggested a risk of 10% in the cattle studied, where all calves were born within 13 months of clinical onset of BSE in the dams. It was extrapolated that the risk is 1% for herds in general and that this factor alone will not lead to endemic BSE in the UK. This might not be true if there is transmission from dams with subclinical disease, if the agent mutates to a more easily transmissible form or if there are or will be modes of transmission we are currently unaware of. <P> Placenta as assayed in the mouse is negative. This may not have been sufficiently sensitive to exclude transmission in utero. <P> ---&gt; Assay placenta, colostrum, milk in an i.c. calf assay. Can there be transmission through saliva (the agent is found in salivary gland of mouse, mink and goat) or through excrements? <P> ---&gt; Determine infectivity in saliva?<BR> - in excrements 15 <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 14 Although intraperitoneal injection is reportedly 2 orders of magnitude less efficient than intracerebral injection, it may be possible to administer 3 orders of magnitude larger volumes (500 ml or more in repeated injections i.p. versus 0.5ml i.c.). <P> 15 Sterilize by radiation, filter through 0.2-&#181;m Millipore filters which do not retain scrapie agent (pers.comm. Dr.Pocchiari), inject intraperitoneally. <HR> <B>5. Did BSE originate in cattle and has it been transmitted to sheep in recent years?</B> <P> Three possibilities for the origin of BSE may be considered. (a) scrapie-infected sheep, (b) a (rare) spontaneous (sporadic) event in cattle (Chastel, 1996) akin to CJD in humans, or (c) a change of strain of an endemic, symptomless form of BSE. In all cases spread of the disease is attributed to introduction of contaminated tissue into cattle feed, perhaps in connection with a change in the rendering procedure. Spontaneous occurrence of spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt Jakob disease) in man is of course well documented, and it has been proposed that kuru, an epidemic spongiform encephalopathy that occurred in Papua New Guinea, may have originated from a spontaneous case of CJD and was spread by the consumption or handling of brain tissue of deceased family members. A spontaneous case of spongiform encephalopathy in a rhesus monkey has been reported (Bons et al., 1996), however infection by feeding is not excluded. <P> The arguments in favor of origin in cattle are (1) the unique properties of the BSE-derived agent, namely: (a) speed of transmission to mice and other animals, (b) lesion pattern in mice, (c) incubation times in 4 strains of mice, and (2) failure to generate BSE-like disease by feeding/ inoculating cattle with scrapie-infected sheep brain (but there was spongiform encephalopathy) (Cutlip et al., 1994), whereas feeding with BSE-infected cattle brain causes typical BSE in cattle. <P> In favor of origin from scrapie-infected sheep the following arguments have been advanced (1) epidemiological: the disease appeared more or less simultaneously in various distant sites in the UK while feed was not widely distributed (Wilesmith, 1992b); (2) appearance of BSE occurred a few years after a change in the procedure for processing offal was instituted (Wilesmith, 1992a). <P> If BSE originated in cattle (or even if it is a mutated form of an agent that originally came from sheep) and is transmissible to man, its transmission to sheep might well generate a disease different from scrapie, possibly with the transmission properties of BSE, i.e. possibly transmissible to man. Cheviot sheep infected with BSE show scrapie-like symptoms; the emerging agent has BSE-like properties when tested in mouse. <HR> Because cattle-derived animal feed has been fed to sheep in the past (the practice is forbidden in the UK since 1988 but cross-contamination of ruminant rations has been likely until April 1996), transmission may already have occurred; if so, it might be maintained within the sheep population as is scrapie. <P> ---&gt; Surveillance of scrapie in sheep of the UK and EU; offer compensation for reported cases in EU; correlate susceptibility to scrapie and to BSE with genotype (natural scrapie is almost always associated with the sA/sA genotype (Goldmann et al., 1994)). <P> ---&gt; Examine the infectious agent derived from recent UK cases of sheep &quot;scrapie&quot; in regard to its strain properties. Because sheep may be slaughtered to early for clinical symptoms to be observed, It may be necessary to monitor a large sampling of sheep brain for PrPsc by an immunoassay and test infectivity in positive cases. In order to reduce the large number of samples that may have to be investigated, sheep with a genotype that renders them non-susceptible to natural scrapie should be preferentially examined. <P> ---&gt; Feed scrapie-infect brain from UK sheep to cattle and monitor for appearance of BSE-like disease. <P> <B>6. Can BSE be transmitted orally to pigs and chickens?</B> <P> Pigs inoculated with BSE agent i.c., i.p. and i.v. (simultaneously) acquire disease, with infectivity (as detected by the mouse i.c. assay) in brain, jejunum, distal ileum; marginally in stomach and pancreas. Oral administration of BSE brain to pigs has not given rise to disease; no infectivity was found in ileum and spleen after 2 years (G.A.H. Wells, as communicated by R. Bradley). Inoculation of chickens with BSE i.c. has so far not given signs of disease. It would seem that no immediate action is required on these issues, but it is of interest to determine whether pig-to-pig transmission occurs, in particular orally, because if a pig at same time became infected with BSE, the disease might be further transmitted by feeding of offal. <P> ---&gt; Feed and inject brain extract of experimentally BSE-infected pig to pigs. <P> <B>7. Diagnostic Research</B> <HR> There is still no rapid, specific and sensitive method to detect CJD or &quot;BSE&quot; in man. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of CNS tissue is usually carried out post mortem. The most sensitive but very slow method is determination of infectivity. In spongiform encephalopathies of man, transmission to primates has been achieved with spinal cord, CSF, eye, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and lymph nodes with varying degrees of success (Brown et al., 1994). In the late stages of disease, appearance of protein 14-3-3 in cerebrospinal fluid may provide an approach (Hsieh et al., 1996). A polarographic method for urine analysis is underway. The specificity of these surrogate markers need to be determined carefully. <P> ---&gt; Develop a sensitive assay in transgenic mice carrying cattle transgenes or cattle/mouse chimeric PrP genes; such experiments are ongoing in S.Prusiner's lab, so far without positive results. <P> ---&gt; Explore surrogate markers mentioned above. A surrogate marker would be extremely valuable. Search for additional surrogate markers. <P> ---&gt; PrPsc is found in the CNS which, however, is not readily accessible in vivo, and in some species in spleen or tonsils at lower levels (Schreuder et al., 1996). Explore the presence of PrPsc in tonsils but also spleen of man. (In cattle, the BSE agent is not found in spleen and lymph nodes; no corresponding data for CJD in man is available). <P> ---&gt; In the absence of a reliable surrogate marker, infectivity assays have to be performed by i.c. inoculation in calves, currently the most sensitive assay for BSE agent. This is very costly and time consuming; it is being implemented on a larger scale by MAFF. The EC may want to sponsor a large-scale facility for assaying BSE in calves independently 12 <P> ---&gt; Strain typing of human-derived prions (CJD, GSS, FFI, BSE-derived), correlation of disease susceptibility with genetic markers. Differentiation of BSE and scrapie agent 16. <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 18 Differences in mobility of PrP-res after digestion by a variety of proteases should be explored. <HR> <B>8. Inactivation of the BSE agent under different conditions</B> <P> There is a need for determining the efficiency of BSE agent inactivation by procedures used in food and pharmaceutical industry. This should not be considered a substitute for using BSE-free sources <P> ---&gt; Determine inactivation kinetics of BSE infectivity under conditions used currently in industry and explore additional procedures. <P> <B>9. Therapeutic research</B> <P> One could consider specific inhibition of PrP synthesis, because disease progression is clearly linked to PrPc content, or search for compounds preventing the postulated conversion of PrPc into the pathological form; such an effect has been reported for sulfated glycosaminoglycans, Congo Red, 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin, amphotericin B and some of its derivatives. <P> ---&gt; Develop rapid throughput assay for PrP synthesis and PrPc--&gt;PrPsc conversion; assay chemical libraries, antisense oligonucleotides. <P> <B>10. Predictive research</B> <P> It has been shown that vCJD and other forms of prion disease occur very rarely in individuals heterozygous for the methionine-valine heterozygosity at position 129. The monitoring for this connection should be maintained. Linkage to other genetic markers should be sought for if there is an increase in vCJD. A PCR test for the 129 haplotype could be used to assess the susceptibility of individuals for vCJD, however the implications of the availability of such a test must be examined from the ethical, economic, insurance and legal point of view. <P> ---&gt; Monitor haplotype of vCJD patients, develop routine PCR assay <P> <B>11. Can BSE-resistant, cattle and sheep be generated and would these be of practical use ?</B> <P> It has been shown that inactivation of the PrP gene has no major detrimental effect on the mouse and that it confers absolute protection against the mouse-adapted scrapie (BSE is being tested in Dormont's lab) agent. The tools for gene disruption, namely omnipotent ES cell lines, have recently become available for sheep (Campbell et al., 1996), <HR> however not yet for cattle. It is therefore now possible to generate and test PrP knockout sheep for resistance to scrapie and BSE. <P> (Whether it is practical to envisage replacing existing flocks by absolutely prion-resistant ones remains to be determined, in view of the fact that many different breeds are required and that production of the required number of animals poses problems. <P> In the case of cattle, the preparation of ES cell lines and successful generation of calves derived from such lines has not yet been reported, however efforts are underway in ( several labs and biotech companies. Herds of prion-resistant cattle would be very desirable for the production of medicinal products; a general replacement of existing herds would be a long-term project. It may be desirable to establish proof of principle and decide wider implementation if and when the necessity arises. If BSE can arise spontaneously, as does CJD, then no country or continent may ultimately be &quot;guaranteed&quot; free of BSE. <P> ---&gt; Determine whether sheep devoid of PrP are viable and resistant to scrapie. <P> ---&gt; Develop methods for generating cattle devoid of PrP. <P> <B>B. QUESTIONS RELATED TO BASIC RESEARCH ON PRION DISEASE</B> <P> We have not considered this issue as being within the remit of this group, however some comments may be useful. <P> <B>1. Nature of the infectious agent.</B> <P> No informational nucleic acid has been found in highly purified preparations and the major protein component has been identified as PrPsc (PrP-res) but other components may be present and important. Purification is very difficult because infectivity is associated with aggregated, insoluble material (mostly PrPsc). As far as we know, the only source used more or less successfully for purification is scrapie-infected hamster brain; efforts with bovine BSE brain seem not to have been successful. <P> ---&gt; Purify infectious agent from BSE-infected cattle brain and other sources and analyze. <HR> ---&gt; 3 D structure of PrPc (PrP-sens) from different sources (the structure of the carboxyterminal half of recombinant mouse PrPc produced in E.coli (i.e. unglycosylated) has been published. <P> ---&gt; 3 D structure of PrPsc should be established- very difficult because purification yields insoluble, heterogeneous material. <P> <B>2. Multiplication of the agent.</B> <P> The &quot;protein only&quot; hypothesis proposes that the infectious agent is PrPsc and that it multiplies by converting PrPc into PrPsc. The two forms are believed to differ only in their conformation. <P> ---&gt; Determine whether PrPc can be converted into the infectious agent (rather than only to PrPsc) in vitro. <P> Not all cells that produce PrPc allow multiplication of the infectious agent. Prusiner has proposed a &quot;protein X&quot; as requirement. <P> ---&gt; Determine which other components are required for propagation of the infectious agent (receptors? chaperones?). <P> <B>3. Pathogenesis</B> <P> It is still not understood how vacuolization and neuronal death come about. <P> ---&gt; Determine mechanism of pathogenesis. Depletion of PrPc? Toxicity of PrPsc ? Other ? <P> ---&gt; Which cell types and tissues can replicate the infectious agent? What are the biochemical requirements? <P> <B>4. Transport of infectious agent</B> <P> It is very likely that the agent can enter the organism via the digestive tract (although entry through nasal mucosa has been cited as an alternative possibility). <P> ---&gt; Determine where and how the agent enters the organism after ingestion. <P> ---&gt; Determine how the agent moves within the periphery, from periphery to CNS and vice-versa. <P> Page 22 <P> <B>5. Strains</B> <P> it has been convincingly shown that there are different strains of TSE agent which can be passaged in inbred mice homozygous for a particular PrP allele. It is not evident how an agent consisting of protein only could encode species specific characteristics, however two explanations have been offered, the conformational hypothesis and the target cell theory. <P> ---&gt; What is the molecular feature of the infectious agent that determines strain specificity?  <P> <B>6. Susceptibility of the host to the infectious agent</B> <P> At least in the case of the mouse, susceptibility of the host and incubation time in response to a given agent strain depend not only on the sequence of the host PrP gene but also on other genetic factors of the host. <P> ---&gt; Which genetic factors contribute to susceptibility and determine incubation time? <P> ---&gt; Which factors other than the sequence of PrP determines the species barrier? <P> <B>7. Natural function of PrP</B> <P> PrP knockout mice generated by the Weissmann and Manson laboratories develop normally, show only minor behavioral deviations (modification of the circadian sleep rhythm. which remain to be confirmed) and mild electrophysiological abnormalities 17. What is the natural function of PrP? Why does ablation of a conserved protein, expressed early in development in many organs not show any notable phenotype? Can the developing organism compensate for absence of putative PrP function? <P> ---&gt; Detailed analysis of the PrP knockout mice. <P> ---&gt; Generate mice in which PrP expression is experimentally controllable. <P> ------------------------------------------------ <P> 17 A PrP knockout mouse line generated by Sakaguchi et al. (Sakaguchi et al., 1996) shows Purkinje cell degeneration and ataxia in aging animals. This may be concomitant with the deletion of the open reading frame. <HR> <CENTER><B>References</B></CENTER> <P> Baker, H. F., Ridley, R. M. and Wells, G. A. (1993a).

The term does not have structural implications other than that a protein is an essential component. <P> &quot;Protein only&quot; hypothesis: Maintains that the prion is devoid of informational nucleic acid and consists of protein (or glycoprotein) as essential pathogenic component. Genetic evidence strongly suggests that the protein is an ,abnormal form of PrP (PrP* or perhaps specifically PrPsc). The association with other &quot;non-informational&quot; molecules (for example lipids or glycosamino glycans) is not excluded. <P> PrPc or PrP-sen: The naturally occurring form of the mature Prnp gene product.

It may but need not be identical with PrPsc. <HR> This concept was introduced (Weissmann, 1991) because the ratio of infectivity to PrPsc is 1:100'000 or less and the determination of chemical or physical characteristics of purified infectious preparations consisting mainly of PrPsc does not necessarily reflect the characteristics of the infectious component. <P> SBO: Specified bovine offal. <P> TSE: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. <P> Virino hypothesis: Maintains that the TSE agent (prion) consists of an agent-specific nucleic acid enveloped in or associated with a host protein, perhaps PrPsc. Such a nucleic acid has not been identified in highly purified preparations of infectious agent. <P> &quot;Unconventional virus&quot; hypothesis: Maintains that the TSE agent is a virus however with unusual properties.

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>(JO UNWIN):  Inside this test-tube is enough purified BSE to kill 10 million cows.  It now seems certain that it can kill humans too.   But the scientific communityfailed to predict that we would be susceptible.   They had been baffled by this extraordinary and mysterious agent of disease.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  The infectious agent is almost immortal and it may be impossible to destroy it.   These agents are incredibly resistant to almost everything we throw at them.   They resist alcohol, they resist boiling, they resist  gluteraldehyde.<p>

<FONT COLOR="996633">DR  DAVID TAYLOR</FONT>:  Ultraviolet radiation, gamma radiation. microwave radiation, potassium permanganate, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  They resist hospital detergents, ionising radiation, even autoclaving.<p>

<FONT COLOR="996633">DAVID TAYLOR</FONT>:  Well we have here for example a hot air oven which runs at the same sort of temperatures as your domestic oven at home which you would reasonably expect to kill conventional bacteria and viruses.   However if you cook these types of agents even at prolonged times in this type of oven you just don't kill them, which means that of course if you have meat infected with such agents you cannot rely it to kill these agents at all.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  We thought it would be interesting to see what would happen if we buried some of these agents and so I ground up some scrapie brain and mixed it with soil, put it in a flowerpot enclosed it in a cage and used my own garden as a burial site, right here, and what we found was that a good deal of the infectivity remained in the soil after 3 years. We exposed it to temperatures that turned it to ash and it did not entirely kill the agent and so every known pathogen of man would have been destroyed by this process and this was not.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  This extraordinary organism was studied long before BSE appeared, because BSE is only a new form of an ancient group of brain diseases, called spongiform encephalopathies.All spongiform encephalopathies are caused by the same infectious agent.  Many species of animal, other than cows, are vulnerable to it, but the disease has always baffled scientists.   We know that the infectious agent accumulates in the brain over many years and eventually destroys brain cells.  The damage is slow but irreparable.   It always ends in death.   Under the microscope the brains of all animals suffering from these diseases have the same distinctive holes that turns the brain to sponge.   In humans the disease is called CJD, Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease. We don't know why, but every person on the planet from Africa to America, rich or poor, vegetarian or carnivore, is at risk of getting CJD in old age.  That's been known for decades, but CJD can infect humans in different ways.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">PROF. JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  We can think of CJD as coming in three forms.   The majority of CJD, about 85%, is what we call sporadic CJD. It's present at similar frequency all over the world.   The lifetime risk of getting CJD is about 1 in 50,000 wherever you look around, around the world, whether there's BSE there or not.   Then there are these cases that have arisen from tragic medical accidents where people have been accidentally exposed to something that's contaminated with CJD.   For instance, children that were treated for growth deficiencies by giving them growth hormone that was contaminated with CJD.   Those are also very rare cases, thankfully, 20 or 30 people probably in the United Kingdom.   There are the inherited forms.  These run in families, they're extremely rare.   None of these three forms of CJD, as far as we are aware, have anything to do with, with BSE.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  But there is one more form of the disease and it may shed light on our current fears over BSE because it caused the first, and up till now, only epidemic of spongiform encephalopathy in human history.   Early this century a strange new disease appeared in the tribal highlands of Papua New Guinea.   It was called kuru - it means to tremble with fear.   Within years it had wiped out thousands of people in one particular tribe.  It was unknown elsewhere in the world.  In 1957 scientists went to the highlands to try and find the source of the disease.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  They found a population that was dying from this disease, but primarily affecting children of both sexes equally and young adult women.   The first symptoms were a little incoordination, a little stagger when they walked.   Little by little over a period of months this became sufficiently severe so that they were unable to walk unaided.   In time the people were unable even to stand and therefore became helpless.  Most people with this disease died within  9 months.   
<P>
Because this disease had this peculiar distribution of age and sex, one of the things you think about is endocrine problems, one of the things you think about is genetic problems you think about toxic causes, you think about malnutrition.  All of these were considered, all were studied in detail and none of them proved out to be correct.   The answer turned out in fact to be very simple:
these people were cannibals. It was clearly being transmitted from person to person by cannibalism.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  This tribe ate their dead relatives as a mark of respect during funeral rites.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  This was not warfare cannibalism, this was loving cannibalism.  In the course of cannibalistic ritual feasting the body was cut up into parts and the men reserved the best parts for themselves and the best parts were muscle. The remaining parts of the body, including brain and pancreas and liver and kidney and intestines, were eaten by the women and the children.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The disease was passed on when women and children ate infected brains.  When they developed kuru and died, they were then ritually eaten, and so the epidemic escalated, an epidemic of human spongiform encephalopathy.   This tragic cycle was broken when cannibalism on the island ended in the 60s, but the incubation period of this disease is so long that the last victims are still dying today.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  The solution to the way kuru was passed from human to human, together with a number of laboratory experiments conducted over the years since, have, without any question, brought persuasive evidence to the idea that infection can be transmitted by feeding.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  In 1986, a new form of the disease struck British cattle.   It had never been seen in cows before. Brain slides from infected cattle showed the same distinctive holes of all spongiform encephalopathies, and we were eating those cattle brains.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  I think the two key questions then revolved around:  what is the nature of the infectious agent in precise molecular terms, what is it, and secondly, of course, the, the burning question became:  can BSE transmit to humans, and are we going to see an epidemic of human disease following exposure to BSE?<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  But scientists working in the field had no answers.  So little was known about these diseases and the agent that caused them that researchers could only guess what the danger to humans might be.<p>

DR ADRIANO AGUZZI:  The theoretical impossibility that BSE might be not contagious but might indeed provoke a disease in humans, was always there and every serious scientist has pointed it out that there was a possibility there.  However, however it was unlikely and I still maintain that, that it was reasonable to, to assume that it would be very unlikely.   The reason is sheep scrapie.   Sheep scrapie has been with us for a long time and yet there is no linkage of consumption of sheep brain with Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, so it appears that there there is a very strict species barrier.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Scrapie is the sheep form of spongiform encephalopathy.  It exists all over the world.  We've had scrapie in Britain for 200 years.  It's fatal in sheep, but seems to be harmless to us.   Scientists were confident that even eating scrapie-infected brains would not cause disease in humans.   But government scientists believed that cows were susceptible to scrapie, and that's what started the BSE epidemic.  Cows were fed a cheap protein supplement to increase their milk yield.   That supplement included the rendered carcasses of scrapie infected sheep.  The theory is that through this feed the disease crossed the species barrier from sheep into cows.<p>

Infected cows were then rendered down and fed back to more cows, escalating the whole epidemic.  It was a kind of cattle cannibalism, chillingly reminiscent of kuru. For the first two years of the epidemic cows dying of BSE could be slaughtered and sent for human consumption.   Their brains ended up in burgers and sausages, meat pies and patties.  In 1988, the government called on the scientific community for advice.   An eminent group of scientists was asked to study all the research on spongiform encephalopathies, most of it about scrapie and decide whether BSE was a risk to humans.   The committee was headed by the zoologist, Professor <FONT COLOR="0000DD">RICHARD SOUTHWOOD</FONT>.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0000DD">PROF SIR RICHARD SOUTHWOOD</FONT>:  Back in 1988 it was very difficult to be confident in one's recommendations.  The amount of information that we had about spongiform encephalopathies was very small.  We knew there was this disease in sheep fairly widespread called scrapie which had been around for 100-200 years.  it didn't seem to be causing a great deal of problems in the human population, so we based our conclusion that the chance of transmission to humans was remote on the long experience of scrapie, but we emphasised that if that assumption was wrong, the consequences were grave and therefore steps should be taken to assume that we were wrong. But cattle can be infected with BSE for years without showing any signs of illness.   They could be sold and slaughtered looking healthy but actually incubating the disease.   So the only way to safeguard human food entirely would be to remove, in the abattoir, the most dangerous organs - the brain and spinal cord - from every cattle carcass.  The Southwood Committee did not call for this ban.  Bringing in any of these bans, of course, does pose considerable practical problems.  One is imposing additional costs on all those concerned.
We didn't at that time think a specified offal ban was crucial.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The Southwood Committee decided only to ban offal from baby food.   Potentially infected cow brain could still go into adult food.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0000DD">RICHARD SOUTHWOOD</FONT>:  We were particularly concerned with baby food because we thought there could be a relationship between the size of the body and the size of the dose and that a much smaller dose which could be possible for a small amount of brain material getting into the food could possibly infect a young baby and so that's why we picked on baby food rather than on adult food.<p>

DR HUGH FRASER:  It really was probably an inappropriate thing to do, to suggest that just the, the ban of brain tissue should be confined to baby food. <p>

We knew from our work in animals, and particularly in laboratory rodents, that the <B>young animal quite unexpectedly was actually largely resistant to infection with these agents and it was actually the older animals of these species which were more susceptible to scrapie infection than the new-born and the neonate.</B><p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Nine months after the Southwood Committee reported, the government extended the offals ban to all foods, to protect adults as well as babies.   But some abattoirs, perhaps believing that BSE was not a risk to humans, did not fully enforce the ban.  We now know that infected material was still getting into human food until the end of 1995.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0000DD">RICHARD SOUTHWOOD</FONT>: <B> I've often reflected as to whether we wrote our report in too reassuring a way and in some way this dimmed the urgency which was necessary and obviously one regrets that.</B><p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  This reassurance was soon echoed by the government and the meat industry who used it as their scientific guide and justification.<p>

DAVID MacLEAN:  We rely on Professor Southwood and his independent experts who said the theoretical risk of BSE was remote.<p>

KEITH MELDRUM:  We have to base our knowledge of the disease on scrapie.
We are fairly confident that there is no risk to human health.
The public is not at risk from BSE.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0000DD">RICHARD SOUTHWOOD</FONT>:  You may wonder why we were not more alarmist in our report, but you must remember that at that time we were dealing with a very rare disease in cattle, a human disease that was, is, is, and has remained very rare, most people had never heard of it, and if we had been too alarmist we were in danger of upsetting the whole of the meat industry in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  But research carried out since the 1970s should have rung alarm bells about the very basis of the Southwood Committee's reassurance -- the link with scrapie.   This research indicated that scrapie and all spongiform encephalopathies can change fundamentally when they cross into a new species.<p>

HUGH FRASER:  We've certainly known since the mid-1970s that when scrapie infection is transmitted to and passaged within a new species that strain characteristics and disease characteristics can change and that a, a phenomenon analogous to mutation can occur and that as a result of that you can generate a strain with new properties, with new characteristics, with altered neuropathology even, and  even with an altered host range.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  Let's assume that BSE is the result of rendered recycled scrapie in the food chain of cattle.  There is not a shred of evidence to date that scrapie has ever caused CJD in humans, but scrapie passaged or, or going into cattle might change the host range of the infection and therefore we cannot predict whether BSE would be, or would not be infectious for humans.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The Southwood Committee did recognise this possibility even as they wrote their report.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0000DD">RICHARD SOUTHWOOD</FONT>:  We of course had no way of knowing at that time whether the BSE agent was exactly the same as the scrapie agent.  Work since has shown that it does actually perform in a slightly different way to the scrapie agent.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The first clue came in 1990 when domestic cats died of BSE.   <B>Cats, like humans, had never been susceptible to scrapie.</B>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  It was certainly concerning when domestic cats developed a spongiform encephalopathy and we
now know that that is BSE that was acquired by these domestic cats and now by quite a few wild cats kept in zoos and some other wild animals kept in zoological gardens, and so <B>that really indicated that BSE had a quite different host range than scrapie that it was infecting different species that had not gone down with scrapie in the past</B>, so that was certainly a cause for concern for me.   Of course that doesn't tell us that humans are going to be at any higher risk, but it does tell us that BSE is rather different than scrapie.

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Over the years the list of susceptible species grew longer.   Scientists grew more worried.  BSE crossed into almost every species exposed to it.  This was extremely unusual.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  BSE has a lot of very special features which we have never seen before in other types of spongiform encephalopathy.  First of all it's very promiscuous, meaning that it's not choosy in the type of host that it will affect, it can infect basically all species where this has been tried.   It will go into, into mice, it will go into cats, it will go into monkeys, so we are witnessing a very special disease that has different features from the other spongiform encephalopathies we knew before and therefore we have to deal with the problem that it might even infect humans.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  People eating potential BSE infected material were eating a new disease.   They weren't eating scrapie anymore.   <B>No the original scrapie that may or may not have triggered off the epidemic, was long gone.</B>
<P>


<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  From the beginning many scientists had been reassured by the link with scrapie and thought it unlikely that BSE would cross the species barrier into humans, but with the scrapie link gone, they faced the reality that we knew little about this new disease and had no clue as to whether it could infect humans.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  The species barrier between cows and humans was unknown.  You can't just assume that it's going to be an absolute one.  Of course we can't measure it because that would involve injecting humans with BSE which clearly we wouldn't do.<p>


DR MOIRA BRUCE:  It's difficult to see how directly we could ever have that information as we can't do experiments on humans.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  But a human experiment has been done.   Millions of us ate infected beef.   We've been part of a vast experiment for the last 10 years.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  With BSE I think we are looking at the emergence of a disease which
may affect significant numbers of people, and I think we have to understand in precise molecular terms the nature of this infectious agent and work out how to kill it.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="996633">DAVID TAYLOR</FONT>:  These agents seem to disobey basic rules of biology.<p>

DAVID BOLTON:  It goes against everything that we've been taught.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:The infectious agent is certainly unique in the world of biology.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  The first question what interests almost everybody is:  what is the nature of the infectious agent, what is the agent that causes scrapie and BSE, Creutzfeldt Jakob and, and this has been very enigmatic
and this question: what is the nature of the agent, this is this is clearly the Nobel Prize question, this is what everybody's trying to answer and there is a lot of competition.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The mystery of this infectious agent made it difficult to predict whether BSE would be a risk to humans.  But for decades before BSE arrived, scientists had been searching, in vain, for the agent of spongiform encephalopathies.<p>

MOIRA BRUCE:  Scientists have been working on this disease for a roundabout 50 years.   It's a very difficult disease to work with and one of the main reasons was that we don't know for sure what the agent is, so we don't have a direct way of, of identifying it.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Most infections are caused by bacteria or viruses which replicate and spread disease.  They can be seen under the microscope and the way they work is well understood.   For  years scientists searched for a virus as the cause of spongiform encephalopathies, but the agent that causes these diseases remain invisible.  It could not be seen, nor even detected by any conventional method, and it had an even stranger quality, one that would prove crucial to understanding its true identity. In 1967, Professor TIKVA ALPER tried to find out what would kill the agent.   She took a solution of infected brain tissue and placed it in front of a source of radiation.  She bombarded this sample with a dose large enough to destroy any virus or bacterium, in fact, large enough to destroy any known infectious organism.   But this lethal radiation had little effect.   The mysterious agent was still active.<p>

SCIENTIST:  The results of Dr. TIKVA ALPER and her colleagues was so remarkable that we tried to repeat them and I must say we've repeated them twice with absolutely identical experimental results.<p>

<FONT COLOR="996633">DAVID TAYLOR</FONT>:  The extreme resistance of these agents to all manner of inactivation procedures does tell us that they're quite unlike conventional bacterium or viruses and that they are some novel type of living organism.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Scientists tried to identify this novel organism by taking a solution of infected brain material and studying it under an electron microscope so powerful that it could magnify objects 100,000 times.   Even the smallest virus can be seen using this machine.   After years of scanning brain samples, in 1981 scientists finally had their first glimpse of the killer. But these fibrils contain millions of particles of the infectious agent.  Even with this powerful electron microscope it was still impossible to see and identify a tiny individual particle, or to know what these fibrils were made of.   The only way to identify the nature of the agent without actually seeing it was to analyse it chemically. The lab in the forefront of purifying infected brain samples was Stan Prusiner's in San Francisco.  In 1982 there was one scientist there whose job was to discover chemical clues about the agent.<p>

DR DAVID BOLTON:  When I came to San Francisco what we wanted to look for was what was unique about a sample from the diseased brain that was not in the normal brain, what, what component, what molecule would be in that diseased brain that was never in the normal brain, and so I did some experiments where I looked at proteins and separated these proteins using a gel to separate them by their size and they give little different bands on the gel, and when I did that I didn't really expect to find anything right off the bat and, and after one of the experiments I went into the dark room to develop the film and I was very surprised when I saw this, and I knew when I saw this gel that this had to be it.  There's a fuzzy band that's here in the gel that's in each of the three samples from the diseased brain, and it's not in the samples from the normal brain, and this is exactly what we had been looking for.  We and everybody else had been looking for some sort of a key, some kind of a molecule that we could say was in the diseased brain and not in the normal brain and that really forced us to conclude that this protein is part of the agent, in fact might be the only component of the agent.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  In discovering this protein the lab felt they had finally cornered the elusive infectious agent.  The scientists called it the PRP protein, but it became known as a "prion".
But finding the prion didn't solve the mystery, it deepened it.   This key molecule wasn't a fragment of a virus or bacterium, the normal agents of disease, it was simply a protein and proteins can't be infectious.<p>

PROF. CHARLES WEISSMAN:  1982 I was at a lecture by Stan Prusiner in Australia and that was the first time I heard him speak and he was talking about these so-called "prion diseases", scrapie in particular, and he proposed that a protein was the infectious agent and that seemed extremely odd and very novel and I was not really quite sure whether this could be true.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  For a protein to be an infectious agent was a scientific heresy.  Apart from water, our bodies are mainly made up of proteins.   They're tiny, far smaller than the smallest virus.   There are literally thousands of different kinds of protein and each has a unique role.  Some digest our food, some absorb our oxygen, others form neurotransmitters in the brain that allow us to think.   But proteins can't cause an infectious disease.  That's because they contain no DNA, no nucleic acid and therefore they cannot replicate. Nothing on the planet replicates without nucleic acid. nucleic acid provides the only mechanism by which all life multiplies.   It is the nucleic acid inside every bacterium and virus that allows it to replicate and cause disease.   How could this mysterious protein cause disease without any means of copying itself.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  To the best of my knowledge, all infectious agents, all pathogens require the participation of nucleic acid in order to multiple to replicate.  The idea, therefore, that replication could occur without nucleic acid is heresy.<p>

DAVID BOLTON:  We couldn't figure out how could a protein replicate if it doesn't have a nucleic acid?<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  This puzzled scientists for years, but tantalisingly an answer had already been worked out 30 years ago.  The theory had lain buried in the literature, almost forgotten, because at the time it was written in 1967 it was dismissed as too outlandish.<p>

DAVID BOLTON:  I started thinking about several years before when I had been doing a literature review and looking in some journals in the library at a paper and I was looking actually up one paper that was written about the nature of the scrapie agent and when I went to photocopy it on the second page of that paper there was another paper and it was<B> by a mathematician named J.S. Griffiths</B> and in this paper he talks about self-replication in scrapie which is one of these diseases, and he outlines three ways that a protein alone could replicate and cause disease. 
<P>
Now he came up with the idea that you would have two different forms of the protein - one was abnormal, disease-causing, a rogue protein if you will, and the other was a normal protein that would be in the cell or in the brain of a normal person, and the essential part of the theory was that the abnormal form of the protein could bind to the normal form and convert it, change its structure to make it an abnormal or a disease-causing protein, and now you can see that if one molecule binds to another molecule and converts it, now you have two molecules of abnormal protein, and two combined to two more and have four, and so on and so on until you have thousands and millions of abnormal proteins in the brain and pretty soon then you have disease, you have so much abnormal protein in the brain that it would cause disease and cause neurones to die. 
<P>
The most amazing thing was that the paper was published in 1967.  He was a mathematician, wrote this one paper, never published anything again in scrapie.   The insight was really very astounding that someone back then with so little information could see a way that a protein could be an infectious agent.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  What Griffiths proposed was an abstract theory, and it was completely ignored by the scientific community.  But over the years clues have been found that indicate he may have had the answer all along.   In 1985 it was discovered that there were two forms of the PRP protein, just as Griffiths had predicted.
<P>
One was a normal protein, genetically manufactured by every animal and found throughout the healthy body. Like all other proteins, it seemed to have some valuable function.  Certainly it never caused disease, but something could trigger this normal, healthy protein to mutate, to change form into a prion. This form of the protein, the prion, is identical down to the last amino acid, but abnormal   This new shape makes it so chemically stable that it resists heat and disinfectants, and because it's simply a protein without nucleic acid it can survive huge doses of radiation because radiation kills by destroying nucleic acid.   Once in its abnormal form, the protein seems to have the unique ability to corrupt any healthy PRP proteins that it comes into contact with and turn them into prions too.  This is not replication, it's conversion.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  It's a very strange observation that you have these two quite different forms of the same protein with quite different properties.   One of them is a killer.   If, if this protein is present in your brain you're in serious trouble.   The other one is a normal constituent of all our brains and obviously understanding how one converts into the other and in the longer term how to stop it is, is a tremendous puzzle.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Although there are still puzzles, we do know that, once converted, prions link together in long, indestructible chains that accumulate in the brain and somehow create the devastating holes that kill. If this theory is confirmed, it will be a revolution in biology, but so far it remains unproven.   No-one has yet found a convincing explanation for how prions corrupt normal proteins and so the protein only hypothesis remains controversial.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  The protein only hypothesis is, is beautiful.<p>

DAVID BOLTON:  I very strongly believe in the protein only hypothesis.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  It's intellectually very appealing.<p>

CHARLES WEISSMAN:  I became largely convinced that in fact the protein only hypothesis is true.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  It should not go unmentioned that the protein only hypothesis in its current incarnation does not explain everything.<p>

HUGH FRASER  The idea that it is an infectious protein is  an exciting and curious idea but it's one which I do not accept.<p>

MOIRA BRUCE:  It may be that the agent is just a protein, but if it is, it's a quite extraordinary protein and it behaves in a quite extraordinary way.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  This has been an extremely controversial area of science.  Prions are new infectious agents and there's been a very rapid evolution of ideas and I think BSE has arrived on the scene in the midst of this scientific controversy and of course that's added to the complexities of, of, of making these sort of risk assessments.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  In the late 1980s, while people were eating infected food, scientists were still trying to unravel the mysteries of the infectious agent.   The prion controversy had split the scientific community and this division only made the search for answers more difficult.   If the prion hypothesis was right, it was crucial to understand whether the cow prions in BSE could infect humans.  To do this meant deciphering the strange rules of the species barrier. All animals make slightly different forms of PRP protein.  The more closely related the species the more similar their PRP is.   The key to the species barriers between all these animals lies in how easily the prions from one type of animal can lock on to the proteins of another and turn them into prions too.   This is what determines how easily one species can infect another, but it doesn't always depend on how similar their proteins are.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  And it really is quite an unpredictable phenomenon.
By and large <B>we tend to think that animals that are more closely related in evolutionary terms are going to be easier to transmit the disease to, but it's not always like that at all. </B>  For instance it can be extremely difficult to transmit the disease between mice and hamsters which are quite closely related species.   In seems to be relatively easy to transmit BSE to mice which are
quite distantly related species, so you know there are really some very strange rules operating here and the only way to find out is to do the experiments.  You can't just sit down with a piece of paper and work out how easy it will go from one species to another.  It's something you have to determine experimentally.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  First of all scientists tried infecting primates whose PRP protein was close to humans, but when the marmosets and macaques died of BSE it still wasn't proof that humans were susceptible.   These animals' PRP, though similar, was still too different from ours to be a realistic human model.   A closer primate to humans is the chimpanzee.   They were never tested.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  Had this experiment been done 10 years ago we would have that answer today.  As it is the experiment, to the best of my knowledge, has still not been done.  It is being discussed and I'm afraid when the answer comes, which will probably be positive, it won't have any significance at all because we'll already know the answer.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  In the early 90s scientists in America decided to try a different approach: to determine the rules of the species barrier on a molecular level in the test-tube.<p>

DR SUZETTE PRIOLA:  Evidence from other labs has suggested that
the type of PRP protein that an animal makes can determine whether or not that animal is going to be susceptible to infection with the agent from a different species So what we know is that this protein, this PRP protein, is, it's composed of a sequence of what are called amino acids which are linked in a long chain and that the amino acid sequence of PRP from an animal like a sheep differs from the sequence in an animal such as a cow and what we're interested in determining is if it's those differences between these two types of PRP that can affect whether or not this species barrier is broken and infection can occur.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Dr Priola was intrigued by the puzzle of the species barrier between mice and hamsters.   <B>Although closely related and with similar PRP proteins, the hamster disease doesn't infect mice, but the mouse disease does infect hamsters. </B>She analysed the amino acid sequences of the mouse and the hamster prion proteins and swapped single amino acids to try to discover how many of them were controlling the species barrier.<p>

SUZETTE PRIOLA:  Between the mouse PRP and the hamster PRP there are 16 amino acid differences
and what we were able to do is show that you can control formation of this protein by changing just one amino acid, so one change out of 254 amino acids could be enough to allow the formation of this abnormal protein.  If you get the formation of this abnormal protein you're probably going to get disease. One of the things that this piece of work implies is that very minor changes in the PRP proteins between two different species could really have a dramatic effect on whether or not you get formation of this abnormal protein.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  With this discovery Dr. Priola had begun to decipher in the test-tube the complex rules of the species barrier, but although promising this is painstaking work, and it will be years before it can answer the key question about cows and humans. Meanwhile, a new scientific technique had been developed one which might at last indicate whether we would be susceptible to BSE.  Scientists had found a way to manufacture substitute humans: transgenic mice.<p>

<FONT COLOR="990099">JOHN COLLINGE</FONT>:  Transgenic mice are mice which contain a foreign gene that's been inserted into them
and you can make these mice by taking a single celled embryo, the fertilised egg from a mouse and injecting in DNA containing another gene. That can be a gene from another mouse, it can be a gene from another species.  In this way it's been possible to produce mice that make human prion protein, so there can now be a model, if you like, of a human being.  What we can do is inoculate these mice with BSE and see how susceptible they are to BSE and that may give us some idea about how effective the, the real species barrier is between cattle and humans.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  This work was begun in 1995, but before it could be completed the human experiment produced its first results.  In March 1996 the government announced that they believed the first humans had died of Mad Cow Disease.  Science had failed to find the answer in time.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  Like everybody else we were pretty shocked.  I mean everybody was thinking that there might be a theoretical risk of transmission of BSE to humans, but, but one thing is to say OK, there may be a theoretical risk,  another thing is to see patients dying from it, so, so this came as a, as a very sobering experience to us.<p>

<FONT COLOR="996633">DAVID TAYLOR</FONT>:  I'm on record as being of the opinion that BSE would not represent a risk to the human population.  I accept that I may have to revise that view in light of the             variant cases of CJD but of course we still have to wait and see to, to see if these really are associated with BSE.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">PAUL BROWN</FONT>:  If these 10 people have died from BSE then essentially the entire population of Britain is at risk.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  In this warehouse in America brain samples are stored from victims of all human spongiform encephalopathies, including those from the only epidemic that we've ever known - kuru in Papua New Guinea.   Scientists are now debating whether we in Britain are heading for the second epidemic and how big that epidemic might be.  Tomorrow night Horizon asks who is at risk and how many may die.

<FONT COLOR="FD3097"><FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT></FONT> (JO UNWIN):  We in Britain know we may be facing a human epidemic of Mad Cow Disease.   The question is:  how big might the epidemic be and who of us is at risk?   This is the story of the scientific search for answers. Long before BSE appeared, the human form of the disease was well-known - CJD, Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.  In 1990 the government set up a small research unit with one sole purpose - to detect the earliest signs of a human epidemic of Mad Cow Disease.   They were to study every case of CJD in Britain to look for any change in the normal pattern of disease, a new variant that would reveal that BSE had crossed into humans.  One member of the team had the job of examining the brains of everyone in Britain who died of CJD, looking for anything unusual.   But a CJD autopsy is unlike any other a neuropathologist ever has to perform.

DR <FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  I've now changed into the clothes I'll wear to do an autopsy in a case of suspected CJD and these garments are disposable because they will be incinerated after the autopsy.   These are the gloves, on the top is a chainmail hand piece and this is flexible and allows my hand to be protected from any cuts while the autopsy's being performed and I wear another pair of rubber gloves on top of this just to make the whole thing as waterproof as possible, and this is the helmet,   I'll just put it on.
The instruments that I use in the post-mortem room and the instruments the technicians use in our dedicated laboratory really we regard these as being permanently contaminated, so we use those for CJD cases alone because there's no effective way of guaranteeing decontamination in this disease
and unlike other viruses and bacteria it can resist extremes of heat, cold, chemicals, enzymes, everything practically and I don't think any of us believe that we can fully decontaminate anything with this agent.<p>

<FONT COLOR="996633">DR MARTIN ZEIDLER</FONT>:  I would travel throughout the whole of the country to see patients with Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease as the geographical distribution is, is completely random.  We would normally be referred cases by the neurologists, or pathologists and then asked whether or not the family know the diagnosis.  If they do and they're happy to see us, we will then arrange to go and see the patient normally within a few days or a week or so. Most patients with Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease by the time that I visit them are severely demented, so they're unable to communicate.  They're usually mute, lying in bed, unable to move, and they have jerking movements
of their limbs, what's called myoclonus.  They can also not infrequently be blind and even though they can't see their brain is producing hallucinations which can make, can make them very frightened.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Rob Will is the consultant neurologist.  He had seen hundreds of cases of CJD over the years, but now he was looking for a change in the normal pattern of the disease, because the first signs of an epidemic of BSE in humans would show up as some new variant of CJD.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366"><FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:</FONT>  What we know about CJD is that it nearly always affects people who are aged between about 50 and 75 and the striking thing about CJD that makes it different from other causes of dementia is that it progresses really very quickly.<p>

WOMAN:  She's a patient, 81-year-old...
<P>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  There are a number of possible things we could look for including a change in the number of cases that might be identified every  year, for example looking at change in occupation to see whether the people who were in contact with cows or with BSE tissue might be more at risk and also to look at any change in the age of the patients or the other clinical features and finally to look at the neuropathology to see if that had changed in any way. Laboratory activity<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The brain is the key to diagnosing CJD.   It is here that the infectious agent, prion protein, accumulates over many years and eventually creates microscopic holes that turn the brain to sponge.   Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease has long existed in the human population.  Because it's rare and strikes people at random, it is sometimes known as sporadic CJD.   The classic signs of sporadic CJD are well-known.
Brain slides being examined<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  Well in the typical form of CJD in older patients we find the appearance of holes which look like a sponge down the microscope.   They're accompanied by accumulations of prion protein which you can see as distinct lumps or deposits.   We really had no idea what we were looking for.   Our mission statement
if you like was to identify every case of CJD in Britain and to study the clinical and pathological features to monitor any change cases being
studied<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  For 5 years they looked at hundreds of cases of CJD, examining them for the slightest sign that a new form of the disease had emerged that could be linked to BSE.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  I felt that the risks from BSE were likely to be remote, as many other authorities commented, and I very much agreed with that, so I thought that we would probably be looking at CJD for many years without necessarily finding anything that was linked to BSE.   I thought that it was extremely unlikely that the pattern of CJD would change in view of the BSE epidemic.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  And then one day in 1994 a young man called Stephen Churchill began to fall ill.   He was 18 years old. Stephen's sister and cousin watched his slow decline, not knowing what it was that was causing his illness.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  I came home more and more regularly from university and just noticed a sort of steady decline in his conversation.   He stopped talking, he wasn't interested in anything, he didn't respond to anything anybody said.<p>

KEITH WRITER:  I didn't expect there was anything seriously wrong with him at all.   I just thought it was just A-level blues which everybody at some stage suffers from.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  One of the first things we noticed when Steve became ill was that he started hallucinating.  It, it started off that he'd be watching television and he'd get very enthralled in what was going on.  If there was fire on the television he'd feel as though he was burning, or if it was like an undersea, underwater scene he'd feel as though he was drowning and then it got to a stage where he was just seeing things that just weren't there, or he'd try and pick up a cup of coffee, but he'd miss, but he wouldn't realise, he'd still continue to look as though he was drinking and hadn't realised that he hadn't actually picked up the cup, and these became more and more frightening for him. He was absolutely terrified of whatever he was seeing, but he wasn't able to explain to us what had happened.<p>

KEITH WRITER:  He also had very jerky movements and he could suddenly decide to try and get up and walk when he wasn't capable of doing any kind of action which would often result in him injuring himself or falling over if there was nobody around to help him.
I next actually saw Steve in February 1995 when he was in the hospital.  It was a great shock to see him.   He had lost a lot of weight, he was lean anyway, but with weight loss on him he looked very emaciated, he had a kind of grey pallor about him and his eyes were sunken.  He looked awful.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  We saw CJD and a question mark written on the notes and that was the first sign that they had maybe an idea of what it was, and obviously we didn't know anything about CJD at the time.   I'm a dental student in Cardiff so I have a fair amount of medical knowledge, so I went back to University, the library and started trying to find but anything we could.   I found out that it was a very strange disease, possibly linked to Churchill family scrapie and BSE and that type of thing, but I also found out it was only really found in 50, 60, 70-year-olds and although a lot of the symptoms seemed to fit the age group didn't.
Steve died May 21st 1995.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  June 1995 we heard about one young patient with CJD, a teenager with CJD.  This was clearly very unusual and then a few months later we heard about another case in another teenager.  Now this was clearly exceptional. In December we began to be referred a number of other younger patients with CJD in their 20s and 30s and over the early months of this year in January and February we identified I think by then 8 cases of CJD in young people with a very unusual clinical presentation. <p>

MARTIN ZEIDLER:  They didn't show the typical appearances which is in the brainwave recordings that we see in sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.  This is brainwave recording from a patient with sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease and it shows the classical appearance associated with CJD.   These sharp waves are occurring in all the, all across the tracing, coming from the various parts of the, the brain and they occur regularly, usually once or twice every second.  However, in the new patients none of them have that classical appearance, and what we saw was just slow waves.  They didn't show the typical appearances associated with the sporadic form of the disease.
<P>


<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  The first time I saw the new variant of CJD was in a, a brain biopsy from a young patient and I can remember being very struck even in this very small piece of tissue the changes there were very different from anything that I'd ever seen before.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The Unit had developed a computer system that could analyse brain slides and highlight all the classic features of sporadic CJD.  The scattering of microscopic holes and the tiny "plaques" or lumps of prion protein that accumulate in the brain were outlined in red.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  When we first set up the project we were anticipating that perhaps the changes would be rather subtle.  However when the first new variant cases emerged the changes were so striking even on initial examination that we were overwhelmed by the differences.
As well as the spongy change in the tissue there were large numbers of these plaques, these aggregates of prion protein, but it wasn't just the plaques.  They had a particular shape, they were large, they were rounded and they were surrounded by a ring or a halo of spongiform change and I had never seen anything like that before.
For me I think the key event was doing an autopsy in January 1996 on the same day on two young patients and when the histology of these two cases came through in February 1996 I think I realised then that undoubtedly this was something different, something new, something very disturbing and something for which we had no explanation.<p>

MARTIN ZEIDLER:  I recall one day speaking to Bob Will and really for the, for the first time I think we all had to agree that this was something unexplainable and that we couldn't just put it down to a chance occurrence.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  The timing of these cases is possibly of some importance, and the reason for that is
the incubation period.   If the population of the UK were exposed to the BSE agent in the mid-1980s it would not be unexpected if there were a link that cases would start to occur in the mid-1990s.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  The striking similarity
in both the clinical features and the pathology in these cases suggest that a common agent is operating and this I think points towards BSE as the most likely cause.<p>

MARTIN ZEIDLER:  I think the most likely explanation is that these cases occurred because of BSE.
SEAC meeting<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  On March 8th the Unit informed the government's scientific advisors, SEAC, that something disturbing was happening.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  We kept the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee informed about the findings of the study and Dr Ironside and I gave a presentation to the SEAC committee on March 8th and I think that was a fairly tense occasion.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  Obviously we were aware of the severe potential implications of the findings and while the room was darkened and I was showing the slides, the graphs, the pictures, I could hear gasps of astonishment and comments of almost disbelief coming from some of the members.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  I remember that SEAC meeting very well of course.  It was tremendously tense as we heard about all the cases.   It was something that none of us had ever seen before and really underlined what we already knew from the ages of these people that this was something quite new.<p>

PROF. JOHN PATTISON:  I think that we were (a) impressed by what Bob and James told us and (b) we were stunned by the implications of what they were telling us because they were saying there is what we went on to describe as a new variant of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.   We couldn't help focusing on the fact that there was something new happening in the human population in the middle 1990s approximately 8 or 10 years after a new epidemic, BSE, happened in cattle.   At that point I think we knew that we simply had to quite rapidly tell the Chief Medical Office and the Chief Veterinary Officer and thereby their Ministers that we had verification that there were 8 cases of what appeared to be a new variant of CJD with all the implications of BSE being a probable cause.<p>

MINISTER:  With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the latest advice which the government has received from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.
There remains no scientific proof that BSE can be transmitted to man by  beef, but the committee have concluded that the most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of the specified bovine offal ban in 1989.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  I was just sat at home having my lunch after I'd been to college one day
and it took a while for me to realise, but there was actually somebody on television telling me that my brother had died because of something that he'd eaten and I just felt so angry and very frustrated and it was just completely out the blue.   Nobody had warned us that anything was going to be said and there was an MP stood there saying that, you know, Steve had died from, from beef.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The news shocked the world,.   By then there were 10 cases.  But still the link with BSE was unproven.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  Well now of course much effort is revolving around understanding whether the new variant of CJD is really caused by BSE.  It seems the most likely explanation.  We need to produce some direct evidence for that.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Last month Professor Collinge succeeded in providing that evidence.   When analysed chemically, brain samples from new variant CJD had an identical molecular signature to BSE.  This was close to proof.  But knowing that these people did die of BSE doesn't tell us how many more are now incubating the disease, or how large the human epidemic might be.  Scientists can only hypothesise.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  Certainly if we are seeing one or two more new variant cases occurring every month, and I don't think we are seeing quite those numbers, but if we were seeing, seeing those numbers that might be consistent with, with an epidemic doubling time of 6 or 12 months, and that would, that would be very concerning if that were happening I think.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  There have been 4 more confirmed new variant cases since the announcement in March.  This brings the total to 14.  There are other suspected cases, but those figures are not officially released.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  At the moment I think the government have to assume the worst, they have to assume that BSE is a huge problem and that they can't take the risks of people's lives.  Too many people have died already.<p>

JOHN PATTISON:  One of the next questions that we must ask is:  how many people in the UK population have been exposed and how many are likely to develop the disease having been exposed?   That's going to be a very complex question to answer because of course beef is commonly eaten and beef products were, are popular foods, so it may be that quite a large percentage of the population were exposed to the dangerous tissues before the bans.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  It is notoriously difficult to predict the size of any epidemic in its early stages.  For example, in the first year of BSE only 10 cows fell ill and no-one expected the huge numbers that followed.   Most of the information that would allow us to predict a human epidemic simply doesn't exist, but scientists do now know the questions that urgently need answers, if we're to estimate how many of us are susceptible to BSE.<p>

DR ADRIANO AGUZZI:  The question is really what are the risk factors.   Is there anything that will allow us to predict whether it's a specific person, a specific individual will develop the disease, the new disease once exposed to the BSE infectious agent, and this is a very important question.
Why do we have only a dozen of cases?
Is it because only very few people are susceptible to contracting the disease, or is it just the beginning of a huge epidemic?<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  I wonder why Steve got CJD and not me.  We were still living at home when he got infected, we ate the same food.  Maybe he got it at cubs or school or, but you do wonder why, why Steve and not somebody else or why not me? The chances are when Steve had whatever it was he ate that infected him that the chances are I was there too and I quite probably ate the same thing.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>:  One of the main questions we have to address now is:  why only this small group of patients has developed this disease.  If you believe that this is BSE then potentially millions of us in Britain have been exposed to the agent in the food chain, so what is special, what is different about these people that in a way allowed them to develop the disease?<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>: ,Since March the CJD Surveillance Unit has searched every detail of the lives of the people who died of new variant CJD,  looking for a common link, a reason why they got BSE.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  Somebody came down with a questionnaire and asked us questions about lifestyle and eating habits, where we'd been on holidays, that sort of thing.   Obviously with Stephen being 19 Mum and Dad knew exactly the medical treatments he'd had, his eating, that sort of thing, 'cos he was still living at home at that time.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The one puzzling thing about all these people was their age.  They were all so young to get CJD.  For a while this seemed significant.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  I think that the age distribution of cases is still unexplained and I, I personally think what will happen is that if we do have more cases of this type of CJD that we will probably see cases throughout the age range with time.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  This is already beginning to happen.   A recent victim was 51 years old.  Scientists now believe that all ages may be at risk.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  We've looked for any common link between all these patients and have really found nothing.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>: For example we haven't found any common geographical link or any common occupational link, and of course this is a matter of concern because it would be very much easier to understand these cases and to
assess the risk if we knew some factor that linked all the patients together.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  Steve was no different to anybody else. He didn't have any operations that would have put him at risk, he didn't eat anything strange, he just, he was a, he was a normal, a normal child and he was a normal 18-year-old up until he became ill.<p>

KEITH WRITER:  He did eat beefburgers, but he ate sausages, he, he ate all sorts of things, no more or no less than most other people, so completely normal in that respect.

JOHN COLLINGE:  It is possible that these people were just particularly unlucky and had some, some foods that were heavily contaminated with BSE, and there's really no way of working that out now.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  However there is something about the new variant cases that may link them together - their genetics.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  There is some evidence from CJD that people of a particular genetic
make-up are particularly susceptible to CJD and that's those individuals with aparticular gene make-up at codon 29 of the PRP gene.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  We all inherit two copies of the gene that controls our response to prion diseases - one from our mother and one from our father.  At a particular place along this gene we can either inherit a methianine or Valine amino acid.  If we inherit one methionine and one valine from each parent we seem to be largely protected from prion diseases.  If we inherit two valine we're more vulnerable, but if we inherit two methionines at this point we are methonine homozygote and they seem to be the people most susceptible to new variant CJD.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  The first two published cases were known to be methianine homozygots and earlier this year we began to get the results back on the other new variant cases and this established that there was a link between them and that was that they were all methionine homozygotes at codon 129 of the PRP gene. Looking at the distribution of methianine homozygocity in the United Kingdom population, it's not really all that reassuring because about 18 million people in Britain are probably methianine homozygotes.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  There's no point in testing the British population for methionine homozygocity because we don't yet fully understand whether our genetics can really protect us, or simply delay the onset of disease.   Scientists have to assume that the whole population is at risk. To know how many of us might now be incubating BSE, we need to know how much BSE got into the human food chain over the years.   There is very little data on this question.<p>

JOHN PATTISON:  Well I think we do know that the most dangerous tissues in cattle by far are the brain and spinal cord.  Some of that went into mechanically recovered meat which would find its way into the rather cheaper burgers and pies and sausages, so prior to the specified bovine offals bans, because those tissues were banned in 1989, you would have expected some brain or spinal cord to be in those foodstuffs.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  But how much?   A starting point is to establish how many cows got BSE.   the official figure is 160,000.  But the true scale of the BSE epidemic has only recently come to light, through the work of a team of epidemiologists in Oxford.<p>

PROF. ROY ANDERSON:  Well since BSE became notifiable in 1988, the government scientists have compiled a very extensive database on all the cases of BSE
in the cattle herds in the UK.   Up until very recently that database has not been available for independent analysis.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  For 8 years this leading team of researchers was denied access to the essential raw data.   The government would not release the information.<p>

ROY ANDERSON:  Our own unit was allowed to have access to the data in April of 1996, and since that time we've completed a very extensive analysis of it. <p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The group calculated the real statistics of the epidemic.   The government only published the number of diagnosed cases, but BSE has a very long incubation period.  Professor Anderson added in the cattle who were incubating the disease, but who were never diagnosed with BSE.   They went to slaughter looking healthy while actually infected.   When the new figures were calculated, it was quite a surprise.<p>

ROY ANDERSON:  Given that you've got 160,000 cases reported, by back calculating the numbers of infected, we can show that in essence about 1 million cattle have been infected.
Abattoir activity<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>: <B> Most of those one million cows ended up in human food</B>, but in 1989 the government banned the most infected parts of the carcass - the brain and spinal cord.  It was the cows eaten before that ban that were the most dangerous to humans because then we were still eating infected offal mixed in to beef products.<p>

ROY ANDERSON:  <B>Prior to the offal ban in November 1989, about 440,000 infected animals would have entered the human food chain.</B><p>


<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  That figure assumes that after the ban all brain and spinal cord was removed from the carcass, but we now know that didn't always happen.   Recently, it was discovered that the offals ban was not properly implemented by some abattoirs and infected tissue was still getting into human food until the end of 1995.<p>

JOHN PATTISON:  We had always assumed that the ban was being fully implemented.
I think we were alarmed at that point and I think the phrase we used was that we were gravely concerned.   I mean it was always the sort of central pillar of the protection of public health, the removal of those tissues which you knew, or suspected, might contain the transmissible agent of BSE, so if they weren't being removed properly that was a serious problem.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  I was horrified to hear what had happened in relation to that, and of course I think it's absolutely crucial that since then there's been a great tightening up of the application of the regulations, and I think that's absolutely, really very important.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Over the years several tons of infected offal may have entered the human food chain.   It would be impossible to estimate how many contaminated burgers, sausages, pies and patties we ate, but anyone who ate these products was likely to have been exposed to the agent.  It was therefore crucial to find out how much infected material a human being would have to eat to trigger the disease.  What was the fatal dose to humans?
The Ministry of Agriculture has concentrated its research on questions of animal health, but their experiments have revealed just how infective BSE really is.  A 1 million study, begun in 1992, has  now established the minimum fatal dose to cows.   They fed varying doses of BSE to a herd of test cattle.<p>

JOHN WILESMITH:  The experiment that we've done is to
take infected brain from terminal cases of BSE and feed them at varying doses, and we've gone from one gram to 100 grams.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Every 6 weeks the cattle in the study were examined for early signs of BSE.  Timidness, fear, anxiety.   The cattle given the largest doses died early in the experiment. Scientists waited to see what would be the smallest dose to kill a cow.  The results were astonishing.<p>

JOHN WILESMITH:  In our study <B>just one gram seems to be capable of infecting  a calf and that's just a quarter of a teaspoonful.</B><p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  A quarter of a teaspoon of BSE infected material, given only once in a cow's life can kill it.   However, this tells us little about what would kill a human because we know that it usually takes a larger dose to pass infection from one species to another than it does within the same species.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  The precise amount of BSE infectivity that will provoke disease in humans, if any, is completely unknown.  It's actually anybody's guess, but we, we can try to extrapolate from, from other experiments.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Work in primates may provide a clue.  In the 1990s macaques were injected with BSE.  They died after receiving a tiny dose - 50 milligrams, one hundredth of a teaspoon.   But critics of this experiment pointed out that this dose was injected straight into the brain, by far the most lethal route.   Experiments in mice have shown that to trigger disease through feeding would require a dose 100,000 times larger.   It would be difficult to imagine many people ate that much BSE, which seems reassuring.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  It's often said that injecting prions directly into the brain of an animal is about 100,000 times more effective than feeding the same dose.  That's true when you're within the same species, <B>but when you're jumping from one species to another that ratio doesn't always hold, and the oral route may be surprisingly effective</B>.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  It would appear that <B>in the case of BSE the difference, the relative difference between the inter- cerebral administration, the injection into the brain, and the administration through the mouth is not so huge as is the case in the mouse,</B> and this of course is dismal news.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The next question that worried scientists was whether seemingly insignificant amounts of BSE could accumulate in our bodies until they reached the fatal level.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  We don't know yet whether there's a cumulative dose in factor.   We know in animal models that there's, there's a minimum dose that you have to give to produce the disease.  We don't know yet if you divide that dose up into small portions and give it over a long period of time whether it would also be effective, and this is an important issue with respect to BSE in humans.  It may be that you have to have a very large exposure to BSE over a short period of time to get the disease, it may be that small amounts over years could build up to produce the disease and we really don't know the answer to that question, but there's likely to be some cumulative element to it, simply because the infectious agent itself is so persistent in the body.   It can stay there for a long period of time so it's bound to build up to some extent.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  There is unfortunately no data yet about this question, but obviously if you think that in food there might have been contamination, repeated contamination with small amounts of BSE prions this is a high priority or something that has to be answered urgently.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  If insignificant doses can accumulate, this could have profound implications.   If minute levels of infectivity exist in the meat we think of as perfectly safe, and therefore regularly eat, they might build up and eventually trigger disease.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  <B>It would certainly be nice to know whether there's any infectivity at all in tissues that we eat such as beef and muscle, whether there's any infectivity in blood, in BSE infected animals</B>.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Unfortunately the government's experiments cannot detect low levels of infectivity.  In 1988 government scientists tried to find out which parts of a cow were infectious.   The only way to do that was to take samples from each tissue and organ of the infected carcass, liquidise them and inject them into mice.   The mice injected with brain and spinal cord succumbed to BSE very quickly, so it was clear these were the most heavily infected parts of the carcass.   They were banned.   But mice injected with muscle, blood, liver and kidneys didn't get ill at all.  These meats were considered safe for human consumption.   But to infect mice, the dose of BSE must be large enough to cross into a new species.   So if parts of a cattle carcass contained levels of BSE too low to cross the species barrier into mice, they would not have been detected.   If these tests had been done in cows rather than mice there would have been no species barrier to cross.   Even minute amounts of BSE will trigger disease in a cow, so <B>cattle tests are the most effective way of detecting low levels of BSE in meat.   These tests were never done. </B>  They would have been more expensive but much more sensitive, and we're only just beginning to understand how much more sensitive.<p>

JOHN WILESMITH:  It was important to examine the sensitivity of the mouse test because it is known in these diseases that when one is putting tissues from one species into another that there is this species barrier, so the studies that have been set up are inoculating the same tissues into cattle as into mice.  Those results are still coming forward, but we do know now that cattle are more sensitive than mice and that is of, is at least of the order of 1,000-fold difference.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  So it takes 1,000 times more BSE to kill a mouse than it does to kill a cow.  We may have been eating minute doses of BSE in some meat that wasn't detected in the mouse tests.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  Well the only way to be sure there's no infectivity in these other tissues is, is to study them in calves yes because there may be levels of infection there that we simply can't detect in mice, but what we can say from the, from the mouse study is, is that, is that <B>if there is any infectious material, for instance, in, in muscle or milk, it's of a very, very much lower order than there is in the brain and the spinal cord, at least a million-fold less.</B><p>

JOHN PATTISON:  What we're considering doing at the moment is to call for extra transmission experiments from cattle to cattle because that's the most sensitive way of detecting the agent of BSE.  Only limited numbers of those experiments have been done to date and so we are advising that there should be more tissues from cattle put into cattle transmission studies.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The cattle tests could have been done 10 years ago and we would now know the answers.  If they start them now we won't have the results for years.
In this test-tube there is enough purified BSE to kill 10 million cows.  It's main component is a protein, the mysterious and unpredictable prion.
Prions can only cause disease if they reach the brain.  That's where they do the irreparable damage that leads to death.
But the prion has to make a tortuous journey through the body to get from the gut to the brain.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  We do not know all the details, but what we know is that at first we have infectivity in the gut and then from the gut
we find it in the spleen which is somewhere here, and then from the spleen we find it's probably in the peripheral nerves and from then on it goes into the spinal cord and then from the spinal cord is crawls all the way up to the brain and then it infects all the brain.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  There are many obstacles along this path through the body, so every time you eat infected food there's a chance that the prions' route will be blocked.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  Each time you're exposed to prions you're taking a small chance and you might be unlucky
and that small dose of prions might trigger production of prions in your brain and cause the disease, and each time you're exposed you're taking an additional chance.   You're filling out another lottery ticket as it were.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The first obstacle for the prion protein is in the gut because here there are gastric juices specially designed to break proteins down.  But we do know that there are brief moments when the gut will let a whole protein slip through into the body.<p>

PROF. ANNE FERGUSON:  When we eat a protein we have an extremely efficient digestive process that breaks the protein down into building blocks and a very efficient system for transporting these little building blocks into the tissues of our body to make our own proteins.   It was known for about 30 or 40 years that perhaps one in a million, one in 10 million protein molecules escapes this breaking down process and indeed intact molecules can actually cross the lining of the gut to reach the inside of the body.  
<P>
 We know that there are many, many situations in which briefly or for a longer period of time the gut becomes leaky.   I'll give you a few examples.   The morning after drinking half a bottle of whiskey, somebody who eats some aspirin tablets, for a day or two around the time somebody has acute gastro-enteritis or food poisoning, if you get Montezuma's revenge when you've been off on holiday somewhere. 
<P>
However, what's particularly interesting in terms of these prion diseases, is the other route by which proteins cross into the body because scattered throughout the bowel there are also little nodules called Peyers Patches.  These are part of the immune system.  In order that material from the gut is seen by the Peyers Patch cells there seems to have evolved a very special surface lining, a layer of little cells that are very good at taking material from the inside of the gut into the tissues, so proteins, but viruses, bacteria, agents that it's useful for the immune system to see, are speeded through this special surface lining and handed to the cells of the Peyers Patches.<p>

We already know that a number of infections enter the body through the Peyers Patches, typhoid for example, in human beings.  We already know that in the sheep and in the cow the Peyers Patches are almost certainly the route by which the prion agents enter the body, so if prion diseases are found to affect man via the gut then it's very likely that the route is through the Peyers Patches and diseases of the Peyers Patches might be the explanation why some people are particularly vulnerable and on the other hand, manoeuvres to protect the Peyers Patches and strengthen their function may be an important protection.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  The gut is only the first obstacle in the long journey the prion takes to the brain.   We don't yet know what other defences the body may have along the way, or what physical characteristics would make a person more at risk.  In fact, 10 years after BSE first appeared in this country, we still have too many unanswered questions.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  It's very hard to try and perform any sort of
real risk assessment as to what, what the outcome of this might be, how many people might get infected, what sort of exposure might be a risk?  We really 
know so little, in fact none really of the key ingredients that you'd need to know to make a risk assessment.<p>

JOHN PATTISON:  Of course it would have been helpful to have much more experimental data than we now have, but I think the situation is we haven't and we can only start from where we find ourselves now and set up those experiments anew.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  I feel that the scientific research has been very slow to start. It was years and years and years before enough research had really started and with the disease being so slow to develop the research takes a long time to do. We'll get the answers in maybe 5 years' time, but by then the damage is done.   The work should have been done a long time ago.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FD3097">NARRATOR</FONT>:  Many scientists now feel the urgent need is to search for a cure, to prepare for a worst case scenario.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">ROBERT WILL</FONT>:  There are a lot of people who are very interested in trying to find some form of cure or treatment that might prevent disease developing or progressing, and I think it's clearly a very important issue currently.<p>

ADRIANO AGUZZI:  If you want to treat the disease you need to understand how the disease proceeds and thereby you can identify ways of attacking it, of interfering with it.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  <B>One approach to treatment would be to develop drugs that block the interaction of prion proteins</B>, that block that interaction and that's something we're actively investigating.
Because of the nature of work on these diseases which takes a long period of time, you know we are in a very difficult situation, a difficult race against time to have an effective treatment ready before any epidemic arose.<p>

JOHN PATTISON:  It's very difficult to predict when you will find a cure for any disease
or a way of preventing any disease and that's true of CJD as it is of any other.  However, I, I think one must admit that we're starting a long way back in terms of our approach to the modification of CJD as a disease and I think it would be wrong to say that anything is likely to emerge very rapidly.<p>

<FONT COLOR="FF3366">DR JAMES IRONSIDE</FONT>: <B> I think it's fairly unlikely that a cure for CJD would be developed in the foreseeable future which means if we do see an enormous increase in numbers of patients in Britain there will be no prospect of specific treatment for them</B>.<p>

<FONT COLOR="0099FF">HELEN CHURCHILL</FONT>:  I think that we've got to assume that there could be a lot more cases.  We don't know, but there could be a lot more cases of CJD in young people and because of this there's got to be some kind of plan of how these people are going to be taken care of.  With Stephen we had a lot of problems finding an appropriate place and the care for him.   In April '95 we started looking for a nursing home for Steve to live and obviously there, there isn't anywhere for a 19-year-old in that situation, and we wanted him to be close to his friends, we didn't want him to be in a hospice a long way away, so in the end we found what was a very nice nursing home, but it was, it was an old people's home.<p>

People shouldn't have to go through that kind of problem at a time like that.  The, I believe the government really have got to put together some kind of care package and give the opportunity for people to have their relatives looked after and be close to home, but where, where they will be looked after properly and their needs will be catered for.<p>

JOHN PATTISON:  There is no way at the moment of predicting whether
these were the only people who were susceptible enough to get it, or whether in fact they are the start of a larger number of people who were exposed and are going to develop new variant CJD. The figures could have been much more alarming by now, but the fact that they are rather small doesn't mean that we're not going to have a significant epidemic, not yet.<p>

JOHN COLLINGE:  I'll be very surprised if there were no more cases of new variant CJD and that, that's true in a sense whatever's causing them because they're such an unlikely cluster of cases that, that there's clearly something going on here which has to be explained.   You know I'm of the opinion that the most likely explanation for them is BSE and I think we will see more cases, but it's far, far too early to say what sort of epidemic that's going to be, whether it's just going to be 20 or 30 cases over, over several years, or whether it's going to be hundreds or potentially thousands of cases.   We have to wait and see.<p>

ROY ANDERSON:  Given this long incubation period or hypothesised long incubation period, clearly if there was an epidemic of the new variant CJD it would be a number of decades probably before it reached its peak.

The BBC TV Horizon programme on BSE on 18 November, screened John
Wilesmith of Central Veterinary Laboratory saying that experiments
suggested that the calf assay could detect  of the order of 1000th of
the inoculation  dose of BSE infectivity that the mouse assay could
detect. <P>

I had a long conversation with John Wilesmith on 19 November, in which
it emerged that Horizon included only part of the facts.<P>

The reported calf assay conclusion was in fact part of a long-term
programme, started about seven years ago,  of experiments with calves
from a CVL-managed herd the "members" of which have  been carefully
monitored throughout the ensuing years. The experiments consisted of
feeding trials with different amounts of brain tissue from BSE
infected cows (briefly referred to in the early part of the Anderson
et al "Oxford study", Nature, 382, 29 August 1996, bottom of page
779); and intracerebral inoculation trials.<P>

In the latter, different amounts of brain tissue from confirmed BSE
infected cows were inoculated into calves. It was from this set of
experiments that it was concluded that calves succumbed to around
1000th of the dose that affected mice, as reported in the Sunday Times
and on Horizon.<P>

What Horizon did not include was the fact that parallel inoculation
tests were carried out inoculating into calves lymph tissue and
spleen, respectively, from confirmed BSE infected cows, and that by
this calf assay, no infectivity was found in either of them after
around seven years.<P>

If any of the tissues or secretions (other than brain, spinal cord and
retina) contained infectivity at levels lower than could be detected
in the mouse assay, lymph tissue and spleen must be prime candidates;
and the fact that infectivity has not been found in them by the more
sensitive calf assay is encouraging. Nevertheless, SEAC is right to
call for testing of other tissues, particularly muscle meat and milk,
by the calf assay.<P>

I was also informed that all this information was in the hands of SEAC
in March 1996 and taken into account when they did their risk
assessment exercise.<P>

No indication was given about how the selected calves were known not
already to be incubating BSE.

</CENTER>

At a press conference held this morning  Wed, 23 Oct 1996 at the Wellcome Foundation,
London, it was announced that John Collinge and his team have found a
means of using the biochemical properties of the prion protein to
trace the likely cause of V-CJD. 

They have found that the biochemical
"signature" of prions in patients who died of V-CJD matches that of
prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD. This method has enabled a conclusion to be reached
earlier than by waiting for the results of the strain-typing
experiments with mice at Edinburgh.
<P>

(24 October), page 685. A discussion of the work, by Adriano Aguzzi
and Charles Weissmann, appears in the same issue on page 666.

                                          Prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle or
                                          Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, are characterized by the presence of an abnormal
                                          prion protein. Collinge et al. have now investigated the biochemical properties of these
                                          proteins. They find that 'new variant' CJD (a form recently recognized in 12 British
                                          individuals and thought to stem from consumption of BSE-infected beef) has properties that
                                          are sharply distinct from those of other human strains, but which resemble those of BSE
                                          transmitted to mice, cats and monkeys from infected cows. The finding greatly strengthens the
                                          conclusion that new variant CJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British cattle, and
                                          suggests that prion proteins themselves may encode the disease phenotype.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"What you have there are the abstracts that came with the articles.  The 
actual thing was really quite complex.  
<P>
An attempt was made to electrophorese purified PrP<SUP>sc</SUP> derived from CJD of 
different types.  The electrophoretic pattern that was seen was well 
divided into 4 kinds.  The first was the sporadic CJD that appears from 
nowhere and no cause is known, the second is the centrally inoculated CJD 
that comes from another person, the third was the peripherally inoculated 
CJD that they find coming in thepatients that received contamiated growth 
hormone.  The fourth type, which could be easily separated from the 
others was that of the new variant CJD.  When this was compared with the 
electrophoretic patterns found when BSE in cats, macaque monkeys, and 
mice is tested, it was found to be the same. i.e. the CJD type 4 was the 
same as the other BSEs.  This evidence is very strong that BSE gve rise 
to new variant CJD.  
<P>

One of the most important findings was that it is the sugar molecules 
(glycan chains) that are on the prion protein at positions 181 and 197 
that decide the strain of disease as it is those molecules that caused 
the variance in the electrophoretic patterns.  <P>

The importance of these findings is not simply because it shows BSE to 
have probably infected humans, but also means that we may actually be able 
to treat the disease (see Dealler in Medical Hypotheses 1994;42:69-72) 
and that we may actually be able to diagnose the disease in asymptomatic 
people by looking at other tissues, perhaps their blood.  

This might seem a long way off but it may well not be so.  
The article by Aguzzi and Weissman was not really perfect in that it made 
a few errors.  Anyway, it attempted to explain the articles.  See my 
latest <A HREF="http://www.airtime.co.uk/bse/welcome.htm">scientific research page</A>.

At the moment there is a furore in the press here about this.  One set 
says that we will all die and the other says that there may be a way out."<P>

The nature of the infectious agent, the prion, causing transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is the subject of one of the most
passionate controversies of contemporary biology. In addition to its
academic aspects, this question now impinges on a grave issue of public
health: the possible linkage between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
and vCJD, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) which has
primarily affected young individuals in Great Britain<SUP>1</SUP> but also one in
France<SUP>2</SUP> (Table 1). 
<P>
This linkage is plausible since a variety of animals can
acquire BSE through oral administration of BSE-infected cattle brain. A
paper by Collinge and coworkers<SUP>3</SUP> provides an exciting new approach for
tracing the passage of individual prion strains within and between species.
TSEs are transmitted by an agent which apparently lacks informational
nucleic acids<SUP>4</SUP>. This, along with an impressive body of genetic evidence<SUP>5-7</SUP>,
led to the hypothesis that the prion consists solely of the modified form
of a protein, named PrPC, which is encoded by a singular host gene<SUP>8-10</SUP>. The
conjectured infectious form of PrP has been designated as PrP*<SUP>11</SUP>. 
<P>
An
abnormal form of PrPC, called PrPres or PrPSc and characterized by its
partial resistance to proteolytic digestion and its tendency to aggregate,
accumulates during the advanced stages of most cases of TSEs and has
therefore been equated with PrP*. PrPC and PrPres appear to be chemically
identical and may therefore represent conformational isomers. PrPres is
thought to propagate by interacting with PrPC and causing its conversion
into PrPres. As predicted by the "protein only" hypothesis, PrPC is
essential for propagation of infectivity<SUP>12</SUP>, for clinical disease<SUP>12</SUP> and
brain pathology<SUP>13</SUP>. 
<P>
The "protein only" hypothesis accounts readily for all findings but one,
namely the occurrence of distinct prion strains which can be propagated
indefinitely in hosts homozygous in regard to their PrP genes. Prion
strains are defined by the incubation time or by the pattern of brain
lesions<SUP>14</SUP>. Stable prion strains would be easily explained if the infectious
agent were virus-like: strains would then be encoded by the viral genome.
If, however, the prion is a conformational isoform of PrPC, then all its
phenotypic characteristics should be solely determined by the host PrP
genes and any prion strain should, after a few passages, become monomorphic. 
<P>
How can the existence of strains be explained by the "protein only"
hypothesis? Three possibilities have been suggested. (1) PrP* or PrPres is
associated with an accessory molecule, such as a small nucleic acid<SUP>15</SUP> which
modulates the prion's phenotype without being essential for infectivity. No
evidence for a nucleic acid of this kind has been adduced. (2) PrP*
undergoes secondary modifications, such as glycosylation, and particular
glycans specifically target the molecule to cells which in turn glycosylate
PrP in an identical fashion (the "target cell hypothesis", Meyer, personal
commun.) (3) PrP* or PrPres exists in various different conformations (at
least one for each prion strain), and each type of prion is capable of
imparting its own conformation to the PrPC molecule with which it
interacts. More than one protein chemist has declared this idea to be
unworldly - and yet this is precisely what is implied by a growing number
of studies.
<P>
Western analysis for PrP from extracts of normal or prion-infected brains
reveals three major bands, corresponding to PrP carrying two, one or no
N-attached glycans. Protease treatment degrades all PrP in the case of
normal brain and leads to increased mobility of the three species in
prion-infected brain, due to amino terminal truncation. Presumably the
changed conformation of PrPres protects a large part of the molecule
against degradation. It was first shown by Bessen and Marsh<SUP>16</SUP> that two
strains of prions derived from mink, when propagated in inbred Syrian
hamsters, give rise to PrPres molecules with distinct and heritable
migration patterns after proteinase K treatment. This mobility difference
was shown to be due to cleavage at distinct sites.
<P>
The most common form of prion disease in man, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD), occurs in four forms: a familial form, linked to mutations in the
PrP gene, an acquired or iatrogenic form, due to inadvertent parenteral
exposure to CJD-contaminated materials, notably human cadaveric growth
hormone, variant CJD, which is attributed to ingestion of BSE-contaminated
bovine products and sporadic CJD, the most common form, which is of unknown
etiology. Recently, Parchi et al. demonstrated that protease-treated PrPres
in sporadic CJD can exhibit two mobility patterns which in conjunction with
a Met/Val polymorphism at codon 129 specify four distinct clinical
entities<SUP>17</SUP>. 
<P>
Collinge and colleagues have now extended these observations to iatrogenic
and vCJD. In addition to the mobility of protease-treated PrPres, they
investigate the relative intensity of the three bands that reflect the
glycosylation state. On this basis they define 4 "types" of pattern. Protease-digested PrPres from sporadic CJD cases
gave rise to type 1 or type 2 patterns and that from iatrogenic cases
predominantly to type 3 pattern. Astonishingly, all vCJD samples were
uniformly of the type 4 pattern, which was not seen in any other form of
CJD. In addition, brains of BSE cattle, as wells as of cats and Kudu who
are believed to have acquired BSE, and macaques with experimental BSE
showed a type 4 pattern, which is mainly characterized by a high proportion
of diglycosylated PrPres, as compared to a low value in the other patterns. 
<P>
All forms of human spongiform encephalopathies have been transmitted to
wild type mice or mice transgenic for the human PrP genes; as summarized in
Fig. 1, sporadic or iatrogenic CJDs with type 1, 2 or 3 patterns give rise
to type 2 or type 3 patterns in mice carrying human transgenes, while
BSE-cattle brain gave rise to a type 4 pattern in wild type mice, again
with characteristically high content of diglycosylated species. Thus the
conjectured conformational specificity is conserved after transfer between
species. The patterns given by vCJD after transmission to the mouse have
not yet been reported but are awaited with interest. 
<P>
How do the different patterns come about? As set forth above, the different
mobilities of protease-treated PrPres are ascribed to differing
conformations and this is also true for the bands corresponding to
non-glycosylated PrP, so that the variability cannot be ascribed to
variable glycans. Closer inspection of the Western blots suggests that even
within a single pattern type there is variability in the mobility, so that
there may be even more different conformations represented among the
samples. The unique feature of the type 4 pattern, namely the high ratio of
diglycosylated to unglycosylated PrP may reflect increased susceptibility
of the diglycosylated form to BSE-mediated conformational change.
Alternatively, cells producing preferentially the diglycosylated form may
be more readily targeted by the BSE agent. 
<P>
The findings of Collinge et al. support the proposal that strain
specificity is linked to distinct, heritable conformational states, and may
be of great significance for the classification of human and animal prion
diseases. Moreover, they provide further evidence that the BSE agent has
been transmitted to man. This conclusion will be further reinforced if vCJD
and BSE impart a similar signature to PrPres when transmitted to mice. One
obvious extension of this work will be to compare the PrPres pattern of
natural sheep scrapie to that of sheep with experimental BSE. A pattern
difference, if present, may be used to determine if and to what extent BSE
has been transmitted to sheep by contaminated feed, a question of
particular importance for public health. Also interesting will be the
search for type 4 PrPres in elderly patients with encephalopathy, since the
aged have thus far, and for no obvious reasons, been spared by vCJD.

Strains of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are distinguished by differing 

physicochemical properties of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the disease-related isoform of prion protein, which 

can be maintained on transmission to transgenic mice. 'New variant' Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) 

has strain characteristics distinct from other types of CJD and which resemble those of BSE 

transmitted to mice, domestic cat and macaque, consistent with BSE being the source of this new 

disease. Strain characteristics revealed here suggest that the prion protein may itself encode disease 

phenotype.
<P>
THE prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of neurodegenerative 

diseases that affect both humans and animals. They can be transmitted between mammals by 

inoculation with, or in some cases dietary exposure to, infected tissues. They are all associated with 

the accumulation in affected brains of an abnormal isoform of a host-encoded glycoprotein, prion 

protein (PrP), which seems to be the central (and possibly the sole) component of the transmissible 

agent or prion<sup>1</sup>. This disease-related isoform, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, can be distinguished 

from the normal cellular isoform, PrP<sup>C</sup>, by its insolubility and partial resistance to 

proteases. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is derived from PrP<sup>C</sup> by a post-translational 

mechanism<sup>2</sup> which seems to involve a conformational, rather than covalent, 

modification<sup>3</sup>. Transgenic, human molecular genetic and <i>in vitro</i> conversion 

studies support a model for prion propagation which involves a direct protein-protein interaction 

between host PrP<sup>C</sup> and inoculated PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> acting to 

promote further conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in an autocatalytic process 

which proceeds most efficiently when the interacting proteins are of identical primary 

structure<sup>4-7</sup>. 


<P>
In addition to the unique biology of these diseases, interest in them has been intensified 

because of the epidemic of the prion disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)<sup>8</sup> 

in the UK, and now in other countries, and the possibility that this may represent a significant threat 

to public health through ingestion of BSE-infected tissues. BSE is known to have caused prion disease 

in a number of other species, including domestic cats (feline spongiform encephalopathy) and captive 

exotic ungulates (nyala and kudu), presumably as a result of ingestion of BSE-contaminated 

feed<sup>9</sup>. The pathogenicity of bovine prions for humans is unknown, although the results 

of exposing transgenic mice expressing human prion protein, which lack a species barrier to human 

prions, indicate that induction of human prion production by bovine prions is 

inefficient<sup>10</sup>. 

 

<P> 

&#009;Although many converging lines of evidence support the 'protein only' hypothesis for prion 

propagation<sup>1</sup>, the existence of several distinct isolates or 'strains' of agent that can be 

stably passaged in inbred mice of the same prion protein genotype has yet to be explained 

satisfactorily within this model. Strains can be distinguished by their different incubation periods and 

patterns of neuropathology when passaged in mice<sup>11</sup>. A number of distinct strains of 

natural sheep scrapie are recognized, although BSE seems to be caused by a single strain of 

agent<sup>9</sup>.  

 

<P> 

&#009;Support for the idea that strain specificity is encoded by PrP alone is provided by study of two 

distinct strains of transmissible mink encephalopathy prions, designated hyper (HY) and drowsy 

(DY), which can be serially propagated in hamsters<sup>12</sup>. These strains can be 

distinguished by differing physicochemical properties of the accumulated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the 

brains of affected hamsters<sup>13</sup>. After limited proteolysis, strain-specific migration 

patterns of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> on polyacrylamide gels can be seen. DY PrP<sup>Sc</sup> seems to 

be more protease-sensitive than HY PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, producing a different banding pattern of 

PrP<sup>Sc</sup> on western blots after proteinase K treatment. This relates to different amino-

terminal ends of HY and DY PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after protease treatment and implies differing 

conformations of HY and DY PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (ref. 14). Furthermore, the demonstration that these 

strain-specific physicochemical properties can be maintained during <i>in vitro</i> production of 

protease-resistant PrP, when PrP<sup>C</sup> is mixed with HY or DY hamster PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, 

further supports the concept that prion strains involve different PrP conformers<sup>15</sup>. 

 

<P> 

&#009;The human prion diseases occur in inherited, acquired and sporadic forms. About 15% are 

inherited, and are associated with coding mutations in the prion-protein gene 

(<I>PRNP</I>)<sup>16</sup>. Acquired prion diseases include kuru and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-

Jakob disease (CJD). Recognized iatrogenic routes of transmission are treatment with human 

cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone or gonadotrophin, dura mater or corneal grafting, and the 

use of inadequately sterilized neurosurgical instruments<sup>17</sup>. However, the majority of 

human prion disease occurs as sporadic CJD, in which pathogenic <I>PRNP</I> mutations and a 

history of iatrogenic exposure are absent. The majority of sporadic CJD cases are homozygous at 

polymorphic residue 129, a common protein polymorphism in human PrP that is known to be 

important in genetic susceptibility to human prion diseases<sup>6-16,18-20</sup>. Recently, the 

occurrence of a new form of human prion disease was reported in the United Kingdom, affecting 

unusually young people and having a highly consistent and unique clinicopathological 

pattern<sup>21</sup>. To date, all patients studied are homozygotes (for methionine) at polymorphic 

residue 129 of PrP and no coding mutations are present<sup>22</sup>. None has a history of 

iatrogenic exposure to human prions. This may indicate the arrival of a new risk factor for CJD in the 

United Kingdom, with dietary exposure to specified bovine offals, before their statutory exclusion 

from the human diet in 1989, seeming to be the most likely candidate. It is not known how many 

strains of human prions cause CJD; only two distinct patterns of protease-resistant PrP have been 

reported to date, associated with different clinicopathological types of sporadic CJD<sup>23</sup>. 

<P>

&#009;We have investigated a wide range of cases of human prion disease to identify patterns of 

protease-resistant PrP that might indicate different, naturally occurring, prion strain types. We then 

studied 'new variant' CJD to determine whether it represents a distinct strain type that can be 

differentiated by molecular criteria from other forms of CJD. We demonstrate that sporadic and 

iatrogenic CJD is associated with three distinct patterns of protease-resistant PrP on western blots. 

Types 1 and 2, as previously described, are seen in sporadic CJD, and also in some iatrogenic CJD 

cases. A third type is seen in acquired prion diseases that arise from a peripheral route of exposure to 

prions. New variant CJD is associated with a unique and highly consistent appearance of protease-

resistant PrP on western blots, involving a characteristic pattern of glycosylation. Whereas 

transmission of CJD to inbred mice produces a pattern characteristic of the inoculated CJD, 

transmission of BSE produces a glycoform ratio pattern closely similar to new variant CJD. Similarly, 

experimental BSE in macaques and naturally acquired BSE in domestic cats show an 

indistinguishable glycoform pattern to experimental murine BSE and new variant CJD. Transmission 

of types 1, 2 and 3 CJD to transgenic mice expressing human PrP reveals persistence or conversion of 

strain type dependent on <I>PRNP</I> codon-129 genotype, providing supportive evidence for the 

'protein only' hypothesis of infectiousness and indicating that strain variation might be encoded by a 

combination of PrP conformation and glycosylation. 

 

<H4>Sporadic and acquired CJD</H4>

Typically, three bands are seen on western blots of protease-resistant PrP from CJD cases. The two 

larger-molecular-mass bands represent the main glycosylated forms of PrP and the smaller band 

represents unglycosylated PrP<sup>23</sup> <a href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig1.html">(Fig. 1)</a>. Two distinct patterns 

have been described in sporadic CJD: a type-1 pattern seen in the majority of CJD cases, with 

homozygosity for methionine (MM) at polymorphic residue 129 of PrP, and a type-2 pattern seen in a 

minority of MM cases and in all methionine/valine heterozygotes (MV) and valine homozygotes 

(VV)<sup>23</sup>. We used western blotting to analyse protease-resistant prion proteins for a total 

of 26 neuropathologically confirmed sporadic CJD cases representing all three <I>PRNP</I> codon-

129 genotypes. Cases that pre-dated and cases that were contemporary to the BSE epidemic were 

included (Table 1). We confirmed the finding that in sporadic CJD, MM cases had two distinct 

banding patterns<sup>23</sup> (designated types 1 and 2), whereas VV and MV cases all showed the type-2 banding pattern. In our sample of sporadic CJD cases, we found type-2 MM to be more frequent 

that type-1 MM (Table 1). In addition, differences were previously noted between the proportion of 

protease-resistant PrP in each of the three bands between the type-1 and type-2 sporadic CJD 

patients<sup>23</sup>. In our larger series, a statistically significant difference was seen between 

type-1 and type-2 cases with respect to the proportion of the low-molecular-mass glycoform, but not 

with respect to the other two bands .

&#009;We then studied a range of iatrogenic CJD cases, including patients who had received human 

pituitary-derived growth hormone, with all three <I>PRNP</I> codon-129 genotypes, a human 

pituitary-derived gonadotrophin patient, and a patient who developed CJD after a dura mater graft. A 

third distinct banding pattern of protease-resistant PrP was detected in all of the pituitary hormone-

related cases which were of <I>PRNP</I> codon-129 genotype MV or VV <a href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig2.html">(Fig.

molecular mass (<i>M</i><sub>r</sub>) of roughly 2,000 to 3,000 (2K-3K) of the protease-resistant 

PrP detected as compared with type-2 sporadic CJD. There were no significant differences in 

glycoform ratios between type-1 and type-3 or between type-2 and type-3 CJD in this sample <a 

href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig4.html">(Fig. 4 legend)</a>. The single MM growth-hormone case had a banding pattern

CJD <a href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig2.html">(Fig.2)</a>. The possibility that there may be further heterogeneity within 

these individual PrP<sup>Sc</sup> types is under investigation. 

 

<P> 

<B>Transmission studies to mice</B> 

 

<P> 

We are studying the transmission characteristics of CJD in transgenic mice that express human PrP 

but not murine PrP (designated HuPrP<sup>+/+</sup> <i>Prn-p</i><sup>0/0</sup> as they are 

homozygous for the human PrP transgene array)<sup>10</sup>. These mice lack a species barrier to 

human prions, and most inoculated mice succumb to prion disease with consistently short incubation 

periods<sup>10-24</sup>, usually in the region of 180-220 days (data not shown). This is markedly 

different from studies with non-transgenic mice using the same inocula, in which transmissions are 

infrequent and when they do occur they are associated with prolonged and variable incubation 

periods. 

 

<P> 

&#009;Transmission of type-2 CJD (of all three codon-129 genotypes) or type-3 CJD (which were all 

of genotype MV or VV) resulted in production of protease-resistant human PrP in the mice with an 

identical banding pattern to the primary inoculum (type 2 or 3, respectively) <a 

href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig3.html">(Fig. 3)</a>. The HuPrP<sup>+/+</sup> <i>Prn-p</i><sup>0/0</sup> mice used 

encode valine at residue 129 (ref. 25). However, transmission of type-1 CJD (which are all of 

genotype MM) resulted consistently in a type-2 banding pattern of human protease-resistant PrP 

produced in the mice <a href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig3.html">(Fig. 3)</a>. The proportion of different glycoforms on 

western blots of brain homogenates from these mice was indistinguishable from that of the human 

cases themselves (data not shown).

<H4>New variant CJD</H4>

Proteinase K treatment of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from new variant CJD revealed the characteristic band 

shift seen after digestion to the protease-resistant fragment, confirming complete digestion of the 

protease-sensitive N-terminal region of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the conditions used . All patients studied with new variant CJD were homozygotes for 

methionine at polymorphic residue 129 (ref. 22). No known or new coding mutations of 

<I>PRNP</I> were seen in the new variant CJD cases or the sporadic CJD cases that were sequenced. 

Western blot analysis of these ten new variant CJD cases revealed a consistent and distinct pattern of 

protease-resistant PrP forms, which could be clearly differentiated by band sizes from type-1 and type-

2 sporadic CJD cases, and from type-3 CJD by a striking and 

distinctive pattern of band intensities which differed from all three CJD types. Deglycosylation with PNGaseF resulted in a single band, indicating 

that there might be a consistent proteolytic cleavage site irrespective of glycosylation state <a 

href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig1.html">(Fig. 1e)</a> and which differs from that seen in sporadic CJD. The high-

<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> glycoform was the most abundant, with relatively little unglycosylated PrP 

when compared with type-1, type-2 and type-3 CJD. These differences in band intensity from types 1-

3 CJD were all highly statistically significant <a href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig4.html">(Fig. 4 legend)</a>. A scattergram 

of the relative proportions of the high-<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> and low-<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 

glycoforms reveals two non-overlapping populations of cases: new variant CJD has a distinctive 

pattern that differs markedly from allpreviously recognized types of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD. 

<H4>Comparison with BSE</H4>

As the band intensities of protease-resistant PrP in new variant CJD differed markedly from sporadic 

and iatrogenic CJD, we investigated whether this distinctive glycoform pattern was also seen in 

naturally or experimentally transmitted BSE. First, we compared transmissions of BSE and CJD to 

the same inbred mice. Comparative transmission data in transgenic mice was not available as BSE 

has not transmitted, to date, to HuPrP<sup>+/+</sup> <i>Prn-p</i><sup>0/0</sup> mice (500 days 

post-inoculation). The glycoform ratios seen in CJD transmissions to wild-type FVB mice were 

indistinguishable from those of the three types of CJD <a href="www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=87614824&CAT=NatGen&PG=collinge/fig5.html">(Fig. 5b)</a>. However, 

BSE transmission into both wild-type FVB and C57BL mice resulted in ratios that were closely 

similar to those of new variant CJD. 

Similarly, band sizes of protease-resistant PrP seen on transmission of BSE to wild-type mice were 

shifted to a lower <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> as compared to type 2 CJD transmission (data not shown). 

We then studied naturally transmitted BSE in the domestic cat (feline spongiform 

encephalopathy<sup>26</sup>) and experimental BSE in a macaque<sup>27</sup>. These cases 

also closely resembled new variant CJD and experimental murine BSE. BSE itself was not detectable on western blots using the 3F4 

monoclonal or R073 polyclonal antibody. However, a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal was detected from 

homogenates of brainstem from naturally infected BSE using a rabbit antibody to a synthetic human 

PrP peptide (95-108) (provided by B. Ghetti) and the pattern of the glycoforms (51.2% high 

<i>M</i><sub>r</sub>, 33.9% low <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>, 14.9% unglycosylated) was closely 

similar to transmitted BSE and new variant CJD. This antibody also detected PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from 

domestic cat, macaque and humans, producing similar results to R073 and 3F4 antisera (data not 

shown). 
<H4>Discussion</H4>

Sporadic and iatrogenic CJD seems to be related to the production of three distinct types of human 

PrP<sup>Sc</sup> which can be differentiated on western blots after proteolytic cleavage by their 

differing band sizes. Types 1 and 2 are associated with different clinicopathological phenotypes of 

sporadic CJD<sup>23</sup>, and type 3 is seen in cases of iatrogenic CJD where exposure to prions 

has been via a peripheral route (intramuscular injection of human cadaveric pituitary-derived 

hormones) rather than by a direct central nervous system (CNS) route (dura mater grafting). It is well 

recognized that such peripherally acquired cases have a distinct phenotype, presenting with cerebellar 

ataxia and psychiatric disturbance rather than as a dementing illness<sup>28</sup>. Iatrogenic CJD 

resulting from CNS exposure typically resembles classical sporadic CJD<sup>28</sup>. New variant 

CJD, while it has PrP<sup>Sc</sup> band sizes similar to type-3 CJD, can be clearly distinguished 

from all three types of CJD by a characteristic pattern of band intensities. This distinctive molecular 

marker, which clearly differentiates new variant CJD from sporadic CJD, serves to support the 

proposal, on the basis of comparative clinicopathological studies and epidemiological 

surveillance<sup>21</sup>, that new variant CJD is a distinct and new subtype of prion disease, 

related to a previously unrecognized prion strain. The spontaneous occurrence of a novel human 

PrP<sup>Sc</sup> type, that is the same in twelve individuals in the United Kingdom, over the last 

two years, seems extraordinarily unlikely as an explanation for 'new variant' CJD. The alternative 

conclusion is that these cases have arisen from a common source of exposure to a new prion strain, 

and the lack of any history of common iatrogenic exposure indicates that this is probably a new 

animal strain. That the glycoform 'signature' of new variant CJD is seen in BSE itself, in experimental 

murine BSE (whereas CJD transmission to these types of mice produces the CJD 'signature') and in 

naturally transmitted BSE in domestic cat and experimental BSE in macaque, is consistent with the 

hypothesis that new variant CJD results from BSE transmission to humans. Transmission studies of 

new variant CJD in HuPrP<sup>+/+</sup> <i>Prn-p</i><sup>0/0</sup> mice are in progress; it will 

be of interest to compare incubation periods and patterns of neuropathology with other CJD 

transmissions (which are also currently under investigation). PrP<sup>Sc</sup> typing will be of 

immediate application in wider epidemiological studies of CJD. It is possible that BSE could produce 

other clinicopathogical phenotypes in humans, particularly in different age groups and different ethnic 

populations, that are not recognized as new variant CJD. Furthermore, this method may also allow 

typing of various animals to see if BSE has also transmitted naturally to these species. There is 

particular concern that BSE may have transmitted to, and be surviving in, the sheep 

population<sup>29</sup>. Typing of known scrapie strains which pre-dated the BSE epidemic, and 

recent isolates, will be important in this regard. 
<P>
&#009;This molecular marker can already be used in differential diagnosis of new variant CJD. New 

variant CJD is atypical both in its clinical features and electroencephalogram, such that diagnosis is 

dependent on neuropathology, either at autopsy or in some cases on brain biopsy. However, although 

the brain biopsy may demonstrate spongiform encephalopathy and PrP immunoreactivity adequate for 

a diagnosis of CJD, the characteristic neuropathological features necessary for a diagnosis of new 

variant CJD may not be present in the biopsy sample<sup>21</sup>. As PrP is expressed in the 

lymphoreticular system, and prion replication occurs in spleen and in other lymphoreticular 

tissues<sup>30</sup>, it may be possible to detect this molecular marker of new variant CJD in 

tonsil<sup>31</sup> or lymph-node biopsy and thereby avoid brain biopsy. 

 

<P> 

&#009;The aetiology of sporadic CJD remains unclear but may involve somatic <I>PRNP</I> 

mutations or spontaneous conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> as a rare stochastic 

event. Sporadic CJD is associated with type-1 or type-2 PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Type 1 is always 

associated with genotype MM, type 2 with all genotypes (MM, MV or VV). Type 3 is seen in 

iatrogenic CJD of genotype MV or VV. Only human PrP M129 seems to form type-1 

PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, whereas either human PrP M129 or human PrP V129 can produce type-2 

PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. As type-3 PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is only seen in MV or VV individuals, it is possible 

that only human PrP V129 can form this type. As type-3 PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is seen in peripherally 

acquired iatrogenic CJD cases, it is possible that this strain is selected in or preferentially produced by 

the lymphoreticular system, where prion replication first occurs in the experimentally transmitted 

disease in mice<sup>32</sup>. If such a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> type were formed preferentially from 

human PrP V129, this could explain the excess of the <I>PRNP</I> codon-129 VV genotype among 

pituitary-hormone related CJD cases<sup>19,20,33</sup>. Further studies will be required to 

determine whether the type-3 pattern is a consistent marker of peripheral, as opposed to central, prion 

exposure or sporadic CJD. It is of note, however, that similar band sizes are seen in the type 4 (new 

variant CJD) pattern (which are of <I>PRNP</I> genotype MM), which seems to have arisen by 

peripheral (presumably dietary) exposure to bovine prions. The formation of particular 

PrP<sup>Sc</sup> types seems to be constrained by host <I>PRNP</I> codon-129 genotype. This 

finding is supported by the observation that type-1 PrP<sup>Sc</sup> converts to type 2 on passage 

in transgenic mice expressing the human PrP gene encoding valine at residue 129, whereas types 2 

and 3 remain unchanged on such passage. 

 

<P> 

&#009;The different types of human PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are seen in association with distinct 

clinicopathological phenotypes of CJD, and can be maintained on passage in mice, which indicates 

that these represent distinct human prion strains. The finding that strains appear to involve different 

post-translational modifications of PrP, which persist or (when PrP genotypes are mismatched) can be 

predictably converted between discrete strains on passage in mice, is consistent with a protein-only 

model of prion propagation in which strains are encoded by post-translational modification of PrP 

itself without the need for a nucleic acid or other cofactor. The bands seen on western analysis of PrP 

following proteolytic cleavage represent diglycosylated, monoglycosylated (at either of the two N-

linked glycosylation sites) and unglycosylated PrP, and two separate features of these bands, shifts in 

mobility and differences in relative intensities, seem to be associated with strain type. The mobility 

shifts after cleavage, seen in all three bands, imply different PrP conformations (which may include 

differing states of assembly). The differences in glycoform ratios could indicate preferential 

conversion of particular glycoforms into particular conformational states. It has been argued that 

differing PrP glycosylation in different brain regions could provide a mechanism for the targeting of 

neuropathology seen with different strain types, as prions may replicate most efficiently in cell 

populations expressing a similarly glycosylated PrP on the cell surface<sup>34</sup>. Both PrP 

conformation and glycosylation may contribute to strain type but further studies will be required to 

investigate whether these two post-translational modifications of PrP can contribute to strain type 

independently, or are coupled phenomena. 

<H4>Selection and molecular genetic analysis of patients. </H4>
Twenty-six neuropathologically 

confirmed sporadic CJD cases including all three codon-129 genotypes, seven neuropathologically 

confirmed iatrogenic CJD cases and ten neuropathogically confirmed new variant CJD cases referred 

to the National CJD Surveillance Unit or the Prion Disease Group, from which frozen brain tissue was 

available, were studied. Brain samples used were from the cerebral cortex, usually frontal cortex. 

DNA was extracted from blood or brain tissue and analysed for the presence of known or new coding 

mutations in the prion protein gene (<I>PRNP</I>) and to determine codon-129 genotype. In 8 of 10 

new variant CJD and the majority of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD patients, the complete 

<I>PRNP</I> open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 

oligonucleotide primers chosen so as not to overlay an intron polymorphism 5' to the open reading 

frame, which can lead to non-amplification of certain alleles, as described previously<sup>35</sup>. 

The PCR product was size-fractionated in agarose gels to exclude insertional or deletional mutations, 

and were then sequenced on both DNA strands using an ABI 373 or 377 automated DNA sequencer 

(Applied Biosystems). 
<H4>Western blot analysis.</H4>
 Between 10 and 20 mg of brain tissue was homogenized in lysis 

buffer (0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate buffered saline) by serial passage 

through needles of decreasing diameter. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 

r.p.m. for 5 min. Proteinase K (BDH) was added to a final concentration of 50 &#18;gml<sup>-

1</sup> and the samples incubated at 37 &#186;C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the 

addition of Pefabloc (Boehringer) to 1 mM. The samples were mixed with twice the volume of SDS 

loading buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) and 

boiled for 10 min. They were then centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. in a microfuge for 5 min before 

electrophoresis. Between 1 and 10 l of sample was electroporesed on 16% Tris-glycine gels 

(Novex)<sup>36</sup>. The gels were then electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Millipore) using 

either a tank or semi-dry blotting system. The membranes were blocked in 5% BLOTTO (5% non-fat 

milk powder in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. No single antibody detects 

all species studied efficiently. After washing in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes 

were incubated with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 (ref. 38) (diluted 1:5,000 in PBST), rabbit 

polyclonal antibody R073 (ref. 39) (diluted 1:10,000 in PBST), or rabbit anti-human PrP peptide (95-

108) (diluted 1:20,000) (from B. Ghetti) for between 1 h and overnight. After washing, the membrane 

was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) or goat 

anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBST for 1 h. The membranes were washed 

again in PBST and developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham) using Biomax 

MR film (Kodak). 
<H4>Deglycosylation of prion proteins.</H4>
 A portion (25 &#181;l) of 10% brain homogenate, pre-

treated with proteinase K, was denatured in 0.5% SDS, 1% -mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 

&#186;C. NP-40 was added to 1% and the proteins were incubated in 500 units PNGaseF (New 

England Biolabs), using the proprietary buffer, at 37 &#186;C for 2 h. After digestion, proteins were 

precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol and resuspended in SDS loading buffer and western blotted. 
<H4>Quantitation of PrP glycoform ratios. </H4>
Blots were scanned on a Hoefer scanning densitometer 

(model GS300) and the relative amounts of the different glycoforms were obtained by computerized 

integration of peaks representing each of the three distinct bands. Scanning was done on exposures 

within the linear range of the photographic film. 

<H4>Transmission studies in transgenic and non-transgenic mice.</H4>
 Strict biosafety methods were 

followed. Transgenic mice expressing human PrP were bred and maintained in an animal 

microbiological containment level I facility and moved to a containment level II facility where 

intracerebral inoculation was performed in a class I microbiological safety cabinet. Preparation of 

inocula and removal of tissues were done in a microbiological containment level III facility. All mice 

were examined twice weekly for the development of clinical signs of scrapie. At onset of signs, mice 

were examined daily. Mice were killed if exhibiting any signs of distress. Criteria for clinical 

diagnosis of scrapie in mice were as described previously<sup>40</sup>. Transgenic lines expressing 

human PrP but not murine PrP were established by breeding mice transgenic for human PrP 

(designated Tg152, produced as described previously) with mice homozygous for PrP null 

alleles<sup>41</sup>. All mice were genotyped to confirm the presence of the HuPrP transgene or 

PrP null alleles by PCR with genomic DNA obtained by tail biopsy, as described<sup>42</sup>. 

Tg152 mice have expression levels of human PrP of 200% of that seen in normal human 

brain<sup>42</sup>. Mice were anaesthetised with halothane/O<sub>2</sub> and intracerebrally 

inoculated into the right parietal lobe with 30 &#181;l of a 1% brain homogenate in phosphate-

buffered saline.

 Reuter Information Service

<P>    BRUSSELS (Oct 9, 1996T) - Mad cow disease will probably still be around five years from now but the number of cases will be much lower, a leading expert hired by the European Commission said on Wednesday.
    Professor Charles Weissmann of Zurich University, who chaired a group of experts to look into research priorities, called for more work to determine whether the brain-wasting disease can be transmitted to humans and for development of a test for the disease on live animals and humans.<P>

    "I think it is pretty clear that it (mad cow disease) will diminish very considerably but whether it will go back to zero or whether there will be a low endemic level I don't think I would venture to predict," Weissmann told a news conference.<P>

    Speaking after presenting a report to EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler, Weissmann said that there were doubts about a report by Oxford University in England in August predicting that the disease would die out within five years and that an extra cull of cattle at risk to the disease was unnecessary.<P>

    "I am not quite sure that one can say that if all the sources of contaminated feed are eliminated that the disease will completely disappear," Weissmann said.
    Animal feed containing suspect tissue, such as ground up meat and bone meal, is believed to be the main source of the disease, known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
    But Weissmann said more research was needed into how the disease could be passed from cows to calves and whether there were any hidden infectious agents.<P>

    On the link between BSE and its fatal human equivalent, Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, experiments should be carried out on similar species to humans, such as monkeys, by giving them them increasing amounts of infected feed.

10.10.96 Nature News
<P>

 Scientific understanding of the  
epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in British cattle has been delayed by  
the reluctance of the UK  
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) to provide access to data, according to  
UK scientists. This reluctance, they say, has stemmed both from a 'culture of secrecy' at the  
ministry, and its failure to dedicate sufficient staff to analysing and  
distributing data on the epidemic. 
<p>
Direct evidence of secrecy at MAFF comes from the uphill struggle faced by Roy Anderson,  
professor of zoology at the  
University of Oxford, and his colleagues, in gaining access to the confidential MAFF  
statistics needed to produce their recent analysis of the transmission dynamics and  
epidemiology of the BSE epidemic (see Nature 382, 787; 1996).  
<p>
Indeed, <I>Nature</I> has learnt that MAFF agreed to make the statistics available only after  
senior officials at the Royal Society put pressure on government ministers, arguing that a  
credible analysis of MAFF data could be done only by independent experts.  
<p>
Anderson's study was designed to estimate the number of infected cattle that may have  
entered the food chain undetected because they were slaughtered before showing clinical  
symptoms of BSE, and the  
efficiency of various culling policies designed to reduce the incidence of BSE. Both analyses  
required raw data on individual farms and the demography of herds, which -- according to  
several sources -- MAFF initially refused to provide.  
<p>
"It was pretty clear that MAFF were scared about the outcome," says one scientist involved in  
the lengthy negotiations,  
suggesting that this was because the data would suggest -- as they did -- that many more sick  
animals had entered the food chain than was previously thought. MAFF eventually backed  
down and released the data, he says, after it had been persuaded that an independent  
epidemiological analysis of the BSE analysis was needed, given that Britain's European  
partners would be sceptical if this were done by MAFF, which would be perceived as having  
a vested interest in the outcome -- only in this way would other European countries be  
convinced that the study had been carried out "scientifically and properly". 
<p>
Anderson declines to comment on this account of events. And a ministry spokeswoman  
dismisses allegations that it has been overly secretive, claiming that access to data is  
permitted within agreed collaborative  
projects. Requests for data that are readily available are met automatically, she says. Those  
for data that are more difficult to compile must be made through a more  
formal written procedure that includes a fee calculated on the basis of the amount and type of  
data required, and a <I>pro rata</I> charge for the salary costs needed to prepare it.  
<p>
The spokeswoman last week promised that scientists can obtain all the data they need "as  
long as we deem it possible, and as long as the data doesn't infringe on the confidentiality of  
individual farmers or the data protection act". She declined to provide a copy of the detailed  
procedures for obtaining data, however, on the grounds that they had to be formally applied  
for through  
so-called 'open government' channels.  
<p>
Not everyone has had problems. Several researchers acknowledge that MAFF has been  
helpful in providing relatively small sets of data. They point out that aggregated information  
has been made available, while MAFF's Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL) in Weybridge  
has regularly published epidemiological studies. Similarly, Heino Diringer, a researcher at the  
Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, says that while he has never asked MAFF for statistical data,  
he has not encountered problems in obtaining other information. 
<p>
But one scientist who has had difficulty obtaining data from MAFF complains of a "culture  
of confidentiality" among government ministries, and MAFF in particular. "This has worked  
to the detriment of the understanding [of the BSE epidemic] and dissemination of information  
in general," he says, pointing out that the health and  
environment ministries have better track records "in terms of being open and involving  
scientists from outside government".  
<p>
"It has been a nightmare to get hold of comprehensive data," says John Kent, a  
statistician at the University of Leeds, adding that "not having the numbers more easily  
available has made life difficult". Kent is keen that MAFF should now make widely available  
the data used in the Anderson study so that they can be critically assessed. 
<p>
Anderson agrees that this is necessary. But he points out that the database is not his to give,  
and that scientists must request it from MAFF. Mark Savey, a leading French epidemiologist  
working on BSE, says he has been given assurances by MAFF scientists that he will be given  
access to the particular datasets he wants. 
<p>
Allegations of excessive secrecy within MAFF are confirmed by one MAFF scientist  
involved in BSE research. He says that while wider access to data on BSE might not have had  
much practical impact on the  
handling of the epidemic, MAFF's lack of openness has been "deplorable". "There is a  
general principle of not wanting to give the data to anybody. But then the political pressure  
became so great that it had to be given to the Anderson group," he says. "We shouldn't have  
been able to withhold data."  
<p>
The MAFF spokeswoman defends the ministry's actions, however, arguing that its BSE  
database contains confidential  
information on individual farms, whose release is forbidden by current government policy;  
such databases must also respect the provisions of data protection legislation. 
<p>
Anderson agrees that these factors are important. But he says that they are not insurmountable  
obstacles to the release of data, pointing out that the databases relating to the AIDS epidemic  
were made available to the entire scientific community "for analysis and interpretation".  
<p>
Similarly, the spokeswoman argues that the general release of data could be misleading in the  
wrong hands. This view is supported by several scientists. "You can't make primary data  
widely available because it's too complicated," says one. "You need to first make a  
synthesis." Uncontrolled release of data could cause more problems than it solves, he says,  
through misinterpretation by both scientists and the press. 
<p>
There is general agreement that complex databases should not simply be made freely  
available, as their proper exploitation requires an understanding of how the data have been  
assembled, and the various caveats they contain. But many scientists say that analogous  
problems in other areas -- such as census data -- are overcome by employing individuals to  
provide such  
assistance. The CVL would need an extra dozen people to do this, says one MAFF  
scientist. "It would take a lot of resources, but I think it would be well worth doing." 
<p>
Indeed, MAFF's failure to assign sufficient staff to the analysis and distribution of BSE data  
appears to have been a major  
factor contributing to the difficulties faced by outside scientists. Graham Medley, a  
biostatistician at the University of Warwick, says he has benefited from greater cooperation  
from MAFF after having complained on a television programme about the problems of  
gaining access to MAFF data. Since then he has encountered few such difficulties, and  
attributes any that have arisen simply to the fact that the CVL is "inundated" with requests,  
and is "grossly understaffed". 
<p>
Statistical research on the BSE epidemic within MAFF has been left mainly to a handful of  
researchers at the CVL. The small numbers of people involved is  
"staggering for a problem of this importance", says one scientist. Anderson says that, given  
the scale of the BSE problem, MAFF should have quickly assembled "a large and effective  
team collaborating with external teams with expertise in particular areas", and that this should  
have included researchers from other European countries. 
<p>
Moreover, Anderson argues that cutbacks in government science over the past decade have  
made such external input more important than ever. These cuts have reduced the  
government's capacity to carry out the in-house research required to deal with complex  
scientific issues in many areas, he says. What is now needed, argues Anderson, is an  
interministerial body -- perhaps organized by the Office of Science and Technology -- that  
would assess important scientific issues, decide whether outside expertise was needed, and, if  
so, arrange for it to be brought in quickly.

 <H3><CENTER>UK medical chief <A NAME="suggests">suggests</A> 'safe' does not mean 'no risk' </CENTER></H3>

Nature News - 3 October 1996
 The chief medical officer of the UK's Department of Health -- currently embroiled in 
political controversy over whether British beef is safe to eat -- has suggested standardizing 
the way in which risks are described to the public on a scale based on their severity.  
<p>
Kenneth Calman proposes in his annual report, published last week, that the word 'safe' 
should, if used, "be seen to mean negligible" -- itself defined as "an adverse event occurring 
at a frequency below one per million". It should not, he adds, "imply no, or zero, risk". 
<p>
Such a definition of negligible risk would, for example, include the chances of dying from 
being hit by lightning, or from the radiation released by a nuclear power station. It would 
also, on the basis of the most recent scientific evidence, include the chances of contracting 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by eating meat infected with bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE). 
<p>
Calman's suggestions are put forward in a section of his report on "topics of particular 
importance". They are, he says, an attempt to "present a vocabulary for debate", adding that 
the perception of risk by the individual is "the most interesting but most difficult aspect of 
understanding risk". 
<p>
He proposes dividing events into six categories, based on the chances of each occurring to an 
individual within any one year. These start with events of "high risk", where the risk estimate 
is considered to be greater than one in 100, and descend in a series of steps through 
"moderate", "low", "very low", and "minimal" to "negligible" risk, each encompassing events 
whose likelihood is an order of magnitude smaller than those in the previous category. 
<p>
Calman acknowledges that any classification of a particular risk needs to be qualified by 
other words that may be equally important. These include whether the risk is avoidable or 
unavoidable; whether it is justifiable; whether it is acceptable or unacceptable (the latter 
meaning that it "would not be tolerated except for special reasons -- such as the use of 
unproven medical treatment as a therapy of last resort"); and whether the risk is "serious". 
<p>
His categorization of risk has received a sceptical response from some public-interest and 
environmentalist groups. While acknowledging the importance of a more rational approach, 
these are concerned that events with any danger attached should not be officially labelled as 
'safe' -- even if the risks are less than one in a million. 
<p>
But Calman's scheme has, in general, been welcomed by industrial representatives such as 
those from the pharmaceutical industry, frustrated at what they argue to be the public's 
inability to distinguish the relative dangers posed by different kinds of risks. Britain's beef 
industry, for example, has slumped in the wake of the BSE scare, even though only about a 
dozen cases of CJD have been linked to 'mad cow disease' -- in a human population of almost 
60 million.

<H3><CENTER>Swiss cull to <A NAME="meet">meet</A> fears of BSE</CENTER></H3>

Nature News - 26 September 1996
 Switzerland's government announced last week that it has decided to subsidize the 
slaughter of 230,000 cows born before 1 December 1990 to restore the faith of consumers in 
Swiss beef. Feeding calves with animal protein, considered to be responsible for transmitting 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was legal until 1990. 
<p>
Farmers will receive SFr1,000 (US$800) compensation for each cow slaughtered, and their 
use for human consumption will be banned. "This move is intended to restore to Switzerland 
the status of a BSE-free country," said the economics minister, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. 
<p>
BSE has already caused a serious economic problem for Swiss farmers. The domestic market 
has fallen by a third since the beginning of the year, leading to reduced beef prices and the 
decision to store large quantities of meat. Foreign markets have also been blocked, as the 
European Union -- of which Switzerland is not a member -- has banned the import of Swiss 
beef. The ban followed an announcement in March by the British government of a possible 
link between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in younger patients.  
<p>
Switzerland has the second highest incidence of BSE in Europe, although, at 9.5 cases per 
100,000 cattle, this is only one-hundredth of the UK level. "We intend to remove from the 
human food chain the entire cattle population which has a statistical chance of harbouring 
BSE-infected animals," says Heinz Mueller, a spokesman for the federal veterinary agency. 
<p>
According to Mueller, the recent study by Roy Anderson and his colleagues at the University 
of Oxford showing that culling is likely to have only a limited impact on the extinction of 
BSE in the United Kingdom (see Nature 382, 779; 1996) is not relevant to Switzerland, as the 
objectives of the two countries are very different. "We want to rebuild trust in Swiss beef as 
soon as possible," he says. 
<p>
The remains of Swiss cows born before 1990 will be used in animal feed given to pigs. But 
this is likely to cause problems. The two leading supermarket chains, Migros and Coop, 
announced last month that, in order to restore public trust in their products, they will stop 
selling meat from any species that is raised on feed containing animal protein.

<H3><CENTER>BSE experiment on <A NAME="monkeys">monkeys</A> 'a waste of time' </CENTER></H3>

The Times: Britain: October 10 1996<BR>
 CHARLES BREMNER AND LEYLA LINTON IN BRUSSELS<BR>

A LEADING European expert yesterday cast doubts on British forecasts that "mad cow" disease would die out soon and called for long-term tests using monkeys to establish whether it can be transmitted to human beings. A British scientist who has already transmitted BSE to monkeys said the experiment would be a waste of time.

<P>

After a year-long study ordered by the European Commission, Charles Weissmann of Zurich University said there were reasons to doubt the prediction by Oxford scientists that BSE would fall to negligible levels in about five years. "I am not quite sure that one can say that if all the sources of contaminated feed are eliminated that the disease will completely disappear," he said. The Government cited the Oxford forecast as the main reason for its decision last month to suspend a selected slaughter of cattle that was agreed in Florence last June.

<P>

Professor Weissmann said it appeared likely that BSE was transmissible to people through the consumption of beef. "The evidence we so far have is sufficiently suggestive of this transmission from cattle to man that we should act as though it were true."

<P>

The best way of establishing the facts was to start experiments in which monkeys would be fed increasing doses of BSE-infected tissue, the professor said. The long incubation time meant that the tests would have to be run over ten years. Monkeys were the best means because the "species barrier" was lower between humans and primates than any other animals. "The answer is that it will not be conclusive, but it is the best we can do under the circumstances," he said.

<P>

Ross Ridley, who works for the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, showed several years ago that BSE could be passed in the laboratory to marmoset monkeys by injecting infected material directly into their brains. This is thousands of times more effective as a route for infection than oral ingestion.

<P>

"Both the marmosets we inoculated developed brain disease after about four years," she said. "Subsequent comparisons have shown a resemblance to the pathology seen in human victims of the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."

<P>

Ms Ridley said she could see no point in the European experiment. "Once you have established what amount is needed, are you going to say that smaller doses do not matter? We have no way of translating a dose that is effective for a monkey into one that is effective for a human."

<P>

She added: "We have already shown that BSE can be transmitted to monkeys and hence that humans, if they ate enough, may also be able to get the disease. We have to assume that no dose of BSE is safe."

<H3><CENTER>Mad cow politics tries to <A NAME="corral">corral</A> science</CENTER></H3>

Nature News - 19 September 1996
<P>
 Science was this week once again called to the aid of politicians in Europe's 'mad cow' 
crisis, when the British government asked the European Commission to revise a previous 
agreement under which Britain would reduce the incidence of bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE) by culling 127,000 cattle.

<P>
The UK government has been reviewing the cull following the publication of an analysis 
suggesting that the epidemic phase of BSE would end around 2001 without any culling, and 
that, given the aetiology of the disease and uncertainty about which cattle are infected, its 
decline would not be greatly accelerated by any culling policy short of the slaughter of 
around a quarter of the 10 million cattle in the national herd. 

<P>
But the interpretation of this analysis, which also puts estimated numbers on the level of 
infected cattle remaining in British herds, has also become a centre of controversy, with 
others contesting the claim that it undermines demands for a broad cull. 
<p>
Speaking at a meeting of European Union (EU) farm ministers on Monday (16 September), 
Douglas Hogg, the UK agriculture minister, said that the paper concerned showed that "BSE 
will in any event die out in 2000 or 2001", and that there was no culling policy that "would 
make a substantial difference to the rate of decline".
<p>
The cull was originally agreed to by John Major, the prime minister, at the European Union 
summit in Florence in June, as the price to pay for an eventual lifting of the EU ban on the 
export of UK beef products. But Major needs parliamentary approval before the cull can go 
ahead, and this looks increasingly unlikely, given growing opposition among Tory members 
of Parliament.
<p>
There is also uncertainty about how the opposition Labour party will vote (opposing the cull 
would also win votes among farmers). With the prospect of an immediate lifting of the ban 
seeming increasingly remote, Major seems to be gambling on satisfying domestic interests at 
the risk of inflaming other EU governments, by demanding that the cull be reduced or 
abandoned.
<p>
The government is relying on the results of a study published by Roy Anderson, professor of 
zoology at the University of Oxford, and both academic colleagues and scientists working for 
the UK Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF). They used sophisticated 
modelling techniques and previously confidential MAFF statistics to analyse the transmission 
dynamics and epidemiology of BSE (see Nature 382, 787; 1996). They also compared the 
'efficiency' of 14 different culling strategies, defined by the number of cases they eliminate 
for the total number of cattle culled.
<p>
But the European Commission disputes that the results undermine arguments in favour of the 
planned cull. The paper's estimates of the "efficiency" of various culling strategies -- in terms 
of how many cattle need to be killed to get rid of BSE cases -- are of no interest to the 
commission, says Gerard Kiely, a spokesman for Franz Fischler, the agriculture 
commissioner. "Whether it is 10,000 or 2 million cattle is irrelevant to us; what is relevant is 
reducing BSE [cases] as fast as possible," he says. 
<p>
In contrast, Kiely argues that new evidence of maternal transmission of BSE -- which, as 
previously announced, has been submitted to <I>Nature</I> -- could, in fact, require an 
enlargement of the cull. The commission is open to reviewing the culling policy to take into 
account such data, he says, as it would allow "taking out more cases of BSE".
<p>
Like other critics, Kiely also points out that interpretations of the Anderson paper other than 
that of the British government are possible, and that the evaluation of the various culling 
strategies could similarly justify not a reduction but an extension of the planned cull. 
According to the Anderson paper, the agreed cull of 127,000 cattle would eliminate 1,580 
cases of BSE. But by adding a maternally targeted policy and killing 150,000 cattle, 2,380 
cases would be eliminated. "I think many member states would say that is the one we need," 
says Kiely.
<p>
Some scientists are also concerned that the British government has selected an interpretation 
of the paper that suits its political needs -- reinforcing the view that governments tend to 
accept scientific advice when it suits them and to reject it when it does not. 
<p>
Mark Savey, a leading French epidemiologist on BSE, and a member of the BSE working 
group of the European Commission's scientific veterinary committee, also argues that the 
rapid interpretation given to the findings raises the wider problem of what he claims is 
insufficient discussion of research results in the BSE crisis.
<p>
"Non-scientists think that when a paper is published in a prestigious journal, it is the 
indisputable single truth -- that the matter is settled," says Savey. "But publication is only the 
first step; there is no paper in the BSE crisis that will close the discussion, and we will be 
discussing this disease for another decade."
<p>
In support of his arguments, Savey points out that much of the current literature focuses on 
the 'epidemic phase' of the disease. "It is a very British way of looking at things," he says. 
The British "say that BSE will be finished as an epidemic in 2001. What they don't say is that 
the disease will not have disappeared completely."
<p>
The scientific issue is to know whether the disease will remain sporadic, and how will this be 
handled, he says, pointing out that low levels of the disease in France has been enough to 
panic consumers. In a sporadic phase, BSE might evolve to find other routes of transmission, 
he warns, adding that the scientific community needs to "start thinking now" about these 
problems. 
<p>
Savey also argues that, whereas the Anderson paper is "absolutely superb", the scientific 
aspects of the cull are merely one consideration. While scientific advice may influence 
culling policy, it would be simplistic to believe it should determine it, he says, arguing that 
this can only be done by also taking into account political, economic and other factors.
<p>
Certainly science, up to now, has had little to do with the decision to cull UK cattle. The cull 
was agreed by EU member states largely as a means of restoring public confidence in beef. 
But from the outset it has been opposed as lacking scientific justification by many scientific 
advisory bodies, including the British government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory 
Committee (SEAC) and the World Organization for Animal Health. 
<p>
Some British researchers argue, however, that the confirmation that any cull short of a 
massacre would not eradicate BSE any faster than doing nothing only lends weight to 
existing scientific criticism of the cull. "I suppose that is what the government is looking at, 
and I think the science supports it," says one of the paper's authors.
<p>
The epidemic should be allowed to die out naturally, given that precautions have been taken 
by abattoirs to prevent infected animals entering the food chain, says Ray Bradley, a MAFF 
scientist who is a member of SEAC and also chairman of the BSE working group of the 
European Commission's scientific veterinary committee. "The cull has no scientific basis," he 
says baldly. "It is only there to appease the other member states of EU."

<H3><CENTER>BSE pre-dates rendering <A NAME="changes">changes</A></CENTER></H3>
Nature News - 11 July 1996
<P>
 The bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic pre-dates changes to Britain's 
rendering industry, according to new research published this week. Until now, the UK agriculture 
ministry has attributed BSE to rendering methods introduced in the 1980s. 
<p>
The ministry has said that the new methods allowed the scrapie infective agent in sheep offal to 
survive and infect cows with BSE via cattle feed. But the results of new experiments funded in part 
by the European Union, the UK agriculture ministry and the UK's largest rendering company, 
Prosper De Mulder, shows that the scrapie agent remains active regardless of the choice of rendering 
method.

<H3><CENTER>Statistics suggest BSE <A NAME="now">now</A> Europe-wide</CENTER></H3>

Nature News - 4 July 1996
<P>

 Europe's veterinary surgeons have urged the European Union (EU) to introduce and enforce 

measures to ensure that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cannot enter the human food chain. 

Their call comes as new analyses suggest that the incidence of BSE in continental Europe is much 

higher than officially reported. 
<p>
EU member states in continental Europe have declared a total of around 50 cases of BSE. But some 

researchers estimate that these countries ought to have declared more than 2,000 cases, given that they 

imported large quantities of breeding cattle and potentially contaminated meat and bone meal from the 

United Kingdom
<p>
One explanation for this discrepancy, say observers, is that farmers may have been discouraged from 

reporting cases because many countries slaughter herds where BSE has occurred without adequately 

compensating farmers. 
<p>
These estimates of the number of BSE cases in continental Europe are nonetheless an order of 

magnitude lower than in the United Kingdom, where around 160,000 cases have been reported. It 

follows that any impact on human health would be correspondingly lower, even if it was established that 

the agent that causes BSE can pass to humans and cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Experts also 

point out that most of the BSE cases in continental Europe will already have entered the food chain.
<p>
Nevertheless, at a meeting in Paris last month, the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FEV) 

acknowledged the BSE crisis is now a "European problem" -- and not just a British one -- according to 

one official present. Tougher European measures to protect public health are needed, he argues.
<p>
He points out that, until last week, when France banned the human consumption of specified bovine 

offals (SBO) -- the most infective parts, such as brain and spinal cord , 

the United Kingdom had been the only EU country to have done so. (Switzerland, which is not a 

member of the EU, had introduced a similar ban.)
<p>
To reassure consumers, "it must be demonstrated beyond any doubt that BSE cannot enter the food 

chain", says Francis Antony, president of FEV and the British Veterinary Association's spokesman on 

BSE. In a statement last week, FEV called on the EU to "design, apply and enforce" a comprehensive 

food hygiene programme "from the stable to the table".
<p>
"Consumer perception and the scientific reality of food safety are too far apart," says one FEV official. 

"The key issue is about keeping brain and spinal cord out of the food chain." Indeed, the FEV statement 

seems a thinly veiled attack on what one official says is the EU's excessive focus on the culling of UK 

cattle. 
<p>
Although culling will precipitate the decline of the epidemic in cattle, it will have little direct impact on 

human health, argues one FEV official. Eliminating risk to public health requires a ban on the human 

consumption of SBOs and strict enforcement of deboning and denerving procedures in abattoirs to 

eliminate infective tissues. 
<p>
The EU also needs to ensure that adequate resources are made available to enforce any new regulations, 

says one FEV official. The failure of the United Kingdom to police its early feed and SBO bans has 

shown that "you can ban things until you are blue in the face", but without proper enforcement this has 

little impact.
<p>
The revised estimates of cases of BSE in mainland EU states come from analyses of UK exports of 

animal feed and live cattle. Experts predict that imported feed may have resulted in several hundred 

cases of BSE. But the total is difficult to estimate precisely because the final destination and use of feed 

are often unknown, while the relationship between tonnage and infectivity is difficult to establish, 

according to John Wilesmith, of the UK Ministry of Agriculture's Central Veterinary Laboratory in 

Weybridge. 
<p>
Better estimates may come from analysis of UK exports of breeding cattle. One group of researchers has 

estimated, for example, that the United Kingdom exported 57,900 pure-bred breeding bovines between 

1985 and 1990, the latter being the year after the EU banned imports of breeding animals older than six 

months. 
<p>
One of the scientists, B. E. C. Schreuder from the DLO-Institute for Animal Science and Health in 

Lelystad, the Netherlands, says that, statistically, around 1,700 of these animals would be expected to 

have developed BSE.
<p>
Such estimates must be taken with caution because of the assumptions they involve, says Schreuder. His 

estimates of total exports are somewhat higher than records of exports for "pure-bred breeding bovines" 

provided by Eurostat -- the body that supplies the European Commission with statistics -- as he has also 

included other export categories such as "bulls not intended for slaughter".
<p>
Nonetheless, Schreuder is confident that their estimate of BSE cases in continental Europe attributable to 

cattle exports is of the right order of magnitude. He says it is possible to identify the individual member 

states most at risk -- Portugal, which has declared just 30 cases of BSE, is expected to top this list. 
<p>
Schreuder says that his warning of under-reporting is mainly aimed at countries where lack of regulation 

might yet allow recycling of BSE and new outbreaks. Wilesmith adds that better data on true BSE levels 

in continental Europe will be essential to studying the epidemiology of any cases of the new variant of 

CJD that arise there. The evidence for higher levels of BSE on the European mainland also underlines 

the need for an effective European CJD surveillance network, he says 

(see Nature 381, 453; 1996).
<p>
Wilesmith asserts that "we were lucky  there were not BSE epidemics elsewhere". The factors that led 

the United Kingdom to be worst affected, he says, probably included the world's highest ratio of sheep to 

cattle (45 million to 12 million), a high prevalence of scrapie, and the use of high proportions of meat 

and bone meal in cattle feed.
<p>
Other countries may have escaped relatively unscathed only because they had more cattle than sheep, 

low levels of scrapie, or used less meat and bone meal in cattle feed. Indeed, a new report from the UK 

Institute of Animal Health suggests that the procedures used in many rendering plants throughout 

Europe would have been insufficient to inactivate the agent that causes BSE.

<H3><CENTER>Prion research programme <A NAME="proposed">proposed</A></CENTER></H3>

Nature News - 27 June 1996
 The European Commission has proposed setting up a ECU100-150 million (US$123-185 
million) research programme into BSE and other prion diseases. The commission raised the matter at 
the European Council meeting in Florence last weekend, and is expected to follow this up with a 
formal proposal in the near future.
<p>
The commission is asking that funding for the programme should be additional to existing 
allocations for  research, and should come from other European Union (EU) budgets. A call for 
proposals would be issued for research to characterize the agents responsible for prion diseases, and 
to reinforce clinical research on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The commission is also seeking to 
coordinate and strengthen CJD surveillance networks.
<p>
Meanwhile, the commission has also agreed to set up a multidisciplinary committee on BSE intended 
to "ensure that the scientific advice on BSE given to the commission takes into account the widest 
possible range of expertise". Members of the committee will be chosen by a seven-member steering 
group, which includes Robert Will, head of the UK National CJD Surveillance Unit.
<p>
The new committee will be only consultative, and political power remains in the hands of the 
agriculture directorate's Standing Veterinary Committee, recently criticized for allowing its 
judgement to be influenced by political factors (>see Nature 381, 353; 1996).

BSE <A NAME="transmission">transmission</A> data cause confusion
Nature News - 1 August 1996
<P>

 The possibility that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) might be transmitted from 
cattle to sheep caused widespread concern and confusion last week. Franz Fischler, the European 
Union's Agricultural Commissioner, responded to what he described as "experimental evidence" by 
calling for a ban on various sheep and other ruminant tissues entering the food chain.

Research by the UK Institute of Animal Health has found that sheep selectively bred for resistance to 
natural scrapie, a disease in the same family as BSE, could still be infected by brain extracts from 
cattle suffering from BSE. Tissues recovered from one such sheep, out of six fed the infected 
material, induced a disease in mice with incubation periods and pathology closely resembling those 
caused by direct transmission of BSE from cattle to mice.
<p>
Although the pathways of the disease seem to be different in cattle and sheep -- only sheep showed 
infectivity in the spleen -- the results have been taken to indicate a theoretical risk. Douglas Hogg, 
Britain's agriculture minister, says he is treating this with an "abundance of caution", recommending 
that sheep heads are destroyed in the same way as those of cattle. 

<P>
Chris Bostock, head of molecular biology at the institute, describes the ban as a "sensible 
precaution". But he points out that, due to the similarities between BSE and scrapie, distinguishing 
between them when diagnosing sheep may be very difficult.

But concerns that scrapie in sheep could be masking BSE have come from "people speculating", says 
Francis Anthony, a spokesman for the British Veterinary Association. 
<HR>

<H3><CENTER>BSE transmission data <A NAME="pose">pose</A> dilemma for UK scientists</CENTER></H3>

Nature News - 8 August 1996
 Preliminary research results have confirmed fears that a small proportion of cows infected with 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) can pass the disease on to their offspring, a conclusion that 
may directly affect the UK government's cattle slaughter programme. 
<p>
The reported low rate of maternal infections -- ten per cent in the offspring of BSE-infected cattle, and 
an estimated one per cent or more in the national herd -- is not expected to affect overall BSE levels. 
Those ''are falling at a rate of 40 per cent a year", according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
<p>
An announcement on maternal transmission of BSE had been expected 
(see Nature 381, 724; 1996). But its timing has fuelled further controversy in the 
United Kingdom and Brussels. Although the 12-member UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory 
Committee (SEAC) discussed the results at a meeting on 19 July, the official government announcement 
was made on 1 August, days after parliament closed for the summer. 
<p>
Opposition politicians are accusing the government of deliberately withholding the results. But Sir John 
Pattison, chairman of SEAC and vice-provost of University College London, says the time between 
SEAC's meeting and the announcement was spent reviewing the findings and drafting a statement for 
government. Pattison says SEAC assessed the data in less than two weeks. "I can't see how we could 
have acted faster."
<p>
This is the second time that SEAC has decided to release results before the scheduled completion of an 
experiment -- or, indeed, its peer-reviewed publication in the scientific literature. The first occasion, 
when preliminary results suggested an association between the consumption of BSE-infected beef and a 
new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human equivalent of BSE, helped to trigger the current beef 
crisis (see Nature 380, 273; 1996).
<p>
Francis Anthony, BSE spokesman for the British Veterinary Association, says he was "annoyed" when 
he heard that preliminary data had been released. "I believe there is a case for the scientists [conducting 
the experiments] to dig their heels in and say: 'we'll give the results when we're ready', otherwise they 
could be accused of doing bad science." 
<p>
But Anthony acknowledges SEAC's dilemma. It had to act quickly in the interests of health, while 
ensuring the accuracy of the research being publicized, "particularly as I have been urging the 
government since 1988 to outlaw breeding from the offspring of BSE-infected cattle".
<p>
Sir Richard Southwood says the decision to release early data is justified on this occasion. Southwood, 
professor of zoology at the University of Oxford, was the chairman in 1988 of the government's first 
advisory committee on BSE, whose recommendations led to the setting up of the maternal transmission 
experiments. "I know this is a thorny problem," he says. "But this is an important matter. In an ideal 
world we could wait. But science cannot operate in a vacuum from political, economic or social 
considerations."
<p>
Pattison says the results were released after SEAC members had assured themselves that waiting for 
further analysis would not have altered the thrust of the findings. "We couldn't just sit on this, and felt 
we had to tell the government. We knew that a culling policy would need to take account of maternal 
transmission," he says.
<p>
Pattison adds that, if SEAC had waited until the end of the experiments, it would have been accused of 
endangering public safety. But he acknowledges the dangers of creating an expectation among the public 
and politicians of the automatic early release of research results, and hopes it will not happen with 
further BSE-related experiments. "Peer review is absolutely critical; it is the essence of how we operate."
<p>
The latest findings come from a seven-year project begun in 1989 at the government's Central 
Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey. The research compared rates of BSE infection in the 
offspring of two groups of cattle; analysis of the results has been complicated by the fact that, at an early 
stage in the experiments, many calves were fed with potentially infected feedstuff.

Of 333 calves born to mothers with BSE, 273 had died by 14 July. Initial histological examination 
showed that 42 suffered from BSE. An equivalent group was the offspring of BSE-free cattle. Thirteen 
of these animals had developed the disease. A comprehensive analysis of all the cases would have taken 
another year.

Reuter Information Service
<P>    LONDON (Aug 29, 1996 11:41  a.m. EDT) - People have eaten more than 700,000 cattle infected with mad cow disease since the epidemic started in Britain in the 1980s, but scientists say they still do not know if this will translate into a fatal human epidemic.<


    A report published on Thursday gave the first definitive analysis of the extent of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease), but left open how many people might have been exposed.<P>

    Infected beef was distributed throughout Britain's 55-million population, so in theory nearly all meat-eaters had a chance to consume some.<P>

    But experts say consumers of burgers, sausages and meat pies ran a higher risk because of the offal content than diners on ordinary cuts of beef.

    No one knows how much infected beef a person has to eat before catching the human equivalent of BSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). Officially, the British government says it is probable but not certain that people can get the brain-ravaging illness from sausages or burgers made out of diseased cows.<P>

    Experts who worked on the report said the BSE figures were troubling, even though they show BSE will die out by 2001.

    "There's...the potential worry in looking at the number of infected animals that entered the food chain," said Christl Donnelly, a statistician at Oxford University who co-authored the report in the science journal Nature.<P>

    BSE remains a mysterious illness. Related to scrapie in sheep and CJD, it can arise naturally because of genetic mutations, but can also pass from mother to calf.

    It can also be transmitted orally. Cattle got the disease from being fed the rendered remains of sheep with scrapie.<P>

    Because scientists are not sure what the infective agent is, they cannot test for BSE or CJD. It can only be diagnosed after death with a brain autopsy. They do know that a brain protein known as a prion becomes mutated and multiplies rapidly, and at the same time holes develop in the brain.<P>

    Whatever the infective agent is, cooking does not kill it. Tests show it withstands very high temperatures over time.

    The government introduced a ban on the use of cattle brains, spinal cords and other infective parts in 1989, and gradually tightened these restrictions through last December. It also banned using animal protein to feed herbivores.<P>

    But people will still have eaten about 446,000 diseased cattle before 1989 and 283,000 more before last December, according to the report.

    "The big shock in this paper is the proportion of (infected) animals eaten before the 1989 ban," Jeffrey Almond, an expert at Reading University, told the Independent newspaper.<P>

    "The peak would have been probably about 1994 when it got up to about 10 or 15 percent (of all cattle eaten)," said Stephen Dealler, a microbiologist at Burnley Hospital in northern England who thinks up to two million people may catch CJD.

    Dealler, who has testified to parliament about his fears, says the new numbers can be used to calculate the risks. This could start with known cases of the new variant of CJD.

    "Imagine they caught their disease in 1985. We know how many cattle they ate in 1985. We can work out from there roughly how many cases of CJD to expect," he said in a telephone interview.

    Depending on how infectious BSE is, that could translate to anywhere from 1,000 cases of the new variant of CJD to two million cases, Dealler says.<P>

    Twelve people have died of the new variant of CJD, which normally strikes one in a million mostly elderly people because of its long incubation period of up to 30 years. Dealler and other scientists say this could be the tip of an iceberg.

    Dealler said he was astounded to see that government scientists co-authored the Nature report after denying for years that large numbers of BSE-infected cattle had been eaten. "They have actually at least admitted to it," he said.<HR>

<CENTER>Vets find cow <A NAME="stunner">stunner</A> could spread disease in cows</CENTER></H3>
Reuter Information Service
<P>    LONDON (Aug 29, 1996 9:36 p.m. EDT) - Captive bolt stunners used to knock out cows before they are slaughtered could spread potentially infectious brain tissue through their bodies, U.S. veterinarians said on Friday.


    Tam Garland and colleagues at Texas A&M University said their findings could mean that people are at risk of catching the human version of mad cow disease despite precautions aimed at keeping beef safe.<P>

    "We found grossly visible brain tissue in the left and right branches of the main pulmonary artery (the artery leading to the lungs) of 2.5 to five percent of cattle after slaughter," they wrote in a letter to the Lancet medical journal.

    "It is likely that prion proteins (the agent believed to carry mad cow infection) are found throughout the bodies of animals stunned for slaughter."

    Britain currently requires that slaughterhouses remove tissue considered to be infectious from all cattle carcasses. This includes the brain, spinal cord and certain organs.<P>

    But Garland said<B> current slaughter practices literally blew bits of brain throughout the cow's body.</B> Because it takes a cow several minutes to die after stunning, the pieces could be pumped into a number of organs.

    She said she thought to check for the effect because she knew people who have head traumas often turn up with brain tissue in other parts of their bodies.

    "Since it is well documented in human literature, the thought occurred to me that oh, when we stun animals we are creating head trauma," she said in a telephone interview.

    She and colleagues checked and: <B>"Oh, boy did we find it."</B><P>

    The British Meat and Livestock Commission said the findings were irrelevant because it "did not know" of any abattoir in Britain which used the stunners referred to in the study.

    The organisation, which represents slaughterhouses and meat retailers, added in a statement that the use of cattle lungs was illegal in British meat products.<P>

    Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) is epidemic in Britain but only occurs occasionally in other countries, including the United States. However, scientists say it is the probable cause of a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a fatal brain illness.<P>

    Garland said her research centred on one particular pneumatic stunner known as "The Knocker," which is used about 50 percent of the time in U.S. slaughterhouses. Her group was now investigating other slaughterhouse practices.

    Garland said she feared the only methods guaranteed not to spread brain tissue were electric stunning or Islamic halal and Jewish kosher slaughter, <B>which involve slitting the animal's throat while conscious.</b><HR>

<H3><CENTER>Mad cow epidemic will <A NAME="die">die</A> out, British experts say</CENTER></H3>
Reuter Information Service
<P>    LONDON (Aug 29, 1996 01:12  a.m. EDT) - British scientists predicted on Wednesday that the mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but admitted they still did not know how many people would get the human form of the disease from eating infected beef.


    In the "first comprehensive analysis" of the epidemic in the scientific journal Nature, the veterinarians, epidemiologists and other experts said it would be hard to get rid of the epidemic any faster without slaughtering vast numbers of cattle.<P>

    "The epidemic is in rapid decline before and without any culling. That's the good news," said Christl Donnelly, a statistician at Oxford University who worked on the study.

    "But there's also the potential worry in looking at the number of infected animals that entered the food chain."<P>

    Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) decimated British cattle herds in the 1980s. Scientists decided it was caused by feeding cows the rendered remains of sheep that had scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease.

    They eventually banned this type of feed and introduced rules to keep infected beef products out of the food supply.

    But in March government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a deadly brain illness, from eating mad cow-infected beef.

    This summer they announced BSE was passed from cow to calf.<P>

    Researchers led by zoologist and epidemiologist Roy Anderson of Oxford used statistical analysis to predict there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of BSE before 2001.

    Nearly every new infection now came via maternal transmission, they said. The numbers would be too small to sustain the epidemic. Donnelly said the current culling policy would barely speed up the end of the epidemic. "It's really just slicing a little bit off the top," she said. To make a big difference, she said, "you would have to kill virtually everything."<P>

    They also gave what they believed to be definitive numbers on the epidemic. About 446,000 infected animals were eaten before the use of infected organs was banned in 1989, and 283,000 more before restrictions were tightened last December.

    "The estimated number of animals infected over the period 1974 to the end of 1995 is 903,000," they wrote.<P>

    Anderson's group said they did not know whether there would be an epidemic of CJD, which normally strikes one in a million per year and has an incubation period of up to 30 years.

    Donnelly said there simply was not enough information yet. "The government is not covering up the risk to humans. It's really not known," she said. "I know it's frustrating to the public. It's also frustrating to scientists."<P>

    David Skegg, a specialist in preventive and social medicine at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, said the report was an embarrassment.

    "The continual retreat from entrenched positions about BSE has damaged the credibility of science, as well as of politicians," he wrote in a commentary.

    "Not only is it disturbing that transmission at a substantial level has been detected so belatedly, but the discovery also calls into question many sacred cows about BSE," he added, noting that scientists had once denied there was maternal transmission.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>BSE 'will end by <A NAME="2001">2001</A> with or without cull' </CENTER></H3>

The Times: Britain: August 29 1996<BR>
BY NIGEL HAWKES, SCIENCE EDITOR

<P>


BSE was in rapid decline and was expected to peter out by 2001, but slaughtering millions of cows would not make it go away much more quickly, a study has concluded.


Without culling, another 6,950 cases of "mad cow" disease were to be expected, to add to the 161,412 cases since the disease appeared ten years ago. But no policy short of large-scale slaughter could have a dramatic impact on the numbers.

<P>

The study, carried out by a team led by Roy Anderson of Oxford University, takes into account the recent discovery of a low level of maternal transmission of the disease from cow to calf.


Using all that is known about how the disease originated, how it is transmitted and the susceptibility of cows of different ages, the team produced a mathematical model that fits the observed trends in the disease.



This showed that about 446,000 infected animals entered the human food chain before cow brains and spinal cords were banned in 1989. Between then and the end of 1995, another 283,000 infected cows had been eaten, the team says in <I>Nature</I>.

<P>

The total number of cows infected by the end of 1995 was estimated to have been 903,000. This is much higher than the number of cases diagnosed, because most of the animals were slaughtered before the disease became apparent.

<P>

The team has produced estimates of the number of cases that would be prevented by various slaughter policies. Slaughtering all cattle, a total of 9,360,000, would prevent all 6,950 cases that were expected to emerge before the epidemic petered out in 2001, but at enormous cost. A more selective cull, targeting herds that had a case of BSE between the beginning of 1991 and the end of 1995, would involve killing 2,870,000 cows and would prevent 6,300 cases. All the more modest options, involving culling up to hundreds of thousands of cows, would reduce the number of cases much less.

<P>

The most efficent, measured in terms of the number of cattle killed per case prevented, would be a combination of aiming at infected herds and the calves of infected mothers. Such a policy could reduce the number of cases by 1,490, at a cost of 44,000 cattle slaughtered &#173; or 30 cattle culled per case prevented.



David Skegg, of the University of Otago, says in the journal that the arcane mathematics should not blind anyone to the limitations of the data. The model predicts 221 cases in the year 2000, but he points out that that was merely the most likely number in a range from 128 to 3,660 cases.<HR>

                Anderson et al. present the first comprehensive
analysis of the BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom, based on recently
released information on the probability of mother-to-calf transmission
and previously confidential statistics from the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The epidemic is now past its peak and
in decline -- new infections from contaminated feed were close to zero
by the end of 1994, with<B> all new cases arising from
maternal transmission</B>. 
<P>
This will be insufficient to sustain the
epidemic, which may disappear almost entirely by as early as 2001
without the need for culling (although there are considerable
uncertainties). In the absence of a diagnostic test that can be used
on live animals, however, it will be difficult to accelerate the rate
of decline without slaughtering a very large number of animals.

<P>

<P>THE BSE epidemic in Britain will decline close to
extinction by the year 2001 and there is no scientific need for cattle
to be culled, new research suggests. The findings call into question the selective cull
of cattle older than 30 months, the main element   of the Government's efforts to restore confidence in
British beef. The study shows that only the obliteration of the
national herd could eradicate BSE sooner, an option already ruled out
by Britain and the EU. Using Ministry of Agriculture data, a team of
scientists predicts that there are 20,600 cattle with BSE and 6,950
will go on to be recorded as cases - 580 infected maternally and the
remainder from eating contaminated feed. There will be only 53
infected animals left in 2001.<P>

 
                  In the absence of a test that can spot BSE before
symptoms develop, the team's study, published today in Nature, shows
that it is not possible to make a big dent in numbers without
slaughtering whole herds. The number of infections from contaminated
feed fell after the feed ban and lingered until the end of 1994 when
the last of it was used up by farmers. The remaining new infections
are largely from maternal transmission. The number of new cases "will
fade close to extinction with no culling at all by the year 2000".<P>

  Can the disease be eradicated faster than under
existing policy? "The answer is no, without culling enormous numbers,"
said Prof Roy Anderson, of the Wellcome Trust, who led the
Government-approved research.  Hitting the target of a 150,000 cull - and tracing
offspring - increases the decline of the epidemic by about 20 per
cent. "We can improve on that, but not by a great deal," he said. "On
scientific grounds - if you are just considering BSE in cattle - then
there is a good argument for doing nothing. However, a human health
issue is involved, and public confidence has been severely damaged."

<H3><CENTER>Whitehall urged to <A NAME="halt">halt</A> slaughter of 147,000 cattle</CENTER></H3>

                  By David Brown and Roger Highfield<BR>
Electronic Telegraph, 29 August 1996
<P>

 
                  THE results of a study of BSE, which show that the
epidemic will fade away even without a cattle cull, brought calls last
night for the Government to abandon plans to slaughter up to 147,000
selected animals.
 
                  The report by independent scientists concludes that
the Government was right in claiming that its existing policies were
sufficient to eliminate BSE by the turn of the century. The findings,
by the Wellcome Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at
Oxford University, vindicate the Government's control measures
including the compulsory slaughter of all suspect animals and the
banning of cattle food containing animal remains. This is believed to
have caused BSE in the first place.<P>

 
                  Last night the Government was urged to halt or
drastically amend plans to extend its cull - Europe's price for
reconsidering its export ban on British beef. The proposed cull, which
is fiercely opposed by vets, scientists and farmers, will come before
Parliament for approval in October and the latest evidence casts doubt
on whether MPs can support it. The beef export ban was imposed after
Stephen Dorrell, Health Secretary, announced on March 20 that BSE may
be linked to a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) - the
human equivalent of BSE.<P>
 
                  Measures to resolve the beef crisis, including the
destruction of cattle more than 30 months of age, is expected to cost
the taxpayer &2.5 billion over the next three years. The additional
extra cull of up to 147,000 targeted "high risk" cattle demanded by
Europe is expected to cost around &500 million but the exact figure is
unknown until exact compensation terms for farmers are fixed.<P>
 
                       'We compare the cull with the burning of
witches in days gone by'<P>
 
                  Labour called last night for Douglas Hogg, Minister
of Agriculture, to re-think the selective cull plans, although there
were no signs that he would. Dr Gavin Strang, shadow minister of
agriculture, said: "The only justification for Parliament going along
with a selective cull is the necessity to reach an agreement on
lifting the European export ban. I would strongly like to see the
Government make further efforts to secure another arrangement which
would bring about the lifting of the ban."<P>

 
                  Labour attacked the Government for not spending
enough on research to find a live diagnostic test for BSE. The report
pointed out pressure for cattle culls was due mainly to the absence of
such a test to positively identify cattle stricken by BSE. Currently,
BSE can be confirmed only by laboratory tests after suspect animals
are culled. Dr Strang said: "We are paying the price of a Government
that has cut the Ministry of Agriculture research budget by 40 per
cent since 1979."<P>

 
                  Francis Anthony, the British Veterinary
Association's spokesman on BSE, said: "The report vindicates what we
have been saying all along. The Government should now re-think its
selective culling policy which will kill too many healthy animals. We
compare the cull with the burning of witches in days gone by. It is
being done to placate a bunch of Eurocrats across the water, not for
scientific reasons. The epidemic is falling fast. Some vets hardly
come across a BSE cow nowadays."<P>

 
                  Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers'
Union of England and Wales, said: "The selective cull scheme should be
re-examined but nothing must be done to jeopardise the lifting of the
export ban." Ministers refused to be drawn last night on whether
they would seek to abandon the selective cull policy.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Total">Total</A> of infected animals was under-estimated</CENTER></H3>

 Electronic Telegraph, 29 August 1996
<P>
THE number of cattle that have been infected with
BSE is <B>six times greater than the cases confirmed</B> by the Government,
the study shows.
 
                  While official figures show that 161,412 cases of
the disease were confirmed by this summer, the Oxford University team
has used new mathematical methods to show that 900,000 cattle were
infected up to the end of last year. Most of the cattle ended up in
the food chain before symptoms of the disease developed. Prof Roy
Anderson, who led the team, said: "Using some quite sophisticated
computational techniques, we can back-calculate the total number of
infected animals and when they were infected." This number peaked at
300,000 new infections in 1987 and 900,000 overall.<P>

 
                  "The reason there is an enormous difference is that
most of those animals were slaughtered and went into the food chain
before BSE developed," he said. "Prior to the specified offal ban
in1989, 440,000 went into the food chain."
 
                  This is not such bad news as it sounds: studies on
mice show that the density of the prion disease agents is highest when
the symptoms develop. "Out of those 440,000, only 6,600 were in this
late stage," said Prof Anderson.<P>

 
                  The population would have been exposed to most of
the risk in 1988-89, consistent with the appearance of the new variant
of CJD in 1994 - but still not proof of a link, he said.
 
                  The new analysis draws on the link between dose and
the incubation time of the disease - <B>an oral dose of one gram of
diseased brain can cause the disease within five years</B>, while 100
grams can shrink this period to 32 months. "That dose-dependent
incubation period is very important because it gives us the shape of
the epidemic," said Prof Anderson.

The ruminant feed ban came into force in 1988. But, many farmers
continued to use possibly contaminated feed until 1994, "when the last of
it was used up", according to Roger Highfield.

In June 1996 the Government announced fines and imprisonment for further
use of illegal animal feed. 5,000 fine for a first offence and one months

<P>
That only 6,600 were in the late stage, doesn't mean that 433,400 BSE

the specified offal ban in 1989.

</A> <H3><CENTER>Britain is preparing for a fresh BSE <A NAME="conflict">conflict</A> with EU members </CENTER></H3>

The Times: Britain: August 30 1996<BR>
BY ARTHUR LEATHLEY, MICHAEL HORNSBY AND CHARLES BREMNER
<P>

MINISTERS are preparing for a new conflict with Europe over "mad cow" disease in the wake of fresh evidence suggesting that it will die out naturally in Britain within five years.



The Government moved last night to head off a threatened Tory backbench revolt by suggesting that ministers would reopen negotiations with European partners over the planned cull of more than 120,000 cattle. Angela Browning, a junior Agriculture Minister, said that there was an urgent need to examine the culling policy in the light of the new research.

<P>

BSE, which, it is feared, might be linked to the human brain disease CJD, could disappear naturally by 2001, the research suggests. Mrs Browning seized on the findings, which support claims by farmers that a widescale cull is unnecessary. She said: "We need to take stock quite urgently of the implications of this evidence."

<P>

Tory backbenchers and farmers' leaders increased pressure on the Government to renegotiate the proposed cull that they claim would lead to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of uninfected cattle. Euro-sceptic MPs have warned ministers that they will oppose plans for the cull which have to be debated in the Commons after the summer recess, in October.

<P>

John Biffen, MP for Shropshire North, claimed that he would not vote for the current "needless" selective slaughter policy and called for the Government to change its cattle cull scheme in the light of new evidence that BSE would die out naturally within five years. Mr Biffen, speaking on BBC Radio 4's <I>World at One</I>, warned ministers of backbench unease over a cull based not on scientific advice, but on public sentiment.

<P>

Mrs Browning moved to defuse Euro-sceptic anger, saying: "I think we need to look at what has been a very useful, valuable piece of research, analyse it ... and then we need to take that information [to Europe]. We will obviously want to reopen discussions with our European partners and the Commission."

<P>

However, on the Continent the latest findings, combined with last month's evidence on cow-to-calf transmission of BSE, were seen as handing ammunition to Germany and other EU states which are intent on revising the plan for easing the beef ban which was agreed in Florence in June.

<P>

Officials in Brussels interpreted the research at Oxford University's zoology department as offering reasons for extending the cull. The finding that about 700,000 cattle incubating BSE had probably entered the food chain by the end of last year was considered to confirm that Britain had mishandled the epidemic and that British beef should be readmitted only when the disease had been eradicated.

<P>

Gerard Kiely, spokesman for the Commission's farm directorate, said it was most unlikely that the EU would consider reducing the cull. "We agreed [the cull] following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible," he said. "I think it would be very difficult to sell to the Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases."

Listserve 31 Aug 1996
<P>

Had MAFF done the following, we would probably not have approx 900,000 BSE-cases, with more than 700,000 entering the food chain and a fear among people that have eaten potentially infected cattle for more than 10 years -- animals that should have been destroyed:
<PRE> 
* if the feed ban had been enforced in 1988
 
* if an entire herd had been destroyed when a BSE case was confirmed
 
* if many actions of 1995-96 had been taken in the late 80's instead</PRE>

<B>Questions on the delayed timing of MAFF regulatory actions:</B>
 
<PRE>Why was there a lack of "determination to shut off this major source of
infectivity once and for all" in 1988-89?
 
Why was possibly infectious ruminant feed not destroyed, but recycled in
feed mills,and fed to pigs and poultry?
 
Why weren't the stocks of feed "recalled, with compensation, being
collected and disposed of at Government expense" in 1988?
 
Why no requirement "to clean out storage facilities and equipment that may
have come in contact with MBM or feed containing it withing 48 hours" when
the feed ban came into force?
 
Shouldn't the compliance has been "ensured by State Veterinary Service
inspections" from day one?
 
Why didn't it become an offense immediately to use MBM, or have it "present
at farms, feed mills and feed merchants premises"?
 
The feed ban of '88 was a key instrument to control transmission of BSE.
So, why was it not enforced in 1988-89, but in 1996?<<HR>

<h3>More than <A NAME="happenstance">happenstance</A>: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in farmers</H3>
Sheila M Gore ... <B>BMJ</B> 1995;<B>311</B>:1416-58
<P>
In 1986, four years after a change in the processing of offals - including
those from sheep infected with scrapie - into cattle meal, the first British
case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy was confirmed.

<P><P>Median incubation period in cattle is around four to five years[i] By 14
April 1995, bovine spongiform encephalopathy had been confirmed in 53.3% of dairy
herds, 14.7% of beef suckler herds, and 33.8% of all herds with adult breeding
cattle; people who work on farms without confirmed cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy may, however, have worked on farms with infected, but not
affected, cattle. The aim of ongoing studies in cattle is to find evidence of
direct transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy by the two suggested
means of transmission of scrapie in sheep: from mother to offspring or between
unrelated animals around parturition.

<P><P>The incubation period of human spongiform encephalopathies - kuru and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - is poorly estimated from data[ii] but is apparently
in the range 15-40 years, possibly shorter in people who were young at
exposure. The potential for the agent responsible for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy to cross species barriers after occupational or dietary exposure
including exposure to cattle meal by ingestion or inhalation - has been a major
concern for human health. Whether the agent is pathogenic to humans cannot be
known by direct experimentation. Thus, surveillance of cases of sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - in terms of occupational distribution, temporal
changes in incidence, and dietary correlations - is the only way to get early
warning of pathogenesis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in humans. British
surveillance of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was therefore reactivated in May
1990,[iii] and a grant from the European Community in 1993 enabled surveillance
projects elsewhere in Europe to share common diagnostic criteria,
methodologies, and case control questionnaires. Two observations from the other
participating countries set the British data (see below) in wider context: the
incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was similar in France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, and Britain in 1993-4 (about 0 72 cases per million person
years); and, across countries, the reported incidence in dairy farmers was
consistently higher than in all farmers (pooled estimates: 6.31 v 0.74 cases
per million person years).[iii]

<P><B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in British farmers</B>
<P>Based on the 1991 population and deaths from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease
in the United Kingdom from 1 May 1990 to 2 March 1995, the age specific
incidence of the disease (per million person years) was estimated to be 0.05
(ages 40-44, 1 case), 0.42 (ages 45-49, 7 cases), 0.62 (ages 50-54, 9 cases),
1.80 (ages 55-59, 25 cases), 2.62 (ages 60-64, 36 cases), and 2.06 (ages 65 and
over, 89 cases), with no cases for the age group 15-39 (R G Will, personal
communication). These age specific incidences (irrespective of sex) were used
in conjunction with the age distribution of farmers in England and Wales -
available from the 1990 European Community structure survey (C Jennings,
personal communication) - to derive the expected age appropriate incidence of
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in farmers: 0.77 per million person years
(male or female, full or part time employment, and including spouses and other
family members). The structure survey gives the number of people employed in
farming in England and Wales as 442,300, 136,440 of them in dairy farming.
Corresponding numbers for the United Kingdom - including Scotland and Northern
Ireland - have been arrived at on a population pro rata basis: that is,
multiplying by 1.13 and rounding up to nearest thousand, to give 500,000 and
155,000 respectively. The number of people employed on farms with adult cattle
is not easily available but is unlikely to exceed twice the number in dairy
farming. An upper limit of 310,000 has been assumed (see table). An estimated
105,000 of these 310,000 (33.8%: rounded up to nearest thousand) work on farms
with cattle affected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

<P>EXPECTED INCIDENCE OF CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE

<P>The expected number of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease during
the
six years from 1 May 1990 to 30 April 1996 in people who work on British farms
at time of diagnosis is thus: 0.77 (expected age appropriate incidence per
million person years)x0.5 million x6 years=2.31. Based on this Poisson
expectation,[iv] the table shows the probability of observing n or more actual
cases for n= 1, 2, . . . 7. The probability of five or more cases in farm
workers is 0.085.

<P>If we restrict attention to people who work on British dairy farms the
expected
number of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease during six years is 0.72,
and the probability of observing four of more confirmed cases is 0.006.

<P>For people who work on British farms with adult cattle, the expected number
of
cases in six years is 1.43, and the probability of observing five or more
confirmed cases is 0.016. Subdivision of farms with adult cattle according to
whether cattle are affected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy suggests that
the probability of observing four or more cases from affected farms and one or
more from unaffected farms is 0 0016x0.61, or 1 in 1,000.

<P>All four confirmed cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people who worked
on
farms affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy were male, lifelong, full
time farm workers. The 1990 European Community structure survey reports that
44% of all farm labour is performed by men working full time. I estimate that
46,000 men work full time on British farms with cattle affected by bovine
spongiform encephalopathy: on the basis of 0.2134 cases of sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease expected in six years, the probability of observing
four or more confirmed cases in such men is less than 1 in 10,000.


<P>FURTHER STUDIES
<P>Possible occupational exposure to the agent responsible for bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy (or other spongiform encephalopathy) agent must be rigorously
researched therefore. If the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent is
implicated it is likely that any such exposure first occurred in the early
1980s when cattle were also first exposed. Have there been changes in farm
practices, including changes in farm workers' diet, that have limited possible
occupational exposures since the first cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy were confirmed? Do historical or current farm practices differ
between lifelong farm workers and others, between full time and part time farm
workers, between dairy and other cattle farmers, or between farming families in
which Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has occurred and other farming families? The
European data warn that aspects of dairy farming other than working with herds
affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy could be implicated in higher
incidences of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in dairy farmers.[iii]

<P>The potential for bias in case-control comparison of recalled diet when the
item of interest is public knowledge[v,vi] has been underlined elsewhere.[iii]
Transmission experiments in mice have begun with brain tissue from farmers who
have died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and whose herds were affected by
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, but these will require two to three years for
completion.

<P><B>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in young adults</B>
<P>Three cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people aged under 40
have
been reported in the United Kingdom since May 1990,[vii-ix] two of them in
people aged under 20. About 21 million persons in the United Kingdom are aged
15-39, and the incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease increases with age (see
above). The Poisson probability of observing n or more cases of sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease during six years in the age group 15-39 - if the
sporadic incidence is taken as 0 01 or as 0 001 per million person years (a
fifth or a fiftieth of that for the age group 40-44) - can easily be computed
based on 1.26 or 0.126 expected cases. If the higher of the two postulated
incidences is the more reasonable, three or more cases in people aged under 40
in six years are not untoward (P=0.13) but four or more begins to be (P=0.04).
Even three or more cases are highly improbable if the alternative postulate
applies (P=0.0003).
<P>A clear epidemiological priority is to pool data from comparable European
surveillance studies of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to derive a best estimate of
incidence for people aged 15-39. A new environmental or dietary exposure to a
spongiform encephalopathy pathogenic to humans is likely to be first evident in
young adults because background sporadic cases are rare and the incubation
period may be shorter in young people. Transmission experiments with brain
tissue from young adults who have died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease will be
needed.
<P>Taken together, cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in farmers and young
adults
are more than happenstance.[x] They signal an epidemiological alert to
investigate intensively possible exposures - farm related and dairy - and to
devise means of doing so that are minimally compromised by pre-existing
publicity.

<h3>Rate of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in farmers is <A NAME="not">not</A> significant</h3>
DOUGLAS R 0 MORRISON, CERN<BR>
BMJ No. 7056 Volume 313 Saturday 31 August 1996</I> <p>

After the death of four farmers from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Gore concluded that the probability of this occurring by chance was less than 1 in 10,000.(1) Recently Will et al reported 10 cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (two of the patients were still alive)(2) While bovine spongiform encephalopathy could not be proved to be responsible for these cases, it was considered to be the most plausible explanation. It might therefore be concluded that bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been responsible for two new diseases (sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the new variant) - a surprising result. I have checked the robustness of Gore's calculation of probability.
<p>
The existence of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease,  different  from  sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, seems established because of the unusual neuropathological profile and the young age distribution of the patients. Seven of the eight patients who died were aged 15-34, and I have calculated that the probability of this occurring by chance is 1 in 100,000,000. To check the robustness of this calculation, I increased the expected rate by 2 SD, when a probability of 1 in 1,000,000 was found. The result was thus robust.
<p>
My main worry about Gore's calculation of probability is the size chosen for the population at risk. This was taken to be 46,000 farmers (9% of the total of 500,000 farmers). These were only male, full time, lifelong farmers. There was an implied assumption that small and large herds of cattle are looked after by the same numbers of farmers and contain equal numbers of cows with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  If the number of farmers at risk had been regarded as 100,000 or 200,000 (20% and 40%, respectively, of the total number of farmworkers) then the probability of four farmers developing sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over five years would be 1 in 500 or 1 in 30 respectively. The first figure is significant at the 3 SD level, but the second is not significant.
<p>
It has been assumed that the rate of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is one per million population per year. As recording improves, however, the rate is increasing with time in most countries - except in the United States, where Holman et al found a rate of 0.9 (range 0.8-1.1) cases during 1979-90 (total number of cases, 2,614).(3) In Austria, where many necropsies are performed, the rate was 1.25 in 1995 (H Budka, personal communication).
<p>
I conclude that Gore's calculation is not robust and that bovine spongiform encephalopathy has plausibly caused only one disease, the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
<p>
I thank Dr F James for helpful discussion.

<PRE>Note that the one on the number of infected animals makes some assertions about the 
human CJD incubation period. It says 5-6 years for 1 gram of infected material, but this 
must be conjecture.

With regard to the "no purpose in culling" stories, remember that the Prime Minister 
made a commitment to getting the EU export ban lifted this year. The maternal 
transmission proof caused the EU to push the ban back yet further, so a mass cull gains 
no short term gain by having the ban lifted, upsets the farmers (with an election coming 
up), and the expenditure upsets the Treasury. By an astounding coincidence, a government 
sponsored report has now come to the conclusion that the mass cull serves no purpose!

They claimed that more than 2,000 lorries carrying British meat products were intercepted across France on Wednesday night and early yesterday.The farmers halted their action yesterday morning, but warned it could resume "at any time without warning".<BR><BR>
Early yesterday more than 100 farmers descended on the ferry terminal in Dieppe to await a ferry from Newhaven which they suspected of carrying beef. More than 500 British travellers waiting to board the ferry were warned to leave their vehicles in the port and go to the terminal buildings in case of trouble.<BR><BR>
The farmers, who burned wooden pallets, tyres and straw, left the port shortly after the ferry docked, when they realised it was not carrying any livestock products. The farmers claimed imported live animals would be set loose. It was the first time this kind of militant action by French farmers had been seen in Dieppe.

<FONT COLOR="00BF00">Nicholas Lander<BR><BR>
Financial Times    ...   Saturday August 31 1996</FONT><BR><BR>
Nicholas Lander reports on a French farm which delivers top quality beef straight to its customers.<BR><BR>
Sitting around their farmhouse table in the village of Fajac en Val, population 38, high in the rocky Corbires, 1,000km south west of Paris and a mere 80km from the Spanish border, Franois Aveline, 29, and his father, Paul, 56, were discussing the consequences of BSE (or ESB, as the French call <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease) on their farm and on their mail order meat business.<BR><BR>
As befits their philosophical nature and the tranquil setting, their response was measured, unlike the initial reaction to the beef crisis in France.<BR><BR>
Then butchers throughout the country posted large signs in their shop windows reassuring customers that their meat was French in origin, and once proud displays of Angus beef were withdrawn.<BR><BR>
The French Agriculture Minister promptly decreed that French beef carcasses be stamped VF, Viandes Franaise. When it was pointed out that those initials stood for Vichy France, an era the French would like to forget, and vache folle (<STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT>), the stamp was promptly changed to VDF, viande d'origine Franaise. In spite of this, beef consumption has fallen 15 per cent in France since April.<BR><BR>
The crisis had one immediate, negative consequence for the Aveline household. "There are, or there were until earlier this year, two aspects to our farming business," Franois said, "the mail order meat business and the sale of live cattle, usually the older animals, to Spain. When news of BSE broke, our business in Spain disappeared.<BR><BR>
"It was not even a question of having to accept lower prices for the animals, the phone calls from our former customers just stopped. Fortunately, our mail order business, to customers who want top quality meat and a guarantee of the manner in which the animals have been reared and fed, has increased by over 30 per cent since April."<BR><BR>
The Avelines moved to the farm 10 years ago, having lived in Normandy and near Castlenaudary, home of cassoulet, the earthy dish of duck, pork and white beans.<BR><BR>
"I bought the farm," Paul said, "because I fell in love with it immediately. Everyone said I was mad, that the land was too poor, too dry to support cattle. But we began slowly with 40 cattle grazing on 400 hectares and conducted tests which showed it was bereft of phosphorous.<BR><BR>
"So we nurtured the soil and it responded - now there are wild flowers everywhere." There are also more than 300 head of cattle and their calves, mainly Gascon, and 100 black Gascon pigs renowned for their flavour. The animals were reared using techniques that Franois's younger brother, Jean-Marie, learnt working on farms in Western Australia. The animals spend all year outdoors, eating grass and barley grown on the farm and watering at a large dam the Avelines built, soon to be supplemented by an irrigation system.<BR><BR>
The mail order business is a family one. The brochure detailing the different packs of beef, veal, pork and charcuterie was designed by Franois's sister, Marie-Ccile. When the beef has been butchered, in a small abbatoir near Puylaurens, and hung for 15 days, it is vacuum-packed, labelled and despatched in the second half of every month from Revel, near Castlenaudary, by Franois.<BR><BR>
The meat is sold in lots of 5kg to 8kg. The most expensive pack of beef includes rump steak, bavette and chateaubriand or sausage, spare ribs and roasting joints from the pigs. Prices range from FFr48 to FFr88 a kilo.<BR><BR>
"Our direct sales this year will be in excess of FFr440,000," says Franois, "and we are currently selling to customers throughout France, as well as a few in Belgium and Spain. We have just had a butcher from outside Bruges and his family staying at our gte next door and he was so impressed by what he saw that he even came down and helped us butcher the meat.<BR><BR>
"He is going to start ordering our meat because, he explained, a lot of his customers are increasingly concerned about the use of growth hormones in cattle and, of course, we do not use any."<BR><BR>
There are more than 400 customers on the mailing list, generated mainly by word of mouth, and Franois sees direct sales as the farm's future. He says: "When we sell a beef carcass weighing an average of 300 kilos we get FFr26 a kilo net from the market but FFr33 if we sell direct.<BR><BR>
"It is the only way to satisfy French customers who are very particular about what they eat. It is not enough to say that just because the animals are outside the meat will be good enough, so I want to improve their feed to get more marbling, more flavour into the beef."<BR><BR>
When I explained how demand for beef in the UK had revived after the British supermarkets had sharply cut the price, Franois shook his head. "Some of the bigger French supermarkets are trying this too, but without as much success. French consumers feel that if they see anyone selling cheap beef they can only have bought it cheaply and will avoid it."<BR><BR>

Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, faces the prospect of renewed civil war inside the Tory party over Europe, after EU officials warned of inevitable delays in the lifting of the ban on British beef exports.<BR><BR>
EU officials said the framework for lifting the ban agreed at the Florence summit in June would have to be revised in the light of new evidence on the possible spread of BSE, or <STRONG><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</STRONG></FONT> disease, from mother to calf and from cattle to sheep.<BR><BR>
Conservative Eurosceptic MP said they were prepared to shatter the British government's fragile truce over Europe, unless the EU started to lift the ban by November.<BR><BR>
The British government revealed earlier this month that BSE could be transmitted from cow to calf. In addition, evidence has emerged suggesting the disease could be transmitted to sheep.<BR><BR>
Mr Major promised in June that measures would be in place by November to combat BSE and thus to secure a lifting of the EU ban.<BR><BR>
Tory Eurosceptics have interpreted the November target as a firm deadline for a lifting of the ban, after which they warn they will resume their hostilities towards Brussels.<BR><BR>
Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said he and his colleagues would press for a resumption of Britain's non-cooperation policy with the EU, and the possible boycotting of the Dublin heads of government summit in December if the ban was not lifted by the target date.<BR><BR>
One EU official predicted member states would be stricter in their interpretation of the Florence agreement in the light of the new evidence.<BR><BR>
There are also concerns about Britain's ability to implement the terms of the agreement, particularly as a comprehensive cull of British cattle underpins the deal.<BR><BR>
"A number of member states are concerned about the way the UK has acted on the plan so far. There has not been a great deal of progress," said a Dutch official.<BR><BR>
The controversy over culling cattle is heightened today with research predicting the BSE epidemic in the UK will virtually disappear by 2001 without any cull.<BR><BR>
In Nature magazine, scientists at Oxford University predict there will be 6,950 new cases of BSE between 1997 and 2001, compared with over 160,000 cases to date.<BR><BR>
One slaughter option would involve killing up to 44,000 animals to prevent about 1,490 of the 6,950 projected cases.<HR>

<H4><CENTER>Electronic <A NAME="tagging">tagging</A> planned in effort to trace BSE cattle</CENTER></H4>


BY MICHAEL HORSNELL

<BR>
The Times: Britain: August 3 1996<P>

 A NATIONAL computer database of Britain's 11 million cattle is expected to be opened within three months by the livestock industry as part of the attempt to eradicate "mad cow" disease. Details will be disclosed to the Ministry of Agriculture in a working group's report next week.



The government-funded scheme, costing &#163;5 million, will begin with the electronic tagging of all new-born calves. Farmers will be compelled to register all animals with details of their date and place of birth, sex, breed, dam, health record, and movements, making them traceable at the press of a button.


But it is understood that the huge registration operation, in which cattle will have a computer chip inserted in each ear, will not be finished until the end of next year.

<P>

There are fears that it will be difficult to trace the more than 20,000 extra cattle that might now be slaughtered &#173; born to dams that contracted BSE within six months of giving birth. After the disclosure of evidence that cows can infect their progeny, two European Union scientific committees are examining the evidence of maternal infection. They are expected to recommend the increase in the planned slaughter of 147,000 cattle from previously infected herds.


Without a database to find the 20,000 calves, the oldest of which was born in 1986, the Agriculture Ministry will have to rely on their own records of BSE-infected cows and return to the farms where the last-born were raised.

<P>

Although farmers tag their animals and keep their own records &#173; many on computer &#173; the reliability varies. Difficulties in tracing last-born will be compounded by their lifetime movements, and the records of auctioneers will have to be used.


An industry source admitted: "Some farmers are rather better at keeping records than others. It will be a challenge but not an impossible one."



The database working group, including representatives of the cattle industry, trading standards, retailers and consumers, began considering an electronic tracing system before the European summit in Florence six weeks ago. One of the preconditions agreed for the lifting of the export ban on beef was that Britain introduce an effective scheme to identify animals and record their movements on an official register.


Angela Browning, the junior Agriculture Minister, announced yesterday that the working party's report would be studied by a team of consultants who would complete their work by the middle of next month.

BY PHILIP WEBSTER, POLITICAL EDITOR, AND MICHAEL DYNES IN BRUSSELS

<BR>The Times: Britain:
August 3 1996
<P>


JOHN MAJOR'S hopes of lifting most of the ban on British beef exports by November were in tatters last night after Germany and Brussels virtually tore up the deal that ended the beef war with Europe.



After the revelation that "mad cow" disease can be passed from mother to calf, the German Agriculture Minister called for a return to the total ban on British beef and its by-products while Franz Fischler, the European Agriculture Commissioner, called for a rethink of the framework drawn up in Florence six weeks ago.

<P>

As the crisis deepened Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, came under pressure over charges that he deliberately withheld from Parliament interim information which he had given to Herr Fischler, suggesting evidence of maternal transmission of BSE.



In a Commons debate on July 24, Mr Hogg made no mention of the study by Government scientists on cow to calf transmission which had been put before the Government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee five days earlier, on July 19.



Mr Hogg had been aware of the interim findings and, according to Herr Fischler's spokesman yesterday, had communicated them to him three weeks ago.

<P>

But Agriculture Ministry officials said Mr Hogg could not have been expected to inform the Commons of the findings until the specialist committee had reported to him, which it did earlier this week.



Herr Fischler said in a letter to Mr Hogg, released yesterday, that he understood it was the new information about maternal transmission that had led him to postpone last month the implementation of the programme for the selective slaughter of 147,000 cattle.

<P>

But officials said Herr Fischler was mistaken. They pointed to Mr Hogg's explanation in the Commons debate that there was already a big backlog in the related scheme for the slaughter of up to one million cows aged 30 months and over.



Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrat agriculture spokesman, accused Mr Hogg of "a deliberate failure to inform Parliament of the latest BSE scientific evidence", and said that if MPs had known last week that the whole programme was back in the melting pot he would have had a much rougher ride.

<P>

Frank Dobson, Labour's environment spokesman, said: "It has now been revealed that Douglas Hogg told Herr Fischler about the latest evidence on BSE being passed from cow to calf three weeks ago. But he didn't tell the House of Commons, even though he had every opportunity to do so. The Tories claim they stick up for Britain in Europe and stick up for the rights of the British Parliament. Douglas Hogg hasn't done that. Quite the reverse. He stuck two fingers up to the House of Commons."



Senior MPs said that if the Commons were still sitting, Mr Hogg would have been in serious trouble yesterday over the disclosure that he had not told MPs.

<P>

There was also doubt over Mr Hogg's assertion that only last-born calves were at risk from the transmission of the disease from infected mothers.

<P>

Derek Ammon, herdsman at Park Farm, Limpsfield, Surrey, gave <I>The Times</I> details of three cases in which the first-born calf of mothers which had died from the disease had also perished. In one case the mother and calf died on the same day.

<P>

"This evidence disputes everything they were saying yesterday. Herdsmen on other farms have told me the same thing has happened there. Once again we are being given bogus information," he said.



Euro-sceptic Tory MPs reacted with anger after Jochen Borchert, the German Agriculture Minister, called for a total embargo on British beef, with the EU reconsidering its decision to relax the ban on exports of semen, gelatine and tallow.


Some MPs called for the EU non-cooperation tactic to be revived, although ministers are likely to reject the idea as counter-productive.


After the Florence summit, Mr Major said he hoped most of the ban would be over by November. But Mr Hogg's decision to delay putting the selective cull orders to the Commons means that there cannot be parliamentary authority for it until October at the earliest. Mr Tyler predicted yesterday that Mr Hogg would lose the vote and his position would become untenable.

<P>

The biggest blow was the letter from Herr Fischler to Mr Hogg, suggesting that a review of the framework deal would be required now that the new route of BSE infection had been discovered. He asked two EU scientific committees to look into whether the selective slaughter of up to 147,000 cattle from previously infected herds planned for this autumn should be extended to calves. Their recommendations will be considered by the EU Standing Veterinary Committee at the beginning of September, when new demands will be drawn up.

<P>

Britain would have begun implementing the selective slaughter programme on August 1, so that all animals which had developed BSE could be traced to their farm of origin, enabling the entire cohort to be identified and destroyed. That programme has now been postponed until veterinary experts in London and Brussels decide whether it will now be necessary to slaughter all the offspring of infected cows as well, and for the eventual vote in the Commons. Veterinary experts are expected to concentrate their attention on how the disease is transmitted from mother to calf.

<P>

Herr Fischler said that while he understood the Government's reasons for postponing the selective cull, the decision would "have the effect of postponing further the reduction in the incidents of BSE which is a cornerstone in our policies ... In any case, it will be necessary to consider the need for expanding the selective slaughter programme.


"We will need to consider what other implications this information may have from the step by step approach (for lifting the ban) which was approved in Florence."


Herr Fischler said later that while the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee details did not require any new measures at European level to protect consumers, "it cannot be excluded that they will have consequent implications for the measures necessary to fight the disease."<HR>
<H4><CENTER>'No need to <A NAME="change">change</A> rules on calf meat'</CENTER></H4>

The Times: Britain:
August 3 1996
<P>

THE Meat and Livestock Commission attempted to reassure consumers yesterday after the disclosure by government scientists that cows can pass BSE to their calves (Nigel Hawkes writes).
Colin Maclean, chairman of the commission, said no change to the regulations on calf-meat consumption was necessary: all but the thymus and intestines of calves up to six months old can be eaten.

<P>

Helen Grant, a neuropathologist, argues that if calves have been infected with BSE in the womb, during birth, or immediately after it, they should be subject to the same regulations as other beef products, with brain and spinal column also excluded from the food chain.


This was recommended by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1990, but has never been acted on, she says. The Government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (Seac) this week said that no changes were necessary.

<P>

Mr Maclean says that he does not see any problem. The regulations are designed to exclude from consumption the parts of the animal likely to have the highest concentration of the infective agent. Experiments have shown that for the first 18 months after infection, the agent is present only in the intestine.



Experiments by ministry scientists have failed to show any infectivity in cow placenta. Nor has the infective agent been found in milk or blood. "We agree that there's no need for amendments," Mr Maclean said.

<BR>The Times: Britain:
August 3 1996<P>

 A FATHER spoke of his uncertainty about the health of his three children after learning that they are being monitored for the human equivalent of "mad cow" disease, which killed their mother.


Anthony Bowen, 36, is particularly unsure about his nine-month-old son Anthony, who was born while his mother was dying of CJD in hospital. He is also concerned in case his daughters Natalie, six, and Jacqueline, nine, could have the illness. All the children are healthy.

<P>

Mr Bowen has been told by Richard Lacey, a microbiolo gist, that his son could have a 50 per cent chance of catching the disease, Natalie 30 per cent and Jacqueline 10 per cent. The Department of Health said that with only 12 people dead and one person dying of the new strain of CJD, knowledge of the disease was at an early stage.


Mr Bowen, of Manchester, said of his son's prospects: "50:50, that's a spin of a coin. I can imagine them in the future going one at a time and I will end up with nothing. We just carry on as a normal family."

<P>

His wife died last Novem ber, aged 29, in a coma after their son was delivered 11 weeks prematurely.

<P>

Professor Robert Edwards, editor of the journal <I>Human Reproduction</I>, emphasised last night the importance of monitoring the children of women and men who die of CJD. "We should have an extensive programme of checking," he said.

CJD is blamed on prion proteins which have proved very resilient. "We know that spermatazoa can absorb viruses. We know that some viruses get into eggs at fertilisation although they appear to be dealt with by the egg. We know nothing about prions."<HR>

Aug 2, 1996
<P>    LONDON - A British scientist said Friday that the news that cows can pass mad cow disease onto their calves meant it was possible pregnant women with the human form of the fatal brain disease could infect their babies.<P>


    But another expert said chances of human transmission from mother to baby were still remote, adding that Britain might not have to expand a mass cull of cattle aimed at eradicating the disease.<P>

    The agriculture ministry re-opened the furor over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) with the announcement that experiments had shown infected cows were passing on the disease to their calves.<P>

    An immediate debate flared over whether Britain would be able to eradicate the disease from its herds and thus get a global ban on exports on its beef products lifted.<P>

    Government scientists said the experiments did not show how the disease was transmitted, but it seemed to be happening in the womb. One immediately warned of the implications for women with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the human version.<P>

    Scientists have already identified a new strain of CJD, which has affected about a dozen people, that they say could have been contracted through eating infected beef

    "We need to know how many children there are born to women who later contract this variant of CJD," Dr Sheila Gore of the Medical Research Council told the Times newspaper.<P>

    She said the government should step up monitoring of the one in a million people per year who come down with the rare illness. "If it is in the womb rather than during birth or after birth, it may just as easily occur in human beings."<P>

    But a member of Britain's government Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), microbiologist Jeffrey Almond, said that even though the phenomenon could be detected in sheep and cattle, it had not yet been observed in humans.<P>

    Children born to CJD victims had about a 50 percent chance of developing CJD themselves, he said, noting that the disease usually occurs because of a genetic mutation which can be passed on.

 THOUSANDS of angry German farmers, who took to the streets to protest at the European Union's handling of the BSE crisis, burnt the Union Jack yesterday as they shouted "England out of the EU!"



The flag-burning took place in Husum, near the Danish border, when the protesters, part of a group of farmers in Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria, joined forces to support the continuing ban on British beef and other related products. But they criticised Brussels for mishandling the crisis.



The continuation of the German ban was approved recently by the Bundesrat, the Upper House. Jochen Borchert, the Agriculture Minister, attempted to assure consumers yesterday that Germany remained free of BSE.

<P>

The demonstration in Husum coincided with the arrival of a high-level delegation from the agricultural departments in Bonn and Kiel who had hoped to appease the farmers. But the farmers delayed them, surrounding their buses for more than an hour.


The president of the Bavarian Farmers Association, Gerd Sonnleitner, told 2,000 farmers in N&uuml;rnberg that for years Brussels had "covered up and lied" about the BSE crisis. Farmers were suffering from "a catastrophic drop in the price of beef", which had cost them billions of marks.



In Bavaria, three out of every four farmers have been affected by the BSE crisis. Herr Borchert has asked German health experts to meet Horst Seehofer, the Health Minister, on Monday to discuss the latest developments.

 THE value of dairy and beef calves plummeted at Beeston market in Cheshire yesterday. The strain of the latest "mad-cow" setback was evident on farmers' faces.


Last year, the auctioneers Wright-Manley recorded an average sale price for calves of &#163;133. Yesterday it was down to &#163;86.50. Only 450 were sold, compared with 577 on the same day last year.

<P>

Susan Lunt, a dairy farmer on the Cheshire-North Wales border, was relieved to have sold a calf for &#163;178 when last year it would have gone for &#163;300.


Edward Bickerton, an elderly dairy farmer from Cheshire, said he had never known such a bad time since the depression of the 1930s. "Business is terrible. Farmers just can't go on any more. We're all so worried about the future."


David Tomlinson, a calf rearer, bought between 20 and 30 calves for almost half the price he would have paid last year. "Every livestock farmer is losing at the moment. I'm confident things will get better, but in the short term it's very, very depressing. Just when we were getting back on our feet, we were delivered another blow."

<P>

Other farmers were less philosophical; angry and frustrated by the shrinking of the export market and the uncertainty over whether their busi nesses would recover. Brian Coleclough, from Holywell, North Wales, said: "I'm going to lose about &#163;150 on each cow I sell, and as far as I'm concerned they should shoot the scientists, not cull the calves, because no one seems to know what's going on." He said it was a wonder farmers weren't hanging themselves. "People are losing money hand over fist and they don't know where to turn."


At the other side of the auction site a huge newly built cull market hall stood empty. John Broomhall, a partner in Wright-Manley, said wistfully: "We used to be the biggest cull market in the UK, dealing in about 600 cows a week. We're down to a couple of hundred."

The Times: Britain: August 2 1996<BR>
BY PHILIP WEBSTER, POLITICAL EDITOR, AND MICHAEL DYNES IN BRUSSELS
<P>


THE Government's efforts to restore faith in the beef industry suffered a new setback yesterday after it revealed evidence for the first time that "mad cow" disease can be passed from mother to calf.


The demolition of previous claims that the disease could only be passed through food threw its strategy for eradicating bovine spongiform encephalopathy into confusion.

<P>

Ministers immediately acknowledged that plans for the selective slaughter of 147,000 cows from previously infected herds would be rethought. Thousands more may have to be killed and the new findings are likely to delay any partial lifting of the export ban which, after the Florence summit, John Major predicted could happen within months.


Last night, in a surprise move signalling a potential new confrontation between London and Brussels, Franz Fischler, the EU Agriculture Commissioner, told the Government that the European Commission would now have to review its approval of Britain's previously agreed plans for eradicating the disease.

<P>

Herr Fischler has written to Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, asking for further details of the findings. The EU's Standing Veterinary Committee also said that if Britain's selective cull had to be extended, the progressive lifting of the European ban on exports of British beef would have to be delayed.

<P>

Earlier, a hastily arranged announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture suggested that the risk of so called "maternal transmission" was about 10 per cent in BSE-infected cattle and as low as 1 per cent across the national herd. Government officials emphasised that there was no extra risk to human health.

<P>

But Mr Hogg conceded that the existing slaughter scheme might have to be widened to include a limited number of the "last-borns" from infected cows. This was because government scientists had found during a study of 600 cattle born in 1989 &#173; half of them to confirmed BSE cases &#173; that transmission of the disease was more likely to occur in the latter stages of the incubation period. In virtually all the cases the mothers died within six months of giving birth.

<P>

However, the Government's advisers appeared to be at odds with Mr Hogg. Professor John Pattison, who chairs the BSE advisory committee, said that all calves of infected cattle might have to be slaughtered. "It is one option that has to be considered," he said. Mr Hogg insisted that it was "logical" to consider killing only the last-born calf of infected cows.

<P>

The new findings may help to clarify why some 30,000 cattle, born after the suspect feed blamed for causing BSE was banned, went on to contract the disease.

<P>

There are no conclusions on precisely how BSE was passed from mothers to calves, whether genetically, through the womb, or at birth. The Government said that while the route of maternal transmission was still a mystery, BSE could not be passed through milk. Calves did not drink the milk produced by their mothers; that was saved for human consumption.

Opposition parties criticised the way officials and not ministers had dropped the new bombshell and critics of the Government's BSE policy went on the warpath.

<P>

Richard Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds University who issued a warning long before the Government did that BSE could be transmitted to humans, said the findings implied that the disease was passed in the blood.


<B>"If it's in the blood it means that all beef products are dangerous,"</B> he said. "This means there should be a total ban on beef products in this country and we should slaughter all infected herds. It is going to be devastating."

<P>

In Brussels Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer, told his EU colleagues of the result of the study and said Britain would now consider whether it was necessary to extend the planned selective slaughter of 147,000 cattle.


Around a million cattle aged 30 months and over are also being slaughtered and Brussels could even insist that the 30-month ceiling be lowered. Mr Meldrum faced a barrage of questions at an emergency meeting of the EU's standing veterinary committee.


Mr Hogg said: "We shall need to take stock of the practical implications, in particular for the proposed selective cull of cattle, and what basis of selection stands to produce the most effective acceleration in the decline of BSE."

<P>

Meanwhile, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, which advises the Government on BSE and its human equivalent, CJD, insisted that no new action was needed to protect public health. It said: "There is no case for changing its recommendations in relation to milk, meat, blood or any other product which is currently permitted".

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="SEAC">SEAC</A> Statement on Maternal Transmission of BSE</CENTER></H3>

Distributed to Brussels press corps 8.2.96 by<BR>
Vicky Bowman,<BR>
UK Permanent Rep. to the EU Information officer
<P>

1.      The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered
at its meeting on the 19 July 1966 an interim report on a study conducted by
the Epidemiology Department, Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge to
investigate the possibility of cow to calf transmission of BSE.  The study
involved assembling two groups of animals with over 300 cattle in each.  One
group consisted of offspring of confirmed cases of BSE whilst the other
group comprised animals born in the same herd and in the same calving season
whose dam had reached at least 6 years of age without developing clinical
signs of BSE.  The animals in the two groups were kept until the age of 7 or
until BSE or another disease intervened.  BSE occurred in both groups as the
cattle were born around the time of the ruminant feed ban in 1988 and the
cattle, or at least some of them, in both groups would have been exposed to
infected feed.<P>


2.      As at the 14 July 1996, 273 animals in each group had reached the
age of 7 and had been slaughtered or had developed disease.  55 animals are
still alive and histological results are pending for 8 animals.  Of the 273
animals born to dams with BSE, 42 have developed histologically confirmed
BSE.  In the 273 animals born to mothers who had not developed BSE 13 were
histologically confirmed as having BSE.  This provides evidence that the
risk of maternal transmission is approximately 10% for the BSE infected cows
whose calves were studied.  The statistical confidence limits for that
figure are 5-15%, this range being a reflection of the numbers of animals in
the study and of the numbers developing BSE.  It is highly unlikely that the
results from the histological examination of the brains of the 63 remaining
animals will materially alter these findings.<P>

3.      An analysis has been made of the inteval between the birth of the
animals in the study and the onset of clinical BSE in their mothers.  All of
the calves in the study were born within 13 months of the clinical onset of
BSE in their dams, and the great majority were born within 5 months of
clinical onset.  Thus the study does not provide a good estimate of the risk
to animals born more than 6 months before the onset of BSE in the dam.
However, the findings provide some, albeit limited, evidence that there is
an enhanced risk of maternal transmission in the last 6 months of the BSE
incubation period.  It is plausible that the risk of maternal transmission
reduces markedly as the interval between the birth of the calf and the onset
of BSE in the dam increases.  Therefore, the risk of maternal transmission
observed under the study conditions is likely to be greater tha nwould be
expected for the entire population of cows.  Under field conditions, only a
fraction of the BSE-infected cows giving birth would be within 6 months of
demonstrating clinical signs of BSE because of the long incubation period of
the disease.  The average incubation period is 60 months and, if the rate of
cow to calf transmission over the last 6 months of the incubation is 10% and
it is insignificant before that time, then the average transmission from cow
to calf over the 60 months duration of infection in an animal prior to
developing clinical disease will be 1%.  this would be the rate of maternal
transmission that would be observed under field conditions.<P>

4.      Maternal transmission at the rates observed in husbandry conditions
of the UK dairy herd will not lead to the permanent establishment of BSE
even at a low incidence in the UK herd.  It will die out, as it already
clearly is doing, as a consequence of the restrictions on the primary mode
of transmission through infected feed.  The study itself provides no new
evidence in relation to horizontal transmission.  Since the meeting of SEAC
on 19 July the Epidemiology Department at CVL has examined the data from
this study and that pertaining to the herds from which study animals were
taken and has found no evidence of horizontal transmission.<P>

5.      The study tells us nothing about the route of matenal transmission,
which could be 'in utero', at birth or soon after birth.  In sheep scrapie
where there is also evidence of maternal transmission, infectivity can be
detected in the placenta.  Furthermore in sheep scrapie there is evidence of
'in utero' transmission from an experiment where the embryo from a scrapie
infected sheep was transplanted into a healthy ewe and when that ewe gave
birth the lamb eventually went on to develop scrapie.  Similar embryo
transfer experiments are underway in cattle but results are not yet
available.  Infectivity has however not been detected in the bovine placenta
or in milk, or in blood*.<P>

*       Data from standard transmission experiments following parenteral
inoculation         into mice.  Details are given in Table 7 of the MAFF
Progress Report on BSE,         published in June 1996.<P>

6.      the Committee considered whether evidence of maternal transmission
calls into question the existing recommendations to protect public health.
These were drawn up on the assumption that BSE could be a risk to man, which
is still not proven, and on the assumption that maternal transmission could
occur.  The Committee have concluded that there is no case for changing its
recommendations* in relation to milk, meat, blood or any other product which
is currently permitted.<P>

*       In its statement of 20 March about the new variant of CJD the SEAC said:
       
         "The Committee does not consider that these findings lead it to
revise its         advice on the safety of milk.

        "If the recommendations set out above [i.e. for the proper
inforcement of SBO         controls and the deboning of cattle over 30
months] are carried out the Committee         concluded that the risk from
eating beef is now likely to be extremely small."<P>

7.      There is no evidence from any of the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies that infectivity can be transmitted through milk.  In
commercial dairy herds where the bulk of BSE cases arise calves do not
receive their mothers milk except for the first few days of life when they
receive the special milk produced at the time called colostrum.  Colostrum
is different in nature from ordinary milk and is not sold for human
consumption.  In the beef suckler herds it is common practice for calves to
be suckled by their mothers for up to six months.  Existing data do not
provide evidence to suggest that the rate of maternal transmission in beef
suckler calves who have prolonged exposure to their mother's milk is any
different to that in dairy herds where the only exposure would be to
colostrum int he first few days of life.  The Committee was pleased to note
that the Epidemiology Department at CVL is undertaking further detailed
studies on this point, and that the results of these studies will be
available very soon.<P>

8.      The Committee recognise the role of the ACDP and the HSE in relation
to the occupational risks.  The Committee draws the attention of those
bodies to these new findings but does not make any recommendations for
further action other than that the two bodies should consider the evidence
and any implications for occupational health.<P>

9.      The Committee considered the position in relation to the measures to
eradicate BSE? particularly in relation to any selective cull implemented by
Government.  It is clear from the new information that maternal transmission
will not perpetuate the disease and that BSE will therefore die out even in
the absence of any form of selective cull.  The Committee were made aware
that preliminary analyses of the effect of these new results on a culling
policy had been undertaken but that these were as yet incomplete.
Nevertheless the Committee recommends that the results of the completed
analyses be taken into account before final decisions are made about the
policy for a selective cull.  Finally, the Committee considered what further
research might be of high priority in the light of the results of this study
and the matter will be the subject of a separate report.

<CENTER><I>Huge new cull in calves scare</I></CENTER><P>

TENS OF thousands of extra cattle face slaughter as a result of the
latest crisis over BSE, it was revealed today. At the same time, the EU
in Brussels confirmed that the framework for lifting the ban on British
beef sales, painfully won by John Major, has now effectively collapsed.
<P>

The estimated cull increase - the most authoritative yet - came from the
head of the Meat and Livestock Commission, Colin Maclean. He said that
the number of calves that would have to be killed as a result of the
evidence that mad cow disease could be transferred from mother to young
would probably be "in the low tens of thousands." Mr Maclean made clear,
however, that with guesswork still involved the numbers could go higher.
Other estimates put the figure as high as 50,000. In Brussels, aides to
the EU's Farm Commissioner, Franz Fischler, said they expected Britain
now to offer changes to the planned cull of 147,000 older cattle. <P>

More seriously, the most senior EU expert Lars Hoelgaard, chairman of
the vet's committee, said that a brand new slaughter programme would now
have to be devised and put into operation and that was bound to prolong
the ban on beef sales. "Any changes to the selective slaughter programme
will inevitably lead to further delays in meeting the requirements for
the ban to be lifted," said Mr Hoelgaard. <P>

That news was a severe political blow for John Major, threatening him
with fresh trouble from worried Tory MPs. At the end of June, the Prime
Minister told the Commons he expected a substantial easing of the export
ban in two stages, the first in October, the next a month later - by
which time only limited curbs would remain. He hailed the progress won
at the EU summit in Florence as the direct result of his blocking
tactics, refusing to give assent to EU decisions. Those targets now look
unattainable. <P>

A spokeswoman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, where concern over
the hazard to human health has been strongest, said today that she
expected it would take "years" before British beef was back on sale
there. The few Ministers and Tory MPs still around Westminster were
privately voicing relief that the Commons was dispersed for the long
summer break. That meant Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg escaped the
wave of criticism which would otherwise have engulfed him over the
handling of yesterday's announcement that BSE could pass from mother to
calf, reversing the Government's earlier stance.
<HR>
<H3><CENTER> EU <A NAME="threatens">threatens</A> to extend ban on British beef</CENTER></H3>

<I>Hogg: "slaughter will have to be extended"</I><P>


THE Government's efforts to restore faith in the beef industry suffered
a new setback yesterday after it revealed evidence for the first time
that "mad cow" disease can be passed from mother to calf.<P>

The demolition of previous claims that the disease could only be passed
through food threw its strategy for eradicating bovine spongiform
encephalopathy into confusion.<P>

Ministers immediately acknowledged that plans for the selective
slaughter of 147,000 cows from previously infected herds would be
rethought. Thousands more may have to be killed and the new findings are
likely to delay any partial lifting of the export ban which, after the
Florence summit, John Major predicted could happen within months.<P>

Last night, in a surprise move signalling a potential new confrontation
between London and Brussels, Franz Fischler, the EU Agriculture
Commissioner, told the Government that the European Commission would now
have to review its approval of Britain's previously agreed plans for
eradicating the disease.<P>

Herr Fischler has written to Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister,
asking for further details of the findings. The EU's Standing Veterinary
Committee also said that if Britain's selective cull had to be extended,
the progressive lifting of the European ban on exports of British beef
would have to be delayed.<P>

Earlier, a hastily arranged announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture
suggested that the risk of so called "maternal transmission" was about
10 per cent in BSE-infected cattle and as low as 1 per cent across the
national herd. Government officials emphasised that there was no extra
risk to human health.<P>

But Mr Hogg conceded that the existing slaughter scheme might have to be
widened to include a limited number of the "last-borns" from infected
cows. This was because government scientists had found during a study of
600 cattle born in 1989, half of them to confirmed BSE cases, that
transmission of the disease was more likely to occur in the latter
stages of the incubation period. In virtually all the cases the mothers
died within six months of giving birth.<P>

However, the Government's advisers appeared to be at odds with Mr Hogg.
Professor John Pattison, who chairs the BSE advisory committee, said
that all calves of infected cattle might have to be slaughtered. "It is
one option that has to be considered," he said. Mr Hogg insisted that it
was "logical" to consider killing only the last-born calf of infected
cows.<P>

The new findings may help to clarify why some 30,000 cattle, born after
the suspect feed blamed for causing BSE was banned, went on to contract
the disease.<P>

There are no conclusions on precisely how BSE was passed from mothers to
calves, whether genetically, through the womb, or at birth. The
Government said that while the route of maternal transmission was still
a mystery, BSE could not be passed through milk. Calves did not drink
the milk produced by their mothers; that was saved for human
consumption.<P>

Opposition parties criticised the way officials and not ministers had
dropped the new bombshell and critics of the Government's BSE policy
went on the warpath.<P>

Richard Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds University who issued a warning
long before the Government did that BSE could be transmitted to humans,
said the findings implied that the disease was passed in the blood.<P>

"If it's in the blood it means that all beef products are dangerous," he
said. "This means there should be a total ban on beef products in this
country and we should slaughter all infected herds. It is going to be
devastating."<P>

In Brussels Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer,
told his EU colleagues of the result of the study and said Britain would
now consider whether it was necessary to extend the planned selective
slaughter of 147,000 cattle.<P>

Around a million cattle aged 30 months and over are also being
slaughtered and Brussels could even insist that the 30-month ceiling be
lowered. Mr Meldrum faced a barrage of questions at an emergency meeting
of the EU's standing veterinary committee.<P>

Mr Hogg said: "We shall need to take stock of the practical
implications, in particular for the proposed selective cull of cattle,
and what basis of selection stands to produce the most effective
acceleration in the decline of BSE."<P>

Meanwhile, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, which
advises the Government on BSE and its human equivalent, CJD, insisted
that no new action was needed to protect public health. It said: "There
is no case for changing its recommendations in relation to milk, meat,
blood or any other product which is currently permitted".

Editor, Country Life<BR>
The Times: Opinion: August 2 1996
<P>


 Yesterday, as Britain's beef and dairy farmers sat down to the evening news, they heard one of their worst fears realised. Until then, it seemed possible that cattle could only contract the brain disease BSE by eating feed containing the ground up remains of sheep and other cattle. This idea was supported by the dramatic fall in the incidence of BSE after the feed was banned. But the ban should, in theory, have eliminated BSE completely from British herds. In fact, cases continue to occur at a rate of almost 200 a week.

<P>

Officials tried hard to find explanations which supported the original hypothesis, though they never sounded very convincing. One heard that tests at government research stations, to be completed at the end of this year, were expected to indicate that BSE could not be transmitted vertically, from mother cow to calf. Farmers now know that this hope was unfounded. In a very small number of cases, vertical transmission does seem to be taking place.

<P>

The findings are provisional, but they could have devastating consequences. They make nonsense of the Government's policyof culling older cattle as a means of exterminating BSE. If BSE is to be stamped out, the cull will have to extend to the progeny of all diseased cattle. Already, before yesterday's announcement, the Government had accepted that its slaughter policy would kill 50 healthy animals for every one that was infected. This was an appalling and tragic waste. Now it is possible that far greater numbers of cattle will have to be sacrificed.

<P>

Some farmers have already gone to the wall over BSE. Very few if any new cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in young people &#173; with which there may conceivably be a link with BSE &#173; have appeared since the spring. So it may yet be that more deaths will result from farmers committing suicide than from children eating hamburgers. On the other hand, some farmers have already taken such a battering that they will barely notice the latest burden. Alan Bartletts, the chairman of the Somerset branch of the National Farmers Union, consoles himself with the thought that only 1 per cent of calves born to BSE-infected cows will have contracted BSE from their mothers. This, he points out, is a very small number &#173; not to be confused with 1 per cent of the national herd.

<P>

The ghastly prospect that it may be possible for BSE to be transmitted through milk is quashed by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee's report. While the scientists do not believe that BSE is passed from cow to calf through blood, they equally assure us that milk is safe. "In commercial dairy herds where the bulk of BSE cases arise, calves do not receive their mothers' milk except for the first few days of life, when they receive the special milk produced at that time called colostrum. Colostrum is different in nature from ordinary milk and is not sold for human consumption." These words will be cherished not just by farmers, but cheesemakers, chocolate makers and the makers of a host of processed foods. They should avert the Government's ultimate nightmare of the slaughter of the whole of the British dairy herd.

<P>

Even so, the ministry's stock has never been so low among the farmers who are part of its supposed constituency. Last week, the Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, led his entire team of ministers to the Game Fair, in Lincolnshire, his object clearly being to demonstrate the ministry's presence in the countryside. Mr Hogg made a vigorous defence of country sports. Anyone who saw him &#173; looking, as someone said, "as grey as a corpse and lolling like a rag doll" &#173; cannot doubt the strain he has been under. Most country people think someone must pay the price of a decade of incompetence in the ministry. That someone is Mr Hogg.

<P>

The manner of yesterday's announcement was unfortunate. Parliament was not sitting, and it happened that the Chief Veterinary Officer was scheduled to attend a meeting of the European vets. Consequently the news was made by press release. Why did Mr Hogg and others not make themselves immediately available to answer questions? The episode recalled the disastrous announcement of the original findings about a possible link between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Then the scientists had not troubled to warn ministers of the likely outcome of their deliberations. No contingency plans were in place.

<P>

The impression of incompetence &#173; by officials if not by ministers &#173; was confirmed by the manner of introducing the slaughter policy. Endless mistakes showed that the ministry, despite being dedicated to a single industry, did not understand how beef and dairy farming operate. Rationalisation has deprived the ministry of its farm advisory service, where practical experience was concentrated. It is the chaos of the slaughter policy, only partially mitigated since April, that really distresses farmers such as Mr Bartletts.

<P>

The largest measure of blame may lie not with Douglas Hogg, but even higher in the Government. The Prime Minister identified his objective in typically political terms. This is to get the European Union's worldwide ban on British exports lifted as soon as possible. He ignores the uncomfortable reality, which is that even if the EU were to relax the ban, most other countries would maintain their own bans, which have also been imposed. There would be no one to take the meat, even if we were allowed to export it.

<P>

In Florence, the Prime Minister pledged to sacrifice an even greater number of cattle to achieve the "framework" by which the ban might be lifted. In supplication to the Euro-sceptics within his party, he even expressed the hope that the conditions for recommencing exports of British beef would be met by October. There was never any possibility of reaching that target, and he must have known it.

<P>

Before yesterday's announcement, Jacques Santer, the President of the European Commission, said that he believed it would be five years before the ban was lifted. Now that period could be doubled. What farmers need to see is leadership to restructure their industry. Rather than squandering billions of pounds on the slaughtering of cattle to fulfil political objectives, it would be better to set in train policies that would, in five or ten years' time, restore the prestige of Britain's beef and dairy industries, making them the best in the world.

<P>

At present, Britain's farmers are in limbo. Parliament's summer recess means that they must wait until October before they find out about the new rules for tracing the "cohorts" of BSE-infected cattle. They need to know the worst now. They need to plan. Then they must be given the confidence to rebuild their shattered businesses.<HR>

The Times: Britain: August 2 1996<BR>

BY PHILIP WEBSTER, POLITICAL EDITOR<P>

 ONCE again the Government has contradicted its own past advice on "mad cow" disease. Years of reassurances from ministers and scientists that there is no evidence that cows can pass BSE on to calves were overturned yesterday by the Ministry of Agriculture's statement that "there may be very low levels of maternal transmission of BSE in cattle".

<P>

Like all previous BSE "thunderbolts", yesterday's came out of the blue. Conveniently for the Government it came after the Commons rose for the long summer recess. Although the Government received the results of the seven-year study by the epidemiology department at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, in the middle of last month, officials insisted yesterday that it had not been in a position to release them at that time. Instead, as usual, the findings were sent to the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (Seac) for assessment and its conclusions landed on the desks of ministers early this week.

<P>

However, the manner of yesterday's announcement was not ex actly designed to raise public confidence in the Government's handling of an issue on which previous soothing words have proved to be worthless. It was driven by the fact that Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, was to have appeared at yesterday's meeting in Brussels of European Union vets.

<P>

In the past Britain has been berated for keeping them in the dark; it was decided therefore that Mr Meldrum would tell all at this meeting, and that the press would also be told at home. Specialist correspondents were invited along to a ministry talk from experts.

<P>

The BBC sent several reporters and what was intended to be a tight briefing developed into something close to a press conference. No minister was present and it only after the news broke during the morning did Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, go into action with a series of broadcasts.

<P>

The Government was swift to assure the public that the latest findings had no implications for human health. The public may be forgiven for treating those words with some caution.

<P>

BSE came to public attention in 1985 at a cattle show near Ashford, Kent, where cows were showing unusual symptoms, identified the following year as BSE. In 1988 scientists said that it affected only older cattle fed on scrapie-infected sheep offal, and the ministry said there was no evidence to suggest that it could cross the species barrier to affect others. The next year the Government's specialist committee said the disease could not be passed from cow to calf. In 1993 independent scientists began warning of a link between BSE and a disease that affected humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, the Government continued to deny that it could cross the species barrier, with ministers stating that there was no evidence that BSE could be transmitted to humans.

<P>

It was in March this year that Stephen Dorrell, the Health Secretary, said for the first time that government scientists believed there was a possible link between "mad cow" disease and CJD in humans. Its claim that beef could be eaten with confidence was met with a worldwide ban imposed by the EU and steeply falling sales in Britain. However, the Government again insisted that the disease could not be transmitted from cows to calves.

<P>

Only two weeks ago came another "thunderbolt". There was now a strong possibility that BSE could affect sheep and there was risk inherent in the consumption of the brain, spinal chord or intestines. Yesterday's admission that the disease could pass from generation to generation punched the latest hole in the Government's campaign to allay public concern. Its record so far suggests it may not be the last.

<P>

 WOMEN who develop the human form of "mad cow" disease may pass it on to their children, a leading British expert warned yesterday.

Dr Sheila Gore, of the Medical Research Council's biostatistics unit in Cambridge, said monitoring was vital, in the light of new evidence that mad cow disease can be passed from mother to calf.



Dr Gore, who is among those who have been pressing the Ministry of Agriculture to publish results from its experiments &#173; because of the implications its results may have for human disease &#173; yesterday welcomed its decision to do so.

<P>

The original plan had been to keep the experiment going until 1997, with the scientists "blinded" &#173; unaware of which animals came from infected mothers and which did not. Pressure has forced the Ministry to abandon this experiment early.

<P>

"We need to know how many children there are born to women who later contract this variant of CJD [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]," Dr Gore said. "We also need to know dates of birth, so that the children can be flagged with the Registrar-General, and kept track of."

<P>

The Health Department said that such monitoring was already being done, as part of the work of the CJD Surveilance Unit in Edinburgh. "They look at the family history of all cases of CJD, and that would go forward as well as backwards" a spokeswoman said.

<P>

So far, the CJD unit has identified 11 patients with the form of CJD which has been tentatively linked with BSE. All but one have already died, and none has been named by the unit, so it is impossible to say whether any were mothers with children at risk.

<P>

Dr Gore points out that human births take place in far more controlled conditions than calving, which may reduce the risk of transmission. But it is not clear how maternal transmission in cows occurs. If it is in the womb rather than during birth or after birth, it may just as easily occur in human beings.

<P>

"I am not trying to cause alarm but I think it is important that the question of maternal transmission is raised for all species that are subject to these diseases" she said.

"For the first time we are seeing cases of CJD in women still in their child-bearing years. All I am saying is let us not make the mistake of not getting the data." At least three mothers died of CJD last year. Although it is unclear whether they had the new strain &#173; which could be linked with BSE &#173; it is known to afflict the under-45s. Old-style CJD usually strikes after the age of 63.

<P>

Jean Wake, 38, a divorc&eacute;e with a 15-year-old daughter from Washington, Tyne and Wear, died last November after a long illness. She had spent four months in hospital, the last three unable to recognise her family.


Michelle Bowen, 29, of Harpurhey, Manchester, also died last November, weeks after her baby was delivered by Caesarian section while she was in a coma. She had worked in a butcher's shop when she was a teenager.


Margaret Garland, 52, a mother of two, died in June last year. Her husband, John, a microbiologist, accused the Government at the time of treating consumers like dirt.

<H3><CENTER>Seven-year <A NAME="study">study</A> shows difficulty of disease eradication</CENTER></H3>



BY NIGEL HAWKES, SCIENCE EDITOR
The Times: Britain: August 2 1996
<P>

 THE discovery by government scientists that cows can pass on BSE to their calves means that eradicating the disease from British herds is likely to prove more difficult than thought.


The results of the seven-year study suggest that sporadic cases of BSE are likely to occur for many years. However, the Ministry of Agriculture said that the transmission from cow to calf was rare enough to ensure that BSE levels, which are falling at present by 40 per cent a year, should continue to decline rapidly.

<P>

The findings stem from an experiment in which 315 calves from cows which developed BSE were compared with a similar number of calves from cows of the same herd which had not shown signs of the disease by the age of six. The experiment, conducted by the Central Veterinary Laboratory on a farm in Yorkshire, involved monitoring the calves as they grew to see whether the offspring of BSE cows were more likely to contract the disease than those whose mothers were free of it.

<P>

By July 14, 273 animals in each group had reached the age of seven and had been slaughtered, or had developed disease. Of those with BSE-infected mothers, 42 have been confirmed as having BSE. In the other group, 13 have developed BSE. This means that there is an excess risk in the group with BSE-infected mothers of 29, or roughly 10 per cent of the calves. It follows that about one in ten of the calves born to BSE-infected cows is likely to get the disease from its mother.

<P>

The experiment proves that maternal transmission takes place, but does not give a very accurate estimate of how great it is. All the calves in the study were born in the 13 months before their mothers showed clinical evidence of BSE, and the great majority within five months of clinical onset.

<P>

Putting the best possible complexion on the figures, the ministry suggests that the risk is concentrated in the last six months or so before clinical symptoms appear. Since cows on average produce calves over five years, or 60 months, this means &#173; the ministry asserts &#173; that the 10 per cent risk is in reality only 1 per cent in farm conditions.

<P>

If true, this means that only the last calf born to a cow before she develops BSE stands a real risk of getting the disease. So a slaughter policy that concentrated on the final calf born to an infected mother might be justified, and is one option being considered by the ministry.

<P>

Typically, cows have their first calf when they are a year or two old. After that, a farmer would ideally aim for a further calf every year for as long as the cow is productive, typically seven or eight years, but sometimes longer. That means that in total a dairy cow might have six or more calves.

<P>

The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (Seac), in a statement issued yesterday, concedes that the experiment "does not provide a good estimate of the risk to animals born more than six months before the onset of BSE in the dam". Only if the risk of transmission is insignificant before that time is the 1 per cent figure quoted by the ministry appropriate.

<P>

Kevin Taylor, Assistant Chief Veterinary Officer, said it was still a mystery how the disease was transmitted from cow to calf. It could not be passed through milk, because the calves of dairy cows do not drink their mother's milk. It was possible infection could occur through the embryo, placenta or uterine discharge.

<P>

He also said that it was difficult to quantify how many calves had acquired BSE from their mothers. Of a total of 28,402 cases of BSE in animals born after infected feed was banned, 1,203 were the offspring of diseased animals. "That rate is 4.2 per cent, but that's misleading because many of them will also have been exposed to the risk of feed" he said. The figure was broadly consistent with the research findings.

<P>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said of the findings: "It is important to keep this information in perspective. The Chief Veterinary Officer endorses Seac's conclusions that there is no case for changing recommendations in relation to milk, meat or any other product which is currently permitted."

<P>

But Helen Grant, a retired neuropathologist from Charing Cross Hospital in London, who has been a constant critic of the Government over BSE, said that the ministry <B>should now follow advice to ban calves' brains from human consumption</B>.

<P>

In its report Seac says that an analysis was made of the interval between the birth of the animals in the study and the onset of clinical BSE in their mothers. All of the calves in the study were born within 13 months of the clinical onset of BSE in their dams, and the great majority were born within five months of clinical onset.

<P>

Thus the study does not provide a good estimate of the risk to animals born more than six months before the onset of BSE in the dam. However, the findings provide some, albeit limited, evidence that there is an enhanced risk of maternal transmission in the last six months of the incubation period.

<P>

Seac says it is plausible that the risk of maternal transmission reduces markedly as the interval between the birth of the calf and the onset of BSE in the dam increases. So the risk of maternal transmission ob served under the study conditions is likely to be greater than would be expected for the entire population of cows.


Under field conditions, only a fraction of the BSE-infected cows giving birth would be within six months of demonstrating clinical signs of BSE because of the long incubation period of the disease.

<P>

Maternal transmission at the rates observed will not lead to the permanent establishment of BSE even at a low incidence in the British herd, the study says. It will die out, as it already clearly is doing, as a consequence of the restrictions on the primary mode of transmission through infected feed.

<P>

Seac says that the study tells us nothing about the route of maternal transmission, which could be <I>in utero,</I> at birth or soon after birth. In sheep scrapie, where there is also evidence of maternal transmission, infectivity can be detected in the placenta.


There is also evidence of <I>in utero</I> transmission from an experiment where the embryo from a scrapie-infected sheep was transplanted into a healthy ewe. When that ewe gave birth the lamb eventually went on to develop scrapie.


Similar embryo-transfer experiments are under way in cattle but results are not yet available. Infectivity. however, has not been detected in the bovine placenta or in milk, or in blood.

<P>

Seac considered whether evidence of maternal transmission calls into question the recommendations to protect public health. These were drawn up on the assumption that BSE could be a risk to man, which is still not proven, and on the assumption that maternal transmission could occur. The committee concluded that there was no case for changing its recommendations in relation to milk, meat, blood or any other product which is presently permitted.

<P>

There is no evidence from any of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that infectivity can be transmitted through milk. In commercial dairy herds, where the bulk of BSE cases arise calves do not receive their mothers milk except for the first few days of life when they receive the special milk produced at that time called colostrum. Colostrum is different in nature from ordinary milk and is not sold for human consumption.

<H3><CENTER>Ministers are increasingly <A NAME="incredible">incredible</A> over BSE</CENTER></H3>

 
The Times: Opinion: August 2 1996<P>

The announcement that BSE can, after all, be passed from cow to calf indicates that this Government still has not learnt how to handle the delicate matter of restoring confidence in British beef. Over four months ago Steven Dorrell, the Health Secretary, alarmed the public and distressed farmers with his maladroit presentation of new evidence which pointed to a link between BSE in cows and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Mr Dorrell's clumsy announcement provoked a public health panic whose consequences still haunt our countryside. Now Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, has again released complex and worrying scientific information in a manner bound to maximise concern. The credibility of this Administration has suffered another blow and it is a mercy for ministers that the Commons is not in session to give them the roasting they deserve.

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture maintains that settled scientific opinion insists there is no new health risk as a result of this announcement. But the Government's BSE record suggests that today's settled scientific opinion can become tomorrow's discredited bromide. In 1988 the Government maintained that BSE could not be passed from cattle to humans. In 1989 the Government's scientists said the disease could not be passed from cow to calf. Both confident assertions have now been contradicted.

<P>

Mr Hogg's admission yesterday came only two weeks after public confidence in farming was further shaken when it was revealed that BSE could affect sheep. Before then ministers had doubted that the disease could spread in this fashion. The history of ministerial management of BSE is of complacency and casualness. No wonder the public's capacity to take them seriously has taken a battering.

<P>

The manner of yesterday's announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture certainly does not suggest a department confident in its conclusions. A private briefing and a bald press release with ministers fugitive for much of the day does not inspire faith. Neither does the content of the ministry's statement. Experiments suggest that BSE is passed from infected cows to calves in 10 per cent of cases. The Ministry argue the risk of transmission is, after adjustment, only 1 per cent. The Ministry may be right, but playing down risks and hoping for the best is not the way to restore confidence.

<P>

Consumer confidence, in this country and especially across Europe, has shown itself a fragile thing. Although the evidence may suggest that there is no new risk to human health the damage has already been done to hopes of an early lift to the ban on British beef exports. The political capital expended during the beef war bought little. Those gains are set at even less after yesterday.

<P>

Political reputations may fall further but ministers, by their mishandling of matters, are the authors of their own misfortune. The largely innocent victims of yesterday's debacle will be the farmers. The slaughter plan which compelled them to cull so many of their livestock looks certain to be extended. It is hard for farmers to face the early death of animals in whom they have invested so much, financially and emotionally. Even if the cull is extended there is little prospect of guaranteeing the eradication of the disease if it can pass from cow to calf. Farmers could face the prospect of the disease lingering in the cow population for years to come, and with it doubts, however unjustified, about British beef. Quality produce has been undermined by ill-qualified ministers. A price will have to be paid.

1 August, 1996<P>

TODAY'S announcement that BSE-infected cows might be able to pass the
disease on to their calves flies in the face of past reassurances from
ministers and Government scientists.<P>

BSE was first identified in 1985 at a cattle show near Ashford in Kent.
The Ministry of Agriculture said that because the disease was so new no
cause for it was known but they would set up a team of scientists to
look into it. In 1988 Government scientists said BSE affected only older
cattle who had been fed on scrapie-infected sheep offal. The Ministry of
Agriculture said there was no evidence mad cow disease could cross the
species barrier to infect any other animal. In 1989 the Government's
special BSE committee of scientists said the disease could not be passed
on from a cow to its calf. In 1993 a cat and a monkey died of a brain
disease that appeared very similar to BSE and independent scientists
began warning of a link between BSE and disease that affected humans,
CJD. The Government denied BSE could cross the species barrier. Reported
BSE cases, which Government scientists had said would begin dying out,
had risen to 800 a week.<P>

 In 1995 Prime Minister John Major said: "There is no evidence that BSE
can be transmitted to humans." In March this year Health Secretary
Stephen Dorrell said, for the first time, that scientists from the BSE
committee had found that there was "probably" a link between mad cow
disease and CJD in humans, but beef could be eaten with confidence.
Scientists again said that there was no evidence that cows could pass
BSE on to calves. Two weeks ago Government scientists said there was the
"strong possibility" that BSE can infect sheep. Today official
scientists admitted for the first time that the disease might pass from
generation to generation in cattle.

IT WAS a momentous development in the BSE crisis - yet no Government
minister attended the journalists' briefing. Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg was "in the office" today, according to a department
spokesman, but the briefing was left to Kevin Taylor, the assistant
chief veterinary officer. The Government planned to release the new
information today at the EU vets' meeting in Brussels and simultaneously
in London. However, it was unprepared for the intensity of the reaction,
with Mr Hogg not even arriving at the Ministry until late morning. Of

<H3><CENTER>BSE strategy flung into <A NAME="confusion">confusion</A></CENTER></H3>

by Charles Reiss, Nick Pryer and Sandra Laville<BR>
London Evening
Standard    ...    Thursday, 1 August, 1996<P>

THE ENTIRE strategy for tackling mad cow disease was flung into
confusion today as the Government revealed evidence, for the first time,
that the illness is being passed from mother to calf. The announcement
demolished the Agriculture Ministry's long-maintained stance that the
disease can only be passed through food. Agriculture Minister Douglas
Hogg conceded that the cull might now have to be widened to include a
limited number of "last-borns" - the youngest offspring of infected
cattle. He insisted the Government had "assumed" for some time that the
disease could pass from mother to calf and he acknowledged that
ministers would have to re-examine the policy of slaughtering older
cattle at risk of having picked up the disease through contaminated
feed. <P>

The announcement brought immediate confusion between the Government and
its advisers about the necessary changes in the slaughter plan, and
stinging condemnation from opposition politicians. Mr Hogg was himself
in the firing line, once again, over the way the news was slipped out by
officials with all ministers initially said to be "out of town". 
<P>
The
most prominent of the Government's critics, microbiologist Richard
Lacey, said: "Obviously the Government has been lying by blaming BSE on
feed, the implications are very serious. "They are going to have to
slaughter whole herds where an animal has been affected, the calf
included.<P>

What it means is that BSE is being passed in blood, which the Government
has always denied." Whitehall at first denied the charge again.
Officials said that the cases found where the disease had been passed
from mother to calf only happened in about one in a hundred cases and
that investigations had "categorically" ruled out the possibility that
blood was the link. But later, the Evening Standard was told by a senior
official that there were a number of possible routes of infection from
mother to calf, of which "blood could be one".<P>

The news was disclosed simultaneously in Brussels by the chief vet Keith
Meldrum, where it sparked a crisis debate in the committee of EU vets.
Liberal Democrat agriculture spokesman Paul Tyler said he was
"completely baffled" by the announcement. "It calls in question the
whole scientific basis for the slaughter programme that they've set in
place now, and it means that hundreds of thousands of cattle may be
unnecessarily culled. The Labour party attacked the way the news had
been announced by officials with no minister present.<P>

The confusion deepened when Mr Hogg publicly disagreed with Professor
John Pattison, who chairs the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee which advises the Government on BSE, over the widening of the
cull. Professor Pattison said all calves of infected cattle might have
to be slaughtered. "It's one option that must be considered now," he
told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. Mr Hogg, however, denied that it
would be necessary to kill all calves of infected cattle.

THE BSE scare crippled trading at Sims, the meat products group, which

The remaining businesses made an underlying profit of 2.2 million pounds

 <H3><CENTER>England Gets Some <A NAME="Bad">Bad</A> News on Mad-Cow Disease</CENTER></H3>


           
            By JOHN DARNTON<BR>
New York Times, International Section ... August 2, 1996
<P>

                 LONDON -- The government said on Thursday that scientific
                 experimentation had shown that so-called mad-cow
                 disease, which had been thought to be transmitted through
            contaminated feed, could also be passed directly from a cow to her
            calf.<P>

            The findings from a seven-year study did not pinpoint the means
            of direct transmission, but they could complicate efforts to
            eradicate the disease, called bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
            which has crippled the $6.5-billion British beef industry after
being
            linked four months ago to a similar fatal brain disease in humans.

            They explain why cows in Britain have continued to develop the
            disease despite a ban on potential contaminants in cattle feed that
            went into effect in July 1988. The Ministry of Agriculture says that
            28,402 cows born since then have come down with the disease.

            Up to now, the government has explained new outbreaks of the
            disease by suggesting that farmers may have ignored the
            regulations by continuing to use old stocks of feed.<P>

            The new data indicates that even more stringent culling of
            Britain's 11.8 million cattle herd may be needed to wipe out
            mad-cow disease. Until now, the government's strategy has been
            based on the idea of killing off older cows, which had been deemed
            to be more at risk of developing the disease.

            Seeking to alleviate fears from the study, the government
            emphasized on Thursday that the rate of direct transmission was
            low and that measures now in place should be sufficient to contain
            it. Agriculture Ministry officials insisted that there was no
            evidence that humans are at a greater risk of contracting the
            human equivalent -- Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, also a fatal brain
            disorder -- by drinking milk from an infected cow.<P>

            "It is important to keep this information in perspective," Douglas
            Hogg, the agriculture minister, said in a statement. "There is no
            case for changing recommendations in relation to milk, meat,
            blood, or any other product which is currently permitted."<P>

            On March 27, the European Union reacted to an admission by the
            British government of a probable link between mad-cow disease
            and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease by imposing a worldwide ban on
            exports of British beef and beef products. Since then, Britain has
            been at odds with its main trading partners, arguing that the ban
            is not justified by scientific evidence and resisting demands for
            strict measures to curtail the epidemic.<P>

            The latest news is bound to be another blow to the British beef
            industry, which is still reeling from a consumer scare from the
            earlier disclosures.

            In an effort to curb the disease, the government has been killing
            off cattle over the age of 30 months. Since the program began
            March 20, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, 257,000 cows
            have been killed.

            The government has not yet begun a secondary program to cull
            herds most afflicted with mad-cow disease. That program is
            scheduled to start in the autumn and is scheduled to include
            120,000 to 140,000 animals.<P>

            The number of cows to be killed has been the subject of a lively
            debate between Britain and the rest of the European Union, which
            has been pushing for stronger measures to restore consumer
            confidence in European beef. The issue has been among the most
            divisive the alliance has faced in recent years.<P>

            Some critics of the government's handling of the crisis disagreed
            with its assertion that the new findings meant little new danger.
            The evidence suggested that the disease could be transmitted
            through the blood, said Richard Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds
            University who years ago warned that the disease might affect
            humans.
<P>

           <B> "If it's in the blood, it means that all beef products are
dangerous,"</B>
            he told Reuters. "This means there should be a total ban on beef
            products in this country and we should slaughter all infected
            herds. It is going to be devastating."

<H3><CENTER>UK findings on BSE may delay lifting of beef
ban</CENTER></H3>

By Deborah Hargreaves in London and Neil Buckley in Brussels    ...
The Financial Times    ...   Friday August 2 1996<P>

British scientists have discovered that BSE, or mad cow disease, can be
transmitted from cows to their calves. The announcement raised fears
that the UK government may have to increase its selective slaughter
programme of cows and that the phased lifting of the world ban on UK
beef exports may be delayed.<P>

Mr Keith Meldrum, the UK's chief veterinary officer, told scientific
veterinary experts from European Union states in Brussels yesterday that
experiments by the UK Ministry of Agriculture over the past six years
pointed to the disease being passed from mothers to calves at the rate
of 1 per cent.<P>

The research may raise questions about extending the cull of British
cattle, due to start in October, beyond the 147,000 considered most at
risk of contracting BSE.<P>

"We will have to re.evaluate our eradication programme and see if any
changes have to be made," said Mr Meldrum. If so, he added, changes
would be put to the European Commission and member states next month.<P>

Mr Lars Hoelgaard, Danish chairman of the veterinary committee, warned
that an increase in the cull could postpone the start of the phased
lifting of the world ban on UK beef exports.<P>

Researchers do not know how the disease is passed to calves, it could
occur in the uterus, at birth or soon after. The ministry said there was
no evidence it was passed through milk, as calves born to dairy cows do
not drink their mothers' milk.<P>

The ministry has always said there was a slight possibility of such a
finding and sought to play it down. "It is important to keep this
information in perspective . . . there is no case for changing
recommendations in relation to milk, meat, blood or any other product
which is currently permitted," said Mr Douglas Hogg, UK agriculture
minister.<P>

But Britain's Consumers' Association reiterated its advice to shoppers
that the only way to be absolutely safe was to eat no beef at all.
"Calves born to cows in the pre.clinical stages of BSE could have got
into the human food chain," said Mr David Dickinson from the
association.<P>

The evidence that cows can pass on the disease helps explain the
incidence of BSE among cattle born after the ban on contaminated feed,
which is believed to have caused BSE, in 1988.<P>

Government figures show that 28,402 cattle born after the feed ban have
since contracted BSE. Some 1,200 calves born to those cattle have also
contracted the disease, but the ministry stressed this was not proof
that all such cattle caught the disease from their mothers.<P>

The UK National Farmers' Union said the research showed the likelihood
of maternal transmission to be far too low to sustain the BSE
epidemic.<P>

The number of new BSE cases has dropped below 200 a week, compared with
1,000 at the height of the crisis in 1993 and the government expects the
disease to be virtually eradicated by 2000.<P>

Mr Richard Carden, head of the ministry's food and safety directorate,
said maternal transmission would not prevent the eradication of BSE.<P>

The Daily
Telegraph<BR>
Friday August 2 1996<P>

EFFORTS to solve the BSE crisis were thrown into confusion yesterday
when new evidence showed that the disease could spread from cow to
calf.

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, admitted that this could force
the extension of the selective slaughter scheme beyond the 120,000 to
140,000 cattle planned. Germany immediately called for a total
restoration of the British beef exports ban.<P>

Franz Fischler, the EU agriculture commissioner, wrote to Mr Hogg last
night, saying that the news was a "disappointing setback, which risks
complicating the whole discussion". He said it would be necessary to
review the eradication plan and the timetable for lifting the exports
ban. So far the European Commission has authorised only the export of
bull semen.<P>

Barbel Hohn, the agriculture minister in North.Rhine/Westphalia, said:
"<B>Our worst fears have been confirmed. New findings about the ways BSE
can be transmitted are continually being admitted.</B>"<P>

While ministers and scientists stressed that there were no new
implications for human health, officials were unable to say how many
calves might be affected. <B>The BSE eradication programme is already
costing 2.4 billion pounds.</B><P>

The new evidence, the result of a small study started in 1989, was
published by the Ministry of Agriculture's central veterinary laboratory
at Weybridge, Surrey. It showed that one calf in 10 was at risk from an
infected cow.

Scientists and ministers emphasised that the new evidence would not
prevent the eradication of BSE and that the study was simply a
confirmation of a widely held view. [???]

Government scientists said that the risk was closer to one per cent if
the realities of cattle breeding were taken into account.

The news brought immediate criticism of the Government for failing to
act on warnings by the Commons agriculture select committee six years
ago that farmers should not breed from the offspring of cows with
BSE.<P>

However, Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer, told
fellow EU vets in Brussels that Britain would have to consider extending
the selective slaughter of cattle.
The cull, due to begin in the autumn, aims to remove animals likely to
have been exposed to infected feed between 1989 and 1993. It will also
remove meat from animals over 30 months from the food chain.<P>

When Mr Hogg was asked about a wider cull, he said: "It is logical to
look at that solution and we will do that."

His ministry played down fears of thousands of extra culled animals,
saying that the gestation period of the disease meant that only the
last.born calf would be affected.<P>

The Government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee said that
there was no need for further action to protect public health, beyond
the ban on specified offals already in force.

There was no evidence from any variety of spongiform encephalopathy that
infection could be transmitted through milk, the committee added<P>

It said that with a transmission rate of one per cent, BSE would
continue to die out, as it has been doing as a result of the ban on
animal matter in cattle feed. There was no danger of cow.to.calf
transmission leading to the permanent establishment of BSE in the
national herd.<P>

The committee said there was some evidence of maternal transmission of
sheep scrapie and that infectivity could be detected in the placenta of
sheep. However, there was no evidence of infectivity of the placenta in
cattle, so this was not thought to be the route.
There was no evidence from any variety of spongiform encephalopathy that
infection could be transmitted through milk, the committee added.<P>

Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrats' agriculture spokesman, said: "This
calls into question the whole of the Government's slaughter policy. If
we now cannot believe the scientific advice that ministers have been
dishing out for 12 months and more, why should we believe this latest
theory."<P>

Francis Anthony, adviser on BSE to the British Veterinary Association,
said: "I don't want to put another nail in the chief veterinary
officer's coffin, but I pleaded with him in 1990 not to allow farmers to
breed from the offspring of cattle which had contracted BSE.

"The Commons select committee also said that advice to farmers not to
breed from these cattle would have been sensible. The Government ignored
it."<P>

Yesterday's meeting of EU vets did provide one piece of good news for
Britain by <B>rejecting the European Commission's plan to ban the spleen of
sheep and goats</B> over six months and the central nervous systems of
cattle, sheep and goats from the food chain. A majority of member states
said the plan was unnecessary.<P>

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS<BR>

FROM BEN MACINTYRE IN PARIS ... August 2 1996<P>


HARD on the heels of "mad cow" disease, another bovine affliction has sent a shiver of panic through <I>aficionados</I> of the bullring: weedy bull syndrome.


Many European bulls bred for the ring have become enfeebled, making them poor foes for even the meekest matador. Their frailty is due to a combination of wet weather, inbreeding and over-feeding, according to a report published in France yesterday.


From Arles in southern France to Seville in Spain, bulls are showing a tendency to collapse under their own weight before the first <I>ol&eacute;</I> has sounded. Bullfight organisers say the weakness appears to be linked to genetic problems and obesity.

<P>

Bullfight fans have come to expect ever larger bulls, with many weighing more than half a tonne. In the weeks before a fight, breeders tended to fatten up their animals, but many bulls lack the strength to carry the sudden extra poundage and often keel over without much of a fight.

<P>

"They are artificially fed with fattening food, when they usually eat only wild grass," Hubert Yonnet, a bull-breeder from the Carmargue, told the French magazine, <I>Ev&eacute;nement du Jeudi.</I> Some breeders also send bulls to the ring before they have reached full five-year maturity. Inbreeding is also a problem; at least 70 per cent of Spanish fighting bulls are descended from the champion Andalusian bull, Domecq.

<P>

This year's crop of bulls is particu larly doddery, with the wet, cold weather leaving many stiff in the joints, bronchial and oddly pacific. The magazine said enthusiasts are increasingly turning to South America, where the bulls are leaner and meaner. Often raised on large farms where they must travel great distances for food and water, the South American bulls apparently grow smaller horns but bigger muscles.

<P>

Once bulls from across the Atlantic were sneered at as lesser creatures, but now French and Spanish bullfighters are having to import South American breeding bulls in order, as one commentator put it, "to put the bravery back in our bulls".

Government is the epitomy of the 'king with no clothes' as every one of
its BSE shibboleths has been demolished, BSE:
-       is not scrapie
-       can cross to human beings
-       can cross to most other mammals
-       transmits vertically within a species

All of which has been vehemently denied by the government at various
times over the last decade.</PRE>

<H4>Calf-to Calf horizontal transmission</H4>

There is the as yet unexplained
observation, in a case control study, of a tendency to subsequent
infection in calves from uninfected dams born on the same day as, or
within a few days after,  calves from BSE-infected dams in the same
herd:
<P>
Hoinville L J et al (1995)  "An investigation of risk factors
for cases of BSE born after the introduction of the feed ban",
Veterinary Record, Vol 136, 312-318
<P>
 
In this connection,  the following is the relevant extract from the
statement by SEAC, issued yesterday:-
 
"The study itself provides no new evidence in relation to
horizontal transmission.  Since the meeting of SEAC on 19 July the
Epidemiology Department at CVL has examined the data from this study
and that pertaining to the herds from which study animals were taken
and has found no evidence of horizontal transmission."

<P>
<H4> Colostrum infected but milk ok?</H4>

As regards colostrum, the relevant part of the SEAC statement is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "  There is no evidence from any of the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies that infectivity can be transmitted through milk.
In commercial dairy herds where the bulk of BSE cases arise calves do
not receive their mothers milk except for the first few days of life
when they receive the special milk produced at that time called
colostrum.  Colostrum is different in nature from ordinary milk and
is not sold for human consumption.  In the beef suckler herds it is
common practice for calves to be suckled by their mothers for up to
six months.  Existing data do not provide evidence to suggest that
the rate of maternal transmission in beef suckler calves who have
prolonged exposure to their mother's milk is any different to that in
dairy herds where the only exposure would be to colostrum in the
first few days of life.  The Committee was pleased to note that the
Epidemiology Department at CVL is undertaking further detailed
studies on this point, and that the results of these studies will be
available very soon."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The belief that milk is safe is based on the fact that if you inject
undigested milk into the brain of mice then they do not succumb to
BSE.  I would be happier about this conclusion if they had used
digested milk as well.
 
Colostrum from infected individuals has been shown to contain
infectious prions  and researchers have suggested that colostrum (the
first milk that a calf  receives) may be responsible for some aspects of horizon
tal
transmission, in particular cases of BSE in calves born at the same
time as the offsping of BSE infected cows.  Colostrum is particularly
rich in lymphocytes which is interesting because the lymphatic system
may be responsible for prion uptake and distribution around the body.

<P>
Calves born at
the same time as the offspring of BSE infected cows are possibly fed on
pooled colostrum. Another possibility: infection by placenta in the meadow.
<HR>
 As far as human colostrum of an
CJD woman is concerned, infectious prions are reported by Tamai, Y. et al.
(New Engl. Journ. Med. 1992, 327, p. 649). The infection of lambs with
scrapie by milk is reported by Straub (Dt. Tier rzteblatt, 199, 5, S. 328).
