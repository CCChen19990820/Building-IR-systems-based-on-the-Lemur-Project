<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The LL.M. in Taxation Program seeks students who have graduated from an ABA or California approved law school.  Graduates of other law schools, including foreign universities may also be considered. While an applicant's academic record is important, other factors may be relevant to the admission decision. Superior grades in J.D. level tax classes, professional accomplishments, letters of recommendation, or other relevant factors should be noted in the application. All interested applicants are encouraged to apply.


<P>Students may begin their studies in the fall, spring or summer trimester. Admission applications should be filed at least one month prior to the applicant's intended start date. Late applications may be considered if program space permits. For dates, see the academic calendar for the LL.M. in Taxation Program.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Application Documents and Fee</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The application form for the LL.M. in Taxation Program is on this website.  To download the application forms now, please click here.  Each application must be accompanied by a non-refundable $45 fee in the form of a check or money order made payable to Golden Gate University.    In addition, the candidate must submit a personal statement.  An official law school transcript  should be sent directly to the LL.M. in Taxation Program Office.


<P>No decision will be made until the application and all supporting documents have been received by the LL.M. in Taxation Program Office.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Personal Statement</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The personal statement allows an applicant to present credentials in non-statistical terms. The applicant may discuss reasons for seeking the LL.M. degree. Of particular interest to the Admissions Committee are the applicant's tax or business-related experiences, either as a law student or as a practitioner. The applicant is encouraged to describe the impact of these tax and business experiences on his or her preparation for a tax career. The personal statement is also an opportunity for applicants who may not meet the program's standard admissions criteria to set forth any factors which may be important to the Committee's decision.
The statement should be in narrative rather than resume form and should be no longer than two double-spaced, typed, 8 1/2 x 11&quot; pages.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Letters of Recommendation</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Letters of recommendation are not required. If provided, they will be considered. Letters should be detailed evaluations from individuals who are well acquainted with the applicant's academic ability or professional accomplishments.  Interviews are not required, but are available upon request by the applicant.


<P>
<B>Acceptance Deposit</B>


<P>A non-refundable deposit of $200 is required of all applicants upon notification of admission. The acceptance deposit must be paid when due to avoid cancellation of the admission offer. The deposit is credited toward the initial tuition payment.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Law School Transcripts</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Official transcripts from all law schools attended must be sent to the LL.M. in Taxation Program, Golden Gate University School of Law, 536 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA  94105-2968.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>International Applicants</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>In addition to the regular admission procedures, LL.M. in Taxation Program applicants who received their law degrees outside of the United States must satisfy the Admissions Committee as to both sufficiency of their academic backgrounds and the proficiency of their English language abilities. Additionally, international applicants must comply with the U.S. immigration laws regarding the study of law. It is the applicant's responsibility to obtain any required visas.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tuition Payment</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Tuition and fees, contained in the fee schedule on this website, are payable in full upon registration.  Tuition may be a deductible expense under IRS regulations.  A tuition installment plan is available, with one-fourth of the total tuition amount plus all applicable fees due at the time of the registration. There is a processing fee for participation in the installment plan. All balances from previous trimesters must be paid prior to registration.  If financial assistance is required, please contact a financial aid counselor in the Law School Financial Aid Office, (415) 442-6635, or call 1-800 4 TAX LLM (482-9556) and ask for the Financial Aid Office.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Financial Aid</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>California Graduate Fellowships, Veterans Benefits, loans, employment, or emergency loans can help finance graduate tax education. Students seeking information about financial aid should contact the Law School Financial Aid Office, (415) 442-6635.


<P>Partial tuition scholarships are available to a small number of deserving LL.M. in Taxation Program candidates. Students with outstanding backgrounds or credentials who believe they might qualify for a tuition scholarship should contact the Director of the LL.M. in Taxation Program for information and materials.


<P>California Tax Bar Scholarship. In an effort to increase diversity in the California Tax Bar, a partial scholarship is offered by the Tax Section of the California Bar Association.  Students interested in this scholarship should contact the LL.M. in Taxation Program Office for more information.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Withdrawal Policy</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Students are enrolled with the understanding that they will remain for the entire semester. If students must withdraw from courses for personal or professional reasons, tuition adjustments will be made on the following basis.  If a student withdraws from all classes, the amount charged will not be less than the acceptance deposit of $200.  For withdrawal before or during the first week of class, 100% of the tuition will automatically be credited to that student's account; during the second week, 85%; during the third week, 70%; during the fourth week, 50%; after the fourth week, 0%.


<P>No adjustments will be made for late registration, absences from class, leaves of absence for a portion of a trimester, or suspensions or dismissals by official action of the  University.  Fees other than tuition will not be adjusted. Acceptance deposits will not be adjusted subsequent to registration.


</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Refund Policy</B><BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Refund of a refundable credit balance will be made if requested in writing by the student. Requests should be sent to the attention of Student Accounts. Refunds will be mailed to the student's address as noted on the request for refund.

<blockquote>




Welcome to the LL.M. in International Legal Studies Program. This program, built upon Golden Gate Law School's longstanding commitment to international law, envisions American and foreign legal scholars working side by side to assimilate disparate principles of international law.


<P>Both American and foreign law graduates who intend to specialize in international and comparative law will find that the LL.M. program offers advanced qualification in five core areas: International Law, Conflict of Laws, International Trade Law, Comparative Law, and International Dispute Resolution. Foreign law graduates interested in comparative aspects of United States law will be able to take a course in American Legal Institutions and may select courses offered in the Juris Doctor program.


<P>The LL.M. program in International Legal Studies is both academic and practical. At its core, the program provides students with knowledge of the fundamental principles of international law and the current rules which govern their application. The curriculum reaches beyond rules, however, to examine the effect of various cultural practices and national policies on international trade, human rights, and the environment. In addition, courses trace the development of international and regional organizations and treaties which govern multinational issues. Students will be exposed to practical applications of negotiating skills and to different methods of international dispute settlement. 


<P>The program has two primary objectives:  to acquaint American students with the legal traditions of other countries, thereby initiating the internationalization of American legal education; and to encourage all students to understand the existing variations in international legal principles so that they may work toward harmonizing their legal consequences.
These objectives will be achieved through the interaction of students from diverse legal cultures, led by a faculty of experienced international legal practitioners, in and out of the classroom, and through research and the publication of international and comparative law materials.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Students may earn credits through coursework at one of Golden Gate's three overseas summer programs. One of the programs, located at the prestigious Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, focuses on the legal systems of Pacific Rim countries with special emphasis placed on trade with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The  programs at the University of Malta on the Mediterranean island of Malta and at the University of Marmara in Istanbul, Turkey offer a variety of courses in public and private international law subjects.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Welcome to Web Help at Golden Gate University</H3>

<P>(Formerly "GGU Webmaster's page")</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This page is meant to facilitate the creation of pages by any and
all parts of Golden Gate University, including individual pages by
faculty, staff, and students. Please revisit it as you work, as it
will certainly change over time.</P>

<H4>Initiating your web weaving</H4>

<P>The first thing to do to add your pages to the GGU web site is to
contact the webmaster at the address below. As this is written, Rob
McBride of OIT is fulfilling this function, in close cooperation with
Ginny Parsons, of University Marketing. However, the webmaster
address will always be the most reliable point of contact, regardless
of individual assignments.</P>

<P>Please consult the university's
<A HREF="e-policy.html">web policy</A>.
That document is also posted in the GGU Online conference
"www.ggu.edu news", buried in the "GGU Computing" conference of the
"Public" conference.</P>

<H4>Using the GGU templates</H4>

<P>Templates have been developed by University Marketing to define a
consistent look and feel throughout GGU's web pages. These should
especially be used for higher level pages maintained by schools,
departments and other administrative units of the university. They
are not meant to constrain creativity on course or individual pages,
etc.</P>

template</A> is designed for home pages of schools, departments,
programs, campuses, and other units. The
<A HREF="ggu_lev3.html">Level 3
template</A>, the one used for this page, is designed for pages below
those. (The Level 1 template is used only for the front door; it's
not really a template for anything else.) Comments are welcome -- you
can direct them to the marketing office or to the webmaster address
below.</P>

<P>Be sure to use the comment lines in the templates to indicate the
original and subsequent authors and the creation and modification
dates. This will help greatly in administering the site, and will let
us contact the right person if changes elsewhere in the site require
changes on your pages.</P>

<P>Please also use the Document Type Definition (DTD) information in
the header of the template. This may not matter to an individual
browser, but is increasingly important as many web administrative
functions become more automated. The more fully commented your pages
are, the easier they will be for you and us to maintain.</P>

<P>In addition to the templates, we have created a
<A HREF="styleguide.html">Web Page
Style Guide</A> for tips on maintaining a consistent look throughout
Golden Gate University's web pages. These are recommendations only.
</P>

<H4>Mounting the pages</H4>

<P>When you have working drafts you want feedback on, and when you
have final drafts, please email them to webmaster@ggu.edu, or contact
him or her for information on FTPing the files. (And sneakernet is
still not yet dead.) Be sure to indicate what existing pages should
be linked to yours.</P>

<P>To publish personal home pages or other material that you maintain
personally, see <A HREF="upload_unix.html">Uploading web pages to
internet.ggu.edu</A>.</P>

<H4>Maintaining your pages ...</H4>

<P>,,, is your responsibility. This site will only be valuable if
every contributor updates the information on their pages. It is also
your responsibility to maintain any external links out from your
page.</P>

<H4>Our servers</H4>

<P>Our primary site server is a PowerMac 9500/132 running WebSTAR.
Additional pages are hosted on the INTERNET and COURSES servers
running NCSA HTTP, and some are hosted externally.</P>

<H3>Polices Pertaining to Electronic Communications at Golden Gate University</H3>

<H4>I.	Electronic Mail and Other Network Resources</H4>

<P>A.	Golden Gate University provides many computing and network resources for use by students, faculty, staff, and other persons affiliated with the University.   Members of the GGU community are encouraged to use these resources to facilitate the efficient exchange of information and to enhance the learning and working environments we all share.  GGU encourages the appropriate use of  electronic resources to enhance productivity and to further education, research, public service, and the free exchange of ideas and points of view.  Access to e-mail and other network resources is a privilege granted by the University, and certain responsibilities accompany that privilege.  Users of these resources are expected to be ethical and responsible in their use.</P>

<P>B.	Messages sent as electronic mail should meet the same standards for distribution or display as tangible documents.  Identify yourself clearly and accurately in all communications.  Concealing or misrepresenting your name or affiliation to disassociate yourself from responsibility for your actions is never appropriate.  Alteration of the source of e-mail or message postings is unethical and may be illegal.</P>

<P>C.	Privacy can and should be a serious concern in electronic communications.  All electronic files belong to somebody.  Files should be considered as private and confidential unless the owner has explicitly made them available to others.  Users of e-mail, in particular, should be aware that their messages can be edited and shared with others without their permission. Good judgment dictates the creation of electronic documents, whether in e-mail or other formats, with the idea that they may become available to the public.</P>

<P>D.	Abusive, threatening, demeaning, or harassing materials are never appropriate, regardless of the format of transmission.  Debate on controversial issues is inevitable and essential in an academic community and ought to be conducted in ways that advance the cause of learning and mutual understanding.</P>

<P>E.	Promoting the efficient use of network resources is everyone's responsibility.  Please refrain from engaging in any use that interferes with the work of others or disrupts the intended use of network resources.  We should all especially avoid wasteful and disruptive practices, such as sending "chain" letters and messages or other unwanted material.</P>

<P>F.	E-mail and other network resources may not be used for commercial purposes or for personal financial gain.  This does not prohibit the posting of "classified ads" to bulletin boards where such postings are permitted.</P>


<P>G.	The same standards of conduct expected of students, faculty, and staff regarding the use of telephones, fax machines, mail services, libraries, and other institutional resources apply to the use of e-mail and other network utilities.  You are expected to abide by the security restrictions on all systems and information to which you have access.  Conduct which involves the use of the University's electronic resources to violate a University policy or regulation, or to violate another's rights, is a serious abuse and may limit your privileges and lead to appropriate disciplinary action.  When appropriate, the University's established mechanisms for investigating and disciplining abuses of University policies will be applied.</P>

<P></P>

<H4>II.	The World Wide Web (WWW)</H4>

<P>A.	The Golden Gate University World Wide Web site is an official publication of Golden Gate University and is located at http://www.ggu.edu/.  The purpose of the Web site is to provide information about GGU worldwide; to encourage inter-campus and intra-university communication; to foster scholarly and research communication with other academic communities; to enhance the University's image, marketing and promotion, and to encourage enrollment growth; to support instruction, research, and creative work; to provide useful services and access to alumni, friends, and supporters of the University.</P>

<P>B.	The GGU Web site is developed and maintained by the Vice President for Enrollment Services (VPES).  The Web Advisory Committee (WAC) provides assistance and makes recommendations relating to page policy, procedures, and design.</P>

<P>C.	Management, responsibility centers, faculty and staff members, recognized student organizations, the Board of Trustees and other advisory bodies, and University program partners and contractors may all have Web pages linked to the GGU Web site, in accordance with the University's Web Page Procedure.</P>

<P>D.	University Web material which is out-of-date or in conflict with Golden Gate University policies shall be removed from the server at the direction of the VPES.</P>

<P>E.	No materials that contain advertisements for commercial products or enterprises, except as approved by the VPES, may be posted on the GGU Web site.</P>

<P>F.	State and Federal laws and University policies and procedures apply to the GGU Web site.</P>

<P>G.	Persons who develop material specifically for the Web site automatically shall be considered to have granted permission for the University to use that material on-line without attribution or legal obligation.  Copyright permission for the reproduction of text, photographs, illustrations, and other graphic images must be provided to the WAC, and all copyrighted material must contain appropriate copyright symbols.</P>

<H4>III. GGU Web Site Procedure</H4>

<P>This procedure applies to responsibility center managers, faculty and staff members, recognized student  organizations, the Board of Trustees and other advisory bodies, and university program partners and contractors.  The purpose is to provide guidelines for the development and maintenance of web pages linked to the GGU Web Site.  Individuals or organizations not named in this document are not permitted to link to the GGU Web Site.</P>

<P>1. If you are interested in designing pages to be linked to the GGU Web Site, a notification must be submitted via email to webmaster@ggu.edu with the following information: <BR>
Your Name and Title<BR>
Department/Unit<BR>
The following: "I agree to operate in accordance with the GGU Web Page Policy."<BR>
Brief description of the page architecture<BR>
The person submitting this information will be considered the individual responsible for the maintenance of the page. This person must contact the webmaster via email or in person to discuss and resolve programming and coding issues at the earliest stage of development to assure smooth incorporation of new pages into the site.
</P>

<P>2. The page must correspond to the Web Page Style Guide (IV) at the end of this document.</P>

<P>3. Prior to being linked to the GGU Web Site, the Vice President for Enrollment Services must approve the design of the page(s).  Please send the VPES your test URL, and your site will be reviewed.  Do not wait until the page has been fully designed to seek approval.</P>

<P>4. There will be space made available on a server to demonstrate and test web pages in progress, before they are officially linked to the GGU Web Site.</P>

<P>5. The unit responsible for the page(s) must have at least one individual responsible for the maintenance and updating of the  page(s).  The unit is also financially responsible for creating and updating its web material.</P>

<P>6. To maintain a consistent overall GGU web identity, page designs should loosely correspond to one another. If the format of the web site changes, all units must revisit the design of their web pages accordingly.</P>


<H4>IV. Web Page Style Guide (Do's and Don'ts)</H4>

<P>To promote consistency and  predictability within the GGU Web Site, the following guidelines are provided to assist you in designing your page:</P>

<P>1. The following disclaimer must be included by faculty and staff members and student organizations: "The information and views expressed on this page are those of (your name) and not necessarily those of Golden Gate University. (Your name) takes full responsibility for the information presented."</P>

<P>2. The design of each page linked to the Web Site must correspond to the general design of the GGU Page Templates.  In order to facilitate this, upon notification to the webmaster, VPES will supply web page templates for the design of your page.  The templates contain header and footer information as well as background and text colors.  The templates provide the greatest amount of design freedom for you while maintaining graphical continuity to the site.</P>

<P>3.  Please consider the following recommendations:<BR>
Think about what a visitor wants from your page<BR>
Define an internal goal of your pages' architecture<BR>
Have a comments/requests for information option<BR>
Create graphical continuity<BR>
Limit the amount of necessary scrolling<BR>
Limit verbiage: use succinct, lively language (no "bureaucratese")<BR>
Limit graphics: don't have different graphic buttons (loading time for your main 	page should not exceed 20 seconds on a 14.4 modem, and subsequent pages should be much faster than that<BR>
Always leave ways to get out of a page (other than the 'Back" button): no dead-end pages<BR></P>



<P>4. Please follow the below "Don'ts" of web page design:<BR>
Don't have non-working links (where one gets an error message)<BR>
Don't have a page wider than any browser's viewing window<BR>
Don't make text full page width: use newspaper columns, larger text, and good 	spatial organization<BR>
Don't crowd images<BR>
Don't have a stylistically different icon for every bullet<BR>
Don't have too much information on a single page<BR>
Don't leave important stuff for the bottom<BR>
Don't forget other platforms and browsers<BR>
Don't forget to make the title very descriptive<BR>
Don't forget -- test, test, test!<BR></P>
<P>

<h2>Web Page Style Guide</h2>
The Web Page Templates are useful as the skeleton for your web page layout. Following are some tips that will be useful as you create your page. These tips are recommended for consistency throughout Golden Gate's web pages. <em>(Please note: This is only the beginning. Please send any suggestions to <a href="mailto:webmaster@ggu.edu">Webmaster</a>)</em>.<p>
<hr>
<H3>Headers</H3>
<li> As a rule of thumb, all headers should be left aligned and use sentence capitalization (not all caps).
<p>
<li> The top header should be tagged as an H2.<br>
This is a <h2>Header 2</h2>
<li> All subsequent headers should be tagged as H3 or H4.<br>
These are <h3>Header 3</h3>and <h4>Header 4</h4>

<hr>
<H3>Lists</h3>
<li> As a rule of thumb, lists should be left aligned and use sentence capitalization. (<a href="http://www.ggu.edu/services/student_affairs/coop_education/coop_att.html#whatis">Example</a>)

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Uploading web pages to internet.ggu.edu</H3>

<P>Faculty, staff and students at GGU can put up personal home pages
and other material on our web site. Schools, departments, campuses
and administrative units can put up organizational pages. Individuals
should use their personal accounts on the INTERNET server,
internet.ggu.edu. If you don't have an account, ask at the OIT help
desk, 415-442-7070. Assuming you have an account and have created web
pages on your local PC or Mac, the following steps will allow you to
publish those pages to the world.</P>

<P>1. Log into internet.ggu.edu using any telnet application, such as
NCSA Telnet (this brings you into your account on the internet
server). Congratulations, you are now doing UNIX! A note of warning: UNIX is case sensitive. Use capital and lower case letters exactly as specified.</P>

<P>2. Enter the following command:</P>

<PRE>    mkdir public-web</PRE>

<P>(this creates a subdirectory named public-web within your account;
all your web page material -- html files, gif files, etc -- must be
in this subdirectory for the web server to serve them)</P>

<P>3. Enter the following command:</P>

<PRE>    chmod a+x+r ~</PRE>

<P>(this sets the correct permissions for your directory)</P>

<P>4. Enter the following command:</P>

<PRE>    chmod a+x+r public-web</PRE>

<P>(this sets the correct permissions for the public-web
subdirectory)</P>

<P>5. That's all it takes to enable your account to host web pages,
so enter:</P>

<PRE>    exit</PRE>

<P>unless you have other work to do in your directory.</P>

<P>6. At any point after this, you can upload files into your
public-web subdirectory using any FTP application to transfer files for web pages into the <I>public-web</I> directory on the host <I>internet.ggu.edu</I>. There are numerous FTP (File Transfer Protocol) clients available for Windows, Macintosh, and other operating systems. At GGU, the Office of Information Technology (OIT) supports <a href="xoftware.html">Xoftware for Windows</a>, and <a href="fetch.html">Fetch for Macintosh</a>.  Name your file "index.html" if you would like it to be the default document delivered from your account. </P>

<P>7. After uploading files, you must set permissions so they can be
read, so log back into your account, so return to your public-web directory:

<PRE>    cd public-web</PRE>

and enter the following command:</P>

<PRE>    chmod a+r *</PRE>

<P>(this allows all files within this subdirectory to be read by
anyone, but only you can delete or modify them).</P>

<P>8. Exit again. Test with your browser.</P>

<P>If you want a "home page" to be served when anyone points a
browser (Netscape, etc) to your directory, name that file:</P>

<PRE>    index.html</PRE>

<P>The url will be:
<PRE>    internet.ggu.edu/~your_userid</PRE>   

<P>URLs for other pages will be:
<PRE>    internet.ggu.edu/~your_userid/filename</PRE>

(The way this all works is that we run a web server on INTERNET
which looks for files mounted this way).</P>

<P>Back to <A HREF="home.html">web_help</A>, the GGU web manager's
page.</P>
Basic definitions of <a href="unix_commands.html">UNIX Commands</a>.

<blockquote><blockquote>



<h2>Instructions for Windows Users:<br> Using Xoftware Network File Manager to FTP Files</h2>

<p>
Many FTP programs are available. For Windows 3.X on the campus network, OIT supports Xoftware. The Xoftware program does not run on Windows 95. If you have questions about using FTP off campus, ask you Internet Service Provider.
<p>

<ol>

<li> From your Program Manager, double click on the icon labeled Xoftware

32/Network File Manager (4 yellow folders connected by wires).<p>

<li> From the main menu click on Connection, select New. The 'New Connection"

Dialog Box will appear.<p>

<li> Enter the following information:



<ul>

<li> Connection Alias: <b>Your Name</b>

<li> Host: <b>ggu.edu</b>

<li> Host type: <b>UNIX</b> (should default to this)

<li> Userid: <b>Your Account Name</b>

<li> Password: <b>Your Password</b> (will only appear as ***'s)

</ul>

Click [OK]

<p>



<li> Now click on the FTP Button. The system will log into your account.

<em>(Note: You should have already set up a folder in your account named

<b>public-web</b>).</em><p>



<li> Double-click on the public-web directory to transfer your files there. The

folder icon will appear to be opened.
<p>

<ul>

<li> By transferring your files to the public-web directory, the address (a.k.a. URL) of your

webpage will be http://internet.ggu.edu/~userid/filename.html.

<br>
 
<li> The URL for a file named "index.html" will be <br>
http://internet.ggu.edu/~userid<br>
since index.html is the default filename for the public-web directory.
</ul>

<p>

<li> Now go to the bottom half of your screen which until now has been inactive.

Click in the window to activate it. The top half will become inactive.<p>



<li> In this window you will choose the HTML file to be transferred into your

account. Select the <b>drive</b> that your document is located on by clicking on

the appropriate button at the top of your screen next to the FTP button. If you

saved your document to disk, select drive A or B. If you saved your document to

your hard drive, select drive C.

<p>

<li> Highlight your document by clicking on it once. <p>

<li> From the main menu bar at the top of the screen, select FILE, COPY. A Copy File Dialog Box will appear. <p>



<li> Click [OK]. Your file will automatically be copied into the directory you

selected from your account in the top window of the screen.

<p>

<li> Now rename your files with the

correct extension- your home page preferably should be named index.html. To do this, highlight the file, then select FILE, RENAME from the main menu bar at the top of the window.

<p>

<li> Now you can exit the Network File Manager by double-clicking on the bar in

the very top, left corner of the screen, or select FILE, EXIT from the main

menu bar at the top of the window.

<p>

<li> Test your homepage with Netscape, Mosaic, Internet Explorer, or another WWW browser and the following URL as the location:

<h5>http://internet.ggu.edu/~userid</h5>

Remember to substitute <B>userid</b> with your account name. <br>

<p>

<li> Notify your head of department and <a href="mailto:webmaster@ggu.edu"> webmaster@ggu.edu</a> to get a link to your homepage.

</ol>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Welcome to Web Help at Golden Gate University</H3>

<P>(Formerly "GGU Webmaster's page")</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This page is meant to facilitate the creation of pages by any and
all parts of Golden Gate University, including individual pages by
faculty, staff, and students. Please revisit it as you work, as it
will certainly change over time.</P>

<H4>Initiating your web weaving</H4>

<P>The first thing to do to add your pages to the GGU web site is to
contact the webmaster at the address below. As this is written, Rob
McBride of OIT is fulfilling this function, in close cooperation with
Ginny Parsons, of University Marketing. However, the webmaster
address will always be the most reliable point of contact, regardless
of individual assignments.</P>

<P>Please consult the university's
<A HREF="e-policy.html">web policy</A>.
That document is also posted in the GGU Online conference
"www.ggu.edu news", buried in the "GGU Computing" conference of the
"Public" conference.</P>

<H4>Using the GGU templates</H4>

<P>Templates have been developed by University Marketing to define a
consistent look and feel throughout GGU's web pages. These should
especially be used for higher level pages maintained by schools,
departments and other administrative units of the university. They
are not meant to constrain creativity on course or individual pages,
etc.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="ggu_lev2.html">Level 2
template</A> is designed for home pages of schools, departments,
programs, campuses, and other units. The
<A HREF="ggu_lev3.html">Level 3
template</A>, the one used for this page, is designed for pages below
those. (The Level 1 template is used only for the front door; it's
not really a template for anything else.) Comments are welcome -- you
can direct them to the marketing office or to the webmaster address
below.</P>

<P>Be sure to use the comment lines in the templates to indicate the
original and subsequent authors and the creation and modification
dates. This will help greatly in administering the site, and will let
us contact the right person if changes elsewhere in the site require
changes on your pages.</P>

<P>Please also use the Document Type Definition (DTD) information in
the header of the template. This may not matter to an individual
browser, but is increasingly important as many web administrative
functions become more automated. The more fully commented your pages
are, the easier they will be for you and us to maintain.</P>

<P>In addition to the templates, we have created a
<A HREF="styleguide.html">Web Page
Style Guide</A> for tips on maintaining a consistent look throughout
Golden Gate University's web pages. These are recommendations only.
</P>

<H4>Mounting the pages</H4>

<P>When you have working drafts you want feedback on, and when you
have final drafts, please email them to webmaster@ggu.edu, or contact
him or her for information on FTPing the files. (And sneakernet is
still not yet dead.) Be sure to indicate what existing pages should
be linked to yours.</P>

<P>To publish personal home pages or other material that you maintain
personally, see <A HREF="upload_unix.html">Uploading web pages to
internet.ggu.edu</A>.</P>

<H4>Maintaining your pages ...</H4>

<P>,,, is your responsibility. This site will only be valuable if
every contributor updates the information on their pages. It is also
your responsibility to maintain any external links out from your
page.</P>

<H4>Our servers</H4>

<P>Our primary site server is a PowerMac 9500/132 running WebSTAR.
Additional pages are hosted on the INTERNET and COURSES servers
running NCSA HTTP, and some are hosted externally.</P>

<H2><A NAME=1.0>1.0 Welcome to WebSTAR</A></H2>
Welcome to WebSTAR, the ultimate World Wide Web server! Formerly known as MacHTTP, <a href="http://www.starnine.com/webstar.html">WebSTAR</A> by <A HREF="http://www.starnine.com/">StarNine&reg;</A> is the most widely used desktop Web server software on the Internet today. 
<P>

<H3><A NAME=1.1>1.1 About WebSTAR</A></H3>
WebSTAR is an HTTP server that lets you publish hypertext and multimedia documents to millions of World Wide Web (WWW) users around the world, right from your Macintosh computer. You can use WebSTAR to put any Macintosh file on the Web, including GIF and JPG images and even QuickTime(TM) movies. <P>

WebSTAR is completely compatible with all WWW clients, on any platform, including Mosaic(TM), which started the Web revolution, and Netscape Navigator(TM), the most popular Web client available today. WebSTAR is also fully compatible with any HTML (HyperText Markup Language) files you may have already developed. Just copy them onto your WebSTAR server Macintosh and you're set. 
<P>
Through the power of AppleScript(TM) and Apple events, WebSTAR can communicate with other applications on your Macintosh to publish any information contained in those programs. For example, if your company information is in a FileMaker&reg; Pro database, Web client users can query it via HTML forms to get the data using the FileMaker CGI (Common Gateway Interface) for WebSTAR. It's powerful and easy to use.
<P>
StarNine also offers several add-on products for WebSTAR, including the Security Toolkit and the Commerce Toolkit. The Security Toolkit provides authentication and encryption capabilities for the WebSTAR server using the Secure Sockets Layer protocol to ensure that connections between Web clients and WebSTAR are completely private. The Commerce Toolkit adds support for commercial transactions via the First Virtual Internet Payment System(TM). Internet customers simply connect to the server and fill in an online order form. First Virtual automatically verifies the buyer and then notifies WebSTAR to complete the transaction. It's completely secure and reliable, and requires no additional hardware or software. Other Internet payment schemes, including credit card transaction processing, will be supported in future releases.
<P>
WebSTAR comes with everything you need to create a killer Web site on any Macintosh. The WebSTAR CD-ROM Pack includes FTP and Gopher servers for sharing files across the Internet as well as a free evaluation copy of StarNine's <A HREF="http://www.starnine.com/liststar.html">ListSTAR</A>, a companion product to WebSTAR that lets you create automated mailing lists (Listservers) and Email-On-Demand systems on the Internet. Sample AppleScripts and CGIs to connect WebSTAR with external applications are also included, and we've provided an online copy of WebMaster Macintosh, by Bob Levitus and Jeff Evans, the definitive reference for Macintosh Web site developers. 
<P>

<H3><A NAME=1.2>1.2 Some History</A></H3>
WebSTAR started out as MacHTTP, which has been widely used on the Web for several years. WebSTAR includes these long-standing features, which will be familiar to users of MacHTTP:
<UL>
<LI>Allows you to serve information to all WWW clients that support the HTTP/1.0 standard<P>

<LI>Handles URL requests for text and binary documents<BR>
For example, for HTML (HyperText Markup Language) documents as well as GIFs, JPEGs, and other binary formats.<P>

<LI>Can execute AppleScripts and CGI applications and return results to clients<BR>
WebSTAR can also link to other external applications (such as FileMaker Pro, AppleSearch, or HyperCard&reg;).<P>

<LI>Allows you to control access to the server by clients' domain name or IP address<P>

<LI>Supports complete user name/password security for all files it serves<P>

<LI>PowerPC native server
</UL>
<H3><A NAME=1.3>1.3 What's New in WebSTAR</A></H3>
<P>
WebSTAR also provides these new features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Uses Apple's Thread Manager for multitasking connection processing<BR>
The use of threads makes WebSTAR three to four times faster than MacHTTP. Because it can process multiple connections at the same time, it surrenders system resources much more quickly, making it more convenient to use other applications on the Macintosh while WebSTAR is running in the background.
<P>
<LI>Includes a new administrative application that allows secure local or remote administration and lets you monitor multiple WebSTAR servers from a single machine<BR>
Overall, WebSTAR has a greatly improved administrative interface and no longer uses the ASCII configuration file required by MacHTTP. 
<P>
<LI>Supports customizable log message formats<BR>
You can specify what kind of information to include in log file entries; for example, you can easily track information about how many times a day the server is accessed, which pages have been served, and who requested them. Some of the new log properties include information about the number of bytes transmitted and how long the transmission took, the identity of the WWW client software, the user name if authentication was required, and the document referencing this URL.
<P>
<LI>Allows preprocessing and postprocessing of URL requests<BR>
Preprocessing allows you to do something with a URL before the server has a chance to. For example, you might want to examine every incoming request, look at the preferred language being requested by the browser, and route English requests to one machine and French to another. Postprocessing occurs after the server has processed a URL. For example, you might want to use a postprocessor application to implement a billing scheme in which you could charge for specific page accesses.
<P>
<LI>Supports user-defined actions<BR>
You can now define an action to be performed on any URL with a particular filename suffix. For example, you might want to define an action that passes all map information to the same map CGI.
<P> 
<LI>Supports aliases to files, folders, and external volumes<BR>
WebSTAR doesn't allow URLs to access files outside its own folder hierarchy for security reasons. However, you can now create an alias to folders that points to a folder on a different volume, including CD-ROM and network volumes, and WebSTAR will treat it as if it were located within its folder hierarchy. (MacHTTP supported file aliases, but not folder aliases.)
<P>
<LI>Is completely scriptable and recordable<BR>
WebSTAR is now completely recordable, scriptable, and attachable. Many scripts and applications have been created to interact with WebSTAR, including tools for supporting clickable maps, free-text searches, fill-in forms, and other WWW functions. WebSTAR's extended Apple events support enables much better integration with other Apple events-aware applications such as <A HREF="http://www.starnine.com/liststar.html">ListSTAR.</A>

<H2><A NAME=2.0>2.0 Getting Started</A></H2>

This chapter shows you how to install the WebSTAR software and start publishing your information on the World Wide Web.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="2.1">2.1 Macintosh System Requirements</A></H3>
WebSTAR requires System 7, MacTCP, and AppleScript. 
MacTCP and AppleScript are included with WebSTAR and will 
be installed automatically if they are not already present in your System.
<P>
WebSTAR requires at least 1MB of application memory for the default 12 connections. 
At least 3MB of memory is recommended for 25 connections.
<H3><A NAME="2.2">2.2 Network Requirements</A></H3>
The Macintosh must a full TCP/IP connection 
to a network (to publish data locally on that network) or to the Internet. 
That means you need to obtain an IP address and configure 
it in MacTCP ( see the MacTCP Administrator's Guide, 
which is available online in PDF format).
<P>
If you are installing WebSTAR on a local TCP/IP network, 
the IP address can be obtained from the network administrator.
<P>
If you are connecting directly to the Internet through a service provider, 
you need to obtain the IP address from that provider. 
In addition, the service provider can usually register a domain name for you, 
provide Domain Name Server (DNS) services, 
help with configuration and security issues, 
and work with a telecommunications provider to establish the type of 
connection you need.
<P>
If you are using a modem to connect to the Internet, you can use a standard phone line. 
However, even if you have a 28.8 kbps modem, dial-up access can be too slow for fast 
transmission of images, sounds, and video. 
Often a higher-speed, dedicated line is recommended, 
such as an ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) line, 
which provides two 64 kbps channels, a T1 line (1.544 mpbs), 
or a T3 line (45 mbps).
<P>
To access your WebSTAR server once it is running, you need a WWW client 
such as MacWeb, Mosaic, or Netscape. 
To run WWW client software and WebSTAR on the same Mac, 
you need at least 2MB of free memory. 
(Note that server performance will decrease if you run a client on the same Macintosh.)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="2.3">2.3 Upgrading from MacHTTP</A></H3>
If you have an existing MacHTTP server, 
you can use WebSTAR to publish the same data with no problems. 
However, you will have to re-enter your suffix mappings, 
realms, passwords, and other configuration parameters by 
using the WebSTAR Admin application. 
See <A HREF="tech_ref2.html#3.0">Configuring WebSTAR</A></DT>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="2.4">2.4 Installation</A></H3>

To install WebSTAR, follow these steps:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Insert the WebSTAR Installer disk.
<P>
<LI>Launch the WebSTAR Installer script.
<P>
<LI>Click Install to do an Easy Install.
<P>
<LI>When the install has finished, open the WebSTAR Folder on the hard disk.
<P>
<LI>Double-click the WebSTAR application to start it up.
<P>
<LI>You will be prompted to enter your serial number.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/serialno.gif">
<P>
<LI>Type your serial number and then click OK. 
<P>
If you ordered the WebSTAR software online, your serial number was sent via E-mail. If you ordered the hard copy, it is on the registration card. 
<P>
<LI>You're now officially part of the World Wide Web!
</OL>
Initially, the WebSTAR folder contains a default Home Page, 
the documentation in HTML format, and a few sample files. 
(No security is initially set on these files.)
<P>

<H4><A NAME=2.4.1>2.4.1 Performing a Test Access</A></H4>

To test that a WWW client can access your server, follow these steps:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Launch your WWW client software, such as Mosaic, MacWeb, or NetScape.
<P>
<LI>Use the Open URL or Open Location menu command to open this URL:
<P>
<CODE>http://webstar.mac.name/</CODE>
<P>
where "webstar.mac.name" is the full domain name or IP address of the Mac running WebSTAR.
<P>
Initially, you'll see a sample Home Page, which describes how to access other sites and the WebSTAR documentation.
<P>
<LI>Open the WebSTAR documentation in HTML format.
</OL>
<B>NOTE:</B>  If you have trouble accessing the server , you can still read the HTML-format documentation by launching the WWW client software on the Mac running WebSTAR and using the Open File command in the client software to open the file in the Documentation folder.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=2.4.2>2.4.2 Setting Up A Folder Hierarchy</A></H4>
To set up your site, you need to organize your data in a folder hierarchy within the WebSTAR folder. If you wish, you can place aliases within the WebSTAR folder that reference folders and files in other locations. 
<P>
When you are moving documents into the folders that can be served by WebSTAR, you need to make decisions about who can access the files, how they should be transferred to clients, whether there are links within the documents to other local files, and so forth. 
<P>
The following illustration shows a basic example folder hierarchy for serving different types of documents in WebSTAR.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/root.gif"><P>
<P>
In this example, the Default.html document is the server's Home Page. See <A HREF=#index>Index.</A> This Home Page is an HTML document that welcomes a user and contains links to other documents available on the server. Its HTML source looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
<CODE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;XYZ Corp Home Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="graphics/XYZHeader.gif"&gt;

&lt;H1&gt;XYZ Corporation Home Page&lt;/H1&gt;

The XYZ Corporation is the world wide leader in the manufacturing of widgets, which as everyone knows are critical in the assembly of new space flight vehicles. We invite you to browse our site and learn more about us and

&lt;EM&gt;Last Edited: May 15, 1995&lt;/EM&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</CODE>
</PRE>
In this example, the Home Page contains links to graphics and documents contained in subfolders in the WebSTAR folder hierarchy. 
<P>
When viewed in a WWW client such as Netscape, it looks like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/XYZ.gif">
<P>
You need to create your own Home Page, organize your folders, documents, scripts, and graphics, and configure the WebSTAR server.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=2.5>2.5 Quick Tour of the WebSTAR Server</A></H3>
When you launch WebSTAR, the server creates a Settings file in the same folder as the WebSTAR application and opens a status window like the one shown in below.
<P>
The Settings file is where all the server's configuration information is stored. Because it is in the server's folder rather than the Preferences folder inside your System Folder, you can run multiple copies of WebSTAR in different folders on the same Macintosh. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/statuswin.gif"><BR>
<P>
The status window contains messages generated by the server during initialization. 
<P>
At the top of the window are two lines of information that provide statistics about incoming connections and WebSTAR memory usage. These statistics make it easier to analyze the number of connections WebSTAR should enable and how much memory it needs to run efficiently. 
<P>
The Connections statistics fields contain the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Total: 
The total number of clients served.
<P>
<LI>Max: 
The maximum number of users (concurrent incoming connections). See <A HREF=#maxusers>Max Users.</A>
<P>
<LI>Listening: 
The number of listening processes for incoming connections. The amount of memory allocated to the server depends on the Max Listens parameter. A simple rule of thumb is to allocate approximately 100K per listen process. The server will warn at start-up if it has insufficient memory. See <A HREF=#maxlistens>Max Listens.</A>
<P>
<LI>Current: 
How many connections are currently active.
<P>
<LI>High: 
The "high-water mark" of simultaneous users. Use this value to verify that you have set the maximum number of users correctly.
<P>
<LI>Busy: 
How many clients have been refused service because WebSTAR was too busy. If this value is not zero, you may need to increase the Max Users setting. If you are on a low-speed network or have a slower computer, you may find that limiting the number of Max Users enhances performance by keeping the server and network from getting swamped by too many requests.
<P>
<LI>Denied: 
The number of clients that were denied access based on allow/deny security. Realm security violations are not logged in this statistic.
<P>
<LI>Timeout: 
The number of client connections that were terminated because the transaction was not completed in the allowed time. This could indicate clients that died without dropping their connection or that the server or CGI application is taking longer than the Timeout period to service client requests. See <A HREF=#timeout>Timeout.</A>
</UL>
The Free Memory statistics fields contain the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Max: 
The maximum amount of free memory (high water mark in K) available to WebSTAR.
<P>
<LI>Current: The amount of free memory currently available to WebSTAR. There is no guarantee that this memory is contiguous, so you may see memory-related problems with AppleScript even if WebSTAR reports free memory. In addition, the amount of memory allocated for a connection may be greater than the amount used. This value will trend downwards with each connection as the status window fills with text. Once the status window's scroll-back area is full, the oldest status messages are deleted and "current" memory displays should level off.
<P>
<LI>Min: The "low-water mark" for memory usage. If this number dips below about 150K, AppleScript will have problems executing some scripts that use OSAX commands. Increase the amount of memory allocated in the Finder to WebSTAR accordingly.
<P>
<LI>Sent: The amount of data the server has transferred (in bytes).
<P>

<LI>Up Since: The date and time when the server was last launched.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME=2.5.1>2.5.1 WebSTAR Server File Menu</A></H4>
The File menu contains only one command -- quit.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=2.5.2>2.5.2 WebSTAR Server Edit Menu</A></H4>

You can manipulate the text items in an open window by using the Cut and Copy commands in the Edit menu. In addition, the Edit menu contains the Passwords and Serial Numbers commands.
<P>
<B><I>Passwords</I></B><BR>
The Passwords command in the server's Edit menu opens a dialog box in which you can edit the passwords and user names associated with security realms for this server.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/passwords.gif"><BR>
<P>
See <A NAME=addpass>Add Password.</A><P>
<P>
<B><I>Serial Numbers</I></B><BR>

The Serial Numbers command in the server's Edit menu opens a dialog box in which you can view, add, or delete serial numbers for WebSTAR software components.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/serialnomaintenance.gif"><BR>

<P>
The buttons in Serial Number Maintenance window let you add, delete, or get more information about a number. Except for the New button, the buttons operate on a highlighted item. The buttons provide the following functions:
<UL>
<LI>Delete: 
This button deletes the selected serial number. For example, you may want to delete a Demo serial number that has expired when you enter the real serial number of the product.
<P>
<LI>New: 
This button opens a window where you can enter a serial number. For example, you may want to add a serial number if you purchase add-on modules in the future.
<P>
<LI>Get Info: 
This button opens a read-only window that shows the name of the product, the serial number, expiration date, and start date. If you have problems caused by running multiple copies of WebSTAR with the same serial number, you can open this dialog box to determine which number is in use for each server.<P>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME=2.5.3>2.5.3 WebSTAR Server Options Menu</A></H4>
Items in the Options menu let you change the behavior of the server. All selections made in this menu are saved in the server's WebSTAR Settings file and restored the next time the server is launched.
<UL>
<LI>Verbose Messages: 
When you check this option, WebSTAR finishes servicing all currently queued clients and then refuses new client connections until the option is unchecked again. Incoming connections are still reported in the statistics area of the status window, but those connections are just "knocking at the door"— they are not being allowed in and the clients are notified that their connection is refused. This option is useful for gracefully shutting down a server, or for allowing you to change HTML documents while the server continues to run but is temporarily refusing connections. 

<P>
<LI>Suspend Logging: 
When this option is checked, WebSTAR temporarily closes its log file (if a log file is specified in the Settings file), allowing you to open and examine the file with a text editor. No incoming connection data will be logged to the file while this option is enabled.
<P>
<LI>Hide Window in Background: 
When this option is checked, the status window is hidden while WebSTAR is running in the background.
<P>
<LI>Refuse New Connections: 
When this option is checked, WebSTAR doesn't accept any new client connections. Incoming connections are still reported in the statistics area of the status window, but those connections are just "knocking at the door"— they are not being allowed in. All currently queued clients are served, but no new connections are opened. Clients are notified that connections are being refused. This option is useful for gracefully shutting down a server, or for allowing you to change HTML documents while the server is running.<P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME=3.0>3.0 Configuring WebSTAR</A></H2>

This chapter shows you how to use the WebSTAR Admin application to configure the WebSTAR server. It covers these important configuration areas:<BR>

The WebSTAR Admin application provides an easy interface for configuring WebSTAR. You can also use it to monitor one or more WebSTAR servers from a single Mac on the AppleTalk network. For background on general administration issues, see <A HREF=#4.0>Administering WebSTAR.</A>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=3.1>3.1 Turning On Program Linking</A></H3>

Program linking is a built-in System 7 feature that lets users and applications link to programs across a network. If you are running the WebSTAR server and the WebSTAR Admin application on separate computers, the Macintosh running the WebSTAR server must have program linking turned on, or WebSTAR Admin will be unable to "see" the WebSTAR server on the network.
<P>
Program linking has three levels of control:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=#3.1.1>System level</A>
<P>
<LI><A HREF=#3.1.2>Application level</A>
<P>
<LI><A HREF=#3.1.3>User level</A>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME=3.1.1>3.1.1 System Level</A></H4>
<P>
To enable program linking at the system level, open the Sharing Setup control panel and click the Start button in the Program Linking area of the dialog box.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/sharingsetup.gif"><BR>


<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.1.2>3.1.2 Application level</A></H4>

By default, WebSTAR has program linking enabled. If you select the WebSTAR icon and choose Sharing in the File menu, the "Allow remote program linking" option should be checked. If for any reason it is not checked, check it now.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/programlinking.gif"><BR>

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  If you have multiple shared applications on your disk and for some reason do not want to enable program linking for the WebSTAR server, you can selectively turn off linking at the application level.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.1.3>3.1.3 User level</A></H4>

When you select a server in the WebSTAR Admin application, you are prompted to supply a user name and password to access the remote server. This is an important security feature. The user whose name and password you supply must have program linking enabled in his or her user profile.
<P>
To turn on program linking at the user level, open the Users & Groups control panel and then double-click a user icon.

<H3><A NAME=3.2>3.2 Launching the WebSTAR Admin Application</A></H3>

After turning on program linking, launch WebSTAR by double-clicking it. Then, double-click the WebSTAR Admin application on any Macintosh on the AppleTalk network.
<P>
A Chooser-like dialog box opens, where you select a WebSTAR server. (You may need to select a zone and Macintosh name first.) Highlight a WebSTAR server and click OK to open the initial WebSTAR Admin Monitor window.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/adminready.gif"><BR>

<P>
The title bar of the Monitor window shows the Macintosh host name or IP address where the selected server is running. 
<P>
In the upper-left area of the window are vertical bar graphs that indicate the current usage (number of connections) on the server. These bar graphs scroll from right to left in histogram fashion at 15 second intervals.
<P>
Each histogram contains two horizontal lines, a gray high-water mark line and a black line indicating the maximum number of users. The high water line is a graphical representation of the "High" connections number (see the "<A HREF=#high>High</A>" statistic described in the next section).
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.2.1>3.2.1 Statistics in the Monitor Window</A></H4>

The Connection statistics displayed in the upper-right of the WebSTAR Admin Monitor window show the following information:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Connections: The total number of active connections for this server.<P>

<LI>Listens: The number of listening processes for incoming connections. See <A HREF=#maxlistens.gif>Max Listens.</A><P>

<LI><A NAME=high>High</A>: The "high-water mark" of simultaneous users. Use this value to verify that you have set the maximum number of users correctly.<P>

<LI>Max: The maximum number of users (concurrent incoming connections). See <A HREF=#maxusers>Max Users.</A>
<P>
<LI>Busy: How many clients have been refused service because WebSTAR was too busy. If this value is not zero, you may need to increase the Max Users setting. See <A HREF=#maxusers>Max Users.</A>
<P>
<LI>Denied: The number of clients that were denied access based on allow/deny security. Realm security violations are not logged in this statistic.
<P>
<LI>Timeout: The number of client connections that were terminated because the transaction was not completed in the allowed time. See <A HREF=#timeout>Timeout.</A>
<P>
<LI>Up Since: The date and time when the server was last launched.
<P>
<LI>Data Sent: The amount of data the server has transferred (in bytes).
<P>
<LI>Version: The version number of the WebSTAR server software.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME=3.2.2>3.2.2 WebSTAR Admin File Menu</A></H4>
<UL>
<LI>New Monitor: This command opens a Chooser-like window in which you can select a server. When you select a WebSTAR server and click OK, the WebSTAR Admin application opens a Monitor window for that server.
<P>
<LI>Quit: Exit the WebSTAR Admin application.
</UL>
<H4><A NAME=3.2.3>3.2.3 WebSTAR Admin Edit Menu</A></H4>

You can manipulate the text items in an open window by using commands in the Edit menu.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.2.4>3.2.4 WebSTAR Admin Options Menu</A></H4>

The Options menu always applies to the frontmost active Monitor window. This is important to remember when there are multiple Monitor windows on the screen. All selections made in this menu are saved in the server's WebSTAR Settings file and restored the next time the server is launched.
<P>
Most of the commands in this menu duplicate the commands in the WebSTAR server's Options menu (see <A HREF=#2.3.3>WebSTAR Server Options Menu</A>). The WebSTAR Admin Options menu contains these additional commands:
<UL>

<LI>Ignore Status Updates and
Ignore Log Updates: 
These are commands sent by the WebSTAR Admin application to the WebSTAR server to configure status reporting communications with that server. When checked, the WebSTAR Admin application stops requesting status or log information from the WebSTAR server whose Monitor window is active.
<P>
<LI>Quit WebSTAR: 
Bring down the selected server.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME=3.2.5>3.2.5 WebSTAR Admin Configure Menu</A></H4>

The Configure menu always applies to the frontmost active Monitor window. All selections made in this menu are saved in the server's WebSTAR Settings file and restored the next time the server is launched.
<P>
Items in the Configure menu set configuration parameters in the WebSTAR server. All selections made in this menu are saved in the WebSTAR Settings file and restored the next time WebSTAR is run. The commands in this menu are described in detail in the next sections.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=3.3>3.3 Suffix Mapping</A></H3>

Suffix mapping determines how the WebSTAR server returns data to a WWW client. It lets you specify an action and MIME type for processing the URL and returning data, based on the filename suffix in a URL or on the Macintosh file type and creator fields of a retrieved document.
<P>
To set up mappings based on suffixes, you have to include a filename suffix in the names of your documents. If you prefer not to rename documents, you can set up mappings based on the Macintosh file type and creator fields instead. If WebSTAR doesn’t find a filename suffix, it examines those fields and looks for a relevant mapping.
<P>
Suffix mapping can be used for more than handling standard file or binary transfers or CGI execution. For example, suppose certain files contain Kanji characters. You can name all of those files with the same suffix and then specify the appropriate MIME type for handling 16-bit characters.
<P>
Choose Suffix Mapping in the Configure menu to open this dialog box:


<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/suffixmapping.gif"><BR>
<P>

The Suffix Mapping dialog box lets you add, delete, or modify Suffix Mappings. Use the up-arrow and down-arrow to move the selection up or down. To view additional mappings, use the scroll bar at the right side of the window.
<P>
Clicking the Edit button when a list item is selected causes the fields of the selected item to appear in the appropriate text fields and menus. (Double-clicking an item has the same effect.) Clicking the Replace button when a list item is selected replaces the selected item with the information specified in the text fields and menus.
<P>
When you click Update, the changes you have made are stored in the Settings file. If you don't want to save your changes, click Cancel.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.3.1>3.3.1 How Suffix Mapping Works</A></H4>

The server fulfills a URL request and uses the first Suffix Mapping it finds that matches the document's filename suffix, file type, and creator (where an asterisk matches anything). If it doesn't find a match in the Suffix Mapping list, it returns the data as text using a default action and MIME type. The default is:
<P>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>BINARY</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>*</TT></B>-- Type/Creator: <B><TT>* * </TT></B>-- MIME: <B><TT>text/html</TT></B></DD>
<P>
This means that the server will use a binary transfer and assume that it is returning HTML text. However, you can set a different default MIME type if you prefer (see <A HREF=#3.7.6>Default MIME type</A>).
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  The order of the Suffix Mappings list is significant; if two mappings match a URL, WebSTAR uses the first one.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.3.2>3.3.2 Guidelines for Adding Mappings</A></H4>
<P>
In practice, unless particular files need special processing, administrators usually specify general Suffix Mappings that use an asterisk in one or more fields. For example, if you have documents created by both Excel 3.0 and Excel 4.0 that have different file types but the same filename suffix (.XL) you can use a Suffix Mapping like this:<BR>

<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>BINARY</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.XL</TT></B>-- Type/Creator: <B><TT>* * </TT></B>-- MIME: <B><TT>application/excel</TT></B></DD>
<P>
<DT>rather than adding two entries like this:</DT>
<P>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>BINARY</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.XL</TT></B>-- Type/Creator:<B><TT> XLS3* *</TT></B> -- MIME: <B><TT>application/excel</TT></B></DD>
<P>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>BINARY</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.XL</TT></B>-- Type/Creator: <B><TT> XLS4* *</TT></B> -- MIME: <B><TT>application/excel</TT></B></DD></DL>
<P>
The wildcard method is preferred because it is easier, requires fewer updates, and improves server performance. (Each time a file is served, the Suffix Mappings list is searched, so fewer mappings result in better performance.) In addition, if Excel 5.0 documents become available, those documents would match the first, general, suffix mapping but would not match either of the more specific ones.<P>

<H4><A NAME=3.3.4>3.3.4 Adding Suffix Mappings to the Server</A></H4>

To add a Suffix Mapping, follow these steps:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>In the Suffix Mapping dialog box, choose an action to be performed from the Action pop-up list. See <A HREF=#action>Action.</A>
<P>
<LI>Specify the file suffix, file type, and creator. An asterisk (*) means "any." See <A HREF=#fsftc>File Suffix, File Type, and Creator.</A>
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  If the Type and Creator values contain special characters, encode them using the %<I>xx</I> encoding scheme used in URLs, where <I>xx</I> is the hexadecimal code for the ASCII character. For example, a space character (decimal 32, hexadecimal 20) would be encoded as %20). So, "AB C" would be entered as "AB%20C".
<P>
<LI>Enter the MIME Type. This information tells the requesting WWW client software what to do with the returned data. See <A HREF=#mimetype>MIME Type.</A>
<P>
<LI>Click Add, or if you are finished, click Update.
</OL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.3.5>3.3.5 Fields in a Suffix Map</A></H4>

<B><A NAME=action>Action</A></B>
<P>
The Action pop-up list in the Suffix Mapping dialog box has these entries:
<UL>
<LI>TEXT: Return the file using the TEXT transfer method.<P>

<LI>BINARY: Return the file using the BINARY transfer method, without modifying its contents. Only the data fork of the file is transmitted.<P>

<LI>SCRIPT: Load and execute the AppleScript specified in the URL. If it is a text script, WebSTAR passes global variables that can affect its execution. The result of the script's execution will be returned to the client as TEXT with the specified MIME type.<P>

<LI>CGI: Load and execute the CGI application specified in the URL. WebSTAR passes arguments to the application by using the Search Doc Apple event. The application is expected to generate a legal HTTP/1.0 header and any response information and return it to WebSTAR as the result of processing the Apple event. This result will then be transmitted to the client without modification. See <A HREF=#5.2.2>Named Parameters.</A><P>

<LI>ACGI: Load and execute the ACGI application specified in the URL. WebSTAR passes arguments to the application by using the Search Doc Apple event and immediately resumes processing other requests. The application is expected to generate a legal HTTP/1.0 header and any response information and return it to WebSTAR as the result of processing the Apple event. When WebSTAR receives the event reply, it processes the result, which is then transmitted to the client without modification. See <A HREF=#5.2.2>Named Parameters.</A>
<P>
<LI><I>User-defined</I>: Load and execute the associated action ACGI application, passing the URL as an argument to it. See <A HREF=#3.4>User-Defined Actions.</A>
</UL>
<P>
<B>File Suffix, File Type, and Creator</B>
<P>
The WebSTAR server uses a document's Suffix, Type, and Creator fields together to determine which action to apply. The Suffix field takes precedence over Type and Creator. For example, suppose the server receives this URL, which specifies a file named run.script in the server's directory:
<P>
<CODE>:RUN.SCRIPT</CODE>
<P>
The server retrieves the file and then looks up .SCRIPT in its Suffix Mapping list, where it finds this entry:
<P>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>SCRIPT</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.SCRIPT</TT></B>-- Type/Creator:<B><TT> TEXT * </TT></B>-- MIME:<B><TT> text/html</TT></B></DD>
<P>

The server then passes its global variables to the script, runs it, and returns the result of that script as HTML text. Or, if the server receives the following URL, which specifies a formatted Microsoft Word document
<P>
<CODE>:MYFILE</CODE>
<P>
it retrieves the file, recognizes that there is no filename suffix, and checks its Suffix Mapping list for the Type (WDBN) and Creator of the file (MSWD). It finds this entry:
<P>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>BINARY</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.WORD</TT></B>-- Type/Creator:<B><TT> WDBN MSWD </TT></B>-- MIME:<B><TT> application/msword</TT></B></DD>
<P>

The server then transfers the file back to the client using the binary transfer method and the MIME type application/msword.
<P>
<B><A NAME=mimetype>MIME Type</A></B>
<P>
MIME Type is information transmitted in the HTTP/1.0 header to indicate what type of file is being returned. This information allows clients to treat the returned data intelligently instead of using some kind of default, such as assuming that all returned data is HTML text. For example, if a client receives data with the application/excel MIME type, it can launch a Helper application to view the formatted data. See <A HREF=#4.2>Client and Server Aspects of File Transfers.</A>
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  Scripts are responsible for generating their own HTTP/1.0 headers, which should include MIME type information. For information about the proper format for HTTP headers, see the HTTP/1.0 standard.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=3.4>3.4 User-Defined Actions</A></H3>

User-defined actions are instructions to run an application or script. Unlike the SCRIPT, CGI, and ACGI actions, which require that the URL specify the name of the script or application directly, user-defined actions can be invoked based on the URL suffix alone.
<P>
Many people use user-defined actions to support clickable maps or any other type of operation where a single CGI will operate on multiple data files. For example, when an action executes a map CGI, all map information is passed to the one CGI. 
<P>
These actions also allow you to hide implementation details from users. The URL seen by users in a document isn't necessarily the URL that gets executed on your server. 
<P>
Another use for user-defined actions would be to create new file types and define an action to process them appropriately. For example, suppose you have .SQL files that contain SQL query statements. You can define an action that would pass a query to Butler to be found in a database when an incoming URL request references a .SQL file.
<P>
User-defined actions also allow you to swap out or change CGIs without having to change URLs in your documents. You simple edit the action to point to a new script.
<P>
Choose Actions in the Configure menu to open this dialog box:
<P>
<A NAME-fig11><IMG SRC="gifs/actions.gif"></A><BR>

<P>

The Actions dialog box lets you add, delete, or modify user-defined actions. To view additional user-defined actions, use the scroll bar at the right side of the window.
<P>
Clicking the Edit button when a list item is selected causes the fields of the selected item to appear in the appropriate text fields. (Double-clicking an item has the same effect.) Clicking the Replace button when a list item is selected replaces the selected item with the information specified in the text fields.
<P>
When you click Update, the changes you have made are stored in the Settings file. If you don't want to save your changes, click Cancel.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.4.1>3.4.1 Defining an Action</A></H4>

Defining an action requires these two parameters:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Application: Specify the relative pathname to the script or application to be executed. Relative pathnames begin with a colon (:) and are relative to the folder containing the WebSTAR application.
<P>
<LI>Action Name: Specify a name, which will appear in the Suffix Mappings Action menu. The name is case-insensitive.
</UL>
<B>NOTE:</B>  No spaces or Macintosh special characters are allowed in the application path or action name. If those characters appear in a parameter, you need to encode them using the %<I>xx</I> encoding scheme used in URLs, where <I>xx</I> is the hexadecimal code for the ASCII character. For example, a space character (decimal 32, hexadecimal 20) would be encoded as %20). So, "AB C" would be entered as "AB%20C".
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.4.2>3.4.2 Associating an Action with a Suffix Mapping</A></H4>

After you have defined an action, you can use it in Suffix Mappings. When you add or change an action, WebSTAR forces a reinterpretation of all Suffix Mappings. If it finds that a previously defined action which was used by a mapping is now absent, that mapping is ignored (though it remains in the Settings file).
<P>
For example, the <A HREF=#fig11>Actions dialog box</A> shown above contains two user-defined actions named CLOAK and TEST. Both of these actions execute an ACGI and return the results as HTML text. After defining these actions, you can integrate them into the Suffix Mapping list as follows:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Choose Suffix Mapping in the Configure menu. 
<P>
<LI>Select CLOAK from the Action pop-up list, and then fill in the text fields so the entry looks like this:
<P>
Action: <B><TT>CLOAK</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.HTML</TT></B>-- Type/Creator:<B><TT> TEXT * </TT></B>-- MIME:<B><TT> text/html</TT></B>
<P>

<LI>Click Add to add the new mapping at the top of the list.
The intention is to pass all HTML requests to the NetCloak ACGI.
<P>
<LI>Select TEST from the Action pop-up list, and then fill in the text fields so the entry looks like this:
<P>
Action: <B><TT>TEST</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>.TEST</TT></B>-- Type/Creator:<B><TT> TEXT * </TT></B>-- MIME:<B><TT> text/html</TT></B>
<P>
The intention is to pass all requests that end in .TEST to the Test ACGI.
<P>
<LI>Click Add, and then click Update.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME=3.5>3.5 Realms</A></H3>

WebSTAR lets you divide your files and folders into multiple security realms. You can then require user name/password authentication to access all files within the same realm. 
<P>
A realm groups folders and files by name. URLs that contain a string that matches the same string in folder and filenames are authenticated by using the password and user name assigned to that realm.
<P>
Choose Realms in the Configure menu to open this dialog box:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/realms.gif"><BR>

<P>

The Realms dialog box lets you add, delete, or modify security realms. To view additional realms, use the scroll bar at the right side of the window.
<P>
Clicking the Edit button when a list item is selected causes the fields of the selected item to appear in the appropriate text fields. (Double-clicking an item has the same effect.) Clicking the Replace button when a list item is selected replaces the selected item with the information specified in the text fields.
<P>
When you click Update, the changes you have made are stored in the Settings file. If you don't want to save your changes, click Cancel.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.5.1>3.5.1 Defining a Realm</A></H4>

A realm requires these two parameters:
<UL>
<LI>Realm Name: Specify a name. The name is case-insensitive.
<P>
<LI>Match String: Specify a text string that will be searched for in incoming URLs. It must appear in the names assigned to the actual folders and files that will be included in this realm.
</UL>
Be careful that each match string you enter is unique. If there is a possibility for a URL to match more than one realm, WebSTAR will stop searching once it matches the first realm (based on the order in which they appear in the Realms window). If there is duplication in the match strings, the second realm will never be matched.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  No spaces or Macintosh special characters are allowed in the application path or action name. If those characters appear in a parameter, you need to encode them using the %<I>xx</I> encoding scheme used in URLs, where <I>xx</I> is the hexadecimal code for the ASCII character. For example, a space character (decimal 32, hexadecimal 20) would be encoded as %20). So, "AB C" would be entered as "AB%20C".
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.5.2>3.5.2 Example Realms</A></H4>

For example, suppose you want to configure your server with some files available to everyone, some files available to coworkers, and some files available to customers. You can do so by defining two realms such as:
<UL>
<LI>Realm Name coworkers (match string <I>work</I>). Folders and files in this realm may have URLs such as:
<P>
<CODE>
http://your.host/working_draft.html<BR>
http://your.host/work-info/staff_photo.gif<BR>
http://your.host/personnel/workers_comp.html<BR>
</CODE>
<P>
<LI>Realm Name customers (match string <I>custom</I>). Folders and files in this realm may have URLs such as:
<P>
<CODE>
http://your.host/customer_data/price_list.html<BR>
http://your.host/custom_designs.html<BR>
</CODE>
</UL>
<P>
The match string can be part of a filename or folder name. WebSTAR looks for the match string anywhere in the URL, so you can control access to multiple files by placing them in a folder whose name contains a realm's match string. 
<P>
Once it has found that a file requires authentication, WebSTAR sends the appropriate response to the WWW client, along with the realm name and a request for a user name and password for the realm. The client shows this string to the user when it prompts for a user name and password. WebSTAR uses a combination of the user name and the realm to look up the correct password in the WebSTAR Settings file. If the password supplied by the user matches the password found in the settings file, the requested file is returned. 
<P>
Most client programs retain authentication information, so the user only needs to enter it on the first access.

WebSTAR uses an internal list of security directives to determine if the IP address or domain name of a client is allowed to access the server. If WebSTAR determines that the client is not allowed access, it returns the file designated as the No Access file (see <A HREF=#noaccess>No Access</A>).
<P>
Choose Allow/Deny in the Configure menu to open this dialog box:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/allowdeny.gif"><BR>

<P>

The Allow and Deny dialog box lets you add, delete, or modify security directives (Allow or Deny statements). You can specify any number of statements. To view additional statements, use the scroll bar at the right side of the window.
<P>
Clicking the Edit button when a list item is selected causes the fields of the selected item to appear in the text field and radio button. (Double-clicking an item has the same effect.) Clicking the Replace button when a list item is selected replaces the selected item with the information specified in the text field and radio button.

When you click Update, the changes you have made are stored in the Settings file. If you don't want to save your changes, click Cancel.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.6.1>3.6.1 WebSTAR Default Allow/Deny Behavior</A></H4>

To determine whether a client is allowed to access the server, WebSTAR evaluates the statements in the order in which they appear in the Allow and Deny dialog box.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  By default, all clients are allowed to access a server. However, if you specify even one Allow or Deny statement, that default is reversed so that no clients are allowed to access the server without explicit permission.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.6.2>3.6.2 Using Allow Statements</A></H4>

To enable access to specific hosts only, follow these steps:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Specify a full IP address or hostname to identify a host in the Match String field.
<P>
An example IP address is <CODE>198.211.33.1.</CODE>
<P>
The trailing period in the IP address prevents a match with another address such as 198.211.33.10.
<P>
An example hostname is <CODE>sparky.starnine.com.</CODE>
<P>
<LI>Click the Allow button.
<P>
<LI>Click Add.
<P>
<LI>Specify a partial IP address or domain name in the "match string" field.
<P>
An example partial IP address is <CODE>198.211.33.</CODE> (to specify a domain), 
<P>
or 1 (to allow all IP addresses that begin with "1")
<P>
An example domain name is <CODE>starnine.com</CODE>
<P>
<LI>Click the Allow button.
<P>
<LI>Click Add.
<P>
<LI>Continue adding Allow statements for hosts and domains you want to have access to the server.
<P>
<LI>Click Update.
</OL>

<H4><A NAME=3.6.3>3.6.3 Using Deny Statements</A></H4>

If you need to allow some sites to connect to your site but restrict a handful of hosts or domains, you can bypass the default deny behavior of WebSTAR by specifying Allow statements using the numbers one through nine, which will match the first digit in all possible IP addresses. You can follow these statements with the few explicit Deny statements you need, for example:
<P>
<CODE>
Allow 1<BR>
Allow 2<BR>
Allow 3<BR>
Allow 4<BR>
Allow 5<BR>
Allow 6<BR>
Allow 7<BR>
Allow 8<BR>
Allow 9<BR>
Deny Xyz.com<P>
</CODE>

Another way to deny a few hosts within a domain is to allow the full domain or network portion of the address and then specify restrictions within that Allow statement. For example:
<P>
<CODE>
Allow 129.166.<BR>
Deny 129.166.3 <BR>
Allow 129.166.30.1.<BR>
</CODE>
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  WebSTAR always appends a trailing period when comparing a client's IP address to the security entries. To match exactly one host, the IP address argument must end with a period. For example, the Deny statement shown above matches not only all hosts in the <CODE>129.166.3</CODE> subnet, but also all hosts in the <CODE>129.166.30</CODE> subnet, the <CODE>129.166.31</CODE> subnet, and so forth. If you wanted to only restrict hosts in the <CODE>129.166.3</CODE> subnet, you should add a trailing period to the IP address (<CODE>129.166.3.</CODE>).
<P>
In the example above, WebSTAR first initiates its deny all default behavior. The first Allow statement specifies that clients with addresses that begin with <CODE>129.166</CODE> are allowed to connect to the server. 
<P>
The next Deny statement specifies that all clients with IP addresses that begin with <CODE>129.166.3</CODE> are denied access the server. 
<P>
The next Allow statement explicitly enables the host with the address <CODE>129.166.30.1</CODE> to access the server. This statement matches only one specific address.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.7>3.7 Miscellaneous Settings</A></H4>

To set parameters that affect WebSTAR's performance and general functioning, choose Misc. Settings in the Configure menu. This dialog box appears:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/miscsettings.gif"><BR>

<P>

<H4><A NAME=3.7.1>3.7.1 Connection Settings</A></H4>

The first four parameters in the left column of the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box determine when connections will time out, how many connections can be processed concurrently, and on which port the WebSTAR server listens for connections.
<P>
<B><A NAME=timeout>Timeout</A></B>
<P>
The Timeout parameter determines the maximum amount of idle time in seconds before WebSTAR disconnects a client's inactive connection. It also determines the amount of time WebSTAR will wait for a reply to an Apple event it has sent to an external application. The minimum value is 15 seconds. The maximum value is 600 seconds and the default is 60 seconds. 
<P>
It is important to monitor the average time that clients wait in the queue and adjust the Timeout value accordingly. If it takes longer than the Timeout period for WebSTAR to complete a client's request (for example, if the server is busy or an AppleScript takes a long time to execute), the client will be disconnected.
<P>
<B><A NAME=maxusers>Max Users</A></B>
<P>
This parameter specifies the maximum number of concurrent client connections to the WebSTAR server. The default is 12. The valid range for the Max Users value is 4 to 50. The last 3 connections are reserved for reporting that the server is too busy when all of the other connections are in use. When all of the designated connections are in use, incoming clients are informed that the server is too busy to handle their request.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  In this version of WebSTAR, the maximum number of users should equal the maximum number of listens (see <A HREF=#maxlistens>Max Listens</A>). 
<P>
Theoretically, the maximum number of incoming connections is 1000, although at this release, the number is limited to 50. (MacTCP can handle a maximum of 64 simultaneous connections, and WebSTAR leaves 14 connections for well-known services such as FTP, E-mail, and Telnet.)
<P>
The server can easily get swamped with connections if you have a slow network connection. Requests can come in faster than the server can transmit data to the clients. If you aren't running WebSTAR on a Power Mac, WebSTAR can begin to get bogged down when more than 15 or 20 connections are active. WebSTAR deals with this overload by refusing connections with a reply message that many clients understand to mean "try again in a few seconds," so some users won't even notice a problem.
<P>
The basic rule of thumb is to watch the WebSTAR status window (the bar graphs) and adjust the Max Users up or down, based on your server's load and performance under that load. Don't be afraid to restrict the number of connections if your server cannot handle the load.
<P>
<B><A NAME=maxlistens>Max Listens</A></B>
<P>
Max Listens determines the number of listening connections that WebSTAR uses to handle incoming connections. Generally, this number should be identical to the value for Max Users, although it can be smaller if you aren't using the Thread Manager. It can never be larger than Max Users.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  In this version of WebSTAR, the maximum number of listens should equal the maximum number of users (described above). 
<P>
<B><A NAME=port>Port</A></B>
<P>
This parameter specifies the port number WebSTAR listens to for all incoming connections. The default port is 80.
<P>
You can change this number to allow multiple WebSTAR servers to run on one Macintosh on different ports. See <A HREF=#4.7>Running Multiple WebSTAR Servers.</A>
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.7.2>3.7.2 Performance Settings</A></H4>

The Pig Delay and Buffer Size parameters in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box affect server performance.
<P>
<B><A NAME=pigdelay>Pig Delay</A></B>
<P>
This parameter is not used if WebSTAR is operating in a threaded environment. 
<P>
The Pig Delay parameter is measured in "ticks", which are 60ths of a second. The default is a half second (30 ticks), or 1/2 of a second. Values can range between 0 and 120 ticks. In an unthreaded environment, the parameter specifies the number of ticks that WebSTAR will "steal" from other processes while sending data to clients. The Macintosh is dedicated to WebSTAR for this period of time. 
<P>
You can adjust this number to increase WebSTAR server performance when it is running on a nondedicated Macintosh. The bigger the number you specify for the Pig Delay parameter, the more processor time WebSTAR uses before allowing other applications to run. The smaller the number, the less impact WebSTAR has on other applications. Decreasing the value of this parameter to 15 or 20 allows other applications more time to run. Decreasing the Pig Delay setting too much will cause WebSTAR to be unable to service its connections at a reasonable level of performance. Experiment!
<P>
<B><A NAME=buffer>Buffer Size</A></B>
<P>
This parameter specifies how many bytes WebSTAR can send in a single MacTCP write to the client. The minimum buffer size is 256, and the maximum is 10,240. The default is 4096 bytes.
<P>
With a relatively large buffer size, files take a longer time to transfer over slow connections. You can adjust the buffer size to accommodate slower connections. The smaller the buffer size, the faster WebSTAR can send a buffer of data to a slow client without slowing down all the other connections. Unfortunately, there is a point of diminishing return, where the smaller buffer begins to cause WebSTAR to spend more time thrashing through connection servicing than sending data. Usually a value between 512 and 2048 works well for slow clients. If you have a lot of high speed clients, WebSTAR performs better with larger buffer size settings like 4096 or 8192. Experiment to determine the optimum size.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  PC-based WWW clients that use the Trumpet socket driver may experience problems with WebSTAR if the buffer size is greater than 8K. Lowering the size or reconfiguring Trumpet to allow larger incoming buffers will solve the problem. 
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.7.3>3.7.3 Use DNS</A></H4>
<P>
The Use DNS check box tells WebSTAR whether or not to perform a DNS lookup when a WWW client connects to the server. By default, it is checked.
<P>
When this option is checked, the WebSTAR server performs a DNS lookup, caches the hostname, and uses the hostname in reporting and logging. The advantage of performing DNS lookups is that clients' hostnames appear in the log file instead of the much more cryptic IP addresses. The disadvantage is that if a problem occurs during the lookup, the lookup has to time out before the server can proceed. This can decrease server performance if many incoming connections have unresolvable addresses or if the DNS server at your site is slow.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.7.4>3.7.4 Special Files</A></H4>
<P>
With the exception of the log file, all special files can be simple HTML documents or SCRIPT, CGI, or ACGI applications.
<P>
<B><A NAME=index>Index</A></B>
<P>
An index file is the default document returned if a URL specifies the document "/" or no document at all. If you don't specify an Index filename, the default index file is named <CODE>default.html.</CODE>
<P>
Use the Index text field in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box to designate the name for an index file for the server. The file does not need to be named "index" or "default," it can be any simple filename. The file may be an HTML file, or the name of a script or application to execute.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  The name you enter must be a simple filename. You may not specify a path or partial path as you can for other special files.
<P>
When a file with the designated name appears in the WebSTAR folder, WebSTAR will return it if a URL specifies the folder without a filename. Any folder in the WebSTAR hierarchy can have an index file, as long as the file has the file name you specify in the Index field. However, if you want to use a different filename for an index file in a subfolder, you can make an alias of the file and rename the <I>alias</I> to the Index filename. 
<P>
<B><A NAME=error>Error</A></B>
<P>
Use the Error text field in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box to type the name of the file to be returned by the server if an error occurs. This is usually an information message telling the user that a requested file cannot be found. The default filename is <CODE>error.html.</CODE>
<P>
The error file resides in the same directory as the WebSTAR application. Relative pathnames begin with a colon (:), which indicates the current directory. So, when you type the name in the Error text field, precede it with a colon.
<P>
<CODE>:error.html</CODE>
<P>
<B><A NAME=noaccess>No Access</A></B>
<P>
Use the No Access text field in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box to type the name of the file to be returned if a client is refused access based on Allow/Deny statements in the Settings file. See <A HREF=#3.6>Allow and Deny</A>. The default filename is <CODE>noaccess.html.</CODE>
<P>
The No Access file resides in the same directory as the WebSTAR application. Relative pathnames begin with a colon (:), which indicates the current directory. So, when you type the name in the No Access text field, precede it with a colon.
<P>
<CODE>:noaccess.html</CODE>
<P>
<B><A NAME=logfile>Log File</A></B>
<P>
Use the Log File text field in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box to type the name of the log file for the server. The default filename is <CODE>WebSTAR Log</CODE>. A log of all client accesses is maintained in this file. See <A HREF=#3.8>Log Format.</A>
<P>
The Log file must reside in the same directory as the WebSTAR application. Relative pathnames begin with a colon (:), which indicates the current directory. So, when you type the name in the Log File text field, precede it with a colon.
<P>
<CODE>:WebSTAR Log</CODE>
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.7.5>3.7.5 Preprocessing and Postprocessing of URLs</A></H4>

Designating a CGI or ACGI application to preprocess URLs allows you to perform an action <I>before</I> the server processes the URL. For example, you could implement your own security check, bypassing the security in WebSTAR in favor of a different username/password scheme. Or, you could examine every incoming request, look at the preferred language being requested by the browser, and route English requests to one machine and French to another. Another use is would be to implement an alternate storage scheme for WWW data other than the Mac file system; for example, every URL request could be mapped into a database query.
<P>
Designating a CGI or ACGI application to postprocess URLs allows you to perform an action after the URL has been processed. For example, you could use a postprocessor application to implement a different form of transaction logging that keeps a summary instead of an exact log of each transaction. Or, a postprocessor could be used to support a billing scheme in the event that you want to charge for individual page accesses.
<P>
<B><A NAME=preprocess>Preprocess</A></B>
<P>
Use the Preprocess text field in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box to type the name of an external application to be executed before any URL is processed by the server.
<P>
Only one preprocessor application can be called by WebSTAR, although daisy-chaining is allowed. WebSTAR launches that application and sends every URL and associated WWW request for information from the WWW client to the preprocessor application before processing the client's request for data.
<P>
If the preprocessor returns any data at all to WebSTAR, WebSTAR assumes that the preprocessor has completely handled any processing necessary to deal with the requested URL. So, it skips any further URL processing and returns the data it received from the preprocessor to the client.
<P>
If the preprocessor application returns an empty string (for example, if it returns "" in AppleScript), WebSTAR proceeds with normal processing of the URL request, including calling CGIs and returning text or binary files.
<P>
<B><A NAME=postprocess>Postprocess</A></B>
<P>
Use the Postprocess text field in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box to type the name of an external application to be executed after the URL is fulfilled.
<P>
As in preprocessing, only one postprocessor application can be called by WebSTAR. After WebSTAR has retrieved the file requested by a URL, it sends the file to the postprocessor application. 
<P>
The postprocessor application is run <I>after</I> the TCP/IP connection to the client has been closed and the it should not return any data to WebSTAR. 
<P>
<H4><A NAME=3.7.6>3.7.6 Default MIME type</A></H4>

WebSTAR can serve any kind of data. It is not limited to HTML documents, although it is configured "out of the box" to use text/html as the default MIME type. That means that if a URL does not match any of the defined Suffix Mappings, the server uses this default:
<P>
<DT></DT>
<DD>Action: <B><TT>BINARY</TT></B>-- Suffix: <B><TT>*</TT></B>-- Type/Creator: <B><TT>* * </TT></B>-- MIME: <B><TT>text/html</TT></B></DD>
<P>
You can change the default MIME type by typing another valid MIME type in this field. For example, if you type this in the Default MIME field:
<P>
<CODE>text/pdf</CODE>
<P>
you have a server configured for PDF files by default.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=3.8>3.8 Log Format</A></H3>
<P>
The Log Format command in the Configure menu lets you specify what kind of information to include in log file entries. 
<P>
The Log file is in the same folder as the WebSTAR folder and uses the name you specify in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog box. See <A HREF=#logfile>Log File.</A>
<P>
Typically, WebSTAR logs messages about each transaction it performs. Each message may include the details shown in the Log Format dialog box (below).
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/logformat.gif"><BR>

<P>

Entries in the log file are separated by tabs, and individual entries are terminated with a carriage return. This format is the standard text-only import format used by most spreadsheet applications, such as Excel, and by Macintosh database applications like FileMaker.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  To suspend logging, choose Suspend Logging in the Options menu.
<P>
You use the log format property list to set the format of messages written to the screen and the log file. Highlight a format property in the Log Format list and click Copy to add that property to the log file.
<P>
The properties and their interpretations are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>DATE:  The current date<P>
<LI>TIME:  The current time<P>
<LI>RESULT:  The results of the request, which may be OK, ERR!, or PRIV.<P>
<LI>HOSTNAME:  The name of the WWW client's computer<P>
<LI>URL:  The requested URL path<P>
<LI>PATH_ARGS:  The path arguments to the URL (text after a dollar sign)<P>
<LI>SEARCH_ARGS:  The search arguments to the URL (text after a question mark)<P>
<LI>METHOD:  The HTTP method, usually GET or POST<P>
<LI>BYTES_SENT:  The number of bytes transmitted<P>
<LI>TRANSFER_TIME:  The number of ticks required to complete the transmission<P>
<LI>AGENT:  The identity of the WWW client software such as Mosaic or Netscape<P>
<LI>USER:  The name of remote user if authentication was required<P>
<LI>FROM:  The contents of the From field in the request, usually an E-mail address if present<P>
<LI>REFERER:  The name of the document referencing this URL<P>
</UL>
<B>NOTE:</B> Not all WWW clients provide all of the information represented by all of these properties.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=3.9>3.9 Add Password</A></H3>

In the WebSTAR Admin application, you can restrict incoming connections based on the IP address or domain name of the remote client, or you can assign user name/password authentication to specific files and folders. To restrict incoming connections based on the IP address or domain name of the remote client, see <A HREF=#3.6>Allow and Deny.</A>
<P>
To assign user name/password authentication, you need to set up your folder hierarchy with security realms in mind (see <A HREF=#3.5>Realms</A>). Then, you can assign the user name/password authentication required to access data within a realm. The user name/password authentication in WebSTAR is the same as the basic authentication scheme built into most WWW clients (with the exception of older versions of MacWeb and Mosaic). For WWW clients that have built-in authentication, users only have to enter the appropriate user name and password once. The client remembers the user name and password and sends it automatically for future requests.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  Authentication is optional. You can choose not to activate any password-based security on your server.
<P>
To add user names and passwords, choose Passwords in the Configure menu. The Add Passwords dialog box appears:
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/addpasswords.gif"><BR>

<P>

To assign a user name and password to a realm, follow these steps:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Define at least one security realm. See <A HREF=#3.5>Realms.</A>
<P>
<LI>Choose Passwords in the Configure menu to open the Add Passwords dialog box.
<P>
<LI>Select the realm in the Realm pop-up.
<P>
<LI>Type a user name and a password in the appropriate fields.
<P>
<LI>Click Add.
</OL>
<P>
The new user name will appear in the scrolling list, along with the realm to which it is assigned. A user name may be entered in multiple realms, but each user name/realm combination must be unique in this window.
<P>
User names are available immediately as soon as you add them; there is no need to stop or start the server. In addition, WebSTAR can continue to serve files while you are adding user name and password information.

<H2><A NAME=4.0>4.0 Administering WebSTAR</A></H2>

This section provides some background on how WebSTAR works and discusses some general administration issues.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.1>4.1 Notes About HTTP Connections</A></H3>
<P>
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) defines how a Web server handles connections. Unlike the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), in which a client opens a connection with a server, opens another connection to transfer data, and holds both connections open for the whole length of the session, HTTP opens a connection only for as long as it’s needed to transfer the requested data. The connection is then closed immediately.
<P>
This method of handling connections has a few implications for the administrator of a Web server. First, there is no way for WebSTAR to keep track of where a connection leads. So, if a user requests data from your server, there is no way for the WebSTAR server itself to track which links are followed within that data, because the connection is closed once the original data is returned. 
<P>
In the context of HTTP connections, you should also be aware that each separate element in a page requires its own connection. For example, a page of text requires one connection to download. If that page contains a graphic, another connection is required. So, connection information is not necessarily a reliable way of analyzing a server’s activity. For example, if you have a server with 5,000 connections a day serving a text document and you add a graphic to that document, you suddenly have a server with 10,000 connections a day.


<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.2>4.2 Client and Server Aspects of URL Handling</A></H3>
<P>
WWW client software is responsible for constructing the full URL for a document, which contains the server's hostname and possibly a path to the folder containing the WebSTAR server. For example, this is a full URL to an HTML document:
<P>
<CODE>http://www.abc.com/sampledoc.html</CODE>
<P>
The portion of this URL handled by WebSTAR is:
<P>
<CODE>/sampledoc.html</CODE>
<P>
WebSTAR handles only URLs relative to its own position on the disk. In effect, the "root" of the WebSTAR file system starts with the folder in which it resides. 
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  The Macintosh on which WebSTAR is running has an IP address, which is assigned in MacTCP. Its hostname is assigned in the DNS server for your site. A machine can have more than one name. The WWW client software handles the DNS lookup to find the IP address that corresponds to the hostname in the URL.
<P>
When the WebSTAR server receives an incoming URL, it performs the steps described below.<BR>
<OL>
<LI>First, it converts the slashes in the URL to colons to obtain a Macintosh path.
<P>
<LI>The server then converts HTTP special characters (using %<I>xx</I>, where <I>xx</I> is the two-digit hex number of the special character).
<P>
<LI>It replaces double-colons (::) with a single colon (:). This prevents clients from accessing parent directories in the Macintosh file system. 
<P>
<LI>It extracts the suffix of the requested file and uses it to determine the actions to perform. 
If there is no suffix (or no Suffix Mapping specifying an action), it examines the Macintosh Type and Creator of the requested file and uses those fields 
to determine which actions to perform.
<P>
<LI>It determines if the requested filename (as modified by the preceding steps) is an alias and if so, translates it to the real path for the file.
<P>
<LI>The server opens the file and performs the specified action, or if no action is specified, uses the appropriate file transfer method and default MIME type to return the data to the requesting client.
<P>
</OL>
For more information on URLs, see the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">URL Primer.</A>
<P>
<H4><A NAME=4.2.1>4.2.1 Client and Server Aspects of Script Execution</A></H4>

If the suffix of an incoming URL requires execution of an AppleScript, a CGI application, or an ACGI application, the WebSTAR server simply packages up the incoming request and passes it to the specified application or script as an Apple event. It doesn't verify or translate the result before returning it to the client. In addition, the application or script is expected to generate a complete HTTP header.
<P>
For example, if a user clicks on a map or sends a form, the WWW client software is responsible for figuring out the map coordinates or filling in the form before it is sent to WebSTAR. WebSTAR then packages this information and passes it to a CGI application for processing. (This behavior is unlike that of the NCSA Web server, which processes maps directly.) 
<P>
When WebSTAR receives such information from a client, it passes the information to the application as parameters and returns the result to the client without modification. If the client receives erroneous data, both the client software and the CGI itself are possible causes. Or, it's possible that an erroneous Suffix Mapping configuration could cause the server to use an inappropriate MIME type or transfer method.
<P>
If you run into problems with defaults or specific Suffix Mapping parameters, you can instruct users to configure their WWW clients appropriately. For example, for Mac Mosaic to "understand" Excel files, a user may need to map the .XL suffix to a specific MIME type (such as application/excel) and then map the MIME type to a Helper application that can be launched to view the document. Then, when the user sends a URL like this:
<P>
<CODE>http://www.abc.com/bigbucks.xl </CODE>
<P>
WebSTAR will send the file and appropriate header information to the WWW client, and the client  will know what is being returned and which Helper application to launch.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=4.2.2>4.2.2 Client and Server Aspects of File Transfers</A></H4>

WebSTAR uses text/html as the default MIME type, unless you have configured a different default. So, if a client sends a URL requesting data and no Suffix Mapping or file type mappings are found, WebSTAR assumes that the request is for an HTML document and sends it using the appropriate MIME type. However, sometimes older WWW clients don't <I>use</I> the MIME type information returned by WebSTAR. In that case, in the absence of obvious information about the data it is receiving, the client resorts to using its own built-in default, for example, MacBinary. This kind of cross-purpose use of defaults can cause a client to be unable to interpret a document.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.3>4.3 Folder and Filenames</A></H3>

WebSTAR handles spaces and special characters in folder names and filenames, but it's a good idea to avoid spaces and special characters in any folder or filenames that WebSTAR will be serving. Otherwise, you must encode the special characters in filenames using the URL standard %<I>xx</I> encodings for each special character, where <I>xx</I> is the hexadecimal code for the ASCII character. For example, a space character (decimal 32, hexadecimal 20) would be encoded as %20). So, "AB C" would be entered as "AB%20C".
<P>
If you are using security realms to protect certain information, you must name folders and files appropriately to assign the proper access control. For example, if a Private realm is configured with the match string private, the names all folders or files within that realm must contain that match string. See <A HREF=#3.5>Realms.</A>

<H4><A NAME=4.3.1>4.3.1 Folder and File Aliases</A></H4>

You can use aliases to folders and files that reside outside the WebSTAR folder, including those that reside on different volumes or different machines on the network. As long as the alias resides within the WebSTAR folder, URLs will work correctly.
<P>
You can also use aliases to supply required filename suffixes without renaming the original files. WebSTAR uses the name of the alias for Suffix Mapping, and then translates the alias to find the original file's contents.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  Although you can use aliases to original files and folders that aren't contained within the WebSTAR folder hierarchy, any URLs contained in the aliased files must still provide paths that are relative to where WebSTAR resides. This is done for security purposes and isn't subject to change.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.4>4.4 Warnings About Script and Application Execution</A></H3>

WebSTAR provides read-only access to files within its own folder hierarchy. This is an important security feature. However, if you allow the WebSTAR server to execute AppleScripts, the burden falls on the script writer to make sure that only files and folders within that folder hierarchy can be accessed.
<P>
If you don't want to allow script execution (or if you don't have AppleScript installed), disable script execution by opening the Suffix Mapping dialog box and making sure that none of the entries defines a SCRIPT, CGI, or ACGI type.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.5>4.5 Warnings About Macintosh Documents</A></H3>
<P>
Macintosh documents must be transferred as binary data and must contain all of their data in the data fork of the file. For example, you need to define Suffix Mappings for Excel or Word documents that ensure that those documents will be sent as binary data. See <A HREF=#3.2>Suffix Mapping</A>. The documents will not be viewable by users on machines that don't possess applications capable of reading Mac files.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.6>4.6 Creating a No Access Message</A></H3>
<P>
A No Access file is returned when the client has been refused access to the site because of the <A HREF=#3.6>Allow/Deny</A> settings. The administrator has to create the <A HREF=#noaccess>No Access</A> messages, which should state that access was denied and perhaps explain why. For example,<BR>
<PRE>
&lt;HTML>
&lt;HEAD>
&lt;TITLE>Access Denied&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;

Sorry, this site is restricted!&lt;P&gt;


&lt;EM&gt;Last Edited: May 15, 1995&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
The No Access file can be an HTML file or even a CGI application that gives different responses based on the address of the client. For example, you might return a message to all .COM addresses such as:
<BR>
<PRE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Access Denied&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;

<H3><A NAME=4.7>4.7 Running Multiple WebSTAR Servers </A></H3>

If you want to have a WWW service that has some public and some private pages and you don't want to use security realms, you can run multiple WebSTAR servers on a single Macintosh. One server can be set up with no access restrictions, while another restricts access to specified hosts.
<P>
All port numbers lower than 1024 are reserved for well-known services. WebSTAR is assigned port number 80 by default. If you are running multiple servers, you need to assign a different port number for the additional servers. Although you can use any unreserved, available port numbers, the convention is to use ports in the 8000 range (such as 8001) for additional WebSTAR servers. 
<P>
See <A HREF=#port>Port</A> for details on specifying an alternate port number for a selected WebSTAR server. When multiple servers are set up, URLs to the alternate servers (those not using port 80) must specify the right port number. For example:
<P>
<CODE>http://www.abc.com:8001/privatedoc.html</CODE>
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  If you want to run multiple servers on different Macs, you need a unique serial number for each WebSTAR server on the network. See the README for guidelines in setting up multiple servers on a network to distribute the processing load.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=4.8>4.8 Troubleshooting</A></H3>

This section describes some commonly asked questions and answers.<BR>
<DL>
<DD>Q:   When I launch the WebSTAR Admin application, I can't see my WebSTAR servers across the network, even though I know it is running.</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   Most likely the Macintosh running WebSTAR does not have program linking turned on at one or more of the three possible levels. See <A HREF=#3.1>Turning On Program Linking.</A></DD>
<P>
</DD>Q:   Many access requests are being denied and users are seeing the message in our No Access file, but I haven't intentionally denied access to those users.</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   When you first launch the WebSTAR server, <I>all</I> clients are allowed to access a server. But if you specify <I>even one</I> Allow or Deny statement, that default is reversed so that no clients are allowed to access the server without explicit permission. Probably you entered one or two Allow or Deny statements and did not realize that you were excluding all other clients. See <A HREF=#3.6>Allow and Deny</A> for ways to use this security method.</DD>
<P>
<DD>Q:   I see a  message "Error receiving results from ACGI execution. (-1701)" in an HTML page.  What does it mean?</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   This message means you have a bug in your script. Even if it compiled correctly, the script is failing to return any data and WebSTAR gives up waiting for it. Add some 
<P>
<CODE>try... on error</CODE>
<P>
syntax around your entire script to catch the error and return some meaningful messages.</DD>
<P>
<DD>Q:   I want to make some Mac files accessible through the WebSTAR server. What do I need to do?</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   To make Macintosh files visible to WWW clients, you should create a URL link to those files in an HTML document (your Home Page or another HTML document). Then, you should check that a Suffix Mapping entry exists to return the Mac files appropriately. If necessary, add an entry to your Suffix Mapping configuration.</DD>
<P>
<DD>Q:   Some users are reporting that they can't access a Macintosh file that's available on the server. I can access the file fine with WWW client software. What should I look for?</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   Most likely the users' WWW client software is not configured properly. Try to get a detailed description of what happens and then contact StarNine support. </DD>
<P>
<DD>Q:   A little while after I configured WebSTAR, it quit. What could cause this?</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   Probably WebSTAR ran out of memory. The most common reason for this is that it was processing too many concurrent connections. If you increased the Max Users setting, you should also increase the WebSTARapplication memory. To increase application memory, select the WebSTAR icon and choose Get Info in the Finder File menu. Then, type a higher number in the Current Size text field. A good rule of thumb is to add 100K for each connection beyond the default 12.</DD>
<P>
<DD>Q:   Macintosh users on the local network can connect to my Web server but PC users can't. Why?</DD>
<P>
<DD>A:   The first thing to check is whether the PC users have IP connectivity. If everything seems fine with TCP/IP, verify you have not denied access to PC users based on their IP addresses. See <A HREF=#3.6>Allow and Deny</A>.</DD>

<H2><A NAME=5.0>5.0 AppleScript and Apple Event Support</A></H2>

This section describes Apple event and scripting support in WebSTAR. It is intended for programmers.
<P>

<H3><A NAME=5.1>5.1 AppleScript Support</A></H3>

WebSTAR is completely scriptable and recordable. This section describes how WebSTAR interacts with AppleScript and passes information to a text script or CGI application.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=5.1.1>5.1.1 Searchable Documents, Maps, and Forms</A></H4>

You can use the WebSTAR software's ability to execute scripts and external applications to implement searchable documents, clickable maps, fill-in forms and all sorts of other neat WWW applications. 
<P>
For information about building these types of AppleScripts and CGI applications, see the Tutorials folder. The Tutorials folder is included on the WebSTAR CD-ROM. To access it on the World Wide Web, see the <A HREF=http://www.starnine.com/webstar.html>WebSTAR Home Page.</A>
<P>
<H4><A NAME=5.1.2>5.1.2 Text Scripts and CGI Applications</A></H4>

Some important notes:
<UL>
<LI>SCRIPT type files must be saved as "Text Only" in the Script Editor. Only text scripts can accept the global variables passed by WebSTAR.
<LI>CGI and ACGI type files created in AppleScript must be saved as Applications in the Script Editor with the Keep Open and Never Show Startup Screen check boxes selected. 
<LI>You <I>must</I> perform all HTML formatting inside the AppleScript file. WebSTAR expects your script or application to generate and return a proper HTTP/1.0 header and does no conversion on the return values from CGI and ACGI type files. SCRIPT type files have some processing done to strip spurious quotes and convert carriage returns returned by AppleScript.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME=5.1.3>5.1.3 Global Variables Passed by WebSTAR</A></H4>

WebSTAR assigns values to certain global AppleScript variables and inserts them at the top of a text script before passing it to AppleScript for execution. All of these variables represent information passed to WebSTAR from a WWW client, or information known by WebSTAR and needed by scripts and applications.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  The information contained in the global variables is also passed to CGI and ACGI scripts and applications as named parameters to an Apple event. See Named Parameters for details.
<P>
The values assigned by WebSTAR to global variables (or named parameters) correspond to the same arguments defined in the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard, which was originally developed as a mechanism for passing arguments from a UNIX server to shell scripts and applications on UNIX hosts.
<P>
WebSTAR passes the variables listed below to SCRIPTs. AppleScripts that are CGIs and ACGIs don't necessarily have these variable names predefined. Instead, there are named parameters passed to these types of external applications. See <A HREF=#5.2.2>Named Parameters.</A>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>http_search_args</CODE>-arguments to the URL after a question mark (?)
<P>
<LI><CODE>path_args</CODE>-arguments to the URL after a dollar sign ($)
<P>
<LI><CODE>post_args</CODE>-actual form data<BR>
To use these three variables in a form page, you might use the following URL to define where the CGI application is:<BR>
<P>
<CODE>&lt;form action="ProcessForm.cgi$JimmyJones?14" method=post&gt;</CODE>
<P>
This URL puts the following values in the http_search_args and path_args variables:<BR>
<CODE>
path_args:  JimmyJones<BR>
http_search_args:  14
</CODE>
<P>
The actual form data (returned from running the CGI application) is put in the post_args variable.
<P>
<LI>method-HTTP method<BR>
The HTTP method, usually GET or POST, is passed in the post arguments method.<BR>
If the HTTP method is POST, the form data sent in the object body of the HTTP request is returned to the server in the post_args variable. Otherwise, this variable is empty.<BR>
<P>
If the HTTP method is GET, the form data overwrites the http_search_args variable.<BR>
<P>
If you are using a map-processing CGI, you might use the method=get argument to pass the name of a map information file that the CGI should use to process the map. The URL might look like this:<BR>
<P><CODE>
/cgi/MapServe.acgi$jonsmap.map
</CODE><P>
When a user clicks on the map, the client software changes this URL so that the map coordinates are added in the search arguments. The full URL transmitted to WebSTAR would look something like this:
<P><CODE>
/cgi/MapServe.acgi$jonsmap.map?223,12
</CODE><P>
<P>
<LI><CODE>client_address</CODE>-IP address or domain name of remote client's host
<P>
<LI><CODE>from_user</CODE>-nonstandard, E-mail address of remote user<BR>
Some clients allow users to set a default E-mail address in the preferences and will include this address as information to WebSTAR. If found, WebSTAR puts this information in the from_user variable and sends it to a CGI application.
<P>
<LI><CODE>username</CODE>-authenticated user name
<P>
<LI><CODE>password</CODE>-authenticated password
<P>
<LI><CODE>server_name</CODE>-name or IP address of this server
<P>
<LI><CODE>server_port</CODE>-TCP/IP port number being used by this server
<P>
<LI><CODE>script_name</CODE>-URL name of this script<BR>
When a URL is received that will execute a preprocessor or user-defined action, the URL is passed as the <CODE>script_name</CODE> argument. Any path arguments in the URL (text after a dollar sign) are passed in the path_argument parameter to the ACGI. 
<P>
<LI><CODE>referer</CODE>-the URL of the page referencing this document<BR>
This variable gives the complete URL for the page the client was displaying when this page was requested (the page displayed <I>before</I> accessing your server). This is useful for telling what sites are referencing your pages. It can also be useful in a CGI to add a "return" link to pages on-the-fly that would return users to whatever page they came from.
<P>
<LI><CODE>user_agent</CODE>-the name and version of the WWW client being used
<P>
<LI><CODE>content_type</CODE>-MIME content type of post_args
See the sample scripts distributed with WebSTAR for examples of how these variables are used.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME=5.2>5.2 Apple Events</A></H3>
<P>
WebSTAR includes Apple events and application properties to set all configuration parameters. For the most part, the syntax of the data sent by the AppleScript Set commands, or returned by the AppleScript Get commands is the same as the syntax for setting parameters in previous releases of MacHTTP. See the script that comes with this release for an example.
<P>
Many of the application properties can be found in the Apple event dictionary for WebSTAR, viewable in the Script Editor.
<P>
The event suite for WebSTAR Apple events is the same as the four-character creator code for the WebSTAR application. This is three uppercase Ws (WWW), followed by the omega character (<img align=bottom src=gifs/omega.gif> , generated by typing option-Z). The event codes for each event are listed after each event description.<BR>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="5.2.1">5.2.1 Apple Event Suite</A></H4>
WebSTAR supports the four required Apple events, plus a custom Apple event suite for sending information to WebSTAR while it is running. The four required events don't do much, because WebSTAR doesn't open or print any documents of its own. However, the custom event suite is very useful for operating WebSTAR under script control or from a remote Macintosh. These are the events in the custom Apple event suite:

If WebSTAR receives a query (GET) from a WWW client requesting a file whose Suffix Mapping is CGI, or ACGI (an executable application), WebSTAR attempts to execute the application and communicate with it via custom Apple events. 

Currently, WebSTAR supports both the "Search Doc" and "Search" Apple events for communication with standard Macintosh applications or AppleScript applications.

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>  Use of the "Search" Apple event is discouraged. It is an older, less capable Apple event that is supported for backward compatibility with older versions of WebSTAR. The four-character event code is <CODE>srch</CODE>. It receives search arguments in the direct parameter and is expected to return an HTTP/1.0 response header and data in the reply parameter.
<P>
The "Search Doc" Apple event is how WebSTAR implements the Common Gateway Interface standard. The four-character Event Suite is <CODE>WWW</CODE><img align=bottom src=gifs/omega.gif>-three uppercase Ws (WWW), followed by the omega character (generated by typing option-Z). The four-character event code is sdoc. For example:<BR>
<CODE><DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD>on &lt;&lt;event WWW<img align=bottom src=gifs/omega.gif>sdoc&gt;&gt;</DD>
</DL>
</CODE><P>
The Apple event keyword codes for the parameters passed by WebSTAR to CGI and ACGI applications are listed below. You can name the variables associated with these parameters whatever you like.

</CODE>
The direct parameter (---) contains the path arguments as passed from the WWW client to WebSTAR. Path arguments are the portion of a URL following a dollar sign and preceding a question mark. For example, the URL
<P>

<CODE>
http://www.abc.com/map_handler.cgi$world_map.gif?123,232 
</CODE>
<P>
is interpreted as follows:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>www.abc.com</CODE> is passed in <CODE>svnm</CODE>.
<LI>The default port number 80 is passed in <CODE>svpt</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>/map_handler.cgi</CODE> is passed in the <CODE>scnm</CODE> parameter.
<LI><CODE>world_map.gif</CODE> is passed in the path arguments (direct) parameter.
<LI><CODE>123,232</CODE> is passed in the search arguments <CODE>(kfor)</CODE> parameter.
The HTTP method, usually GET or POST, is passed in the <CODE>post</CODE> parameter.<BR>
If the HTTP method is POST, the post data sent in the object body of the HTTP request is passed in the post parameter. Otherwise, this parameter is empty.<BR>
<LI>The <CODE>ctyp</CODE> (content type) parameter contains the MIME type of any post argument data.
</UL>
The <CODE>Kact</CODE> and <CODE>Kapt</CODE> parameters inform the application whether it is running as a CGI or an action. Both contain character strings. If the application is running as a CGI or ACGI instead of an action, <CODE>Kact</CODE> will contain CGI or ACGI and the path will be the same as the scnm parameter.
<P>
The <CODE>Kcip</CODE> parameter contains the IP address of the client as a string. It is always the IP address of the client, regardless of the No DNS setting. The <CODE>Kfrq</CODE> parameter contains is the unmodified text of the complete request as received from the WWW client.
<P>
All other variables are filled in from information in the HTTP/1.0 request header or from information known to the server. See the <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html">Common Gateway Interface standards document</A> for more details on what each parameter means. Note that the referenced document is a good reference for conceptual purposes only-the way parameters are passed, their names, and other specifics are different on the Macintosh.
<P>
WebSTAR expects the Apple event reply's direct parameter to contain an HTTP/1.0 header and HTML text that will be transmitted to the client.
<P>
If you are a C or Pascal programmer, the above information will make sense. If you are creating compiled AppleScript applications, see the scripting examples in the Tutorials folder for more details. The Tutorials folder is included on the WebSTAR CD-ROM. To access it on the World Wide Web, see the <A HREF="http://www.starnine.com/webstar.html">WebSTAR Home Page.</A>
<P>
<H4><A NAME=5.2.3>5.2.3 Receiving Apple Events from Other Applications</A></H4>

WebSTAR can receive requests from other applications that they be notified of messages or status information about WebSTAR. Requests are made by applications sending a Request Reporting event to WebSTAR:
<P>
<DL>
<CODE>
<DD>Remote logging:<BR></DD>
<DD>request reporting: Request real-time status reports be sent to caller</DD>
<P>
<DD>request reporting messages boolean status boolean id integer</DD>
<P>
<DD>messages boolean requests log messages from the server (true=on/false=off)<BR></DD>
<DD>status boolean requests status information (usage levels, etc.)
id integer requests a unique ID for the caller</DD>
</CODE>
</DL>
<P>
An application sending this event to WebSTAR will receive an event of class and code <CODE>WWW<img align=bottom src=gifs/omega.gif>Rrep. Ksta, Kmsg,</CODE> and <CODE>Kpid</CODE> are sent as arguments to this event. The first two are of type "char," and the last is a "long integer" (the same value as the requestor passes to the event above in the ID parameter.
<P>
The <CODE>WWW<img align=bottom src=gifs/omega.gif>Rrep</CODE> event is sent by WebSTAR every 15 seconds with an empty <CODE>Kmsg</CODE> parameter and a <CODE>Ksta</CODE> parameter with contents identical to the result returned from the WebSTAR Status Report event. Also, anytime the internal message buffer in WebSTAR exceeds 8K or an urgent message is sent, all queued message data is sent to all subscribing applications in the <CODE>Kmsg</CODE> parameter.
<P>
The fields and names are guaranteed to always be in the same order and have the same name. Any new status parameters are added onto the end of the string. So, you can parse by position rather than caring about the name of the field if you'd like. Field syntax is always &lt;id&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;id&gt;&lt;space&gt;   , so "space" is the first token delimiter, and "comma-space" is the second.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=5.3>5.3 Where to Find Script and CGI Examples</A></H3>
<P>
The Tutorials folder contains many example AppleScripts and CGI applications, and provides instructions for learning about how to write scripts and CGIs. You'll need the Script Editor application (included) to work with the examples.
<P>
The Tutorials folder is included on the WebSTAR CD-ROM. To access it on the World Wide Web, see the <A HREF="http://www.starnine.com/webstar.html">WebSTAR Home Page.</A>

<TITLE>WebSTAR Questions and Answers
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>WebSTAR Questions and Answers</H1>

<ul>
<li><b>Q: How come my scripts and CGI applications don't work from my form? All I get is
junk on the screen.</b><br>
    <b>A: </b>You used the Open Local or Open File command from your WWW client
    running on the same Mac as WebSTAR to open your form.
    Opening a file directly with the client, without connecting to the WebSTAR server first,
    means that the client is using a file:// URL instead of an http:// URL to access the
    file. If you don't have a complete URL specified as the action procedure in your form,
    the client has no idea how to run your CGI script or application.
    <p>

<li><b>Q: Why doesn't WebSTAR index directories automatically, like UNIX servers do?</b><br>
    <b>A:</b> This is a HUGE security hole in UNIX servers. It means clients can access ANY file
    in a directory. WebSTAR is designed so that a malicious user can't
    crawl all over your hard drive, looking at stuff in every directory. You can provide
    directory indexing functionality using a few lines of AppleScript code. 
    See the examples that come
    with WebSTAR for details.
    <p>

<li><b>Q: Can WebSTAR serve up a default file when a directory is accessed?</b><br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes! A file named the same as the INDEX file specified in your WebSTAR.config file
    can be present in each directory in your WebSTAR document tree. Accessing a URL that points
    to a folder name will return the default document in the folder instead.
    <p>

<li><b>Q: Am I stuck with serving HTML files for my INDEX, ERROR, and NOACCESS files?</b><br>
    <b>A:</b> No. WebSTAR will serve any type of document that has a suffix mapping for 
    these three special files. Scripts and CGIs are especially handy for
    handling ERROR condititions, since they have access to information like the URL of the
    nonexistent file and the page that referenced that URL. This enables you to generate
    automatic replies to clients, rather than simply returning a generic error message.
    <p>

<li><b>Q: My SCRIPT or CGI doesn't run. I get nothing on my client's screen.</b><br>
    <b>A:</b> Your script or CGI is failing before it returns a result to WebSTAR.
    Try running the script or CGI interactively, using the Script Editor. Pass dummy
    arguments or predefined variables to get the script to run. It also helps to use
    AppleScript's <b>try...on error</b> construct to trap errors, so something is always 
    returned to WebSTAR.
    <p>


<li><b>Q: How do I return a complete HTML document or GIF from a script or CGI application?</b><br>
    <b>A:</b> URL redirection is the trick. The Found 302 HTTP response code makes this possible.
    See the <a href=http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html>HTTP/1.0 standard</a>
    for details. Return this status code and a Location: header field with a complete URL to
    the document you want to return.
    <p>

<li><b>Q: How can I retrieve WebSTAR's status window if it has moved off the screen?</b><br>
    <b>A:</b> Launch WebSTAR and hold down the mouse button while WebSTAR starts. This will reset
    the WebSTAR window to its default position.
    <p>

With this exciting add-on, Internet customers simply connect to the WebSTAR server and fill in an on-line order form, and presto! They've purchased your information, services, or products.  The Commerce Toolkit automatically verifies the buyer with the First Virtual system and then notifies WebSTAR to complete the transaction.  And, with SSL included, all transactions are completely secure. Whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a large corporation or even a University department, start marketing to the biggest on-line community in the world...with WebSTAR!<p>

<h2>Save on <a href=http://www.starnine.com/liststar.html>ListSTAR</a><img align=top src=gifs/tm.gif>, the easy Listserver for Macintosh </h2>
Purchase WebSTAR before July 31, 1995, and we'll send you a coupon to save 20% on ListSTAR, the ultimate companion product for your WebSTAR site.  ListSTAR helps you connect your site to the Internet with two of its most widely used services:  Listserver mailing lists and EMail-On-Demand systems (similar to Fax-On-Demand, but over           e-mail!). Classroom schedules, product information, or even software...you name it and ListSTAR automatically makes it available via e-mail 24 hours a day!<p>

<P>The Law School has found it helpful to provide prospective students with estimates of tuition costs and living expenses for the regular nine month academic period. The following figures show tuition costs for first-year students, as well as other expenses that all students incur. These figures are based on projections of living expenses developed by the Law School Financial Aid Office for 1996-97 and on the tuition rates in effect for the 1996-97 academic year.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Financial Aid</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Financial Aid Office administers a full range of programs to help students who need financial assistance at Golden Gate University School of Law. Financial Aid information is sent automatically to students who apply for admission to the Law School. However, since many financial aid program deadlines are earlier than Admissions deadlines, new students interested in financial aid should <B>obtain forms from the Financial Aid Office as early as possible</B>.</P>

<P>The Office provides budget and debt management counseling, evaluates students' financial needs, and determines financial aid awards. The Financial Aid Office is responsible for maintaining standards and procedures which are in compliance with federal regulations, donor restrictions, and University policies, and which most equitably help meet students' financial needs.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Eligibility for Financial Aid</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>To be eligible to receive assistance from the Federal and Campus-Based Financial Aid programs at Golden Gate University, a student must meet all the following requirements:</P>



<OL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Admission into the J.D. Program;

	<LI> Enrollment in the Law School <I>(at least a half-time unit load is normally required);</I>

	<LI> United States citizenship or proof of permanent residency/other eligible alien status;

	<LI> Satisfactory academic progress;

	<LI> Registration with the Selective Service, if required by federal law;

	<LI> No default on any Title IV loan and no refund owed on any Title IV grant;

	<LI> Demonstration of financial need as determined by an analysis performed by the Federal Processor;

	<LI> Completed Financial Aid file - students should continue to complete their Financial Aid file even if they have not been notified of their admission status.
</UL>

<P>Students who need financial assistance to attend the Law School are expected to apply for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loans and for state fellowships if they are eligible. Many students may expect to apply for privately funded loans in order to meet their financial needs.</P>



</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Federal Stafford Loans</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Depending on the financial need analysis, an eligible student may borrow up to $8,500 for each academic year of study (usually two semesters) from a bank or financial institution which participates in the Stafford Loan program. Repayments begin six months after the student graduates or ceases to be enrolled at least half-time, whichever comes first.</P>

<P>Students who do not have financial need may borrow through the <B>Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, which replaced the Federal Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS)</B>. Unsubsidized Stafford has the same terms and conditions as Stafford, except that the borrower is responsible for interest that accrues during in school deferment periods. Students may borrow up to $18,500, less the amount of the subsidized Stafford Loan.</P>

<P>Loans are disbursed in two equal checks: the first at the beginning of the first semester of the loan period, and the second at the beginning of the second semester. A new borrower at Golden Gate must attend a loan counseling session before his/her Stafford Loan check may be released.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Campus Based Financial Aid (CBFA)</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Campus-Based Financial Aid program for law students consists of the Federal Work-Study and Perkins Loan programs. It is funded annually by the Federal government, the University, loan repayments from alumni, and wages from agencies that provide jobs. Students must submit the Financial Aid Application by March 1 of each year to be considered for CBFA for the following fall, spring and summer semesters.</P>

<P>Funding is limited, and eligible students who have the greatest financial need and apply by the deadline are given priority. Entering law students should apply as early as possible. Students who miss the application deadlines will be considered for funding that has been declined by priority applicants.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Federal Perkins Loan</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The amount of a Perkins Loan varies but seldom exceeds $2,500 per year. Loans are repayable at a 5 percent annual interest rate beginning nine months (for new borrowers) after an individual ceases to be at least a half-time student. A student may have up to ten years to repay the loan at a minimum of $40 per month for a new borrower, depending on the amount owed. The maximum amount that a student may borrow through the Perkins Loan program for graduate and professional study at all institutions is $18,000.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Federal Work-Study</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><I>(FWS) (available only to upper-division J.D. students)</I></P>



<P>The Federal Work-Study program was designed by the federal government to expand part-time employment opportunities for students who demonstrate financial need. Besides providing a means of financial assistance for the student, a FWS job is intended to complement the student's educational program or career goal. Most jobs developed under this program are intended to serve the public interest and meet needs of the community or the University; thus, most off-campus job providers are nonprofit agencies.</P>

<P>A student who receives a FWS award is approved to earn a specified amount in a FWS job. The employer and the Federal Government each pay a portion of the student's earnings. Award amounts may range from $1,500 to $2,500 for the academic year, including summer, fall, and spring semester earnings.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Private Loans</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Creditworthy students who need loans to meet the cost of education may be eligible for a Law Student Loan (LSL) or a Law Access Loan (LAL) of up to $15,000 per year. The total maximum for all LSLs or LALs is $45,000; the maximum for all educational loans is $92,000. The LSL requires a borrower to have a creditworthy co-signer. Repayment begins after a student has graduated or is no longer enrolled as at least a half-time student. Interest, fees, grace periods, and other terms vary slightly between the LSL and LAL programs. A student should consult a Financial Aid Counselor regarding these loans, especially if the student is eligible for any other forms of federal assistance.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">California Graduate Fellowships</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>California Graduate Fellowships are awarded to California residents who intend to become college or university faculty members. Recipients are selected on the basis of academic excellence (including grades and test scores), and financial need. The maximum award has been $6,490 per year. The application deadline is in March of each year. The selection process for California Graduate Fellowships is very competitive. All Graduate Fellows must be full-time students. The awards may be renewed for up to three additional years if the student is making normal progress toward the graduate or professional degree. Students who have already received a graduate or professional degree or have completed graduate or professional work beyond the first year are not eligible for a California Graduate Fellowship.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Veterans' Benefits</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Students who qualify for Veterans Administration Educational Assistance programs may use their benefits at Golden Gate University. A new student may request advance payment of his/her veterans' benefits by submitting a written request to the Veterans' Affairs Coordinator in the Financial Aid Office. Students receiving veterans' benefits should notify the Veterans' Affairs Coordinator of any changes in their academic programs as soon as possible.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Financial Aid Tuition Postponement Plan</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>If a student has been approved for financial aid (including a certified loan) which has not been disbursed, and if the student cannot pay tuition at the time of registration, he/she may use the University's Financial Aid Tuition Postponement Plan. Under this plan, an eligible student may postpone a tuition payment amount which does not exceed the amount of the approved financial aid for the semester. Such postponement may last until the financial aid has been disbursed or until the last day of the semester, whichever comes first.</P>

<P>A student who uses the plan must sign a promissory note at the time of registration. If the approved financial aid is subsequently disapproved or canceled for any reason, the postponed tuition payment amount is due and payable. Failure to pay tuition after receiving financial aid will result in a 10 percent late payment charge and may cause a student to lose deferred payment and postponement privileges and become ineligible for University loans. In order to determine eligibility for the Financial Aid Tuition Postponement Plan, the University may review a student's credit history with national credit reporting agencies.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Employment</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Students must contribute to their educational costs from their own employment earnings. They are encouraged to use resources in the Law Career Services Office to conduct employment searches.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Emergency Loans</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>A registered law student whose income is temporarily interrupted or who has an unforeseen emergency may borrow up to $500, interest-free, from the Judith Grant McKelvey Emergency Student Loan Fund or from the Karen D. Kadushin Law Emergency Loan Fund. The Queen's Bench-Marjorie B. Anderson Loan Fund is available for small, interest-free loans to women law students. These loans usually must be repaid within a month, but not later than the end of the semester.</P>



<P>Additional emergency loans are available in amounts up to $400 from the University Financial Aid Office and must be repaid within one month or by the end of the semester, whichever comes first. These loans are supported by gifts from friends and alumni, including the Albert I. Levine Memorial Fund, the Herbert Pothier Memorial Student Emergency Loan Fund, the Sonoma County Loan Fund, the Stanley Breyer Loan Fund, the M. Graham Loan Fund, and the Past-President Memorial Loan Fund.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Law School participates in the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) program for students from western states without an accredited law school (Alaska and Nevada). The commission provides payments of up to $4,300 per academic year for such students. For information about the WICHE program, write to Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, P.O. Drawer P, Boulder, CO 80301-9752, (303) 541-0214.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Bar Review Loan</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Golden Gate University School of Law Bar Review Loan (BRL) was established to make low-interest loan funds available to graduating law students to help pay for the cost of a bar review course.</P>

<P>Any student planning to take the California Bar for the first time can apply for a loan to cover a portion of the cost of a review course, up to $1,000. Terms of repayment are the same as for the Perkins Loan.</P>



<P>Students will be selected based on their total level of indebtedness including prior loans, the ability to obtain private bar loans, and required and cumulative GPAs. All students will be considered to the extent that funds are available.</P>

<P>Two private loans have been established to help creditworthy students pay for bar review study courses and bar exam fees. Students who have borrowed through the Law Loans program may apply for the Bar Study Loan (BSL), which provides loans up to $5,000 with a creditworthy co-signer. Students may also apply for the Bar Exam Loan (BEL) provided by the Law Access program for loans up to $5,000.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Fee Waivers</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Applicants with financial hardship may request a waiver of the application fee.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Law School Admissions Test</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>All applicants for admission as degree candidates must take the LSAT, which is administered by the Law School Admission Service. The test is given four times each year at test sites throughout the United States and abroad; LSAT dates for 1996-97 are June 10, 1996, October 5, 1996, December 7, 1996, and February 8, 1997. Applicants must have taken the LSAT within three years of the date of application. Detailed information about the test is in the <I>Law Services Registration and Information Book</I>. Golden Gate University does not mail this information. However, applicants can obtain this information at any local college, university or law school.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Law School Data Assembly Service</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Law School requires participation in the <a href="http://www.lsac.org/">Law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS)</a>, which collects and analyzes academic and test records of law school applicants. Applicants should submit transcripts of all college work to LSDAS as early as possible. College seniors, including those attending Canadian schools, should not wait for fall grades before submitting transcripts. For information regarding LSDAS, applicants should write to the Law School Admission Service, Box 2000, Newtown, PA 18940, or telephone (215) 968-1001.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Personal Statement</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The personal statement is the candidate's opportunity to address the Admissions Committee. <B>Since a personal statement is a writing sample, it should be a polished well organized essay no longer than four pages, double spaced and typed.</B></P>



<P>A strong personal statement answers these questions: Why do you want to study law? What special skills, attributes, and experiences will you bring to the law school community? What other matters should the committee consider in weighing your application?</P>

<P>A personal statement argues for the student's potential success in law school. It should highlight strengths and experiences that illustrate the candidate's development of the writing, research, and analytical thinking skills necessary for success in law school. If the student faced academic difficulties which appear on the undergraduate transcript, they should be explained.</P>

<P>The statement should distinguish the student from everyone else applying to law school by including background information that makes the applicant unique, including personal accomplishments, extra-curricular activities, career experience, or socio-economic background. Returning students who have been out of school for some time often discuss their experiences raising families and/or working in diverse disciplines. A resume may accompany the personal statement.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Letters of Recommendation</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>At least one letter of recommendation is required for admissions consideration. Each letter should be a detailed evaluation from an individual who knows the applicant's academic ability or can assess potential for success in law school.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Interviews and Visits</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The volume of applications received by the Admissions Office precludes granting personal interviews for admission purposes. Applicants may, however, arrange appointments with the Admissions staff to discuss their questions about the Law School. Such meetings will not be considered part of the application process.</P>

<P>The Golden Gate faculty holds a well-earned reputation for high-quality classroom teaching. For that reason, the Law School encourages applicants to visit classes. Any applicant who wishes to visit the Law School, or attend a first-year class, should call the Admissions Office at (415) 442-6630.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">The Application Process</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>No decision can be made until the application and all supporting documents have been received by the Law School. A complete application file consists of an application for admission, personal statement, LSDAS report, and letter of recommendation. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that all documents are received by the Admissions Office in a timely manner. Admission decisions are made on an on-going basis, and, as seats are limited, it is advantageous to apply early.</P>

<P>If an applicant indicates that he/she plans to retake the LSAT, the Admissions Office will not consider the application complete until the subsequent LSAT score is received.</P>

<P>When an applicant's file is complete, it is forwarded to the Admissions Committee. Every attempt is made to notify the applicant of a decision as soon as possible. Admissions decisions are final.</P>

<P>Because the Admissions Office receives a large number of applications, the Law School requests that applicants who wish to inquire about the status of their applications telephone between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. on weekdays. The Admissions Office e-mail address is <A HREF="mailto:lawadmit@ggu.edu">lawadmit@ggu.edu</A> and the number is (415) 442-6630.</P>

<P>The Law School communicates with applicants primarily by mail. Applicants should notify the Admissions Office in writing of any address changes. Such notice should include the applicant's full name, Social Security number, current and former address, and current and former telephone numbers.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Acceptance Deposits</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Upon notification of admission to the Law School, all applicants are required to make a nonrefundable deposit of $100. This deposit must be paid when due to prevent cancellation of the admission offer. Each admitted applicant will be requested to reconfirm his/her intent to matriculate during the summer, at which time a second nonrefundable deposit will be required. Both deposits will be credited toward the initial tuition payment.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Reapplication</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Application files, including all supporting documents, are retained by the Law School for two years. A new application form and fee will be required to reactivate the file. In general, a reapplication should be supported by a new personal statement, an improved LSAT score, graduate transcripts, or other evidence of increased likelihood of success in law school.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Conditional Admit Program</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The Law School offers a free, three-week program for minority, educationally disadvantaged, and ESL applicants who do not meet traditional entrance requirements but who may possess the skills necessary for a career in law. Through the regular admissions process, the Admissions Committee will recommend the admission of certain students contingent upon participation in this program. Special emphasis is placed on the applicant's remarks on the "Optional Information for Special Admissions Consideration" section of the application.</P>

<P>The Conditional Admit Program is designed to provide students with a head start by introducing them to the learning and studying skills necessary to succeed in law school. In the program, students are introduced to the legal system and development of the law. Students work to acquire skills in briefing cases, participating in class discussion, note taking, outlining courses, legal analysis, exam preparation, and exam writing.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">International Students</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>International students follow the same basic application procedures as domestic students. However, international applicants whose native language is not English must take both the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). To register for the LSAT, contact the Law School Admission Service. To register for TOEFL, write to TOEFL/TSE Services, P.O. Box 6161, Princeton, NJ 08541-6161, or call (609) 921-9000.</P>

<P>International applicants need not register with the LSDAS if they have completed their undergraduate study outside the United States or Canada. However, such applicants must register with a qualified agency for an independent evaluation of their undergraduate work. Many international applicants to Golden Gate have utilized the services of the International Education Research Foundation Inc. Credentials Evaluation Service, P.O. Box 66940, Los Angeles, CA 90066, (310) 390-6276. The Admissions Office requires a complete subject breakdown as part of any credentials evaluation report. A report of basic equivalency is insufficient.</P>

<P>International students must indicate on the application their visa status. The Admissions Office will send the appropriate immigration documents to the applicant to facilitate matriculation in the United States.

<P>Golden Gate University School of Law is in the heart of downtown San Francisco, everyone's favorite city. Flanked by the legal and financial district and the lively South of Market (SOMA), the school is a short walk from restaurants, shops, and plazas. Students work in law firms, courts, and government offices only blocks away.</P>

<P>With its year-round mild climate, the Bay Area is a pleasant place to live and work. From the pines and redwoods of the East Bay and Marin hills, across the magnificent bridges spanning the Bay, to the post-modern Museum of Modern Art and the Transamerica pyramid, the Bay Area is filled with natural beauty and triumphs of the builders' arts.</P>

<P>Outstanding theater, opera, dance and music are at home in San Francisco throughout the year. Chinese New Year, Carnaval and numerous other festivals celebrate the cosmopolitan character of the City by the Bay.</P>

<P>The San Francisco Giants, San Francisco 49ers, Oakland Raiders, Oakland A's, Golden State Warriors, San Jose Sharks and college teams entertain serious sports fans.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Since it is in the downtown business area of San Francisco, Golden Gate has no residence hall. The University Student Services Office maintains a list of available apartments and houses in many Bay Area communities.</P>

<P>The school is one block from <a href="http://server.Berkeley.EDU/Transit/Carriers/BART/">BART</a> and San Francisco <a href="http://server.berkeley.edu/Transit/Carriers/MUNI/">MUNI</a> stations and the San Francisco Transbay bus terminal, which serves Berkeley, Oakland, Marin, and the peninsula. Nearby <a href="http://server.berkeley.edu/Transit/Carriers/GGT/">Marin ferries</a> and <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">CAL Train</a> commuter service make public transportation to Golden Gate one of the easiest commutes in the Bay Area.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="#00527B">Athletics/Recreation</FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Private health clubs and a modern YMCA facility are located within easy walking distance of the Law School. Student discounts are available.</P>

<p><a name="History"><h2>History</a></h2></center>

<p>Marty Rimm transferred to Carnegie Mellon University in August
1993. The next semester, he approached the provost's office and asked
them to pay for a research project focusing on adult BBS pornography.
Barbara Lazarus, the associate provost, was in charge of allocating
grants through the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/adm/uri/uri.html">Small
Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG) program.</a>

<p>Lazarus saw Rimm's research as a flagship project that would
increase the visibility of the SURG program; she likely brought her
husband, Professor Marvin Sirbu, on board as Rimm's advisor. Lazarus
was the first administrator to realize the value of Rimm's study for
her purposes.

<p>Rimm and Sirbu were a perfect match. Rimm was a star student in the
<a href="www.ece.cmu.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering
program</a>, doing exceptionally well in the department's most
challenging courses. Then 30 years old, he was an older student who
had successfully completed a stint in the U.S. Army and was excelling
in graduate-level ECE courses in broadband communications. Sirbu was
chair of the well-funded <a href="http://www.ini.cmu.edu">Information
Networking Institute</a>, and was a senior professor with joint
appointments in three departments. His specialities, as listed in
CMU's Research Directory, were:
 
<blockquote><p> "Telecommunications technology, policy, and
management, regulation and
    industrial structure; communications networks and
standards."</blockquote>

<p>His advisor's fields of interest may have led Rimm to focus more on
the Internet and Usenet. Or perhaps Rimm realized that the Internet
craze was starting. Whatever the reason, Rimm broadened the scope of
his research to include pornography on the Internet that was
distributed through Usenet newsgroups.

<p>At the time, Bill Arms was in charge of CMU's flagship Andrew
computer system. As the vice president for computing services, Arms
had a long and dubious history of trying to remove pornographic images
from CMU's Usenet netnews servers. One failed attempt brought him
before the CMU's human relations commission in the 1993-1994 school
year, where he claimed the pictures were degrading to women. Arms
apparently learned about Rimm's research in June 1994, when Rimm's
unusual request for 300 MB of project volume storage space for
pornographic images crossed his desk. Arms was the second
administrator to recognize the value of Rimm's study for his own
purposes. He realized that if he wanted to argue his anti-pornography
case before academicians, research showing the extent and content of
network pornography would be a useful exhibit.

<p>Erwin Steinberg was the vice provost for education at CMU.
Reporting to him was the associate provost, Barbara Lazarus, who
authorized $2,000 for Rimm's project. It is conceivable, though
unlikely, that Steinberg knew nothing about Rimm's project at the time
the four grants were awarded in early 1994.

<p>Rimm continued working on his project through the summer,
downloading at least 10,000 images from adult BBSs along with roughly
a million image descriptions. By the end of the summer, he had amassed
formidable amounts of data and images, some of which he learned were
not just pornographic, but obscene.

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kcf/censor/misc/PA-law.html">
Pennsylvania law defines obscene material</a> as that which:

<blockquote>(1) the average person applying contemporary community
standards
        would find that the subject matter taken as a whole appeals to
the
        prurient interest; 

<p>        (2) the subject matter depicts or describes in a patently
offensive way,
        sexual conduct of a type described in this section; and 

<p>        (3) the subject matter, taken as a whole, lacks serious
literary, artistic,
        political, educational or scientific value. 
</blockquote>

<p>In practice, text is not obscene, but images of bestiality and
sadomasochistic activities are -- and distributing obscene material is
illegal under state law. <a name="Mehrabian">One California adult BBS
operator from whom Rimm acquired images had been convicted of
violating obscenity laws in Tennessee.</a> Rimm says he saw the same
salacious images on the the alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.* Usenet
newsgroups to which CMU subscribed. He claims he concluded this meant
that CMU administrators could also face jail terms.

<p>Rimm's next move was to tell this to CMU President Robert
Mehrabian. He sent the mail around 4 am.

<p>By 8 am, the normally sluggish CMU bureaucracy had shifted into
emergency damage control mode. The high-level team assembled to defuse
the situation included Don Hale, vice president for university
relations, Paul Christiano, provost, Bill Arms, vice president for
computing services, Erwin Steinberg, vice provost, legal counsel, and
Rimm's advisors, Marvin Sirbu and statistics professor David Banks.

<p>Arms, the only administrator with any technical knowledge, was
given the task of investigating Rimm's findings and recommending a
course of action. Over the next few weeks, he looked through the
newsgroups "with the law in one hand and a mouse in the other." Any
discussion groups that offended his refined British sensibilities he
put on the list to ban. The final list included approximately 80
newsgroups -- any discussion fora that had the word "sex" or "erotica"
in their titles.

<p>Around the same time, on September 22, 1994, Arms submitted his
resignation to Mehrabian, effective at the end of the semester. He had
been forced to resign or be terminated involuntarily at the end of the
year by a high-level outside review board brought in to review the
state of computing at CMU.

<p>On September 27, 1994, Sirbu sent mail to some of the members of
the damage-control team, including Steinberg and Hale. Sirbu's mail
stressed that Rimm's work was "a ground-breaking study" that would
make "an important scholarly contribution." Sirbu predicted great
press interest -- and academic interest from everyone from Jerry
Falwell to Andrea Dworkin. He also said that Rimm wanted to publicize
his study before "applying to graduate schools this fall."

<p><a name="AcademicCouncil">Next month, at the president's behest,
Arms met with a group of college deans and provosts called the
Academic Council.</a> Arms informed them, in a meeting closed to the
public, that the university had learned from Rimm that it was breaking
the law and that removing certain newsgroups was imperative. Absent
from the meeting were key administrators who might have questioned the
urgency of this action, including Charles Lowry, the head of the
library system.

<p>Scared by Arms' claims of criminal liability and assertions that he
could be imprisoned over the contents of Usenet, the Academic Council
allowed him to yank the newsgroups.

<p>Afterwards, with the Academic Council's apparent -- although
misguided -- blessing, Arms drafted a highly restrictive policy that
eliminated all newsgroups with the word "sex" or "erotica" in their
titles. (Academic Council members later distanced themselves from the
decision, saying in one case: "We were snookered.")

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kcf/censor/computing-services/action.html">
The new policy</a> was announced on November 3, 1994. The campus outcry
was quick and furious. Students, faculty, and staff met with the
president to demand changes. Students organized a rally that drew
national attention, from the Associated Press, The Washington Post,
ABC Radio, and TIME Magazine. A petition started circulating.

<p>The university was unprepared. Arms, who was orchestrating the
policy change, was out of town at a conference, and as the new point
person, Steinberg was not competent to discuss the policy's technical
details, and so relied on the authority of Rimm's research as a
defense. Mehrabian had believed that criticism over what he viewed as
a internal policy change would be mild and largely would be confined
to the campus community. Even an internal memo instructing CMU
employees not to speak with the press focused on campus media outlets:

<blockquote><p>"If anyone from the press (The Tarten, WRCT,
Post-Gazette, etc) contacts you, do NOT talk to them. Instead, feel
free to give my name and number..." [Internal Memo issued by Computing
Services Supervisor Robert Kuszewski on November 3, 1994]</blockquote>

<p>Many administrators who learned the details of Rimm's study found
something in it for themselves. Lazarus saw a way to promote the SURG
program. Sirbu saw a way, according to <i>Boardwatch Magazine</i>, to
help his corporate sponsors. Arms saw a way to justify to the Academic
Council a ban on pornography. Steinberg saw a way to solidify the
university's increasingly tenuous censorship arguments. Soon
afterwards, anti-porn groups also would see something to gain though
Rimm's study and would work with him to mold it into a form that would
advance their agenda, too. This time, the study would make it to the
U.S.  Congress.

alt="------------------------------"> <p><a name="Snooping"><h2>Helped
Rimm and Sirbu spy on users</a></h2></center>


<p>Marvin Sirbu, Rimm's advisor, was the person who suggested that
Rimm spy on the Usenet readership habits of thousands of members of
the Carnegie Mellon University community.

<p>Taking his advisor up on the suggestion, Rimm obtained records of
Usenet newsgroup readership and demographic information for thousands
of members of the Carnegie Mellon University campus community.
Although Rimm did not publish the demographic data, he acquired them
without the permission of his other subjects.  He also violated the
APA ethics code by not supplying a copy of his study to each of his
subjects. When first questioned about this practice, Sirbu and Rimm
grew defensive, saying if it wasn't illegal, they could and would do
it. This ethical split led one member of the "research team,"
statistics professor David Banks, to withdraw from the project in late
1994.

<p>The SURG undergraduate research <a href="policies.html">policy</a>
requires that all students involved in human subjects research submit
details of their research to the provost's office for approval:

<blockquote>Whether you are funded by SURG or not, if you will be
working with human subjects during the course of your research, you
must meet certain guidelines.  This applies to students as well as
faculty in all departments and may include surveys, data collection,
interviews, and product trials on human subjects.</blockquote>

<p>Assuming Rimm and Sirbu followed this policy, they submitted their
research proposal to the provost's office and the provost approved it.
But was it ethical?

<p>An article in the <i>New York Times</i> said:

<blockquote>"In November, the author of the report and his faculty
adviser secretly captured private computer records from the personal
directories of 3,000 computer users at Carnegie Mellon to determine
what bulletin boards on the Usenet the users were
frequenting."</blockquote>

However, Carnegie Mellon University's own <a
href="policies.html">policies</a> say:

<blockquote>"All files belong to somebody. They should be assumed to
be private and confidential unless the owner has explicitly made them
available to others... Failure to observe [this] may lead to
disciplinary action."
</blockquote>

<blockquote> "The user must presume that the contents of any other
user's directory are his or her private property just as one would
presume that the contents of someone's apartment or office are
personal...  Improper behavior in the use of computers is punishable
under the general university policies and regulations regarding
faculty, students and staff... For students in particular, the range
of penalties available includes reprimands, loss of computing
privileges, course failures, disciplinary probation, suspension or
dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution."
</blockquote>

<p>Rimm and Sirbu's surreptitious recording of the reading habits of
Andrew users -- authorized by the provost's office -- violates
multiple published policies of the university.  It also represents a
gross abdication of their own responsibilities as researchers to
obtain informed consent of their subjects before involving them in a
research project. 


<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------"> <p><a
name="Confidential"><h2>Helped Rimm and Sirbu access confidential
data</a></h2></center>


<p>Carnegie Mellon University apparently violated its own <a
href="policies.html">policies</a> and Federal law by giving Rimm and
Sirbu access to confidential employment and enrollment data. The
university's policy on the security and confidentiality of
administrative data states:

<blockquote>
"Requests for access to information for multiple
divisions or university-wide must be signed by the provost or
appropriate vice president. Authorization is to be granted to
employees who have job responsibilities requiring the information
requested...  Any university employee, student or non-university
individual with access to administrative data who engages in
unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of data in
violation of this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary
action, including possible dismissal and/or legal action."
</blockquote>

<p>Rimm claims in Footnote 40 of his study that he obtained "detailed"
data on CMU users including sex, nationality, age, and marital status.
That information is not publicly available, so a senior administrator
authorized access to the data. <b>Unless Rimm lied</b>, this policy implies
that the provost or a vice president helped him. Since the provost's
office signed off on Rimm's research methods, the provost, Paul
Christiano, likely was the administrator who authorized CMU to release
confidential data to Rimm and Sirbu.

<p>Footnote 40 does not indicate whether Rimm's "detailed" data
collection was restricted to students or included the entire Carnegie
Mellon campus community. <i>The Legal Deskbook for Administrators of
Independent Colleges and Universities</i> (2nd ed, last updated 1993)
discusses the implications of CMU's actions in both cases. On
disclosing information on faculty and staff, the deskbook states:

<blockquote><b>Prohibition of Disclosure to Third Parties</b>

<br>The personnel records policy should contain a general prohibition of
 disclosure to third parties... without the express written consent of
 the employee, describing specifically the records to be disclosed and
 the persons to whom they are to be disclosed. 
Records disclosed to third parties... should be accompanied by
 notification (usually stamped on the documents) that the disclosure is
 made only on the condition that the third party shall not make any
 redisclosure of the information without the employee's written
 consent.
</blockquote>

<p>The deskbook says the following about disclosing student information:

<blockquote><b>Statute, Purpose, Basic Provisions</b>

<br> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA),
 commonly known as the "Buckley Amendment," seeks to ensure the privacy
 of the educational records of students through elaborate procedural
 guarantees. The Act applies to all institutions that are the
 recipients of federal funding. Noncompliance can result in withdrawal
of federal funds...

<p><b>Enforcement</b>

<br>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is enforced by the
 Department of Education through its FERPA office in Washington, DC.
 Complaints are received and reviewed by this office and those that are
 not resolved are forwarded to a review board which can recommend
 sanctions to the Secretary, including a withdrawal of federal funds.

<p><b>Directory Information</b>

<br>Certain information, known as directory information, may be disclosed
 by an institution without violating the Buckley Amendment. "Directory
 information" generally includes a student's name, address, telephone
 number, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation
 in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of
 members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards
 received, and other similar information. Each institution is permitted
 to identify which information -- from the above categories -- will be
 released as "directory information" and which information remains
 protected against release to third parties, even though it falls under
 the definition of "directory information."
</blockquote>

<p>FERPA allows for a limited category of data designated "directory
information" to be revealed.  CMU's <a
href="policies.html">policies</a> define directory information to be:

<blockquote><b>Disclosure of Directory Information</b>
<br> Carnegie Mellon University has designated directory information to be:
<br>1. Student's full name, campus or local address, local telephone
    number, class, department, college of enrollment, dates of
    attendance, date(s) of graduation, degree(s) awarded.

<br>2. For those students participating in intercollegiate athletic events,
    personally identifiable information included as directory
    information is the sport of participation, height and weight.
</blockquote>

<p>Neither CMU's own policies nor federal law allow "age, sex,
nationality, and marital status" to be disclosed. No staff or faculty
employees authorized CMU to give Rimm and Sirbu access to their
confidential employment data. No students authorized CMU to give Rimm
and Sirbu access to their confidential enrollment data. By divulging
this data to Rimm -- according to his footnote -- CMU violated its own
policies and Federal law.

<p>It is difficult to determine the extent of this abuse of trust on
the part of the university administration. CMU administrators are
reticent to comment on their own conduct, citing the fact that the
study is being investigated internally.

<p>But the virtues of any administrators participating in this
unethical conduct are suspect. CMU has a responsibility to members of
its community to follow its own policies and Federal law. It may
exercise its right to change the law through persuasion or petition.
It may even, in rare occasions, prioritize other values by deciding to
engage in civil disobedience and disobeying the law -- but such
decisions must be made in an open manner allowing the maximum of
community involvement. There is no excuse for CMU's demonstrably
unethical conduct. The culprits should not be hidden behind an
already-broken shield of confidentiality.

alt="------------------------------"> <p><a name="CMUStudy"><h2>Hyped
the "Carnegie Mellon Study"</a></h2></center>

<p>Carnegie Mellon University hyped Marty Rimm's paper as the
"Carnegie Mellon Study," even though it was written by a sole
undergraduate and received no outside funding. By doing this, CMU
participated in the deception perpetrated by <i>TIME</i>, Rimm, and
Sirbu -- that Rimm was more than an undergraduate student working on a
senior thesis.

<p>CMU's vice president for university relations is Don Hale, also the
school's official spokesperson. Hale called Rimm's study the "Carnegie
Mellon" study repeatedly, both to journalists and academics from other
universities. Other university officials, including Erwin Steinberg,
vice provost, and Kyle Fisher-Morabito, assistant vice president for
university relations, did as well.  Carnegie Mellon's PR office issued
a news release naming Rimm's work "the Carnegie Mellon study."
Carnegie Mellon even announced that free copies of the reprint from
the <i>Georgetown Law Journal</i> would be available from the
University Relations office.

<p><i>TIME</i> and ABC's Nightline organized a secrecy deal with the
<i>Georgetown Law Journal</i> and Rimm that gave the media outlets
advance copies of the study -- on the condition they embargo the study
until the TIME issue hit the streets. This unethical backroom deal
prevented TIME from verifying the validity of the study.

<p>CMU participated in this <i>TIME</i>/Nightline/law journal secrecy
deal, at least to some extent. The vice provost, Erwin Steinberg, and
Rimm appeared in a pre-taped segment on the Nightline episode that
aired June 27, 1995. Not only did Steinberg neglect to raise any
ethical questions about the study, he used his exposure to a national
television audience to validate Rimm's work. Specifically, Steinberg
defended what he had been justifying for eight months -- the
university's decision to ban sex-related discussions and images, a
move that was sparked by Rimm's research.

<p>CMU also helped Rimm by giving him office space and access to a
computer, photocopiers, telephones, and fax machines in the University
Relations office. (One of Rimm's friends afterwards said the
administration did it to "keep an eye on him.")

<p>Why did CMU devote so many resources to helping an undergraduate?
Like Lazarus, Sirbu, Steinberg, Arms, and the anti-porn groups,
high-level administrators at CMU saw something for themselves in
Rimm's study. They decided that it had brought them positive press
before. In November 1994, when CMU's Usenet censorship sparked a
firestorm of media protest, free-speech groups and savvy cybernauts
denounced CMU's actions, but the university rode a groundswell of
support in the Pittsburgh community. The <i>Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette</i> editorialized <b>in favor</b> of CMU's position.
Conservative members of the community voiced their support. National
anti-pornography groups weighed in with their opinions -- the same
groups that later worked with Rimm to refine his paper to promote
their aims. Steinberg even went to academic conferences to advance the
administration's point of view.

<p>Because of the generally positive press coverage Rimm's study
provided CMU in the fall of 1994, CMU believed it would be even more
beneficial when published in the prestigious <i>Georgetown Law
Journal</i> and featured on the cover of <i>TIME</i>. They were proven
wrong.

alt="------------------------------"> <p><a
name="Trustees"><h2>Refused to release names of
trustees</a></h2></center>

<p>Apparently the names of the trustees of Carnegie Mellon University
aren't always public.

<p>The <i>Associated Press'</i> Aaron Dickey reported on July 15, 1995, in a
post to Usenet:

<blockquote>CMU's PR office is now refusing to release the list of who
serves on.  CMU Board of Trustees.  This is public information, and is
published in CMU's own catalogs.  As such, the only possible reason
they've privatized it is to slow down reporters.  The PR office
admitted it was publically-available, and refused to give a reason why
they wouldn't provide it.  When asked when this new policy was
instituted, no answer was given.

<p>CMU has apparently issued a university-wide coverup order.  The
simplest question about any aspect of the school's research system now
results in the caller being transferred from office to office, and all
information is suddenly "unavailable".
</blockquote>

<p>When reporters asking for the list called the office of CMU's
president, Robert Mehrabian, the person answering the phone said she
didn't know if she had permission to release that information.

<p>CMU's Board of Trustees membership is public information. It's
published in the Annual Report, which also is public record.
According to the Student Handbook, CMU is "a private university
incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"
which would mean the names of its officers and trustees are also
public information.

<p>For CMU to stonewall on releasing publicly-available information is
petty. It also stands as diametrically opposed to the core values of a
university, which should be to promote openness -- not to restrict the
free flow of information. Furthermore, the university relations office
has a responsibility to the public, including journalists, of making
publicly-available information about the university accessible within
a reasonable period of time.

name="Conclusion"><h2>Hosed Marty Rimm: The Investigation</a></h2></center>

<p>The example of the Board of Trustees membership is illustrative,
not only to highlight an apparent ethical violation, but to
demonstrate the amount of pressure CMU was under in July 1995. Major
media outlets, including the <i>New York Times</i>, were investigating
ethical violations.  Academics at other universities were asking
questions. Even its own faculty members were trying to distance
themselves from the study -- Jim Morris, the head of the CMU computer
science department, had drafted a letter to the ACM underscoring the
department's lack of involvement in Rimm and Sirbu's research.

<p>After Prof. Jim Thomas wrote a blistering criticism of the ethics
involved in the "Carnegie Mellon Study," CMU announced it was forming
a committee of inquiry to investigate potential ethical violations. In
August, the provost announced the formation of a subsequent committee
that would investigate the charges formally. As of January 1996, the
provost has not announced the outcome of the charges. Unsubstantiated
reports say the committee will not punish Rimm, and has not contacted
him since August 1995.

<p>Of course, the provost was the same administrator whose office had
to have approved Rimm's unethical human subjects research methods.

<p>From the wording of their announcement of the investigation
committees, one might think that the central administration had never
even heard of Rimm's study before -- that they had suddenly learned in
July 1995 about their undergraduate's suspicious research.  However,
that's not the case. Their latest damage-control stance is the
opposite of their initial position, when they rushed to embrace Rimm
and his pornography study in a manner that was almost obscene in
itself.

<p>Even though administrators may not have read the final study,
everyone in Warner Hall knew the details of Rimm's research: the
vice-provost, members of the Academic Council, the provost, and the
president. <a name="SirbuMail">Rimm and Sirbu spent hours in
meetings</a> with CMU administrators, describing what they had learned
and how they had learned it. Email from Sirbu dated September 27, 1994
and addressed to Rimm, Hale, Steinberg, and Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Murphy, shows how close many Warner Hall administrators were
to the study, half a year before it was featured in <i>TIME</i>:

<blockquote> I have been meeting regularly with Martin since last
Spring, and believe that he is nearing completion on a ground-breaking
study that makes an important scholarly contribution.  He has
developed some very interesting methodological approaches, and has
amassed a remarkable database of information on his chosen subject
matter.  As Martin and I have discussed, there is still much to do in
interpreting the data. [...]

<p>I might not have chosen myself to raise these issues via a message
directly to the President, but sooner or later this study will come out
and I suspect there will be significant interest among the press.  It is
certainly appropriate that CMU be prepared.  Martin and I both concur that
the way the research is publicized should be handled with great care, but
I know that he is anxious, after working on this for more than a year, to
get something out before he starts applying to graduate schools this
fall.
</blockquote>

<p>Only in July 1995, after rampant ethics violations were publicized,
did CMU try frantically to distance themselves from Rimm. It would not
be easy. In a public post in November 1994, Rimm wrote:

<blockquote> From: Martin Rimm <mr6e+@andrew.cmu.edu>
<br>     Newsgroups: cmu.cs.discussion
<br>     Subject: Re: More Censorship
<br>     Date: Fri,  4 Nov 1994 00:31:15 -0500

<p>     The team of researchers consists of seven professors, <b>three
     deans</b>, four lawyers, two lobbyist groups, six undergraduate
     research assistants, three doctoral students, three
     programmers, and an art instructor.

<p>     Martin
</blockquote>

<p>While Rimm has a history of engaging in deception, he rarely lies
outright. Since he posted this message publicly, it is reasonable to
conclude he was telling the truth, and that "three deans" worked on
his project in some capacity. They likely knew the substance
of his research, including his unethical conduct.

<p>Instead of choosing a scapegoat, CMU administrators and deans
should be investigating their own role in this sorry affair. They
helped Rimm with his study by funding it, approving his unethical
research methods, providing him with confidential data, and then
justifying his research by using it as a pretext for censorship. CMU
also hyped his study by handing out free copies, sending an
administrator on <i>Nightline</i> with Rimm, and naming his work the
"Carnegie Mellon Study."

<p><a name="Consequences">CMU's role in helping and hyping Rimm has
led to consequences far beyond the university's campus.</a>
<i>TIME's</i> Elmer-DeWitt admitted that had CMU not stood behind
Rimm's study in November 1994, there likely would never have been a
cover story: "That's certainly when it caught my attention."  Without
the cover story, <a href="time.html#Grassley">Senator Charles
Grassley</a> would have had less ammunition when calling for
Internet-wide censorship. The consequences of CMU's decisions have
been severe.

<p>Just as TIME has an ethical responsibility to conduct due diligence
on a story that it is researching, so does Carnegie Mellon have a
responsibility to conduct due diligence on a study that it is
promoting. Carnegie Mellon University's conduct is beyond negligent;
it is shameful.

<p>The provost, who handles allegations of research misconduct, is the
same administrator whose office had to approve Rimm's unethical
research. What does an institution do when administrators must
investigate themselves?

<hr>


<p><i>TIME Magazine's</i> ethical lapses started last spring when
Marty Rimm snookered the powerful newsweekly into agreeing to a
secrecy deal in exchange for a scoop. In its quest for an exclusive,
editor Philip Elmer-DeWitt set aside his credulity for the possibility
of being the first to report on a sensational new study.

<p>Practicing journalists disagree over what to do or not to do for a
scoop. A recent column by Floyd Norris in the <i>New York Times</i>
covered the firing of Dan Dorfman by Money: "Some journalists, this
one included, sometimes pass up exclusives, fearing that the risk of
being used outweighs the marginal benefit of the apparent scoop."

<p>Perhaps Elmer-DeWitt should have done the same. TIME's uncritical
acceptance of the Rimm pornography study elevated a fraudulent
undergraduate research paper into the national consciousness. For
instance, look at the remarks of Senator Charles Grassley in the June
26, 1995 <a name="Grassley"
href="http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/gpo/crfld.html">Congressional Record</a>:

<blockquote>
 Mr. President, Georgetown University Law School has released a
remarkable study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University. This study raises important questions about the
availability and the nature of cyberporn.

<p>The university surveyed 900,000 computer images. Of these 900,000
images, 83.5 percent of all computerized photographs available on the
Internet are pornographic. Mr. President, I want to repeat that: 83.5
percent of the 900,000 images reviewed--these are all on the
Internet-- are pornographic, according to the Carnegie Mellon study.
</blockquote>

<p>Grassley's remarks are untrue. Not only are the Rimm study
and its figures fraudulent, Grassley confused the study's adult BBS
claims with ones relating to the Internet. Anti-porn groups also have
embraced Rimm's figures and misrepresented them. More recently, a
German newspaper reporter revealed that the <i>TIME</i> story had
contributed to European cyberporn hysteria, culminating in
Compuserve's decision, sparked by a local German prosecutor, to censor
Usenet newsgroups.


<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------">
<p><a name="Truth"><h2>Truth-Telling</a></h2></center>

<p>The most obvious ethical lapse on the part of <i>TIME</i> is its
lack of commitment to truth-telling.

<p>For instance, <i>TIME</i> concealed Rimm's status as an undergraduate. In
the November 1994 piece, Rimm was described as a "research associate."
At Carnegie Mellon that is an official academic rank denoting a
postdoctoral researcher, which Rimm was not.

<p>In the June article, <i>TIME</i> promoted Rimm to a "researcher and
"principal investigator." A "researcher" is not an official academic
rank; Carnegie Mellon's research faculty ranks are Research Scientist,
Senior Research Scientist, and Principal Research Scientist. But at
universities, the term "researcher" by itself customarily denotes
someone with a PhD. While Rimm technically may have been a
"researcher" in the sense that he did "research," he and <i>TIME</i>
misused traditional nomenclature in a deceptive manner.

<p>As a science reporter, Elmer-DeWitt knew or should have known
enough about academia to realize how misleading his use of the terms
was. Further, he was told as early as November 1994 that Rimm was an
undergraduate, but chose not to report it.

<p>In a discussion on the WELL, Elmer-DeWitt argued that he did not
conflate statistics from Usenet and BBSs. But he did:

<blockquote><p> There's an awful lot of porn online. In an 18-month
study, the team
     surveyed 917,410 sexually explicit pictures, descriptions, short
     stories and film clips. On those Usenet newsgroups where digitized
     images are stored, 83.5 percent of the pictures were
pornographic.</blockquote>

<p>The pictures surveyed were from adult bulletin board systems, which
generally are not accessible via the Internet or Usenet. Combining the
adult BBS figures with the Usenet "83.5 percent" number conflated the
two. If Elmer-DeWitt did not know the technical differences between
Usenet newsgroups and adult BBS download areas, he should have
investigated it. If he did know the differences, then he was not
telling the truth. In either case, a demonstrable lack of commitment
to truth-telling exists on the part of <i>TIME</i>.

<p><i>TIME</i> also had information revealing Rimm's past exploits and
attempts to manipulate the media -- but concealed it from their
readers. (When Rimm wrapped his head in a burnoose and infiltrated
Atlantic City casinos, <i>Life</i> dispatched a reporter to
cover the story, but never published it.) Rimm assured the
newsmagazine's editors that his anti-gambling history was not relevant
to his anti-pornography study, and they decided not to mention it. It
likely would have detracted from their exclusive.

<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------">
<p><a name="Fairness"><h2>Fairness and Accuracy</a></h2></center>

<p>"Sex is everywhere," breathed the lead sentence in the <i>TIME</i>
cover story. In the same paragraph, the story breathlessly described
"balloon-breasted models" and actors with "unflagging erections."
Combined with the lurid photographs of computers seducing innocents,
the article gave the impression that cybersex was everywhere, and
parents must protect their children. It directly contributed to the
growing national concern over the material on the Internet, and
allowed those who would restrict free expression to advance
unconstitutional legislation.

<p>Consider the impact if <i>TIME</i> would have reported the same
facts, but phrased differently -- starting the article with:

<blockquote><p>The first exhaustive study of pornography on the
Internet found that less
 than one percent of all information flowing through this global computer
 network contains material of a sexual nature.</blockquote>

<p><i>TIME</i>wrote that "only about 3% of all the messages on the Usenet
newsgroups [contain sexually-explicit images], while the Usenet itself
represents 11.5% of the traffic on the Internet." <i>TIME</i> failed to
multiply the percentages to reveal the more accurate figure -- less
than one-half of one percent of messages (3% of 11%) may contain
sexually-explicit images. To be fair and accurate, <i>TIME</i> should have
reported that information.

<p>Elmer-DeWitt's misrepresentations and errors date back to the first
time he wrote about Rimm. That article was published in November 1994,
after Rimm's email to Carnegie Mellon's president sparked the school's
Usenet censorship. The <i>TIME</i> article claimed that Rimm had "put
together a picture collection that rivaled Bob Guccione's (917,410 in
all)." That is simply incorrect. Rimm never even had enough
CMU-supplied disk storage for more than a few thousand images.
Instead, his study looked at the <b>descriptions</b> of the images, a
crucial point that is largely ignored in all of the <i>TIME</i>
articles. (In addition, one writer pointed out on the WELL that
Guccione's Collection never came close to a million images.)
Elmer-DeWitt apparently was not one to let the facts stand in the way
of a good story.

<p>Some of these concerns may be explained away because of
<i>TIME</i>'s possible lack of technical knowledge. However,
<i>TIME</i> also committed logical fallacies. For example, the
magazine reported that Rimm's study purported to be the first of its
kind yet also purported to show a <b>trend</b> towards the marketing
of more "extreme" sexual images online. In other words, if Rimm was
the first to measure cyberporn consumption, he couldn't also have
extrapolated a trend. As the EFF's Mike Godwin pointed out, that is a
<b>logical</b> inconsistency -- not one that requires methodological
expertise to recognize.

<p>Nowhere in the <i>TIME</i> article does Elmer-DeWitt reveal that
serious questions were raised about the study before it went to press.
However, Donna Hoffman, a professor at Vanderbilt University, had
expressed very strong reservations about the methodology of Rimm's
study to Elmer-DeWitt as he was writing the article. Godwin also had
early information about the study and told his concerns to
<i>TIME's</i> researchers and Elmer-DeWitt directly. Godwin also
brought up that he knew prior to publication of the "Cyberporn" story
that the <i>Georgetown Law Journal</i> wasn't peer-reviewed. Godwn and
Hoffman had told him in June. Not only did <i>TIME</i> not heed these
criticisms, the article never mentions them. The <i>TIME</i> reader is
led to believe that the study was rigorous and without fault.

<p><a name="HoffmanCritique">Hoffman and Prof. Thomas Novak</a> have
identified a variety of areas where <i>TIME</i>'s coverage has been
unfair or inaccurate, or both:

<blockquote><p> p. 38, 3rd graf
 The Rimm study is not "an exhaustive study of online porn - what's
 available, who is downloading it, what turns them on..."  The Rimm
 study is instead an unsophisticated analysis of descriptions of
 pornographic images on selected adult BBSs in the United States.
 The study findings cannot be generalized beyond this narrow domain.

<p> p. 38, 5th graf
 TIME says, "There's an awful lot of porn online."  But in fact,
 Rimm's own figures suggest that the amount of pornography on Usenet
 and the World Wide Web represents an extremely small percentage of
 the total information available on the Internet.  TIME further
 neglects to clarify this by noting that the vast bulk of Rimm's
 study concerns files that reside exclusively on adult BBSs, which
 is a very minor portion of "online," and which does not include the
 Internet.

<p> p. 38, 5th graf
 TIME says that 83.5% of images in Usenet binaries groups are
 pornographic; however, this number is simply incorrect.  What Rimm
 actually wrote (p 1867) was "Among the pornographic newsgroups,
 4206 image posts were counted, or 83.5% of the total posts."  This is
 based upon 17 alt.binaries groups that Rimm considered "pornographic"
 and 15 alt.binaries groups that Rimm considered "non-pornographic." 

<p> p. 38,40, 6th graf
 TIME says that '[t]rading in sexually explicit imagery, according
 to the report, is now 'one of the largest (if not the largest)
 recreational applications of users of computer networks.'"  But
 there is no evidence for this statement as Rimm's study does not
 examine "trading behavior" on Usenet news groups, only aggregate
 *postings*.
</blockquote>

<p><i>TIME</i>'s responsibility to its readers is to provide reportage
that is as fair and accurate as reasonably possible. For <i>TIME</i>
uncritically to accept Rimm's findings as fact violates the
fundamental principles of journalism.

<p><a name="ThomasInterview">Even <i>TIME</i>'s interview with Robert
Thomas, in prison for distributing obscene images</a>, was done in an
underhanded manner. Mike Godwin reported on July 15, 1995:

<blockquote><p>Wendy Cole, the Time magazine reporter who interviewed
Robert Thomas for the "Marquis de Sade of Cyberspace" sidebar, omitted
to mention to Thomas during the course of the interview (which he
estimates to have been an hour long) that the "CMU study" that she'd
told Thomas was the centerpiece of the Time story was conducted by one
Martin Rimm, or that Robert Thomas and his Amateur Action BBS were
declared by the study to be the "market leader" of adult BBSs ("That's
not true," Thomas interrupted me to say when I was relating this to
him), or that the Rimm article itself declared Thomas to be "The
Marquis of Cyberspace."  Said Thomas today in an interview from
prison: "If Wendy Cole had told me that Rimm was involved in that
study in any way, I'd have said 'Go away, leave me alone." That is, he
said, he would never have given Time that interview...

<p>Since she never mentioned any of these facts to Robert Thomas, the
first time he'd heard of the singular attention he receives in the
Rimm article was when I told him about it during my interview with him
just an hour and half ago.</blockquote>

<p>Elmer-DeWitt also never revealed that all of the sexually-explicit
images on Usenet are encoded. An actual excerpt from a pornographic
image posting is:

<p>Decoding from this format is nontrivial for the novice user, and
requires a particular amount of dedication to the task.


<P><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------">
<p><a name="Independence"><h2>Independence</a></h2></center>


<p>A journalist has an ethical responsibility to remain independent of
his subject. There is an ongoing debate in the field of media
criticism over the possibility and even the advisability of
objectivity in reporting, but all agree that <b>independence</b> is
always required.

<p>Elmer-DeWitt did not fulfill that responsibility in his treatment
of the Rimm study. Instead, he apparently looked to different values,
such as hoping the story he wrote would be successful and that the
research would prove to be solid.

<p>The EFF's Godwin reports he heard the following at the end of a
conference call:

<blockquote><p>We wound down, although a few voices (mostly mine) were
raised. But before we lost the connection, I heard this:
 
<br> Philip: "Marty, you there?"
<br> Rimm: "Yes, I'm here."
<br> Philip: <slight pause> "Good job!"</blockquote>

<p>Elmer-DeWitt congratulating Rimm for defending his study on the air
is disheartening at best. A journalist's interest should be in
discovering the truth, not in sculpting it. But that's not the only
time Elmer-DeWitt is sympathetic to the former Carnegie Mellon
student. In an interview with HotWired, he characterizes the
Rimm-study debunking as a lynching:

<blockquote><p>Frankly, I think there's a good story to be done,
probably by me, in
  what's gone on in The Well... poor Marty Rimm is being lynched there.
  Mike Godwin has organized an attack, and there are precious few
  voices that are not already prejudiced to one side.</blockquote>

<p>A journalist should not be lobbying for the subject of his
reporting to be proved correct. He should maintain that distance --
that independence -- that is a reporter's responsibility to his
readers.

<p><a name="Mistakes"><h2>Correcting Mistakes</a></h2></center>

<p>The nation's leading newsweekly doesn't like to admit it made a
mistake.

<p>In an interview with CyberSurfer, Elmer-DeWitt refused to
acknowledge the many errors TIME had made -- not just the problems
with the study, but the problems with the <b>story</b>. He says: "Time
regrets the error, but we reported the story correctly... the study
was wrong."

<p>Elmer-DeWitt also said: "Even with all of it's flaws the Rimm study
is probably the best thing we have for now." This demonstrates his
apparent inability to report accurately on academic research. In
research, the validity of the conclusions is not severable
from the validity of the methods; if the methods are wrong, the entire
study is wrong.

<p>A few weeks after the "Cyberporn" cover was demolished by
Internet-based criticism, <i>TIME</i> ran a followup. Though the
article criticized Rimm, it never gave the reader a hint of
<i>TIME</i>'s reporting errors and culpability in agreeing to the
secrecy deal:

<blockquote>The most telling assault was issued on the Internet by
Donna Hoffman and Thomas Novak, associate professors of management at
Vanderbilt University. When contacted by Time prior to the cover
story's publication, Hoffman made some of her concerns known. But
she--and Time--was constrained by exclusivity terms imposed by the Law
Journal that prevented her from seeing the full study before Time's
cover went to press.

<p> It would be a shame, however, if the damaging flaws in Rimm's
study obscured the larger and more important debate about hard-core
porn on the Internet.
</blockquote>

<p><a name="RP">In the following months, <i>TIME</i> public relations
staff</a> continued to bash the newsweekly's critics in online fora,
especially America Online. Their attacks on the EFF's Godwin led one
observer to note:

<blockquote>
I've been in journalism for fifteen years, on two continents, on eight or
 ten
 different beats. Never have I seen such intellectual dishonesty on the part
 of a publication that made a huge stinking blunder. And it's getting worse
 all the time.
 
<p> RPTime engages in attempted character assassination of one of Time's most
 eloquent critics (EFF's Godwin), on the grounds that GODWIN might serve some
 special interest. RP is, of course, speaking for the media conglomerate on
 whose payrolls he finds himself. How twisted can you get? Don't get me
 wrong:
 any Time staffer can chime in with his or her opinion, and they're all
 welcome. But to question, from that position, the motives of others, is just
 too bizarre for words.
</blockquote>

When Godwin said he planned to criticize in an <i>Internet World</i>
column the repeated unwillingness of <i>TIME</i> to admit its errors,
the magazine's representative, Robert Pondiscio, tried to have the
story yanked, complaining that Godwin quoted improperly from one of
Pondiscio's public posts. A fax Pondiscio sent to Godwin's editors
reads:

<blockquote>
 In any event, I doubt the editors of Internet World consider my
 personal viewpoints worthy of an entire column of rebuttal. I also
 encourage you to read the entire thread from which Godwin takes
 my words without permission.  In doing so, you will amply satisfy
 yourself that Godwin bas built a straw man, not reflective of the
 content of my posts, which he now proceeds to attack in your pages.
 
<p>Lastly, I can only assume that Mr. Godwin is well aware that he has
 stepped over the line for all of the reasons listed above.  How else to
 explain why he has posted his column on the WELL, where I am not
 a member, but not on TIME Online, the scene of a vigorous debate,
 lasting several months.
</blockquote>

<p>Ironically, <i>TIME</i> the same right to mislead the American
public in promoting Marty Rimm because of the First Amendment -- the
very same portion of our Constitution that Rimm's research was
designed to eviscerate. The religious right helped Rimm craft his
study. In its final form, it was designed to lend ammunition to the
Congressional censors trying to enact a Federal law that would enforce
an unconstitutional speech code muzzling online expression. (It would
ban even great works of literature like <i>Ulysses</i> or <i>Catcher
in the Rye</i> from being placed on the Internet.)

<p>For the most part, magazines and newspapers pay only lip service to
the freedom of the press unless they're defending themselves from
libel suits. But <i>TIME's</i> decision to hype Rimm's fraudulent research
did not only ignore the First Amendment, it trampled on it.

<hr>

<p>Marty Rimm's cyberporn study is a case study in how to conduct
unethical research. Rimm's research methods are fraudulent; the study
has been contaminated by his alliance with anti-porn advocacy
groups; the data-gathering techniques violate fundamental ethical
principles in a reckless and dangerous manner.

<p>A number of researchers have already published <a
href="docs/jthomas.2">criticisms</a> of the study's ethics, most
notably Professor Jim Thomas of Northern Illinois University's
Department of Sociology. His criticisms largely revolve around the
responsibilities of a researcher to his subjects. In social science,
that responsibility of beneficence is paramount, and is one of the
basic values of the profession.

<p>This report is not meant to be an exhaustive treatment of the Rimm
study, its methodological and procedural errors, or the fallout from
its publication. Vanderbilt University professors Donna Hoffman and
Thomas Novak have already published a lengthy <a
href="http://www2000.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu/rimm.cgi">critique and
detailed analysis</a> of the conceptual and methodological flaws of
Rimm's article. <a name="EthicalViolationsShort">Some of the ethical
questions raised elsewhere include how Rimm:</a>

<blockquote>
* <a href="sirbu.html#Analyst">Misrepresented his study as "Carnegie Mellon Study"</a>
<br>* Enticed BBS operators into study with "Pornographer's Handbook"
<br>* Lent help to Justice Department in prosecuting same BBS operators
<br>* Has a longtime history of deception and fraudulent research
<br>* Orchestrated secrecy deals with the law journal and <i>TIME</i>
<br>* Worked with anti-porn advocacy groups to craft study
<br>* <a href="cmu.html#Snooping">Spied on Andrew computer users' actions</a>
<br>* Denied he wrote the Pornographer's Handbook, then admitted it
<br>* Published unsupported generalizations
</blockquote>

<p>This report's purpose is to investigate the ethical questions
raised by apparent scientific misconduct that have received relatively
comparatively attention elsewhere. Scientific misconduct is a broad
term, and extends to any sort of fraud or deception in scientific
inquiry. Some of the commonly-accepted aspects of misconduct are:

<blockquote>
* Fabrication of scientific data
<br>* Falsification of scientific data
<br>* Selective reporting of data
<br>* <a href="rimm.html#Footnotes">Plagiarism of another's work</a>
<br>* <a href="rimm.html#Tools">Failure to release data and measuring devices</a>
<br>* <a href="rimm.html#Carnegie">Conflicts of interest</a>
<br>* <a href="rimm.html#BBS">Deception in research or data-gathering</a>
<br>* <a href="rimm.html#BBS">Failure to protect human subjects</a>
<br>* Failure to meet legal or ethical requirements
</blockquote>

<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------">
<p><a name="Footnotes"><h2>Plagiarized footnotes</a></h2></center>

Cheating is "submission of work that is not the student's own for
papers, assignments, or exams," according to the <a
href="http://www.cmu.edu/enrollment/sa/student_handbook/standards.html#cheating">Carnegie
Mellon University student handbook</a>. Plagiarism is "failure to
indicate the source" in written text, or in "an idea derived from the
work" of another. Even if the other party <em>agrees</em> to the
unattributed use, the conduct still is plagiarism -- and a violation
of academic and research standards.

<p>Evidence <a href="docs/godwin.3">presented elsewhere</a> shows that
Rimm, not a lawyer, plagiarized his well-written footnotes from one.
But which attorney? Who was the author? The Electronic Frontier
Foundation's staff counsel, Mike Godwin, reports:

<blockquote> Who knows what Philip [Elmer-DeWitt] might have learned
if he'd done what I just did this afternoon -- namely, talk to
*another* faculty adviser listed in the biographical note in the Rimm
study? [...] My source told me that the famous legal footnotes were
actually written by someone other than Rimm. "It almost appears," I
then said, "that the legal footnotes were added on in order to qualify
the Rimm article as something fit for a law journal." "Yes, that is
exactly the way it appeared."</blockquote>

<p>Rimm's contradictory reports on the composition of his research
team provide even more reason for suspicion. In November 1994, Rimm
declares that "four lawyers" are on his "team of researchers." Months
later, the team suddenly has no lawyers, and Rimm has no explanation
for the apparent change:

<blockquote> From: Martin Rimm <mr6e+@andrew.cmu.edu>
<br>     Newsgroups: cmu.cs.discussion
<br>     Subject: Re: More Censorship
<br>     Date: Fri,  4 Nov 1994 00:31:15 -0500

<p>     The team of researchers consists of seven professors, three
     deans, <b>four lawyers</b>, two lobbyist groups, six undergraduate
     research assistants, three doctoral students, three
     programmers, and an art instructor.

<p>     We appreciate your interest. We are making every effort to
     get you a complete copy of the study before publication. In
     the meantime, we would greatly appreciate an independent
     check of our legal notes, which the journal helped us with.

<br>     Thanks again,
<br>     Martin Rimm
<br>     Principal Investigator</blockquote>

Godwin writes:

<blockquote>It's certain that Marty had legal assistance prior to the
official formal submission article to the law journal. Who gave that
assistance?

<p>At this point in the inquiry, the likeliest answers to this
question appear to be:

<p>1) That either Deen Kaplan (the Georgetown Law Journal staff member
and antiporn activist), or Len Munsil (the antiporn activist who, as a
law student, helped Bruce Taylor craft his law-review article and who
would no doubt be able to recall it from memory) crafted the study is
the source of Rimm's legal footnotes and of the law-related text of
the Rimm article.(Catharine MacKinnon is also a possible candidate),
and

<p>2) That either Bruce Taylor, who continues to spearhead the
attempts to pressure Congress into censoring the Internet, or
Catharine MacKinnon, the controversial University of Michigan law
professor is the Supreme Court obscenity litigator who served as a
"referee" for Rimm.</blockquote>

<p>Rimm has denied receiving unreported assistance with his footnotes
from Bruce Taylor or Deen Kaplan, two leading anti-porn activists.
(Knowing that Rimm's paper would contribute to the national hysteria
over pornography on computer networks, Kaplan successfully placed the
study in the Georgetown Law Journal, where he worked.) However, when
confronted with the evidence that he received unattributed legal help
from an unnamed source, Rimm has not denied it.

<p>As a researcher, even as an undergraduate, Rimm has an ethical
responsibility to follow accepted ethical standards. Plagiarism is not
one of them.

<p>Michael Mehta was a doctoral student at York University in Ontario
when Rimm contacted him and asked to share information. Rimm
represented himself as a professor leading a large interdisciplinary
research team at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon
University</a>; Mehta was flattered by the attention. He sent
"everything they had" to Rimm, and never heard from him again.

<p>After Mehta learned about Rimm publishing his study, he read an
online copy. "I don't think the parallels between the two studies are
coincidences. There are a lot of similarities that can't be accounted
for by chance," he said. Rimm responded by denouncing Mehta in a
letter to the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>, and calling the charges
part of a "witchhunt" against him.

<p>It is deceptive for Rimm to misrepresent himself as anything but an
undergraduate engineering student -- albeit an 30-year-old
undergraduate with previous engineering skills through service in the
military. As defined earlier, scientific misconduct extends to any
sort of fraud or deception in scientific inquiry. There certainly must
be room for misunderstanding and accidental errors. But repeated
attempts at research-related deception are not consistent with the
truth-seeking nature of scientific inquiry.

<p><a name="Tools"><h2>Refused to allow replication</a></h2></center>

<p>Scholarly, peer-reviewed journals require that the authors of
submitted papers reveal their methodologies in detail, to allow for
replication and verification. To avoid the rigors of peer review, Rimm
submitted his work to the <i>Georgetown Law Journal</i>, a non-peer
reviewed publication.

<p>This also allowed Rimm to avoid revealing details on his
methodology. No details on his methodology can be found in his paper,
a choice he defended as made by the law journal.  The <i>Georgetown
Law Journal</i> certainly has a right to conduct business as it sees
fit. However, when Rimm was asked to provide copies of his software,
he refused. In academia, this is regarded as a breach of a basic norm
of modern science.

<p>Jim Thomas wrote on October 26, 1995:

<blockquote>Amongst reputable academics, it's considered fully
appropriate to ask for,
 and obligatory to provide, coding or analytic mechanisms of this kind 
 used in producing published results. Asking Rimm for his scripts is
 akin to asking a scholar to produce the raw data or (for example) the
 SPSS JCL used in statistical analysis. 
 
<p> Others here were able to critique such works as The Bell Curve or Sex in
 America because--whatever else the flaws--the authors displayed their
 methodological framework for the reader. Rimm's parsing software is
 as relevant to his "study" as were M&H's logit regression tables in TBC.
</blockquote>

Donna Hoffman wrote on August 12, 1995:
 
<blockquote>You know, in the top scholarly journals in the marketing
and behavioral science fields, it is a requirement that the authors of
submitted articles make their instruments and data available to
reviewers, if the reviewers should request it, for example, to run
their own analyses.
 
<p>It is also a requirement that the methodology be clearly detailed, either 
in the main text and/or a technical appendix, so that subsequent sets of 
scholars may attempt to replicate the work in other contexts.
 
<p>Not providing such information is grounds for rejection or, at the 
minimum, a hasty return of the manuscript to the author with a polite 
request to provide such information so it can be properly reviewed...

<p>I've reviewed hundreds of scholarly manuscripts over the years for 
journals that run the gamut in quality and do have to say that I have 
never encountered a paper that appeared to be so fraudulent in its 
approach to research and scientific inquiry.</blockquote>

According to the National Academy of Sciences' Statement on
Responsible Conduct in Research:

<blockquote>After publication, scientists expect that data and 
other research materials will be shared with qualified 
colleagues upon request. Indeed, a number of federal 
agencies, journals, and professional societies have 
established policies requiring the sharing of research 
materials. Sometimes these materials are too voluminous, 
unwieldy, or costly to share freely and quickly. But in 
those fields in which sharing is possible, a scientist 
who is unwilling to share research materials with 
qualified colleagues runs the risk of not being trusted 
or respected.</blockquote>

<p>One of the values of science is shared knowledge. Ever since the
Royal Society of London established the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> journal more than a century ago, the practices of
peer review and openness in sharing findings have been fundamental
values of western science.

<p><a name="Denies"><h2>Lied about Usenet posts</a></h2></center>

<p>On September 17, 1995, Rimm posted two message to Usenet,
apparently seeking vindication in the comments of a British professor
who also decried the prevalence of Internet pornography. Referring to
the <a href="articles/atlantic_city_press_8_29_95.article">newspaper
articles</a> that had revealed his background, Rimm posted:

<blockquote> Then again, perhaps if you conducted a background
"investigation" of this Professor, you might learn that he read the
report in an Arab headdress, and that in his youth he conducted a
study of watermelons in Queen Elizabeth's garden, concluding that they
indeed had pits (though the cantelope industry vehemently denied
this). Any one of these rumors, if confirmed, would immediately
discredit his research.</blockquote>

<p>Lillie Wilson from the <i>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i> read
Rimm's posts and decided to mention them in an article. The next day
she called CMU's University Relations office and spoke to Vice
President Don Hale, who confirmed that Rimm had made the posts. Rimm
declined to be interviewed. But a few hours later, Rimm posted a
followup message to Usenet saying he did <em>not</em> make the posts;
he claimed they were forged.

<p>However, according to the message-tracking headers on the posts
stored on the Andrew news servers, the posts originated from Rimm's
account.

<p>While not directly related to the content of Rimm's study, this
public incident related to the fallout from its publication is a
useful barometer of his conduct in dealing with criticism. Rimm acted
in a manner that was less than virtuous. Here, though, we can try to
envision the moral maze Rimm may have been facing. He likely was under
some pressure to post a retraction. Since the PR office knew about the
phone call from Wilson, perhaps the pressure came from CMU itself,
which was trying to minimize publicity related to the study. Since
Rimm was being investigated for ethical misconduct, the administration
would have a lever to use against him. If the administration had
prompted Rimm to act in this manner, Rimm's choices -- given that his
degree was at stake -- become much less clear.

<p><a name="BBS"><h2>Adult BBS Operators and Confidentiality</a></h2></center>

<p>Rimm deceived operators of adult BBSs in order to gain access to
their confidential files cataloging the downloads of images. The
deception occurred when Rimm neglected to inform them that he was
doing research for a university-sponsored research project. This
duplicity violates the fundamental ethical principles of social
science, which <em>require</em> that subjects enter into a project
voluntarily and with adequate information. Rimm's deception made it
impossible for them to do so. In his paper, Rimm even admits to
concealing his identity: "Members of the research team did not, as a
rule, identify themselves as researchers."

When asked by investigative journalist Brock Meeks how he managed to
acquire sensitive information on user habits from the BBS operators,
Rimm replied:

<blockquote><p>Dispatch asked Rimm:  "Did your team go uncover, as it were,
     when getting permission from these [BBS operators] to use their
     information?"  He replied only:  "Discrete, ain't we?"

<p>When asked how he was able to obtain detailed customer profiles
     from usually skeptical operators of adult BBSs he says:  "If
     you were a pornographer, and you don't have fancy computers or
     Ph.D. statisticians to assist you, wouldn't you be just a wee
     bit curious to see how you could adjust your inventories to
     better serve your clientele?  Wouldn't you want to know that
     maybe you should decrease the number of oral sex images and
     increase the number of bondage images? Wouldn't you want
     someone to analyze your logfiles to better serve the tastes of
     each of your customers?</blockquote>

<p>Not only did Rimm resort to deception to acquire confidential data, he
apparently was careless about keeping the data confidential himself.
When he wrote to Anne Branscomb, one of the reviewers commenting on
his study, he included a listing of the names of persons in foreign
countries who downloaded pornographic images from Amateur Action BBS.
Mike Godwin wrote:

<blockquote>I asked her whether she thought there are ethical
questions to be raised if those names, or other users' names, were
disclosed to the government in the context of seeking a grant from the
Department of Justice. She says she thought there are.</blockquote>
 
<p>By itself, the release of this information is a serious enough
ethical violation to justify censure. Rimm had an ethical
responsibility to ensure the safety and confidentiality of his
subjects. Given the possibility of prosecution or persecution, the
consequences of that information leaking could be severe.  Rimm also
obtained BBS subscriber data and published the names of the cities and
small towns where the subscribers lived. He did not obtain permission
from the subscribers to do this.

<p>Protecting the confidentiality of research subjects is a basic
responsibility for a researcher, especially when there may be
significant negative, possibly even legal, consequences for the
subjects if their identities were to be made public. Rimm's
recklessness in not considering the consequences of his actions is
distressing.

<p><a name="Speranza"><h2>Claimed Carolyn Speranza as Illustrator</a></h2></center>

<p>Rimm listed Carolyn Speranza as an illustrator for his
"Pornographer's Handbook," apparently without her consent. Speranza,
Rimm's former girlfriend and faculty advisor, says she never gave him
permission and did not know he had done so. On July 16, 1995, she
posted this message to Usenet:

<blockquote>1.  My name was listed in Books in Print as an illustrator
for the Pornographer's Handbook without my knowledge or consent.

<p>2.  The Pornographer's Handbook was an idea that Martin Rimm spoke 
of frequently to me, but I have never seen it in either printed or 
electronic form.  I have never written, or helped anyone write the 
excerpts from The Handbook which have been posted on the net, quoted
in Brock's article or any other.  I have never published material, 
written or illustrated under this title in any format.  Martin Rimm 
has never given me copies or excerpts from the Pornographer's 
Handbook, nor have I taken them from him without his consent.</blockquote>

<p>As of October 21, 1995, she also has asked that her name be removed
from the Books in Print entry that showed her as an illustrator:

<blockquote>In correspondence with Dan Dickholtz, editor for Books in Print,
published by R.R. Bowker, I have requested that my name be removed from
the Pornographer's Handbook listing. I have received a letter from him
stating that it has been removed from the electronic versions of Books
in Print, (ie the databases the bookstores receive) and will be removed
from the hardbound, printed version for its next publication. You can
verify this situation with Dan at R.R. Bowker in NJ.</blockquote>

<p><a name="Carnegie"><h2>Registered "Carnegie Press"</a></h2></center>

<p>Marty Rimm registered Carnegie Press on March 10, 1994, according
to the Corporation Bureau in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In <i>Books in
Print</i>, he lists Carnegie Press as the publisher of his
"Pornographer's Handbook." Years earlier, Rimm had self-published a
collection of short stories, <i>An American Playground</i>, using the
name of a vanity "Atlantic City Press."

<p>Carnegie Press is not a true company -- the Corporation Bureau
calls it a "fictitious name" -- since it's owned by a single
individual and trading under a business name. Rimm paid $52 to
register it, and the registration is good for his lifetime. According
to the bureau, the given purpose of Carnegie Press is "book
publishing." At the time of the company's registration, Rimm was
working on the "Pornographer's Handbook" project that apparently was
used to entice adult BBS operators into participating in his study.

<p>Apart from the ethical issue raised by Rimm's intention to profit
from grant-funded research on nonconsenting subjects, there also may
be an ethical issue raised by the misleading name, "Carnegie Press."
It capitalizes on the name of Carnegie Mellon University and lends an
unwarranted aura of credibility to a project that was not truly
associated with the school.

<hr> Marvin Sirbu was Marty Rimm's advisor and advocate. Sirbu lent
his name and credibility to Rimm's dubious research, and the
<i>Georgetown Law Journal</i> and <i>TIME</i> magazine believed him.
He was a senior, tenured professor with joint appointments in three
departments and the chair of the <a
href="http://www.ini.cmu.edu">Information Networking Institute</a>. If
the research was anything but stellar, the publications rationalized,
Sirbu would not stand behind it. One of the law journal writers who
commented favorably on Rimm's study said she did it because she knew
Sirbu from MIT.

<p>Sirbu's rights as a professor and advisor are circumscribed by his
responsibilities to the administration, to his profession, and to his
students, as well as by the values commonly understood to apply in
academic research. For example, he has the right to advance his own
career. But he also has the responsibility to uphold ethical and
scientific standards by overseeing the research of his advisees. If
the material is novel and interesting, he has the responsibility to
help his advisees publish their work.

<p>The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of
Biomedical and Behavioral Research published a report entitled
"Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human
Subjects of Research," popularly called the Belmont Report. The report
outlines three broad areas of responsibilities that should guide a
researcher in the social sciences: respect for persons, beneficence,
and justice. Rimm's study failed to meet those criteria, and Sirbu
failed in his responsibility to ensure it did.

<p>The reason for pairing a student with an advisor is that the
student's understanding of scientific and ethical standards may be
incomplete.  The advisor's role is to demonstrate those standards by
instruction and by example. Sirbu failed to fulfill this
responsibility, and the consequences have been significant.

<p>As Rimm's advisor, Marvin Sirbu participated in a demonstrably
unethical series of actions designed to <a
href="docs/jthomas.2">attract government funding,</a> to further his
career, and possibly even to help his <a
href="articles/boardwatch.article">corporate allies</a>.

<p>As the advisor, he should take responsibility for it.

<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------">
<p><a name="PI"><h2>Allowed Rimm to call himself `Principal
Investigator'</a></h2></center>

<p>Sirbu allowed Rimm to represent himself as the leader of a large
interdisciplinary research team -- a representation that was nothing
more than fantasy. Professor Jim Thomas wrote in an ethical analysis:

<blockquote>As Sirbu should know, "research team" has a special
connotation among
   scholars. A research team is not a casual circle of people who may
   occasionally interact. Sirbu's professed close relationship with Rimm
   and involvement in Rimm's research would give him knowledge of whether
   a "research team," as the term is conventionally employed by reputable
   scholars, did in fact exist. Sirbu's claim (above) that some
   high-level faculty "collaborated" with Rimm adds credence to, and
   perpetuates the image of, an established group of professionals
   well-integrated into a research project directed by Rimm as "principal
   investigator."</blockquote>

<p>Even though many members of Rimm's "research team" have disclaimed
any substantial involvement with Sirbu or Rimm, Sirbu allowed his
advisee to perpetuate this fiction. Sirbu also allowed an
undergraduate to pass himself off to the national media as the
"principal investigator" of his "research team."  That is more than
misleading; it is deceptive.

<p>"Principal investigator" has a specific meaning in academia. As one 
researcher, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote:

<blockquote><p>To be principal investigator on a research project
means your name goes on the cover page of the proposal, and you bear
the responsibility for how the project is conducted, including how
money is spent, how university and funding agency regulations are
complied with, and how the results are published. The PI is the person
with whom the funding agency communicates directly. He is the person
accountable for the project. When applying for external funding (e.g.,
from NSF), only faculty members can be principal investigators on
grants; graduate students cannot be.

<p>If the project were externally funded -- which is considered far more
prestigious -- Rimm could not have awarded himself the title of
"principal investigator." Sirbu would have had to have been the PI.
Rimm probably even can't legitimately call himself PI on a SURG grant,
since he is required to have a faculty advisor. Real PIs do not have
advisors looking over their shoulders.</blockquote>

<p>For Rimm to call himself "principal investigator" of a CMU-funded
study is self-congratulatory nonsense. For Sirbu to condone and
perpetuate it is deceptive.

<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------"> <p><a name="Analyst"><h2>Allowed
Rimm to use "Dean's" account</h2></a></center>

<p>Rimm employed other devices to conceal his undergraduate status. When Rimm
was a student, his computer account on CMU's Andrew system revealed
his class status at Carnegie Mellon. A "finger" request directed at his
Andrew account would have shown that Rimm was an undergraduate: a
senior Electrical and Computer Engineering major.

<p>To hide his true status, Rimm acquired another Andrew account that
was labeled "CIT Dean's Office," meaning the <a
href="http://www.cit.cmu.edu">Carnegie Institute of Technology</a>. He
used this account to communicate with researchers at other
universities, often not revealing that he was an undergraduate
student. Since CMU policies would have required that Sirbu sign the
paperwork for Rimm's "Dean's Office" account, Sirbu should have
ensured his student did not abuse it.

<p>Rimm often used this account to lend the imprimatur of the Dean of CIT
to his study. When Aaron Dickey from the Associated Press revealed on
Usenet that the author of the "Carnegie Mellon study" was an
undergraduate, Rimm replied from the Dean's office account, without
signing the mail:

<blockquote> Date: Tue, 27 Jun 1995 07:59:02 -0400 (EDT)
<br>  From: CIT Dean's Office <analyst+@andrew.cmu.edu>
<br>  To: Aaron L Dickey <kieran@interport.net>
<br>  Subject: Re: Time, Dewitt AWFUL article
<p> 
  More than two dozen members of the Carnegie Mellon community
  contributed to the project, including eleven faculty members and three
  graduate students.

<p>  Thank you for your interest.</blockquote>

<p>Rimm also used the "Dean's Office" account to communicate with Seth
Finkelstein of MIT:

<blockquote><p>Message-Id: <UjvAjda00iWUM4kFB9@andrew.cmu.edu>
<br>  Date: Sat, 24 Jun 1995 22:37:29 -0400 (EDT)
<br>  From: "CIT Dean's Office" <analyst+@andrew.cmu.edu>
<br>  To: sethf@MIT.EDU (Seth Finkelstein)
<br>  Subject: Re: EFF Analysis of Communications Decency Act as Passed by

<p>We made the cover of TIME to hit the stands Monday. If you have a
  chance, you can watch me on Nightline Monday evening.</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="docs/case.of.two.cybersex.studies.html">"Case
of the Two Cybersex Studies"</a> reveals that Michael Mehta was a
graduate student at York University in Ontario when Rimm called him in
November 1994 to talk about Mehta's research. Rimm misrepresented his
identity to Mehta, leading the Canadian to believe Rimm was a
professor leading a large team of researchers. Mehta said afterwards:
"I feel like a total fool now.  I was under the impression that Rimm
was a tenured faculty member. He never corrected me when I called him
'professor Rimm.'"

<p>Here too, Sirbu knew or should have known what his advisee was
doing. Advisors have a responsibility to oversee the actions of their
students, especially when the students are acting on behalf of a "team
of researchers" that includes their advisor.

<p><center><img src="graphics/separator.wide.jpg"
alt="------------------------------"> <p><a name="Status"><h2>Allowed
Rimm to hide status in report</h2></a></center>

<p>Even Rimm's paper clouded the issue of his own lack of credentials
in social science research. To be sure, an advanced degree is not
necessary or even sufficient to produce interesting research in a
field.  At the same time, its absence may make observers more
skeptical about the quality of the research -- a skepticism Rimm went
to great lengths to avoid.

<p>Nowhere in the paper did Rimm mention his student status.  The
biographical footnote simply identified him as "Researcher and
Principal Investigator, College of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon
University."


A few pages afterwards, Rimm
says:

<blockquote><p>The principal investigator, an electrical engineer with
a background
  in broadband communications, began with an interest in digital image
  manipulation and the transmission of multimedia applications over
  computer networks in real-time. Other interests include examining how
  computer networks challenge researchers to develop new methodologies
  to monitor consumption habits, marketing techniques, and reliability
  and validity methods for the analysis of vast quantities of
data.</blockquote>

<p>This wording implies that Rimm has a substantial background in
developing "new methodologies" and in "marketing techniques." This is
misleading and deceptive.

<p>Still later in the study, Rimm writes:

<blockquote><p>More than two dozen faculty, staff, graduate and
undergraduate
  students at Carnegie Mellon University contributed in some manner to
  this study. After a year of exploring the Internet, Usenet, World
  Wide Web, and computer Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), the research
  team discovered that one of the largest (if not the largest)
  recreational applications of users of computer networks was the
  distribution and consumption of sexually explicit imagery.</blockquote>

<p>In the first sentence, Rimm credits over a score of Carnegie Mellon
community members with contributing to this study, but in the second
sentence, he switches to using the words "research team." This leads
the reader to believe that all two dozen members were on the "research
team," which is incorrect and misleading. Half of the "contributors"
to his study have distanced themselves from it, saying they had
nothing to do with the paper. Rimm was and remains the sole author.

<p>Rimm also failed to follow Carnegie Mellon's published requirements
for students receiving SURG funds:

<blockquote><p>Please acknowledege your award in any printed materials
related to
  your project including any final reports or formal publications.
  Please use the following statement: "This project was funded [in part]
  by Carnegie Mellon's Undergraduate Research Initiative through the
  Small Undergraduate Research Grant program.  This paper represents the
  views of the author[s] and not those of Carnegie Mellon
University."</blockquote>

<p>Rimm did not comply with the policy, choosing instead to conceal
that he was an undergraduate, in this footnote: "This
interdisciplinary project was made possible by four grants from
Carnegie Mellon University."

<p>On July 4, 1994, Professor Donna Hoffman of Vanderbilt University
noticed that Rimm's web site featured a response to her critique
authored by him alone but deceptively labeled as coming from "The
Research Team":

<blockquote><p>
 But they don't have text behind them.  Rimm previously signed this page 
 as "The Research Team" but I wrote Sirbu to advise Rimm to change it and 
 take responsibility for it and he did.  It is now signed, "Marty Rimm, 
 Principal Investigator."
<p> There used to a an active link to "Conspiracies," which contained all the 
 grafs from Elizabeth Corcoran's story in last week's Washington Post in 
 which I was quoted.  However, a letter to Sirbu suggesting this was a bad 
 idea  resulted in its hasty removal and an apology from Rimm (which I 
 posted here).
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it is somehow conceivable that an advisor would decline to
read their student's paper before it was published in a prominent law
journal and featured on the cover of TIME magazine. But it is
inconceivable that Sirbu wouldn't have realized by this time that Rimm
was perpetuating the "principal investigator" fiction. Yet Sirbu
allowed Rimm to continue.

<p>After all, it had been going on for quite a while. On November 6,
1994, Rimm sent mail to Carl Kadie, a graduate student at the
University of Illinois. In the mail that Kadie reposted to Usenet with
permission, Rimm again perpetuated his "principal investigator"
fabrication:

  You're a good guy, Carl. I'm the principle [sic] investigator of the
  study, "Marketing Pornography on the Information Superhighway."

<p>And again on April 4, 1995, in mail sent to the EFF's Mike Godwin,
Rimm used the misleading "principal investigator" title.

<p>Since Sirbu's name was on the final draft of Rimm's "Marketing
Pornography" paper, and since he was the faculty member who signed off
on the SURG grant, Sirbu should have read the paper before it was
published. He should have realized that <b>nowhere</b> in the paper was
Rimm's undergraduate status mentioned. Instead, the paper was a
masterpiece of deception and duplicity.

<p>On January 9, 1996, Sirbu said in a post to Usenet that:

<blockquote>[I] never condoned or "allowed Marty to represent himself as a
  post-doctoral researcher" as you allege.</blockquote>

<p>This is misleading. Sirbu knew or should have known about Rimm's
misrepresentations and lies and stopped it. To do otherwise is gross
negligence and an abdication of his fundamental responsibilities as a
faculty member and a member of the Carnegie Mellon University research
community.

<DD>Announcement of a new mailing list, EDEM-ELECT, 
    focussing on using the net for activism relating to offline elections.
    Description excerpts: &quot;EDEM-ELECT has been established to 
    promote citizen exchange efforts during the election season.
    EDEM-ELECT intends to bring together those working to facilitate
    online public discussion and participation in elections held in
    1996 or 1997. Depending upon the usefullness of this forum its
    charter may be expanded or reduced. For now EDEM-ELECT is focused on 
    the exchange of ideas, plans, and experiences among individuals and 
    groups working across the world to develop local, regional, or 
    national efforts...we want to concentrate on the 'how to's' of organizing
    local, non-partisan efforts; such as how to recruit volunteers,
    how to attract and use in-kind information infrastructure
    donations (WWW site, e-mail lists, etc.), how to build an
    audience, how to work with campaigns, the media and political
    organizations, and how to coordinate the technical and
    social/political aspects of online open forums...&quot;

    created in the fall of 1993 to explore a team-based, open-network 
    approach to implementing the recommendations of the National Performance
    Review. As an umbrella network of networks, NetResults fosters the
    development of teams which span agencies and departments, cross
    public-private sector boundaries, and link federal, state, and
    local governments.&quot;

<DD>Community Policy &amp; Terms of Service for users of firefly, a 
    free online service and &quot;intelligent agent&quot;, http://www.ffly.com
    Last revision: 1996. Firefly's policy takes a very firm stance on 
    protecting user privacy, and a middling stance on user freedom of 
    expression, noting firefly's own editorial control rights (and 
    potential market imperative to excercise them). Policy also 
    acknowledges legal requirements, and other parties' intellectual 
    property rights. This is basically an exemplary policy for a BBS-type 
    model in which the system may wish to exercise editorial control, e.g. 
    to please a &quot;family oriented&quot; customer base. For an ISP, it is lacking 
    a net.abuse policy, and does not do enough to protect user free 
    expression (since ISPs are not in business of content control, only 
    access provision). Unlike many older policies, this one essentially
    grants the system the right to display advertising to users, avoiding
    any question or confusion on that point.

<DT><a href="psu.code.hearing-procedures"><B>psu.code.hearing-procedures</B></a>
<DD>This is part of the Pennsylvania State
    University Code. It is available via gopher from info.psu.edu. Some
    points of interest: 1.The charges must be specified in detail. 2.The

    Code. It is from the document '//psuinfo/University Life/Legal Rights 
    and Safety Concerns/Intolerance'. It is available via gopher from 
    info.psu.edu. Some points of interest: 1. Says that although the 
    University hates intolerance, "members of its community have a right 
    to hold and express their views, even when these views are contrary 
    to University values and objectives. The University cannot impose 
    disciplinary sanctions on those who express their views when these 
    persons have not violated University regulations as long as these 
    comments are not directed at a specific individual and do not incite 
    violence." 2. But, also says "If you see materials that you and/or 
    others may view as offensive ... you may file a report at the Campus 
    Life Assistance Center .." 3. Also says, punishment can be increased 
    if a prohibited action is hate motivated. This might not be 
    constitutional. see ftp.eff.org:pub/CAF/law/hate-crime.ohio and 
    rav-v-st-paul.
<DT><a href="psu.code.publications"><B>psu.code.publications</B></a>

    Code. It is from the document '//psuinfo/Policies-Rules for
    Students/Student Organizations, Registered/Publications And Other
    Communication Media'. It is available via gopher from info.psu.edu. 
    Some points of interest: 1. Students are responsible for content. 2.
    Requires some faculty control in student media.
<DT><a href="psu.code.rights-of-others"><B>psu.code.rights-of-others</B></a>
<DD>This is part of the Pennsylvania State
    University Code. It is from the document '//psuinfo/Policies-Rules
    for Students/Policies and Rules/Rights Of Others ... The Educational
    Process'. It is available via gopher from info.psu.edu. Some
    points of interest: 1. Forbids institutional censorship. 2. Says a
    member of the University community has a "right to identify
    oneself as a member of the University community and a concurrent
    obligation not to speak or act on behalf of the institution without
    authorization". 3. Says a member of the University community has a
    right "to privacy in offices, laboratories, and residence hall
    rooms, and in the keeping of personal papers, confidential records,
    and effects, subject only to the general law and University
    regulations".
<DT><a href="psu.code.sanctions"><B>psu.code.sanctions</B></a>
<DD>This is part of the Pennsylvania State University
    Code. It is available via gopher from info.psu.edu. Some point of
    interest: 1. One of the later sanctions mention is "Loss of
    privilege is the withdrawal of a privilege, use of a service, or
    participation in an activity for a specific period of time
    consistent with the offense committed and the rehabilitation of the
    student." This could probably include a computer suspension. 2.
    Summary campus suspensions are only allowed "when a University
    official designated by the President has reasonable cause to believe
    the student is an immediate threat to the safety of
    himself/herself or other persons or property or is an immediate
    threat to disrupt essential operations of the University."

<DD>Community Policy &amp; Terms of Service for users of firefly, a 
    free online service and &quot;intelligent agent&quot;, http://www.ffly.com
    Last revision: 1996. Firefly's policy takes a very firm stance on 
    protecting user privacy, and a middling stance on user freedom of 
    expression, noting firefly's own editorial control rights (and 
    potential market imperative to excercise them). Policy also 
    acknowledges legal requirements, and other parties' intellectual 
    property rights. This is basically an exemplary policy for a BBS-type 
    model in which the system may wish to exercise editorial control, e.g. 
    to please a &quot;family oriented&quot; customer base. For an ISP, it is lacking 
    a net.abuse policy, and does not do enough to protect user free 
    expression (since ISPs are not in business of content control, only 
    access provision). Unlike many older policies, this one essentially
    grants the system the right to display advertising to users, avoiding
    any question or confusion on that point.

   With some twenty or thirty million individual users, and
twenty thousand businesses, already linked electronically to one
another, and thousands more arriving on the scene each day, the
Internet's potential as a marketplace--a place where buyers and
sellers can come together to exchange goods or services for value--
is vast. It is thus no surprise that businesses are rushing
headlong onto the Internet (even if most of them have not quite 
figured out what they will do when they are there).<P>
   
   But the thousands of willing sellers (of everything from
books, magazines, computer programs, and other
information-based products to more tangible items) hawking their
wares online face a problem:  how will buyers pay for these goods
and services?  What is the currency that will serve as the medium
of exchange in this new marketplace?  At present, there is no
secure way to effect payment of the public Internet, and so users
are forced to go off the 'Net to make the purchase--mailing the
seller a check or phoning in a credit card number.
   <P>
   Eight hundred years ago, give or take a few, the merchants
of medieval Europe faced a similar problem when trying to unlock
the commercial potential of the continent-wide marketplace. After
the fall of Rome, with Europe divided up into dozens of competing
sovereignties, long-distance commerce came to a virtual standstill
for hundreds of years. Merchants and traders seeking to exploit
this new territory faced any number of seemingly insurmountable
obstacles--e.g., the difficulty of obtaining protection against armed
and organized marauders, conflicting local laws and customs
regarding commercial practices, and incompatible and
inconvertible currencies.
<P>   
   To circumvent some of these problems, these medieval
merchants invented, in effect, a form of private money: negotiable
instruments (promissory notes, bills of exchange, and the like).
The merchant-developed commercial law surrounding use of these
instruments, incorporated into the lex mercatoria in the early
middle ages, stands as one of the truly remarkable achievements
of the western legal tradition and one of the critical turning-points
in the history of the expansion of trade and commerce. 
<P>   
   We may be on the verge of a similar sort of development
today, but one that, in keeping with the general acceleration of all
things technological, is likely to take far less time to conclude than
the centuries it took for the commercial payment system to evolve.
Although I am generally loathe to make predictions about future
developments on the Internet (other than a forecast of continued
rapid growth and activity), one prediction may stand as an
exception to this general rule:  I am virtually certain that we will
soon find true electronic cash ("e-cash") -- digital tokens accepted
as the equivalent of legal tender 
<A HREF="/pub/Publications/David_Post/HTML/e-cash_side.html">
[See sidebar]</A> -- circulating over the Internet's wires<A NAME="CONTD">.</A><P>

      Don't take my word for it. Microsoft's Bill Gates, a man
with a fairly good track record at predicting future technological
developments (if only, perhaps, because he has the resources to
will them into existence) calls the "electronic wallet" -- a
microchip storing e-cash, credit card information, and various
other tidbits of information one might like to carry around in one's
pocket -- his "favorite idea," and everyone from Microsoft to
financial services giants such as Citibank and Visa International --
and dozens of smaller and (currently) less well-known operations
-- is hard at work developing its version of the currency of the
future.<P>
      
      It is not hard to see why. Existing paper money, to be sure,
is inconvenient (physically cumbersome, difficult to transport and
process, easy to steal) and it has been steadily losing "market
share" to other payment systems (checks, credit cards, electronic
funds transfer) that seem better suited to the needs of the modern
world of electronic commerce. <P>
      
      But shorn of these disadvantages, cash is pretty wonderful
stuff: portable, instantly recognizable, instantly accepted by
everyone without any of the overhead associated with the other
payment systems, and entirely anonymous. And any form of cash
that can retain these features and be utilized in the world of
electronic commerce is going to prove extremely attractive.  It also
will likely earn its developers significant amounts of money, digital
or otherwise.<P>
      
      So what, you ask?  So Microsoft (or others) finds some
way to issue e-bills, earns billions of dollars in transactions fees,
and helps transform the Internet into a kind of Home Shopping
Network in overdrive -- why should the law or lawyers pay this
any mind?  <P>
      
      Because e-cash poses, appropriately enough, a binary
choice for regulators and other law-enforcement types that will do
much to determine the ultimate fate of lawful activity on the
global network. <P>
      
      As a result of the very features that make it so attractive,
cash has always occupied a somewhat unstable and uncomfortable
place within the existing legal regime. Anonymous and virtually
untraceable, cash transactions today occupy a place in a kind of
legal netherworld, an underground domain where the law is an
uncertain presence. 
    <P>  
      Because paper money in large quantities is indeed so
cumbersome to use and manipulate, this underground economy is
generally confined to relatively small-scale transactions.  (Some
large-scale drug operations and other organized crime are the
obvious exceptions).  So long as the transactions are mostly small,
they can, perhaps, be tolerated by the state as an unfortunate, but
largely insignificant, by-product of the modern commercial state.
As transactions get larger, the state becomes more suspicious, and
enlists the aid of the banks, through the currency reporting and
anti-structuring laws, in reporting large disbursements of cash so
that additional oversight can be ordered. 
<P>      
      Anything that makes cash substantially easier to use in a
substantially broader range of transactions holds the potential to
expand this extra-legal netherworld to proportions posing ever
more serious threats to the existing legal order.  Under the most
ambitious visions of e-cash, we would see a new form of a
currency--units of money in the form of digital files instead of
engraved notes that could be freely passed off from one computer
to another with no record, yet incapable of being forged.  A
consumer could draw such e-cash electronically from his or her
bank.  The bank would have a record of that transaction, just as
a withdrawal or check is recorded now.  But after that, the
encrypted e-cash file could be handed off without the knowledge
of anyone but the parties to the transaction (see sidebar).
<P>      
      Consider the impact of this on taxation. Transaction-based
taxes (e.g., sales and use taxes) account for a significant fraction
of state and local government revenue, and Congress itself is
considering implementing a transaction-based national sales or
valued added tax.  But if electronic money really is made to
function like paper money does, payments we would never think
of making in cash--to buy a new car, say, or the down payment on
a house--could be made in this new form of currency because there
would be no problem of bulk and no risk of robbery.
<P>      
      From the government's standpoint, if much larger and more
significant transactions could be effected safely and securely by an
electronic means that leaves no more of a paper trail than cash
does today, that could eliminate records of many taxable
transactions.  The threat to the government's revenue flow should
such schemes be implemented is a very real one (and officials at
the US Treasury Department, at least, are starting to take
cognizance of this development and to prepare their responses).
<P>      
      Perhaps the banks and the public will never have enough
confidence that the most powerful, untraceable, forms of e-cash
can be safe from forgery.  But e-cash's proponents think the
technology will prove trustworthy.  If it does, the government may
move to prevent any truly anonymous and untraceable e-cash
system from developing.  But that raises its own problems
because, as we escape the Scylla of the Underground Economy,
the Charybdis of Big Brother rears its ugly head. Just as powerful
encryption schemes permit the design of radically untraceable e-
cash systems, so, too, do powerful electronic record-keeping tools
permit the design of equally traceable systems -- systems where all
of your financial transactions are duly recorded in the Great
Database, allowing those with access to know more about you than
anyone could know today.
<P>      
      However the politics and business of e-cash play out, the
technology is far enough along that the legal issues can't be
avoided.  The question e-cash poses is not, "Should the law take
cognizance of this development?" but rather, "How can it not?" 
By pointing an arrow at the heart of the state's revenue-raising
capabilities, e-cash cannot escape scrutiny and regulation; but it is
going to take some serious thinking to design a regulatory scheme
that does not fulfill our worst fears about the personal privacy
implications of the new digital world.

<H3>SIDEBAR:  WHAT IS E-CASH?</H3>

<I>American Lawyer</I>, February 1995<BR>
<A HREF="/homes/post.html">David G. Post</A>
<BR><HR><BR>

   Although there are any number of schemes currently under
development, the basic e-cash system is likely to work roughly as
follows:<BR>

<OL> 
<LI>   Alice establishes an account at her bank, First Digital, in
the ordinary manner.
<LI>   When she wants cash, she sends an electronic
mail message to First Digital requesting, say, $100. Using one of
the available "public key encryption" programs I described in last
month's column, she encrypts her message -- scrambles it using
First Digital's public encryption code, which means that only First
Digital can make any sense of it whatever. She also electronically
"signs" the message -- encrypts it again, but this time using her
own private encryption code -- which allows First Digital to verify
that the message indeed came from Alice.
<LI>    First Digital debits her account by $100 and
sends off her cyber-currency, which consists simply of a digital
file, a string of 1s and 0s, that the bank's computers will recognize
as the equivalent of a $100 bill. This file, too, is encrypted by
First Digital (so that only Alice can make use of it) and signed by
First Digital (uniquely identifying First Digital as the issuer).
<LI>    When Alice finds Bob offering something on
the Internet that she want to buy, she transfers this file to him --
encrypting it again (for Bob's eyes only) and signing it. Bob
decrypts the file and, verifying that First Digital is the issuer,
transmits it back to First Digital, which confirms that it issued the
file and credits Bob's account accordingly.
</OL><BR>

             All of these manipulations, needless to say, are
handled automatically in the parties' computers. What Alice really
does, sitting at her PC, is choose "get $100" and "send $100"
from the menu of her Internet navigation program.

    Many early citizens of cyberspace will bitterly oppose any such
    development, arguing that anonymous and pseudonymous electronic
    communications are vital to preserve electronic freedoms and allow free
    expression of human personality. But the problem with that view is that
    we all collectively face the diners' dilemma -- we must collaborate in
    groups to build a rich social fabric, and we know that the ability to
    act anonymously, sporadically, in large groups brings out the worst in
    human character.&quot; One of Mr. Johnson's more controversial pieces.

<A NAME="spa"> </A><B>Software Publishers Assoc. vs. ISPs - suits
dropped, "Code of Conduct" critiqued</B><BR>
A software industry trade assocation best known as a piracy watchdog
filed suit against several Internet service providers for "contributory"
copyright infringement because users of the ISPs allegedly engaged in
software piracy. No proof was offered, and SPA, in late Nov., had dropped
or settled its cases against C2.Net and other ISPs.
The point of the legal action may have been to herd smaller providers
into adopting the trade association's "ISP Code of Conduct". The code
calls for broad monitoring of user communications for "cracker material"
by sysadmins-turned-net-cops. The "Code" would invade user privacy, and
chill the First Amendment-protected expression of both providers and
users. Despite criticism of the "Code", SPA to date has simply changed the
name of it (to "ISP Guidelines for Copyright Protection"), without making
any changes to its content.

<A NAME="cos-settle"> </A><B>Church of Scientology settles suit with ISP
Netcom and BBS sysop Klemesrud.</B><BR>
A lengthy court fight to hold system operators liable for actions of users
ends quietly, as both Netcom and co-defendant Tom Klemesrud have settled with
CoS representatives.  CoS had sued them, and former CoS minister Dennis
Erlich, when Erlich allegedly violated CoS copyright and trade secrets
by distributing Scientology teaching on the Internet. The settlement leaves
open the issue of whether service and access providers can be found at least
contributorily infringing if their users infringe trade secret and other
rights. Erlich, the accused direct infringer of CoS copyright is still being
sued. Scientology Critics claim that the cases are nuissance suits designed
to prevent former CoS members from whistleblowing or publicly denouncing
the controversial organization.

     You have probably heard your fill of grandiose predictions
about the Coming of the Internet ("the 'Net" to aficionados, the
"National Information Infrastructure" to the bureaucrats): 
absolutely nothing -- not the way you work, the way you play, the
way you educate your children, the way you interact with your
friends, the very Meaning of Life -- will ever be the same now
that it has arrived in full glory.  Well, whatever may be the
consequences for the Meaning of Life, it is difficult to believe
that emergence of the Internet is not going to have a real, and
possibly even a profound, effect on the work that we lawyers do and the
context in which we do it is -- on the practice of law, the
business of law, and perhaps even the nature of Law.       
<P>
     What is the Internet?  First and foremost, it is nothing more
than a computer network, conceptually similar to the Local Area
Network (LAN) that you may have at your office.  Like any
network, it is simply a system linking individual free-standing
computers by means of (a) physical connections (in the case of
your LAN, cables running inside your office walls) and (b) a
language that each of the computers is programmed to understand,
the electronic "rules of the road" that allow each computer on the
network to transmit information to any other computer and to act
on the messages it receives -- to forward some messages to a third
machine, to transfer a particular file to the computer from which
the message originated, etc. -- in the manner specified.      
<P>
     The Internet differs from your LAN, however, in three
important ways.  First, no special cables are required; ordinary
telephone lines can be used for the physical links among Internet
computers.  Second, the Internet's common language -- the
"Internet Protocol" -- is non-proprietary and publicly available
(unlike the proprietary software that controls operations on your
LAN).  And third, the Internet language is built upon the principle
of decentralization; unlike your LAN, where a central computer --
the network "server" -- stores all of the files and routes all
electronic mail messages, files can be stored anywhere on the
Internet and messages can travel from machine to machine without
ever passing through a central point.      
<P>
     Because ordinary telephone lines can be used for the
physical links among Internet computers (see Box), any computer
with access to a dedicated telephone line can join the Internet --
and at latest count, 3.2 million computers have done so (1 million
in the last 6 months).  Immense as this is, it vastly understates the
Internet's reach; because telephone lines are the medium of
Internet communication, anyone with a computer and a modem can
dial in to one of these "backbone" computers, and, while the
telephone connection is active, be "on" the Internet.  Estimates of
the number of dial-in Internet participants runs as high as 20
million (with 20% monthly growth). 
<A HREF="/pub/Publications/David_Post/HTML/demyst_inet_side.html">
[See sidebar]</A><A NAME="CONTD">.</A><P>

     That is, basically, what it is.  As Gertrude Stein said of
Oakland, there is no "there" there; no one owns the Internet, no
one operates it, no one can point to it or say exactly where it
is, how big it is, or how much traffic it bears.  It is less illuminating
to think of it as a tangible "thing" than as a system connecting
previously free-standing "things," transforming, if you will,
millions of small digital ponds into a single digital ocean.  With
the Internet in place, virtually any information stored in digital
form -- and think, just for starters, of every musical composition
now recorded on CD, virtually every opinion ever issued by
virtually any court in this country, the output of virtually every
newspaper and magazine in the developed world, and indeed most
of what each of the readers of this magazine put down in writing
each day -- can be transferred, almost instantaneously and for little
more than the price of a local phone call, to any, or all, of those
20 million or so computers now connected to the global network.
<P>     
     What difference will all this make to the practice of law? 
Predicting the impact of new technologies is a tricky business --
many people were convinced that the telephone would be used for
listening to opera, after all.  I will not try to persuade you here
that this is the most fundamental transformation in the way that
information is organized and communicated since Gutenberg
invented the printing press, and that no one in the business of
organizing and communicating information will remain untouched
by its emergence (though I believe both statements to be true).  I
will instead look at just one small corner of this vast canvas, and
suggest that the Internet, by giving your clients new capabilities to
search for information, will transform lawyers' (and law firms')
relationship to their own work product.  Let's see why this might
be so.      
<P>
     To begin with, consider that even with the rather primitive
search tools now available over the Internet, you can perform a
kind of search that was not possible a few years ago (and that was
virtually unimaginable a few decades ago):  you can now find
information -- texts, documents, memoranda, papers, etc. --
pertinent to a particular question without knowing beforehand
where to look, since your search can be performed everywhere on
the network at once.  That is, you can post a query on the Internet
-- looking, say, for documents explaining the elements of copyright
infringement -- and the search will comb through databases and
other collections of whose whereabouts, and very existence, you
are completely unaware -- statutory summaries and annotations
compiled by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, the
speeches of Learned Hand posted on the Net by some enterprising
law student, the legal memoranda, perhaps, prepared by the law
firm right down the street from you.  In a real sense, information,
once placed on the Internet, can find the question(s) to which it is
relevant, rather than the questioner having to find the relevant
information.      <P>

     These searches are, to be sure, cumbersome and unreliable;
searching the Internet feels, in fact, more like using a 10-year old
version of Lexis or Westlaw on a computer whose battery keeps
running low than your ticket to the 21st century.  But because the
Internet has only recently emerged as a mass-market phenomenon,
comparatively few resources have yet been devoted to making it
easily usable by ordinary mortals; the race to make more
sophisticated search tools available is now under a full head of
steam, for whomever finds the way -- or just any way -- to make
these searches easier is going to make a great deal of money.  The
same "natural language" search capabilities that have now made
their way onto Lexis and Westlaw will, for example, surely soon
be available for Internet-wide searches, allowing anyone to point
a question in English towards the digital ocean -- "I own a
bookstore; what should I do if I am informed by a publisher's
representative that the author of a book published by a competitor
contains material that constitutes copyright infringement?" -- from
which it will return, like an obedient terrier, relevant documents
dangling from its mouth.      
<P>
     Those of you still using the West bound digests for your
primary legal research may doubt that people will actually find
useful information this way.  The rest of you are presumably less
reluctant to embrace the notion that online searching can become
more efficient than alternative means, having watched this happen
close to home over the past several years.        
<P>
     What will people be looking for, and what kinds of
information will be made available, on the Internet?  First as a
trickle, then in a torrent, lawyers' work product will inevitably be
recycled onto the Internet -- some of it perhaps for sale, some of
it for free, but it will be there.  There is, after all, substantial
demand for this information on the part of clients and potential
clients (which covers just about everybody).  Because legal
problems, while enormously diverse, do tend to recur with some
frequency, lawyers are not infrequently in the position of
"reinventing the wheel" -- charging clients for the research and
other information-processing activities that others have previously
engaged in.  Consumers of legal services are understandably
unhappy with this state of affairs, but the market currently
provides them with few options; it is costly, and at times
impossible, to obtain information about lawyers (other than those
with whom they ordinarily deal) who may have faced and already
solved problems similar to those now being addressed, and thus it
is usually less expensive to re-invent the wheel than to determine
whether there are alternative (and less expensive) sources of supply
for the advice or other services they seek.      
<P>
     Courtesy of the Internet, the cost of obtaining that
information is in free fall.  But lawyers will not make that
information available, you say?  Lawyers will not take a product
for which there is substantial market demand, a product that costs
virtually nothing to produce -- memos and briefs that are already
written -- and place it where it can actually be found by the very
people who indicate that they need it?  Perhaps not.  But while
you're summarizing your recent work in trademark infringement
litigation and recycling it into an "all client memo" -- most copies
of which, being irrelevant to any immediate problem facing any of
your current clients, end up in the trash -- your not-so- friendly
competition is going to put its memo where somebody who
actually needs help with a trademark infringement matter can find
it.  And don't say I didn't warn you when a long-standing client
of yours comes in to ask you to handle defense of her trademark
infringement action -- and tells you to use the brief written by one
of your competitors, which she plucked off the Net and now
plunks down on your desk, as the starting point for your own
work.       
<P>
     Predictions, as I said, are tricky, and I am sure that many
of you think there is much more, or much less, going on here than
I have suggested.  In the spirit of the new technological age, I
welcome your comments or thoughts on the above, or on any of
the topics I treat in future columns (or those I should be paying
more attention to), which can be sent to me by email at Lexis
Counsel Connect (or at dpost@eff.org on the Internet).

The Internet's phenomenal growth may be due in large measure to
certain of its rather unusual features.  First, unlike your office
network (which requires the installation of special cables),
ordinary telephone lines can be used for the links among Internet
computers.  Second, the Internet's common language -- the
"Internet Protocol" that allows each computer on the network to
transmit information to any other computer and to act on the
messages it receives -- is non-proprietary and publicly available
(again, in contrast to the proprietary software that controls
operations on your LAN).

     Most people imagine the Supreme Court as an institution of
robes, velvet curtains, and ceiling-high bookcases--a institution that
sometimes seems bent on preserving vestiges of the Nineteenth
Century.
<P>
     But within the court's walls, the electronic age is altering
the way the court's work is done.  I'm not talking about Lexis or
Westlaw, but something that sounds more mundane on the surface
but which is probably more revolutionary over the long term:
electronic mail.
<P>
     I got a glimpse of this last  year, when I clerked for Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Several times each day a message would
arrive from one of the other clerks over the court's internal e-mail
system, of the "Has anyone worked on a cert petition raising a
Penry claim arising out of voluntary intoxication?" variety.
Usually, I had nothing to say in response to such queries, although
sometimes I could pass along a purely "informational" reply ("see
Smith v. Texas, No. 93-1234, January 17th conference"). If I was
feeling more expansive, or if the subject were one in which I was
particularly interested, or if I simply felt that I needed a break
from my work, I might take a few minutes to compose a more
thoughtful response ("Forget voluntary intoxication as a basis for
a Penry claim; take a look at the majority opinion in Johnson v.
Texas, where the Court discussed the scope of Penry and . . .").
And if I were interested in the question raised but couldn't then
take the time away from whatever it was that I was then working
on, I could always wait until I had a few minutes to spare, take a
quick look at what had crossed the network, and add a few words
if I felt that I had anything interesting to say.
<P>
     Multiply by 40 people my experience there, and you have
a pretty rich conversation going on, and one that is impossible to
imagine in any other medium. The e-mail system became an
indispensable part of day-to-day work at the court--one that, for
me, and for many of the clerks, added immeasurably to the
richness of the experience of working at the court. 
<P>
     What is it about electronic mail that arouses so much
passion? Few people can work up much excitement about, say,
their fax machines, or word processing software, or on-line legal
research--even those who use them on a daily basis and could not
imagine working without them. These are all handy tools to get the
job done, sure, but not a whole lot more than that.
<P>
     But electronic mail? Randomly select 50 acquaintances or
colleagues of yours, put them in a room together, and start talking
about e-mail. I can almost guarantee you that one of them, at least,
will turn out to be not only a committed user but a true devotee,
a convert to a new medium, someone who has "gotten the bug."
<P>
     Why this enthusiasm--exhilaration, even--about what is,
after all, nothing more than a means of sending a message (or
computer file) from one computer to another across a network? 
<P>
     Having used e-mail in three very different institutional
contexts over the past couple of years--as an associate at a large
law firm (Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington, D.C.), as
a clerk at the Supreme Court, and as a member of the faculty at
Georgetown University--I have seen that certain tasks can be
accomplished more quickly and more efficiently using e-mail than
with its main competitors in the workplace: handwritten or typed
communication delivered by hand, mail, or fax machine, or verbal
communication by telephone. Telephone tag, for example, which
can be anything from a minor annoyance to a major headache, is
virtually eliminated by the use of e-mail, as anyone who has ever
tried to schedule a meeting among a dozen or so people can
readily testify.
<P>
     But while these efficiency gains are real and important,
e-mail is much more than just a better and faster way to do the
things (like scheduling meetings) that we've always done.
Something deeper is at work here: a qualitative change in the way
that information is shared within institutions and the way that
collaborative work proceeds. It is these more fundamental effects
that I believe are responsible for the intensity of the reaction of
e-mail's adherents.
<P>
     Take the experience at the Supreme Court, which illustrates
how e-mail's special characteristics <A HREF="/pub/Publications/David_Post/HTML/virt_cooler_side.html">
[See sidebar]</A> can fundamentally alter the character of communication 
and work within institutions<A NAME="CONTD">.</A>
<P>
     The process of scanning queries and posting one's
thoughts undoubtedly saved prodigious amounts of time by
allowing you to tap into the knowledge and experience that your
colleagues carry around in their heads (the "wetware" database),
which greatly enriches the information you can bring to bear on
any particular problem. And in my experience, the value of the
information obtained always outweighed the relatively trivial
costs incurred to obtain it. 
<P>
     But there was great value in this process that had nothing
to do with the amount of time saved. Instead of seeing "nine
little law firms" at the court, everyone--even non-participants
watching the discussions flow across the network--begins to
perceive the outlines of a single collegial institution. Each
reply that circulated--especially the many that began with the
equivalent of "Funny you should ask; I've been thinking about
this question too, and . . ."--subtly and even subconsciously
reinforced a notion that is easy to lose sight of in any large
institution: that we're all in this thing together, participating
in a single organizational endeavor with at least some common goals
and purposes.
<P>
     People have many reasons for participating in this kind
of electronic dialogue (or multi-logue?): a sincere desire to be
helpful to others, a little egotism, perhaps, or the knowledge
that you will need a reciprocal helping hand yourself at some
point in the future. Most important is something simpler, I
think: Many of us simply enjoy this kind of informal
conversation with our colleagues. It is the "virtual water
cooler," an electronic gathering of your coworkers conversing
about questions of mutual interest. Indeed, this kind of contact
helps to define our coworkers as colleagues, helping to set a
tone of collegiality that can be difficult to achieve in any other
way, given the stresses and often overwhelming time constraints
in the modern workplace.
<P>
     At Wilmer, Cutler, too, a similar kind of firmwide query
was common, with questions such as: "Has anyone had any
experience arguing before Judge X?"; "Does anybody know
anything about Virginia's new limited liability company
statute?"; "Does anyone have a good model escrow agreement I
can look at?" As at the court, a wealth of useful information
was uncovered in this way.
<P>
     But here too, much more than efficient
information-gathering was taking place. For example, in
connection with a negotiation training session a colleague and I
were planning, we broadcast a message outlining a "prisoner's
dilemma" situation and asking anyone interested to give us their
views on the "correct" strategy. We were inundated with dozens
of replies, all from extremely busy people who nonetheless were
interested enough in the problem to spend a few minutes
thinking about it and putting a paragraph together. In fact, a
spirited debate ensued for several days -- --so much so that we
ended up scheduling a lunch where people could discuss the
issues raised face-to-face and in "real time."
<P>
     This may seem like a small, even trivial, incident -- but
given the paucity of opportunities to engage intellectually with
most of your coworkers at a large law firm, it was anything but.
Opportunities to make this kind of contact with colleagues are
becoming scarcer as institutions become larger and more
dispersed and the pressures of the profession intensify, but it is
through these contacts that an institution becomes more than
simply a collection of individuals who happen to be sitting in the
same building or getting their paycheck from the same source.
E-mail has a unique power to connect people together by
allowing a running dialogue in which all can participate when
and only when they choose, at their own pace, in their own
fashion--all without taking more than a couple of minutes from
the more "serious" tasks in which they are engaged.  It's a lot
of bang for a relatively small buck.
<P>
     Several years ago, a woman who worked in the
accounting department at Wilmer, Cutler, having heard that I
was something of an opera fanatic, came into my office to talk
about music. She had just heard her first opera, and was
bursting with excitement. After we talked for a while, I became
almost envious--that she had all of this wonderful music to look
forward to, that she had yet to experience the exquisite thrill of
hearing La Boheme, and Rosenkavalier, and Otello, etc. for the
first time. As one who has gotten the e-mail bug, I feel much
the same way when I meet people who have not yet been "e-mail
enabled"--you've got something very interesting indeed to look 
forward to.

<H3>SIDEBAR:  THE KEY FEATURES OF E-MAIL SYSTEMS</H3>

<I>American Lawyer</I>, November 1994<BR>
<A HREF="/homes/post.html">David G. Post</A>
<BR><HR><BR>

<OL>
<LI> E-mail (shorthand for electronic mail), unlike the telephone, is 
"asynchronous": sender and recipient do not need to be "on the line" at 
the same time. Thus, an e-mail message, sent
from X to Y, can be effective even though Y may be talking on
the telephone, at a meeting out of the office, or home sick at the
moment X sends the message; Y can read the message whenever
he is ready. At the moment Y reads the message, in most e-mail
systems an electronic "receipt" can be returned to X, letting her
know when the message was opened -- --and, perhaps more
importantly, that it had not been opened prior to that time (a
crucial feature for time-sensitive information).

<LI> E-mail is a "broadcast" medium, allowing you to take a
single message and send it to any number of recipients, e.g., the
specific colleagues with whom you are working on a project, or all
members of a pre-existing group, such as all law clerks, all
members of the banking group, or all partners.

<LI> E-mail uniquely combines the immediacy of
instantaneous transmission with a kind of nonintrusiveness, by
giving the recipient of a message control over both the timing of
the response and the duration of the interaction. A telephone call
catches the recipient unawares, and implicitly announces "I'm
ready to talk to you about something, here's what it is, tell me --
right now -- what you think of what I am saying." E-mail, by contrast,
allows recipients to spend as little, or as much, time thinking about
and composing a response as they see fit.

<LI> Unlike most written communication, e-mail is perceived
as an informal medium. Many people who labor mightily over
their own written communications to strike just the "right" tone
and to eliminate all errors and possible ambiguities -- and who
therefore often avoid written communication unless it is
absolutely required -- think nothing of dashing off an e-mail with
typographical mistakes, sentence fragments, and the like in
response to a colleagues' question or comment.

<H2>Encryption -- It's Not Just for Spies Anymore</H2>

<I>American Lawyer</I>, December 1994<BR>
<A HREF="/homes/post.html">David G. Post</A>
<BR><HR><BR>
<A HREF="/pub/Publications/David_Post/crypto_not_just_spies_post.article">

<BR><HR><BR>

     Computer programmer Phil Zimmerman has probably done more to open up 
the Internet than all of Al Gore's minions combined -- and the government 
has rewarded him by initiating a criminal investigation.<P>
     
     Zimmerman is the developer of a computer program known as PGP -- for 
"Pretty Good Privacy."  PGP is an encryption program -- software that 
lets you scramble any digital file (that these days can be a legal 
memorandum, a computer program, the Jurassic Park video, or Dylan's 
latest CD) in such a way that it can be reconstituted only by those
possessing the digital equivalent of the decoder ring. 
<A HREF="/pub/Publications/David_Post/HTML/crypto_spies_side.html">
[See sidebar]</A><A NAME="CONTD">.</A><P>

     You would be forgiven for thinking that encryption technology is of 
interest only to spies and counter-spies. Forgiven, but incorrect; in 
fact, encryption technology is about to make its way to your desktop.<P>
     
     The Internet has, as I noted in an earlier column, enormous 
potential as an electronic marketplace, a place where buyers and sellers 
of information in digital form can interact and consummate transactions. 
But that potential remains largely unrealized; the Internet has not yet 
become a major factor in the commercial world, a major venue for trade
of any kind. <P>
     
     There are many reasons for that; transmission rates, for example, 
are still slow enough so that I can run down to my local video store to 
pick up Jurassic Park in less time than it would take to download it from
the Net. <P>
     
     But even when the transmission rate problem is solved, commerce 
faces a perhaps more fundamental obstacle. The Internet today looks a lot 
like the Wild West:  dazzling, thrilling to ride through, unlimited in 
potential -- but fundamentally lawless, a small pocket of anarchy in an 
otherwise regimented world. For many people -- myself included -- that is 
one of the Internet's peculiar charms. But lawlessness does have its
drawbacks. Travelers on the Internet are a bit like travelers on a 
stagecoach through the Dakota territory; their property may be subject to 
appropriation at any time without their consent.<P>
     
     The technology required to intercept anything transmitted over the 
Net, or to gain access to any file residing on any computer with a direct 
hook-up to the Internet, is widely available. And to make matters worse, 
while interception may in some circumstances be illegal -- subject, for 
example, to the Electronic Communication Protection Act's prohibition 
against opening electronic mail directed to others -- legal remedies against
wrongdoers are uncertain at best. It can be prodigiously difficult to 
associate a stream of 1's and 0's -- and remember, the only thing
actually travelling on the Internet is a stream of 1's and 0's -- with 
any particular individual. With impersonation and anonymity this easy to 
achieve, you may often be unable to determine who was responsible for any
particular wrongful action or to bring any remedy to bear against them.
     
     As a place to carry on commerce, this resembles a flea market in the 
early days of Dodge City:  there are few laws to appeal to if someone 
walks over and grabs something off your table, and even if there were, 
everybody here -- not just the bad guys -- wears a mask.
If you want people to buy your products, this is hardly the environment 
you would choose to display your wares. If the Net is going to
become a place where commerce can flourish -- where money and other 
(intellectual) property can actually change hands, where confidential
information and documents can be exchanged -- users need to have more 
assurance that some degree of security for their property, and
authentication of individual identity, has been achieved. <P>
     
     In previous epochs of human history, people looked to the law to 
solve this problem -- Wyatt Earp cleaning up Dodge City or, more
generally, some institutional structure emerging to define and enforce 
property, contract, and personal rights in the new jurisdiction. But the 
Net may be a good deal harder for Marshal Earp to get control over
than Dodge City was. Whose law, for example, is the Marshall going to 
apply when an unauthorized copy of a file stored on a computer in 
California is posted on a bulletin board in Finland, as a result of 
instructions received from a computer in Japan, from which the file is 
downloaded to a Brazilian computer for distribution by e-mail to a 
variety of Net addresses worldwide?  And, assuming that the Marshall is 
persuaded that this is indeed "unlawful" activity, how will the perpetrators
be identified?  And even if this chain of events can be traced to 
individual machines -- a task that even unsophisticated "hackers" can
make exceedingly difficult -- how will the Marshall identify the people 
standing behind those machines (let alone assert personal jurisdiction 
over them)?<P>
     
     Enter Phil Zimmerman and his Pretty Good Privacy. We, as lawyers, 
may at times forget that legal protection is not the only form of
protection on which people can rely. Think of encryption as the ultimate 
form of self-help, a way both to keep your property secure and to
verify the identity of the person at the other end of your transaction 
without the need for the intervention of the lawman. <P>
     
     Using a program like PGP, I can send you a file with complete 
security that you, and only you, will be able to make any use of it
whatsoever; even if it is intercepted, it is of absolutely no value to 
the interceptor. Even better, I can simply make the file available 
somewhere on the Internet (for a price, if I choose) in encrypted form, 
secure in the knowledge that anyone who comes along and downloads it 
cannot use it without my authorization. And keeping in mind that these
files can be video or audio performances, books, videogames -- anything 
that can exist in digital form and therefore can be transmitted over the 
Net -- the commercial significance of encryption -- perhaps even the
commercial necessity of encryption -- starts to come into focus. <P>
     
     This security function might be enough to make encryption an 
important commercial force over the next few years. But there's more.
Encryption also allows me to verify the identity of individuals with whom 
I am communicating over the Net. <P>
     
     How?  Here's the true beauty of public-key encryption systems (see 
sidebar): there is only one person who can encrypt a file that is
decrypt-able with Al Gore's "public key," and that is the possessor of Al 
Gore's private key. So, if I receive an encrypted email message that I 
can decrypt with Gore's public key, I can relatively safely presume that it
came from Gore himself; because Gore need never reveal his private key to 
anyone at any time, the risk that someone has appropriated his private 
key is manageably small -- about the same risk I run if I were to hear 
the Vice President's voice over the telephone and presume that he is 
speaking of his own free will, notwithstanding the fact that someone
may be holding a gun to his head to make him say the words that I'm hearing. 
<P>     
     Taken together, these two features -- security and authentication -- 
may well make encryption technology a critical tool for commercial 
interactions over the Internet. All aspects of the interaction -- the 
confidential messages regarding negotiation positions, the relevant 
purchase and sale documents, and the goods themselves -- can avail 
themselves of this new medium without compromising basic security.<P>
   <P>  
     So if encryption is this wonderful, why is the government, as I 
noted at the beginning of this column, investigating whether PGP's
developer should be thrown in jail?  Could it be because the regulators 
cannot abide the idea that people can get along just fine without them?  
Perhaps -- but to give this question its due will require a more careful
look at the threat that encryption may pose for traditional government 
functions -- a topic I will address in <A HREF="/pub/Publications/David_Post/HTML/crypto_v_gatorclip.html">
next month's column</A>.

<H3>SIDEBAR:  HOW ENCRYPTION SYSTEMS WORK</H3>

<I>American Lawyer</I>, October 1994<BR>
<A HREF="/homes/post.html">David G. Post</A>
<BR><HR><BR>

     The code you may have used to encode
messages to your friends in elementary school
-- A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, etc. -- is an example
of a single-key encryption system: the same
"algorithm" is used by the sender to encrypt
the message and by the recipient to decrypt
it. Many of the enormously powerful encryption
programs are single-key systems (with far, far
more complicated coding algorithms, needless
to say).<P>

     Single-key systems, however, have one
large drawback:  because the sender and the
recipient have to first agree on what code
they are using -- i.e., they have to have an
uncoded conversation during which the code is
exchanged -- the system is only as secure as
the medium in which that prior communication
takes place. That is, if you and your friend
want to exchange coded notes in class, you'll
have to meet in a corner of the playground to
get the system rolling. You certainly can't
send your friend a note in class explaining
the code you want to use, because then all
your classmates will be able to decrypt your
messages; if that channel of communication
were secure enough for you to use for
transmitting the code, why do you need a code
at all (other than to have a little fun)?<P>

     PGP, on the other hand, is a public key
system. The program generates two codes, code
A and code B, for each user. A file encrypted
in code A can only be decrypted with code B
(and vice versa), and it is impossible to
derive code A from code B or vice versa --
trust me on this (though readers wanting more
information can send me an e-mail). Code B
becomes your public key; think of it like your
telephone number -- you give it away,
publicize it widely, allow people to put it in
publicly-available directories, etc. Then, if
I want to send you a file that only you can
decrypt, all I need do is look up your
telephone number (i.e., public key) and use
that to encrypt the file; that file can then
be de-crypted only by the person possessing
code A (which you have kept secret from the
world and which I, therefore, need not ever
have seen). Unlike single-key systems, you and
I need never have previously communicated for
the system to provide complete security, and
therefore there is no need for any secure
channel over which codes can be exchanged.

      Remember John Gotti? No longer merely a "reputed" mob kingpin, 
Gotti was sentenced to life imprisonment after his conviction on 
racketeering and murder charges. It may be too much to suggest that Gotti 
was brought down by an FBI alligator clip, but it is true that the case 
against Gotti was bolstered, perhaps decisively, by recordings of 
conversations between Gotti and his compatriots obtained by tapping the
telephones at a downtown Manhattan social club.<P>
      
      Keep in your mind for the moment the image of John Gotti, plotting 
some evil deed with an FBI agent listening in and taking down every word.

Last month I noted</A> that "public key encryption" programs--software 
that enables you to scramble a digital file so that the file cannot be 
read by anyone but the intended recipient, even if you and the recipient 
had not had any prior contact with one another have recently become 
widely available. <P>
      
      Because encryption may be the only way to provide true security for 
property (intellectual property, credit card numbers, or more 
sophisticated versions of "electronic cash," and the like) placed in the 
stream of electronic commerce on the Internet, I suggested that 
encryption may turn out to be the philosopher's stone for the 
twenty-first century. I suggested that it may be the key to unlocking the 
Internet's vast commercial prospects, and that encryption technology may 
spread quickly beyond the banking sector, where it is already widely 
used, to help create a broader electronic marketplace for a wide variety 
of goods and services.<P>
      
      That is all good news. In addition, encryption has the power to 
keep Big Brother at bay; to allow political dissidents in, say, China, a 
new and more secure means to disseminate information freely to the 
outside world.<P>
      
      But there is bad news as well. Now that ordinary everyday 
communication can easily be placed in digital form (such as an electronic 
mail message or a conversation on a digital telephone) and then converted 
into an unreadable scrambled mess with a few clicks of the mouse on a home
computer, what happens to the Alligator Clip that Felled John Gotti ? 
What is the point of tapping a wire when the information coming through 
the wire is irretrievably garbled?<P>
      
      The FBI and others have raised the specter of a world where not 
only political dissidents but terrorists, assassins, drug kingpins, and 
the like are all communicating freely over the Information Superhighway 
without fear of being overheard; a world where wiretapping is no longer a 
useful weapon in the law enforcement arsenal, and where crime suddenly 
becomes more difficult to uncover and punish. "If you think crime is bad
now," FBI Director Louis Freeh has warned, "just wait and see what 
happens if the FBI one day soon is no longer able to conduct 
court-approved electronic surveillance."<P>
      
      The government does not take this threat to its law enforcement 
powers lightly, and has, not surprisingly, been trying to devise ways to 
restrain the use of encryption software. Indeed, encryption has been the 
focus of the government's first real efforts to exercise control over 
activities on the Internet, and represents the first battleground in what 
may become a fascinating, and possibly quite nasty, war to assert 
jurisdiction over this new territory.<P>
      
      First, the federal government classifies encryption software as a 
"munition" under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation Act (ITAR). 
Like an F-15 attack plane, encryption software cannot be exported from 
the United States without a special state department license, which is 
next-to-impossible to obtain for the more powerful encryption systems.<P>
      
      Second, and more notoriously, the government is trying to promote 
adoption of an encryption system that, conveniently enough, has a "back 
door" through which the government can continue to monitor otherwise 
"secure" conversations. <P>
      
      With its infamous "Clipper Chip" initiative, the Clinton 
administration licensed the manufacture of a special chip, incorporating 
the government's own (classified) encryption system, that could be placed 
into telephones, computers, and other communication devices. This system 
differs fundamentally from "public key" systems. It is an "escrowed 
encryption system" under which the government retains, in escrow, the
"keys" that can unscramble encrypted files, keys that can to be released 
to law enforcement officials upon an appropriate showing of need.<P>
      
      Faced with a choice between an escrowed encryption system, with 
agencies of the United States government as key-holding escrow agents, 
and an equally powerful public key system that is secure from all 
eavesdroppers, most American consumers--let alone foreign consumers, or, 
for that matter, terrorists--would probably opt for the latter. Do we really
expect, as Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has asked, to be able to "sell 
our phones and computers abroad with a note saying, 'All encrypted 
communications sent on this equipment are guaranteed to be available to 
the U.S. government upon its secret request'"? <P>
      
      Skipjack/Clipper, in other words, would appear to be a nonstarter 
in a truly competitive encryption market. How, then, to foster widespread 
use of the Clipper chip (or other devices implementing an escrowed system)?
      <P>
      The government has not--yet--tried to mandate use of the 
Skipjack/Clipper system or outlaw use of competing encryption systems. 
Instead, the original Clipper proposal attempted to establish Clipper as 
a de facto standard in the marketplace, without, quite, going so far as 
to mandate its use, by providing that exporters of machines incorporating 
the Clipper Chip will receive automatic export authorization, and by 
requiring the government to buy only machines that use the chip.
      <P>
      In this battle over the future of encryption, however, the state is 
in retreat. Export control has perhaps slowed, but hardly stopped, the 
spread of public key encryption. Several months ago a copy of PGP, a 
powerful public key encryption program I discussed in last month's 
column, was placed on an Internet-accessible computer, from where it 
could be copied by anyone in the world with a modem and access to the 
global network. It is estimated--nobody knows for sure--that several hundred
thousand copies are now in circulation around the world.
      <P>
      And Clipper, under relentless attack from an alliance of civil 
libertarians fearful of giving the government Orwellian eavesdropping 
powers and the software industry looking to exploit a multi-billion 
dollar market for encryption products, has hardly fared much better. The 
federal government has apparently abandoned the Clipper initiative, at 
least with respect to computer (though not voice) communications, and is "re-
evaluating" the need for an encryption system requiring government escrow 
agents.<P>
      
      This all has the flavor of locking the barn door after the horses 
have left. Although the government initiated a criminal investigation of 
Phil Zimmerman, PGP's author, over his part in the illegal export of PGP, 
nothing the government can now do will put the genie back in the bottle. 
Not in a world where a single copy of a program can generate thousands, 
or hundreds of thousands, of additional copies in a matter of minutes. It is
probably not even too much to suggest that the very notion of "export 
control" on the Internet, where geographical boundaries have absolutely 
no significance, and where one computer looks exactly like another 
regardless of geographical location, has a faintly ludicrous tinge to it.
<P>      
      This is not to say that the encryption battle is over. Far from it; 
the government has many, many other weapons in its arsenal. For example, 
talk of outlawing unescrowed encryption systems--a move that would raise 
rather profound constitutional and ethical questions--has been heard in 
the land. We shall see. It is on the one hand hard to see how anything 
short of that will give the government what it apparently seeks: assured 
access to all electronic communications. But it is just as hard to see how
even that drastic step will provide such assurance, given the already 
widespread availability of unescrowed encryption programs. A difficult 
dilemma, to be sure, but one that perhaps raises the possibility that the 
government, whatever its wishes may be, may have to content itself with a 
less vigorous role in policing cyberspace.

<DD>File containing NIST's August 1991 notice requesting 
    comments on a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
    Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This proposed standard
    specifies a public- key based digital signature algorithm (DSA)
    appropriate for Federal digital signature applications. The proposed
    DSS uses a public key to verify to a recipient the integrity of data and
    the identity of the sender of the data. The DSS can also be used by a
    third party to ascertain the authenticity of a signature and the data
    associated with it. 
<DT><a href="fips_dss_proposed.standard"><B>fips_dss_proposed.standard</B></a>
<DD>File containing August 1991 announcement by 
    NIST of the proposed Digital Signature Standard (DSS). This standard 
    specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which can be used to 
    generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect 
    unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of 
    the user who generates the signature. In addition, the recipient of 
    signed data can use a digital signature in proving to a third party that 
    the signature was in fact generated by the signer of the data. This is 
    known as nonrepudiation since the signer of data cannot, at a later time, 
    repudiate the signature.

<DD>CA Assembly Bill 295 would &quot;extend&quot; child porn and
    obscenity statutes to cover the Internet &amp; other media. As currently 
    defined in existing statutes, this material is *already illegal* on 
    the Net, and offline too, all over the US, so there's not much point 
    to the bill. The definition used is that provided by the US Supreme 
    Court, so bill would make a much better statute that most state laws 
    on this topic. Additionally, it provides liability protection for 
    system operators, an almost unique, but very necessary, feature of 
    this sort of law. Bill passed the Assembly, and has been sitting in 
    the CA Senate Judiciary Committee for many months.

<DD>House Bill 1048 defines &quot;obscene&quot; as the less specific 
    &quot;harmful to minors&quot; and barrs distribution of such material online. As 
    with other such laws, and the national Communications Decency 
    Amendment, the OK law, passed April 1995, is either completely 
    pointless (obscenity is already illegal offline or online), or 
    unconstitutional (as an attempt to broaden the definition of obscenity 
    to include constitutionally-protected material).

<DD>Oregon House Bill 2310. Creates crime of
    electronically furnishing obscene material to minors. Punishes by
    maximum one year imprisonment, $10,000 fine or both. This bill is
    completely redundant, as the proscribed activity is *already* illegal
    under both state and federal law. The entire purpose of this bill is
    to impose felony-level liability on system operators for crimes they
    did not commit. Early in 1995, the state House Judiciary
    Committee reported unfavorably on this bill. No news since then. It 
    may well have passed or died by now.

<DD>Senate bill 1067, singed into law May 1995, like clone 
    legislation in Montana, Kansas and elsewhere expands definition of 
    &quot;child pornography&quot; to cover obscene faked child porn (pointless - 
    it's already illegal) and non-obscene art that does not feature real 
    children at all (unconstitutional - such art is protected under the 
    First Amendment).

<DD>House version of SB238 (below).
<DT><a href="fl_sb238_95.bill"><B>fl_sb238_95.bill</B></a>
<DD>FL Senate Bill 238, the &quot;Pornography Victims' Compensation Act&quot;, create
    private cause of action for victims of crimes supposedly related to
    pornography, including Florida's computer porn statute (itself a terrible
    piece of work). Florida (hypocrically, given it's well-deserved
    reputation as flesh-haven for horny college students during spring 
    break) is well known for attacking sexually explicit or even just 
    subjectively &quot;yucky&quot; or &quot;gross&quot; material, and prosecuting
    nationally-acclaimed artists for &quot;obscenity&quot;. SB 238 is very disturbing
    - any rape victim could sue you for all you're worth if you happen to
    create disturbing art, even though there would be no connection of any
    kind between your art and the victim's misfortune. This is a
    recipe for legal mahem. The bill appears to be moribund as of May 1995 -
    as are it's companion bills HB 13 (House version) and SB 76 (Senate 
    bill to redefine child porn, etc.) - but be on the look out. This 
    legislation could be back next session. Familiarize yourself with it 
    now and draft responses early.
<DT><a href="fl_sb76_95.bill"><B>fl_sb76_95.bill</B></a>
<DD>Apparently-dead bill to redefine &quot;child pornography&quot; to 
    include (already illegal) obscene works that do no feature actual children
    and (constitutionally protected) non-obscene works such as art, also 
    created without the abuse of any real child.

<DD>Senate Bill 838, signed into law July 1995, raises 
    many questions regarding several aspects of this legislation, such as 
    system operator liability, and minors masquerading as adults. The 
    statute may also conflict with other state's laws. While the bill's 
    intent seems lofty, and it will probably protect a handful of children 
    from some rather noxious sexual advances, the wisdom of trying to 
    handle this problem at fifty different state levels, is questionable. 
    The ACLU finds it to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in 
    several ways, and has warned that it could be used by religious 
    extremist prosectors to go after disseminators of sex education 
    materials. The real danger here is that theocratic organizations, 
    smelling an easy victory, may introduce follow-on legislation next 
    session to restrict indecency and other constitutionally protected 
    speech online. Be on the lookout.
<DT><a href="il_sb747_95_aclu.analysis"><B>il_sb747_95_aclu.analysis</B></a>
<DD>ACLU attacks SB747, an over-broad waste of
    time and effort that in the end holds system operators liable for the
    actions of users over whom they have no control.

<DD>CA Assembly Bill 295 would &quot;extend&quot; child porn and
    obscenity statutes to cover the Internet &amp; other media. As currently 
    defined in existing statutes, this material is *already illegal* on 
    the Net, and offline too, all over the US, so there's not much point 
    to the bill. The definition used is that provided by the US Supreme 
    Court, so bill would make a much better statute that most state laws 
    on this topic. Additionally, it provides liability protection for 
    system operators, an almost unique, but very necessary, feature of 
    this sort of law. Bill passed the Assembly, and has been sitting in 
    the CA Senate Judiciary Committee for many months.

<DD>Washington (state) governor vetoed this bill, which
    targets online material deemed &quot;harmful to minors&quot;. Senate Bill 5466 was 
    vetoed May 1995. State legislature has threatened to try to over-ride 
    the veto, but has not done so, to our knowledge, as of June 1996. 
    BEWARE! This bill or something like it will probably be back in 
    late 1996 or in 1997, perhaps targeting material &quot;obscene as to minors&quot; 
    or &quot;indecent&quot; (or some other meaningless, undefined &quot;term of art&quot; that 
    targets Constitutionally-protected expression). Bill was re-introduced 
    as SB6079, and nearly passed again. Unlike many of the various net
    censorship laws, this one was an attempt to replace an already existing
    state law on sexually explicit material, that had been ruled 
    unconstitutional. (Version of text here is that sent to governor
    for veto, by both Houses. Original date of introduction of first version
    was in Jan. 1995.)

<DD>The New York State Assembly and Senate have passed 
    a bill (AB3967/SB210-D) that would make online service providers liable 
    for the content on their networks. The bill would prohibit the knowing 
    &quot;dissemination&quot; of material that depicts &quot;actual or simulated nudity,[or] 
    sexual conduct&quot;, that is &quot;harmful to minors&quot; and is communicated to a 
    minor through a &quot;computer communications system&quot;. Additionally, S.210-D 
    would make it a felony to intentionally engage a minor in an explicit, 
    sexually-oriented communication via a computer or on-line service, and 
    then make contact with the minor. It provides for penalties of up to 
    seven years in prison for certain offenses. If Gov. Pataki signs this 
    bill into law it could impose significant burdens upon Internet Access 
    businesses to screen the Internet for their users, drive Internet content 
    businesses from New York state, and chill free speech. The bill is vague 
    and over-broad, may force service providers to become censors, ignores 
    existing parental control technology &amp; services, and lumps most 
    responsbility on to the shoulders of service providers. As of Feb. 7: 
    the bill is being altered due to pressure from the Net, to prevent 
    Internet providers' liability for users' actions. Keep the pressure up. 
    State Sen. William R. Sears is to introduce the chapter amendment, and 
    the legislature is asking the Governor to NOT sign the bill as it 
    stands, even though it was already passed.

<DD>Connecticut state bill HB 6883, introduced March 2 
    1995 and signed into law apparently only weeks after introduction. Would 
    make it a crime to send email &quot;with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm 
    another person.&quot; Get in an argument? You're could go to prison on 
    felony charges. Few laws ever passed anywhere in this country could 
    be so incredibly dirt-stupid.

<DD>Maryland state senate bill 22: legislation to
    criminalize what is already a crime (distribution of child pornography via
    computer). Still pending as of our latest news, but may have passed 
    or died by now (June 1996). SB22 prohibits (redundantly) online child 
    porn, as well as sexual solicitation of a minor by computer.
    As with the Illinois bill, this appears to mean well, but, as usual,
    creates legal mayhem due to inconsistency with other statutes, and poses
    legal threats for innocent access providers. Also this bill, like a
    similar Kansas law, probably unconstitutionally redefines &quot;child porn&quot; to
    include even completely fake computer-generated art, as well as actual
    child porn and already-legally-obscene fake child porn of the hardcore 
    sort. Creates major sysop liability. Though high-minded, the law is very
    poorly thought out and dangerous for all system operators. If one of your
    users does something Maryland prosecutors don't like, you could go to
    prison for it.
<DT><a href="md_sb22_95_aclu.analysis"><B>md_sb22_95_aclu.analysis</B></a>
<DD>ACLU attacks SB22, an over-broad waste of
    time and effort that in the end holds system operators liable for the
    actions of users over whom they have no control.

<blockquote><blockquote>

<p>The following text is excerpted from the book <i><a
href="index.html">Anarchy Online</a></i>, to be published by
HarperCollins during 1996. The text is copyright 1996 by <a
href="charles_platt.html">Charles Platt</a>.

<p>Book production tends to be a slow process. Since I have 
never been a patient person, and since I own the electronic 
rights, I have decided to circulate portions of my book 
online. 

<p>The text will be divided into two large sections, the first 
dealing with popular fears about netcrime, the second 
focusing on net freedoms and the netporn controversy. I will 
not be circulating the first section online, since it is less 
topical. I have divided the second section into seven parts 
that will be placed on various web sites. 

<p>I received help from many people while I was working on this 
project. Full acknowledgments and thanks will be included 
when the book finally appears.

<p><b>Brief summary of this section:</b>

<p>     How can children be prevented from viewing unsuitable 
material online? Large Internet service providers such as 
Compuserve or AOL have tried to offer limited access, but 
AOL, in particular, was singled out as a pedophile playground 
by Barry Crimmins, an anti-porn activist who testified before 
a Senate subcommittee. 
<p>     Some netspeech may seem shocking (see samples, below) 
but we should be careful to distinguish fantasy from reality. 
Children are actually safer online than in any realworld 
environment. 
<p>     Usenet groups catering to pedophiles are offensive to 
many people, and a new federal law was proposed to expand the 
definition of child pornography. By using anonymous 
remailers, however, kiddieporn fans are already violating 
existing laws with impunity, which suggests that new laws are 
not the answer. 
<p>     Can filters such as Surfwatch work effectively? Will a 
web-site rating scheme (now endorsed by Microsoft) make any 
difference? Can the Guardian Angels clean up the net? 
<p>     In every case, easy answers turn out to be inadequate. 
<p>     It may be impossible to control net access effectively.

     Community Standards 

     Amateur Action, the adult bulletin board run by Robert 
and Carleen Thomas and immortalized by Martin Rimm, was based 
in Milpitas, California. For several years it served users 
who were mostly located in that general area. 
     In 1993 a postal inspector named David Dirmeyer in 
Memphis, Tennessee joined the BBS under the pseudonym "Lance 
White." Using a long-distance phone connection he downloaded 
a bunch of pictures, then handed them to a local federal 
prosecutor. Ultimately a jury decided that the pictures 
violated local Tennessee community standards, and the 
Thomases were sentenced to three years in jail. 
     The Supreme Court has ruled that obscenity is a relative 
concept. The same picture that's legal in San Francisco may 
not be legal in a conservative part of the country where 
different values apply. Maybe there's some sense to this, so 
long as physical objects such as photographs or magazines are 
involved; but online communication shatters geographical 
barriers. A BBS can be accessed by anyone willing to pay 
long-distance phone charges. Usenet is available even more 
easily all over the world. Does this mean that online speech 
must be censored to the point where it will not offend the 
most conservative community on the net? If this isn't 
possible or desirable, must small, communities put up with a 
torrent of salacious material that they find horribly 
offensive? 
     Internet service providers in conservative areas can 
block any Usenet news groups that are known to contain 
explicit material, just as Compuserve chose to block a whole 
class of groups. This will placate some users--but will anger 
others. Even in small-town USA, for every anti-porn activist 
there's at least one person who resents having his decisions 
made for him. 
     The ACLU and the Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF) 
both filed amicus briefs on behalf of Robert and Carleen 
Thomas seeking (unsuccessfully) to overturn the guilty 
verdict. The ACLU made an interesting argument: "Computer 
technology has created new 'communities' or groups of 
individuals who communicate among themselves, sharing 
thoughts, ideas, and values. These communities do not exist 
geographically, but they exist nonetheless. The district 
court should have instructed the jury to apply the standards 
of the community involved, that of the members of the 
Thomases' bulletin board." 
     In other words, forget the whole concept of geography. 
Amateur Action created a new kind of community in which 
pictures that David Dirmeyer downloaded were _not_ obscene. 
In fact, Dirmeyer was an outsider who intruded into this 
community. Since he chose to go poking around there, he had 
only himself to blame if he didn't like what he found. 
     Extending this concept further, large service providers 
such as Prodigy, CompuServe, and America Online (AOL) have 
created cyberspace communities that are just the opposite of 
an adult-oriented BBS. They're designed to be as wholesome, 
safe, and family-oriented as possible. In fact on Prodigy 
subscribers are simply not allowed to use "inappropriate" 
language (such as four-letter words). 
     This seems an excellent answer to the problems of access 
and distribution. A large service provider will even be able 
to allow varying levels of access that can be established by 
a child's parents when the account is opened. Adult chat 
groups can be locked out; in fact, all of Usenet can be 
excluded if necessary. 
     And yet--in practice, this hasn't worked. 
     One problem is that regardless of what people claim they 
want, a lot of them really want to sample some online sex. 
Another problem is that service providers have an incentive 
to make as much money as possible by attracting users of as 
many different ages and tastes as possible--not just a narrow 
special-interest group. Also, censorship is hard to enforce 
when there are hundreds of thousands of users generating 
millions of messages. 
     Consequently, even on a big family-oriented system like 
CompuServe which runs and monitors its own "teen chat" areas, 
you still find adult-style material. The following transcript 
is contributed by a CompuServe user in Canada: 

          Tommy, my 12-year-old brother, is a Compuserve teen 
     chat-forum devotee. We never knew what he was up to with 
     his 12-year-old friend Dave until he accidentally left 
     one of his chat transcripts lying around.

           Sandra:  bye 
                    why did u leave? 
     Tom and Dave:  sorry got fuck someone else to night 

     Should this chat have been censored? Yes, according to 
CompuServe terms of service. But what would censorship 
achieve in this case? If Tom and Dave were stopped from 
indulging in their childhood sex fantasies online, maybe 
they'd get bored and go back to reality. Wouldn't it be more 
hazardous for them to play these roles in the real world, 
with a real fifteen-year-old girl? Online, no one gets 
molested, pregnant, or raped. Doesn't this mean that the 
online environment is actually safer, even if it's 
uncensored?  
 

     Pedophiles' Playground 

     Of course, the situation changes drastically when kids 
are no longer just interacting with other kids but start 
communicating with adults. Bearing in mind that no one knows 
how old you are online, the environment seems to be an ideal 
stalking ground for pedophiles. 
     America Online (AOL) is the largest family-oriented 
service provider, selling itself as a nurturing environment 
for children. AOL has also attracted a lot of publicity for 
installing safeguards against bad behavior. Yet when a 
leading anti-porn crusader had to select a single Internet 
service provider as a nest of child pornography and 
pedophiles, AOL was the one. 
     Barry Crimmins is a left-wing activist who makes a 
modest living doing anti-establishment comedy routines. At 
the same time, Crimmins has also become one of the loudest 
voices denouncing the traffic in online pornography. More 
effectively than any other person he has publicized the dark 
side of AOL and demanded action to protect its young users. 
     Crimmins was sexually abused when he was a child. "My 
sister witnessed my abuse," he says. "Years later I published 
a story about it, and a social worker read it and knew the 
time period and got ahold of me, and in 1989 the person who 
had abused me was arrested and jailed for the third time. 
What he did was rape little boys, and he died in prison in 
1991. He was--I'll just say he was an adult male in my 
babysitter's life." 
     As a result of the case, Crimmins became a contributing 
editor for _Moving Forward,_ a news journal for sexual abuse 
survivors. He started speaking out on the subject. In 1994 he 
learned that child pornography was being "openly traded" on 
America Online. Crimmins became an AOL member, sampled the 
chat rooms for himself, and was horrified by what he found. 
     A few months later he was invited to testify at Senator 
Charles Grassley's hearings on children and netporn. John 
McMickle of The National Law Center for Children and 
Families--the same man who invited (and later disinvited) 
Martin Rimm--picked Crimmins after receiving an endorsement 
for him from the publisher of _Moving Forward_. 
     Crimmins later said he felt terrified speaking at the 
hearings. Still, he made a strong, impassioned speech. "I 
came upon numerous atrocious rooms [on AOL]," he told the 
senators. "Many were obviously created by, and for, 
pedophiles. There were rooms promoting rape, incest, the 
exchange of child pornography, hate crimes, and every 
possible, and in some cases impossible, sexual activity. The 
first time I found the Abuse Survivors' room, it was located 
between a room called 'DadsNDaughtrs' and another entitled 
'lilboypix.'" 
     Like other large service providers, AOL divides its 
system into many different areas. In the "People Exchange" 
area, members can create and name "rooms" where they can 
share messages with anyone else who visits the room after 
being tempted by its name. 
     There are two tiers of rooms: public and private. 
Crimmins used the system for a couple of months before he 
discovered the private tier. AOL offers parents the option of 
making this tier inaccessible for their children, but many 
people fail to do this--because they don't understand how, or 
they don't realize the potential problem, or they forget, or 
they simply don't bother. 
     When Crimmins saw what was going on, he complained to 
the management of AOL. When his complaints seemed to be 
ignored, he created a new online identity for himself as a 
12-year-old and lay in wait for the pedophiles. He didn't 
have to wait long. At the Senate hearings, he claimed he was 
sent more than a thousand pornographic photographs of 
children by people he met online. "At one point," he said, "a 
particularly sick individual sent me (in my guise as a 12-
year-old) so much child pornography that it took eight-and-a-
half hours to download it." 
     Crimmins sent this contraband to AOL and told them they 
should reimburse him for the online charges he incurred while 
receiving it. He received no reply. 
     He felt that the pornography was dangerous for three 
reasons: it was being used to entice children, it encouraged 
adults to think of kids as sex objects, and real children 
were needed in order to create the kiddieporn in the first 
place. "The law of supply and demand is kicking in," he later 
wrote. "The increased demand for child pornography directly 
translates into an increased number of sexually abused 
children. You cannot have child pornography without abused 
children." 
     His testimony received a mixed reception. Civil 
libertarians were angry with him for giving new ammunition to 
decency crusaders. He also annoyed conservatives because on 
topics outside of child pornography, he maintained a 
permissive attitude. At the Senate hearings, for example, he 
endorsed the idea of chat rooms for gay and lesbian teens. 
"I'm concerned about them," he said later. "They're the group 
that has the highest rate of suicide. But Grassley turned 
purple when he heard me say that." 
     Crimmins is a hard-liner on child abuse partly because 
he feels it's not receiving the attention it deserves. "Take 
the Susan Smith case," he says, referring to the Florida 
woman who drowned her two infants. "It may be in _The 
National Enquirer,_ but how much space does _The New York 
Times_ spend on it--especially the fact that her step-father 
sexually abused her for years, and was a senior official in 
Pat Roberson's presidential campaign." Crimmins sighs. 
"There's your family values for you." 
     Is he a Christian? 
     "I have no problems with Jesus, he was a socialist among 
other things, and he wasn't a hypocrite. But I do think that 
Pat Robertson is a hypocrite. And I think that what's going 
on online, unless people of good conscience act, will provide 
the excuse for the Pat Robertsons of this world to destroy 
the whole deal for all of us." 
     According Crimmins, liberals should clean up the net so 
that conservatives don't find an excuse to do it for them--
far more sweepingly. He fully realizes that this doesn't go 
down too well with civil libertarians. "If everyone's worst 
fear comes true," he says, "and Big Brother takes over the 
Internet, I'm certain that people like me will be blamed for 
it." 
     But why did a family-oriented service like AOL become 
such a prime pedophile hangout? Several factors seem to have 
been involved: 
     First, millions of AOL disks distributed through direct 
mail and as inserts in magazines make it easy for anyone, of 
any age, to log on anonymously and receive hours of free 
connect time. 
     Second, the service made access easier than it had ever 
been before. By developing its own point-and-click software, 
AOL became one of the first systems that could be handled by 
naive users ... such as young children. 
     Third, partly because of its free disk-distribution 
scheme, AOL experienced explosive growth, with all the 
problems of management and control that this implies. 
     Crimmins admits that by mid-1995 the service had 
improved its internal security compared with the time when he 
first started monitoring it. "To some extent they've cleaned 
things up," he says. "But at 1:15 AM last night there were 
fourteen private rooms, and I found 'XXfamilyXX' which is an 
incest room, and 'Dad's Home,' same thing. Another room was 
titled 'PbRoEyTgEiEfNs' which, if you read it carefully, says 
'pre-teen boy GIFs.'" (GIF stands for Graphic Image File 
format, the most common way of storing photographs online.) 
     AOL runs a program that vets room names. According to 
one AOL user, the word "boy" has been totally banned, along 
with "girl" and "hacker." But it seems easy enough to fool 
the program by misspelling words, scrambling letters, or 
adding a few X's here and there. In this way, users have 
defeated the scheme just as easily as Robert Carr's Hexon 
Exon program would defeat a federal decency monitoring 
program. 
     Crimmins feels the only answer is better human 
supervision. "AOL claims they are going to have fifty people 
on their staff," he says. "When I first logged on there were 
four people. In those days it was running unchecked. AOL now 
says that 98 percent of the rooms are _not_ related to child 
pornography. Well, all I can say is that last night, 100 
percent of the people who wanted to traffic in child 
pornography found where they wanted to go." 
     America Online has since made further attempts to 
restrict and monitor its members. At the beginning of 
September, 1995, President and CEO Steve Case sent a letter 
to all users asking them to "report any unusual or improper 
behavior that you see immediately. If you're in a chat room, 
notify our Terms of Service advisory unit by using keyword 
GUIDEPAGER. Email, Instant Message, and Message Board 
violations should be reported to keyword TOS." 
     These attempts to protect the innocent may have achieved 
some results but have also caused the inevitable backlash. 
Complaints about AOL tend to be censored by AOL itself, so 
angry users go outside the system and post their rants to 
groups such as alt.censorship on Usenet. Here, a woman who 
works as a prostitute and used the name ACallGirl on AOL 
reported that she was constantly hassled about it. "They even 
went so far as to suggest I not go into the chat rooms. 
Frequently arguments would erupt in chat rooms about my 
name." 
     Maybe this seems reasonable on a family-oriented 
service--except that ACallGirl says that she came across 
other names far worse than hers, including FistFuk, FukU2, 
BitchKillr, BooEatShit, and NiggaKill. 
     Eventually a group of militant AOL members caused such a 
fuss that they provoked an AOL guide into sending them a list 
of recent user names that had been judged acceptable, and 
another list of names that were unacceptable. The lists were 
a rare treat for anyone studying the intricate absurdities of 
censorship:

     Subsequently, it was reported that the guide who sent 
this list was terminated by the service provider. AOL did not 
respond to attempts to confirm or deny this story. 
     Language in AOL chat rooms remains an equally sensitive 
topic. Guides can instantly eject anyone who uses forbidden 
words. The following dialogue was transcribed and circulated 
through the Internet and even earned a mention in _Playboy_

and the :) symbol is meant to suggest that the person using 
it is smiling. 

     SPIDERM540: todd is the REAL problem, you see he has no 
*genitalia*.... asexual...get it? 
     Guide GO: SPIDERM540 vulgarity is a violation of the 
Terms of Service. Please stop NOW.  Read at Keyword TOS. 
     Mary5913: Wait......what was the vulgarity? Can you tell 
us which of Spiderman's words were vulgar? 
     Guide GO: Mary I suggest you go read your Terms of 
Service 
     Stpfljes: may i suggest that you read the constitution 
of the united states of america                                  
     Guide GO: I am just talking about the Terms of Service:) 
     Trout Esq: fascist 
     Stpfljes: which are vague therefore void and 
unenforceable 
     Trout Esq: agreed 
     Guide GO: Not really:) 
     ToddT38799: and we appreciate that but are you 
monitoring conversation.

     SPIDERM540: mary, what's your take on this....tyranny... 
     Stpfljes: marys gone 
     Guide GO: Well I have to be GOing now.  If there are any 
TOS problems and you need a  guide..... Please use Keyword

     Yet according to Barry Crimmins, the real lawbreakers on 
AOL still find ways to do what they want to do. Is it really 
reasonable to expect AOL to maintain total control over 
everything that's said in all its chat rooms? Shouldn't 
parents take some responsibility, especially since AOL has 
made it possible for them to lock out some areas if they will 
just take the trouble to do so? 
     Crimmins disagrees. He points out that child abuse is 
often perpetrated by the parents themselves. 


     Crackdown on Kiddieporn 
 
     If we can't trust parents to protect their children, who 
_can_ we trust? According to Crimmins, the answer is law 
enforcement. "We need more cops on the Internet to enforce 
existing laws against child pornography and stalking, and 
they should be undercover. If they start trying to bust 
people for other reasons I'll be right there with the ACLU. 
Civil liberties are extremely dear to me. But with freedom 
comes responsibility. Nobody has the right to trade pictures 
of an eight-year-old with semen on his or her face. An 
epidemic of child abuse is going to result from this. People 
will say, 'I've thought about it, but I've never thought 
about _doing_ it.'" 
     Pictures, he says, are a stimulus that encourages new 
crime. The FBI seems to agree with him. On September 13th, 
1995, agents raided approximately 120 homes of AOL users 
nationwide. According to a report from Associated Press, 
computer equipment was seized and there were "at least a 
dozen arrests." Other reports stated that AOL had been 
cooperating with the government for two years, supplying 
names and addresses of users suspected of trading child 
pornography and/or luring children. 
     Pam McGraw, a spokesperson for America Online, admitted 
that the service had monitored email and private messages 
exchanged between people in chat rooms. Wasn't this a 
violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act? 
Evidently AOL felt that the law didn't apply to 
communications that never left its own computers. Department 
of Justice guidelines have suggested a similar principle. 
     Attorney General Janet Reno praised the raids in a 
statement that should have warmed Barry Crimmins's heart. "We 
are not going to permit exciting new technology to be misused 
to exploit and injure children," she said. In February, 1996, 
a man in New York state was sentenced to five years in prison 
for sending sexually explicit pictures of children via his 
AOL account. 
     But after all the publicity had died down, what did it 
add up to? According to the Interactive Services Association 
(of which AOL is a member), major internet service providers 
had a total of more than 8 million members when the raids 
took place. Of these users, AOL claimed more than 3 million. 
If child pornography and pedophilia were such a problem on 
AOL, why did a two-year investigation of this huge membership 
base yield only _one dozen_ arrests, with no guarantee that 
these cases would yield convictions? 
     Nationwide there are at least a million cases of sexual 
abuse of children each year, according to a 1995 Gallup 
survey that based its figures on statements from a sample of 
1,000 parents. Bearing this in mind, imagine what a huge 
number of offenders the FBI could grab if it could snoop into 
people's home lives as easily as AOL was able to monitor its 
members online. Evidently, the real world is much, much more 
hazardous for children than the online world. 
     True, the net attracts some people who like to talk 
dirty to children; but judging from the disappointing results 
of the AOL raids, these people just want to fantasize. People 
who actually want to molest children will naturally prefer to 
hang out at shopping malls or school yards, trying to put 
their ideas into practice. Wouldn't it make more sense to 
deploy FBI agents in these places in the physical world 
rather than online, where it's all talk and no action? 
 
     
     Child Pornography: Pest or Plague? 

     Getting back to Usenet, a quick scan shows many pictures 
of solo children taken at nudist camps, and very few of kids 
involved with partners in sex acts. In fact, according to an 
attorney who has been actively involved in pornography 
litigation, penalties against creating hard-core kiddieporn 
are so severe, virtually none has been produced in America 
since the 1970s. Pornographers naturally prefer to make money 
marketing pictures that are legal. 
     Still, child pornography is abhorrent to almost 
everyone--which makes it an ideal scare-topic for 
legislators, right down there with communism and drug use. A 
senator can condemn it in the comfortable knowledge that 
almost everyone will agree with him. 
     On September 6th, 1995, standing before the Senate, 
Orrin Hatch did exactly that. "It is impossible," he said, 
"for any decent American not to be outraged by child 
pornography and the exploitation of children. Such material 
is a plague upon our people and the moral fabric of this 
great nation." Hatch said there was an overwhelming 
bipartisan belief "that there is no place for such filth even 
in a free society and those who produce or peddle this 
reprehensible material must be made to feel the full weight 
of the law and suffer a punishment reflective of the 
seriousness of their offense." 
     The reason for Hatch's diatribe wasn't immediately 
clear, since there's already a federal law against producing 
or possessing erotic photographs featuring underage models. 
But this law is limited. Its purpose is to protect children 
who might be used in the production of pictures. Thus, a 
crime only exists when a real child has been used as a model. 
Federal law does not cover text or visuals created purely 
from the human imagination. 
     The snag is, computer graphics software can now create 
simulations that are almost indistinguishable from the real 
thing. Hatch talked about the case of a 20-year-old Canadian, 
Joseph Pecchiarich, who had used image retouching software to 
process a picture of a child in a bathing suit. Pecchiarich 
artfully erased the clothing and put the child "in a sexually 
provocative position" (according to Philip Enright, an 
assistant crown attorney associated with the case). 
     Since no real children had been harmed, Hatch believed 
that "this type of repulsive conduct" would be legal if it 
ever occurred in the United States. Worse still, "computers 
can also be used to alter sexually explicit photographs, 
films, and videos in such a way as to make it virtually 
impossible for prosecutors to identify the individuals, or to 
prove that the offending material was produced using 
children." A pornographer could conceivably sell unretouched 
photographs of real children having real sex but can claim 
that the pictures are computer-generated; and no one will be 
able to prove otherwise. 
     So what's the answer? A new law, obviously. Hatch 
introduced a bill that would criminalize _any_ form of art or 
graphics (including paintings as well as digitized 
photographs), depicting children indecently. The new law 
would outlaw not just sexually explicit pictures but also the 
depiction of buttocks and breasts of children under eighteen, 
and it would ban any advertisement or description worded "in 
such a manner that conveys the impression that the material 
is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in 
sexually explicit conduct." This seemed to mean that if you 
saw some kiddieporn, you'd be committing a crime if you 
described it to someone. 
     Hatch's proposal sparked a heavy debate among net users. 
Even hardcore online libertarians couldn't claim that real 
photographs of children having sex should be legal--but they 
feared the consequences of a crackdown all the same. On 
Usenet, Joseph H. Allen wrote: "Pedophiles have been with us 
since before the beginning of recorded history--certainly 
before computers, photographs, or even printed books. Most 
child molestations occur in the home or local community and 
are usually instigated by a loved one. Censorship of any kind 
is not going to make any difference whatsoever in the 
incidence of this permanent part of the human condition." 
     Allen digressed into a brief paen of praise for free 
speech online, then finished up: "Yet this achievement is to 
come to an abrupt end by a man and a mindset so replete with 
suppression and domination that he and it would go so far as 
to censor public libraries. It is to be replaced by a forum 
based on a lie--perhaps the lie of western culture: that sex 
is the last thing on the mind of any given human. The new net 
will be occupied with stale Disney characters instead of real 
humans, but will certainly be convenient for shopping." 
     Others were deeply skeptical of legislators' motives. A 
woman who signed herself "Joan" suggested that "the badness 
of child porn is something everybody can agree about. Which 
makes it the perfect tool for a power-greedy government to 
grab control over a new medium. ... just use your word 
processor to substitute 'witchcraft' for 'child porn' and 
'witches' for 'pornographers,' then re-read the messages. 
Just try it and see what you think. Then try 'transsexuals' 
... then 'Catholics.' Think of it as a game...your leaders 
certainly do." 
     "Joan" went on to say that she found it hard to believe 
there was an active market for child pornography, or 
businesses actively supplying it. "I'd like to see some REAL 
DATA before going off in a half-cocked hysterical panic...or 
is that wishful thinking?" 
     Well--what _are_ the figures? Kiddieporn on Usenet 
certainly does exist; it's right where you'd expect to find 
it, in alt.sex.pedophilia. And a few of the pictures are 
almost certainly illegal under _current_ federal law. This 
raises another question: how do people get away with posting 
them so openly? 
     An anonymous contributor to the news group explained 
precisely how it is done. "I suggest chaining multiple 
remailers (at least 3) together. ... Also if you're going to 
post here I suggest using a dummy account [at an Internet 
service provider]--one in which you paid by money order with 
a bogus name and address--and ONLY use this account for 2 
months! Because they can do a trace back to see where you're 
calling from. But by the time it takes to subpoena different 
remailers from all over the world you won't be using that 
account anymore!" 
     What's a "remailer"? Simple: a computer on the net that 
receives messages, automatically strips off the name and 
address of the sender, and forwards the message automatically 
to its destination. Anonymous remailers are run by people who 
believe that anonymous speech is an important liberty, 
protecting people who have unpopular views. Indeed, the 
Supreme Court has found that anonymous speech is protected 
under the First Amendment. In McIntyre vs. Ohio Elections 
Commission, a woman named Margaret McIntyre had distributed 
anonymous pamphlets in violation of Ohio elections law. By a 
7-2 vote, the Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional 
and stated that anonymous pamphleteering is protected speech. 
     What if you don't know how to find an anonymous 
remailer? No problem; like most other useful nuggets of 
information, it's available online. Lists of remailers are 
stored at a couple of web sites: 

     http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html 
     http://www.replay.com/staff/usura/chain.html 

     And just to make the situation even more interesting, in 
February 1996 Joel Grasty, a self-described "cypherpunk," 
announced that you no longer need to be a Unix programmer to 
set up a remailing operation of your own. Grasty developed a 
program that can turn any PC running Windows into a remailing 
system, and he started giving away the software from his web 
page at http://www.c2.org/~winsock. 
     Under Senator Exon's decency amendment, of course, 
anonymous remailers could be penalized for knowingly allowing 
porn to flow through their computers onto screens which might 
be seen by children. But since most of the sites are located 
overseas (Hacktic, for instance, is in Holland) it's hard to 
see how they could be prosecuted under American law. 
     Even so, remailers are not totally secure. The Church of 
Scientology shocked net users in 1995 by successfully 
persuading police in Finland to raid a site and break open 
its shell of anonymity, in a civil case. Still, the system 
does provide reasonable security if multiple sites are used 
and the person who sends the message uses a fake ID. Usenet 
participants certainly feel quite confident about posting 
illegal photographs. They also enjoy discussing their 
"forbidden" pleasures. 
     On  alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children, one person 
described precisely the photo he was looking for: "A young 
couple (mf) together naked, the boy with an erection, 
obviously stimulated by the sight of the girl, and the girl 
admiring it. Anyone else have this (also known as 2TEENS.JPG 
or maybe that's a different one from the same series) please 
post it. Or anything similar. I get a bit fed up of the 7-
year-olds sucking off 'Dad.' Much rather see two youngsters 
enjoying themselves together." 
     Naturally, this kind of post is matched by an equal 
number of apoplectic rants. "PPkiller" warned everyone on 
alt.sex.pedophilia: "you fucking sick bastards should have 
your genitals scrambled.... this newsgroup is not natural. 
you are all stricken with a disease...you all need help..." 
     And there were some typical Usenet conspiracy theories: 
"The 'regulate the Internet' people are posting the photos 
here in order to justify their cries of 'pedophiles are all 
over the net.'" 
     Some moralists vowed to take personal action. In 
response to a woman who had posted a bunch of pictures, one 
man wrote: "I have taken the liberty of downloading 
approximately 25 examples of your sickest work, and sent 
printouts, along with your header and the name of your access 
provider to the local FBI office. It is child predators like 
you that are giving the net a bad name, besides harming the 
most innocent of our society. I hope they find you and nail 
you for everything that they can." 
     But the target of this letter was cheerfully defiant. 
She replied to it in detail: "I freely and merrily admit that 
I made those posts! What saddens me is your narrow mindedness 
... you just rush forward and attack like a knight in shining 
armor, without even thinking that you may be attacking 
someone who hasn't done anything wrong. Mr. H, not only did I 
post this material, but if you've read the newsgroup even a 
little, you'd know that I've made occasional mention of my 
daughter and of my past relationship with my mother. Now, let 
me ask you a simple question of logic: seeing that some 30-35 
years ago, I was supposedly one of the children you are 
protecting, and that I feel in no way harmed or molested by 
the love my mother had for me ... don't you think I have a 
say in this? Also I wish to note, _if_ you could touch me 
(and believe me you can't), you'd not only be putting me in 
prison, you'd also be ruining my husband's and 8 yr old 
daughter's lives, how chivalrous, don't you think?" 
     So here was a decency crusader's worst nightmare. 
Perverts were trading kiddieporn openly on the net, for all 
the world to see. And as if that wasn't bad enough, they were 
_bragging about it,_ challenging anyone to try and stop them! 
     Well, it was only natural that this kind of thing would 
provoke a man like Orrin Hatch to stand up and start ranting 
about "the moral fabric of this great nation." You could see 
why conservatives wanted some tougher legislation. But wait a 
minute--some of the pictures online were already illegal! If 
existing laws were having absolutely no effect, why should 
new laws do any better? 
     Perhaps Barry Crimmins was right: the real answer was to 
enforce existing laws more vigorously. But if the FBI had 
only been able to arrest a dozen offenders after a two-year 
investigation of AOL--where they had full access to the names 
and locations of members--how could law enforcement even 
begin to tackle the anonymous hordes of Usenet? 


     Cruising Channel #littlegirlsex 

     In America Online's chat rooms, speech can be censored 
legally because everything happens inside a privately owned 
system. On the Internet, there's a much bigger online chat 
arena where supervision is impossible and law enforcement is 
virtually unknown. 
     Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a huge global service 
divided into thousands of topic areas. The system resembles 
Usenet, except that you don't have to wait a day or two after 
posting a message in order to read other people's replies. On 
IRC, everything happens in realtime. 
     The mind-boggling scope of the system is made clear when 
you log on: 

     *** Welcome to the Internet Relay Network 
     *** This server was created Sun Sep 24 1995 at 12: 12:11 
PDT 
     *** There are 6990 users and 4879 invisible on 87

     *** There are 129 operators online 
     *** 2859 channels have been formed

     *** Current local  users:  471  Max: 601 
     *** Current global users:  11868  Max: 12206 

     If you want to chat with people on IRC, you have to 
master a horribly confusing vocabulary of commands. The 
system was originally put together by hardcore Unix geeks and 
is definitely not a user-friendly environment. But the word 
LIST is all you need to find room names. Here's what you see 
in response to the command LIST *SEX*, which means, "display 
all room names containing the word SEX regardless of other 
letters before and after it." (The number following each chat 
area indicates how many people were currently using it.)

     On IRC, just the same as on Usenet, _most_ areas are 
_not_ full of sexual fantasies and perversion. IRC functions 
mainly as a way for lonely or isolated people to find other 
people who share interests such as pets, gardening, 
literature, or movies. Thousands of people have met in real 
life after chatting online via IRC. I personally know of two 
couples who ended up getting married. 
     The problem posed by the minority of sexual-oriented 
chat rooms still boils down to the same old story: access, 
content, and distribution. 


     Filters 

     Content-filtering programs are now available, enabling 
parents to lock out various areas of the net in just the same 
way that AOL allows some of its own features to be 
selectively disabled. 
     Surfwatch, one of the most widely publicized packages, 
"comes ready to block more than a thousand sites containing 
material we would not want our children to see," says Ann 
Duvall, president of the corporation. Customized lists are 
also available, blocking only certain types of web sites or 
news groups. 
     The Internet Filter goes further and automatically 
eliminates "specific types of messages within any newsgroup" 
(presumably, messages containing offensive keywords). The 
Internet Filter boasts "silent installation, without any 
indication to the child that it is installed." And it 
automatically emails a warning message to the parents if any 
"access violations" occur. 
     Net Nanny, marketed by a Canadian software developer, 
allows parents to specify "dangerous phrases" that the 
program should look for--such as "What's your name?" or 
"What's your phone number?" If the program notices one of 
these phrases, it logs off immediately. 
     Meanwhile, in June, 1995, Netscape, Microsoft, and 
Progressive Networks, Inc. formed the Information Highway 
Parental Empowerment Group "to work together on coordinating 
standards for technology that would give aprents greater 
control over what their children are able to access on the 
Internet." According a Netscape spokesman, "The technology 
for filtering content is easy. The hard part is deciding what 
to filter." 
     But if that's true, why does AOL have such a hard time 
filtering just the names of its chat rooms, let alone the 
chat itself? Word-oriented or phrase-oriented programs such 
as The Internet Filter and Net Nanny must check for countless 
"danger signals" in online text--and will be instantly 
defeated if a security-conscious pedophile merely transposes 
some letter pairs or sprinkles a few X's here and there. 
Also, the list of forbidden sites in software such as 
SurfWatch will have to be frequently updated to keep pace 
with new Usenet groups or web sites that come online. And 
many parents won't be computer-literate enough to grapple 
with the complexity of all this filtering. In many homes, the 
kids are more computer literate than the adults. 
     Bearing all this in mind, another tactic has been 
suggested: a rating system. The Recreational Software 
Advisory Council (RSAC) is an independent, nonprofit 
organization established in September, 1994 with funding from 
various trade associations that are financed, in turn, by 
corporations in the computer business. It was established 
after a previous round of Senate hearings sounded the alarm 
about excessive violence in video games. 
     Stephen Balkam, executive director of the RSAC, reports 
that more than 200 software titles from nearly 80 software 
companies have now been rated using a scale that was 
developed conjunction with parents, pediatricians, and Dr. 
Donald Roberts, chairman of the Communications Department at 
Stanford University. This working group developed objective 
criteria to measure violence, nudity/sex, and bad language in 
video games, boiling it all down to a number from 0 (totally 
safe) to 4 (totally outrageous). 
     But the RSAC doesn't evaluate software itself. Video 
games tend to have dozens or even hundreds of hidden levels; 
there's no way they can be thoroughly examined in the same 
way that it's possible to view and evaluate an entire movie. 
Consequently, RSAC requires manufacturers to answer a 
questionnaire on the content of each new product. It then 
spot-checks games at random to make sure that nobody cheats. 
     Like "Parental Advisory" labels on music CDs, RSAC game 
ratings now exert a subtle force encouraging manufacturers to 
sanitize their products. There's also a strong incentive for 
all game manufacturers to participate in the scheme: Wal*Mart 
and Toys R Us have both announced that they won't sell 
unrated games anymore. 
     Could the RSAC rating scale be used online? Absolutely, 
says Balkam. He feels that "many hundreds if not thousands of 
web sites and home pages could be rated and regulated." 
     Moreover, adult material could be blocked automatically. 
Each transmission from a web page or Usenet group would 
commence with a few bytes establishing its rating. Software 
at home or at every Internet site would sense these bytes and 
lock out material exceeding the level specified by the 
consumer. Any source that mis-rated its material would find 
itself re-rated or blocked for a penalty period. And sources 
that refused to rate themselves would automatically earn 
themselves the maximum adult rating by default. 
     Does this sound like the final, equitable answer to the 
problem of access, content, and distribution? Well, even 
Stephen Balkam admits that the scheme would be useless for 
online chat, where content is totally unpredictable. Balkam 
suggests a system like Surfwatch for that--or he says parents 
can block _all_ chat areas if they want to be totally secure. 
     But even if the rating scheme is just applied to web 
sites and news groups, it still raises problems. Will the 
authors of Usenet posts have to rate every message that they 
write? Will smaller Internet service providers play along and 
participate in the scheme, even though they have resisted 
every attempt at censorship in the past? Participation could 
never be compelled by law; that would be a clear violation of 
the First Amendment. 
     In March, 1996, Microsoft endorsed the RSAC's rating 
system and pledged to incorporate filtering capabilities into 
the next version of its Internet Explorer software. It's 
still hard, though, to see how such a system can ever be 
enforced. With thousands of new web sites constantly coming 
online, and the content of current web sites constantly 
changing, who's going to do the random sampling to check that 
everyone's following the rating scheme? Who's going to deal 
with the bad sites that need to be re-rated or blocked? Who's 
going to process the arguments, complaints, and appeals from 
people who claim that they did rate themselves accurately and 
are now being unfairly penalized? Who's going to administer 
this nightmare of censorship, and who's going to pay for it? 
     According to Balkam, about 2,000 new videogames are 
published each year--and he admits that even this volume 
creates a sizable amount of work for the RSAC. But it's a 
tiny fraction of the ratable material on the Internet. 
     And so, no matter what kind of cunning tactic is 
proposed or who bears the burden of it, online content seems 
uncontrollable, distribution can't be contained, and access 
can't be effectively restricted. 


     Angels Online 

     There's one more possible approach for controlling the 
net. In 1995, a bunch of net users decided to take matters 
into their own hands by giving "peer pressure" a new and more 
sinister meaning. In effect, they became the first decency 
vigilantes of cyberspace. 
     The Guardian Angels started out as a citizens' group in 
New York City, patrolling subways and bad neighborhoods in an 
effort to discourage crime. Wearing distinctive T-shirts and 
red berets, the Angels have become a well-established feature 
of urban life, although they have never been regarded as 
particularly useful or desirable by the New York Police 
Department. 
     Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Angels, has his own daily 
show on talk-radio station WABC. In 1995 he announced that 
he'd acquired an Internet address. Soon he found himself 
talking to listeners who worried about netporn, hate speech, 
and pedophiles online. Soon after that, Sliwa came up with 
his inevitable response. If the Internet is just another "bad 
neighborhood," it's up to him--or citizens like him--to 
patrol it. 
     In June he issued a preliminary press release signed by 
himself and Colin Hatcher, who called himself "Gabriel" 
online and was appointed "Netwatch Coordinator." They 
appealed for volunteers who would spend two to eight hours a 
week "looking for places where they believe there may be 
unacceptable activity" on the Internet. 
     The main targets seemed to be Usenet, IRC, chat areas in 
major Internet service providers, and "any sites providing 
material / discussions / images / contacts of a sexually 
explicit nature (there are thousands!)." 
     This raised some interesting--and unanswered--questions. 
Were the Angels implying that sexually explicit material was 
illegal? They seemed a bit vague about this. "We are not 
trying to abolish free speech," they said in a press release, 
"but we believe that freedom of speech should not be 
exercised if by exercising it you are violating someone 
else's basic rights." 
     What rights? This was unclear. 
     Another unresolved issue was discipline. Sliwa freely 
admitted that he wouldn't even try to control the online 
conduct of his volunteers: "None of our volunteers is 
qualified to represent our organization. They are simply 
people who have contacted us and said they will keep a look 
out." 
     For what? Five prime targets were listed: 

     a) Hate crimes (like racist postings, hate mail) etc. 
     b) Sexual harassment (eg Online stalking) 
     c) Sexual abuse of children 
     d) Kids access to pornographic material 
     e) Anything where Service Providers Terms of Service are 
        being violated. 

     Of course, it's no crime in the United States to publish 
racist tracts. As for sexual harassment, it's tricky to 
define and hard to prove. But the Angels seemed to feel that 
they'd know it when they saw it, and if a volunteer found 
some stuff she didn't like the look of, she should "report 
the violations to us at Netwatch, and also to the System 
Administrators, or Service Providers, of the cybercriminal." 
Cybercriminal? This suggested that so far as the Angels were 
concerned, hate speech and sexually explicit text and 
pictures _were_ crimes, no matter what the Constitution and 
federal laws might say on the subject. 
     How would this decency crusade actually work in 
practice? Well, later in 1995, one net user received the 
following not-very-friendly, not-very-literate warning, sent 
via an anonymous remailer: 

          The Net is out of control, sex crimes, hate crimes 
     and felonies. 
          Just as on the streets, CyberCrime is committed by 
     a minority of criminals who destroy the quality of life 
     for an innocent majority. And just like on the streets 
     the Guardian Angels will combat it. 
          We have good reason to believe that you are 
     involved in unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening 
     and/or harassment, particularly relating to minors. We 
     will be watching you. 

     The netizen who found this in her mailbox was baffled 
and irritated. She had no idea what she'd done to provoke the 
warning, and since the message was anonymous, there was no 
way to _find out_ what she was supposed to have done. 
     By November, the Angels claimed they had 200 volunteers 
working for them, busily searching for bad guys on the net. 
"We have reported a number of Child Pornographers (50) to 
Sysadmins [system administrators] this month," Colin Hatcher 
noted, although he was no longer signing his real name to his 
progress reports, perhaps in fear of reprisals from angry 
pedophiles. "Letters we have received back all share our 
concern and promise stern action. Remember, each electronic 
image represents a real life destroyed." 
     The Angels now had an international reach. After finding 
a posting from a sixteen-year-old girl on the Usenet group 
alt.teens that was "extremely nasty (obscene)," Hatcher 
contacted the site from which the message originated--which 
turned out to be a girls' school in England. According to 
Hatcher, "I wrote to the Sysadmin and asked the question, 
'Are you aware that one of your girls is posting this kind of 
material to this newsgroup?' He investigated the matter, and 
it turned out apparently that the postings came not from a 16 
year old girl at all, but from an older, MALE, member of the 
teaching staff." 
     When Hatcher told the sysadmin about the teacher's 
secret online persona, did this also result in a "real life 
destroyed"? Hatcher didn't say. In his righteousness. it 
didn't seem to occur to him that he could be damaging people 
who might not be guilty of anything more than fantasizing. 
     One thing was clear, though: in Hatcher's universe, some 
topics were so taboo, they shouldn't even be mentioned. For 
instance, he was outraged by the idea of free-speech 
advocates suggestiong that conversations about pedophilia 
were a form of protected speech. 

          Like environmental granola terrorists who will 
     injure loggers or bomb hunting retreats to save the 
     spotted owl, these Champions of Cyber feel that freedom 
     of speech as proposed by the founding fathers was 
     intended to allow child rapists to hold public gab 
     sessions, discuss their disgusting deeds and depraved 
     desires and just generally work themselves into a 
     pedophilic lather. Personally, I prefer a little 
     preventative medicine, a little stitch in time that 
     saves sending out the blood hounds to try and locate a 
     snatched 5 year old before she ends up in a garbage bag 
     in a dumpster. 

     According to Hatcher, his force of 200 volunteers was 
ready to administer this medicine. "Basically there are more 
law abiding Users on the Internet than law breaking Abusers," 
he wrote. "It's just a matter of the good guys working as 
hard as the bad and the ugly." 
     Some net users wondered, though, if Hatcher was 
qualified to draw a dividing line between good and bad, let 
alone ugly. They also worried that decency vigilantes might 
have a chilling effect on freedom of speech. A student at 
Rutgers University complained that some of the Angels' public 
statements "are threats to violate the civil liberties of 
users of the Internet." In addition, he said, "the record of 
the Guardian Angels suggests that they will step over even 
the bounds that they publicly set for themselves." 
     Still, he had an answer. "The idea is to use one problem 
(the "CyberAngels") to counter another (net-abuse such as 
spamming). Simply forward copies of spamming ... [to the 
angels] ... and ask them to deal with the problem." 
     Was this a polite way to mailbomb the Angels into 
oblivion? The writer didn't come right out and say so, but he 
did admit he was "hopeful that the volume of mail received on 
this count will be great enough that they will be unable to 
carry out any improper actions." 
     So here it was again, the net community's strange powers 
of instant, universal communication, ready to be invoked at a 
moment's notice for purposes of self defense. In this 
particular case, though, the call for action created barely a 
ripple of interest. The CyberAngels talked a good game, but 
online libertarians weren't particularly impressed. They just 
seemed a bit weary and annoyed, like elephants harassed by a 
small swarm of tiny biting flies.

<p>     How much offensive material really exists online, and 
what do we really want to do about it? Excerpts from Usenet 
(below) show why decency activists are so upset--but the 
history and structure of Usenet suggest that this system is 
virtually impossible to control, as <a href="http://www.gsia.cmu.edu:80/andrew/ml3e/www/Not_By_Me_Not_My_Views/">German authorities 
learned</a> when they tried to block access to sexually-oriented 
news groups and holocaust-revisionist web pages, with 
farcical results.
 
<p> The <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/">Simon Wiesenthal
Center</a> launched a public relations campaign against white
supremacist groups online, with mixed results. A representative from
the Institute also testified before the Senate Subcommittee on
Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information, warning the bomb
recipes were available online. But when an FBI agent was asked to name
a single crime employing this kind of information, he was unable to do
so.

<p>     A systematic government policy of intimidation could 
induce many net users to censor themselves. But this 
"solution" seems extreme compared with the "problem" of 
content--which is far less severe than news reports and 
political statements have claimed.

     Measuring the Sleaze 

     Since Rimm's study has been discredited, we have to look 
elsewhere to discover how much pornography really exists 
online. 
     In mid-1995, Peter Trei, a highly experienced software 
engineer, did his own quick survey and posted the results on 
the net. Basically he examined the Usenet feed at his local 
Internet service provider, counted how many news groups had 
dangerous-sounding names, and compared them with news groups 
that had safe-sounding names. 
     What standards did he use for "safe" and "dangerous"? 
Trei didn't use those words. Thinking back to Senator Exon, 
he tried to imagine what "might offend a certain retiring 
senator." Anything that fell into that broad category, or 
anything "which I'd feel uncomfortable about letting my five-
year-old see or read," he labeled "Unexonian." Adding it up, 
142 out of a total of 10,985 had names that sounded 
Unexonian. This worked out at 1.3 percent. 
     But some groups are busier than others. To factor this 
in, Trei did what Martin Rimm chose not to do: he devised a 
program to count the number of actual messages in all the 
different groups. This program didn't take a lot of time to 
write; in fact, it was a single line of Unix commands piped 
together. Using it, Trei counted a total of 591,783 messages 
of which 16,288 were pictures in Unexonian news groups and 
18,025 were text in Unexonian news groups. This meant that 
out of all the messages on Usenet, 5.8% might be unsuitable 
for a five-year-old, by Trei's rough estimation. 
     This figure is a lot less scary that Rimm's traumatic 
statistic, but according to Trei, it's still probably too 
high, for several reasons. 
     First, pictures are commonly split into two or more 
chunks of data. Trei's routine counted the chunks as separate 
messages, when really they were subsections. 
     Second, picture news groups also contain text messages 
from people asking for, offering, discussing, or complaining 
about the pictures. There's nothing offensive in these 
messages--but they were counted as Unexonian by Trei's 
routine because they were sitting in Unexonian news groups. 
     Third, sexually oriented groups are often bombarded with 
threats such as "You will all burn in hell!" from religious 
fundamentalists and other do-gooders. Naturally, these 
threats generate angry or mocking replies. Since this all 
happens in Unexonian groups, all of it was counted as being 
unsuitable for a 5-year-old. 
     "Applying these caveats," Trei concluded, "it's likely 
that 'unexonia' actually occupies no more than 4% of Usenet 
traffic, in terms of 'things to be read or looked at.'" 
     How much should it worry us that maybe 1 message in 25 
on Usenet is unsuitable for Senator James Exon or a five-
year-old child? Trei suggested comparing the situation with a 
typical news stand where _more_ than 4% of the titles on 
display might be unsuitable for five-year-olds. This seems 
reassuring--but is it? Usenet differs from a news stand in 
three important ways: 
     _Access:_ News stands are supervised; the Internet is 
not. There's no one to say, "Sorry, kid, if you're under 
eighteen, you can't buy that." 
     _Content:_ Material in some news groups is far more 
explicit than pictures or text in men's magazines. 
     _Distribution:_ News stands in conservative areas of the 
country often choose not to carry "offensive" publications. 
Magazine distribution varies according to local tastes and 
community standards. By comparison, Usenet is equally 
accessible from any area of the country. 
     Access, Content, and Distribution are the three big 
problems afflicting free speech online. 


     Sex, Drugs, and Kiss My Ass 

     Another rough-and-ready study of Usenet was contributed 
anonymously to the alt.censorship Usenet news group. Once 
again the author counted news groups that had names liable to 
worry moral activists. At his local site there were 4,283 
available groups of which 74 had the word "sex" in the title, 
9 had the word "drugs" in the title, one was called 
"alt.irc.ops.kiss.my.ass," and so on. The total of 
potentially offensive group names came to 2.91 percent. 
     The author of this brief summary came up with his own 
analogy. Usenet is like a city: you're likely to get a very 
different impression of it depending on the neighborhood 
where you choose to hang out. He wrote: "If you stood in the 
'Combat Zone' (an area where porno shops are concentrated in 
Boston) and looked around, all you'd see is pornography and 
strip joints and think what a filth hole this is and judge 
that city harshly. If, on the other hand, you stood in the 
Fanuiel Hall Marketplace, all you'd see was all kinds of 
great restaurants and shops, historic buildings, street 
entertainers singing and doing magic acts, etc., and you'd 
judge that city quite differently. ... perhaps if 
'investigative reporters' and paranoid hysterics didn't hang 
around exclusively in newsgroups with the words 'sex' and 
'erotica' in the title, they'd see a lot of valuable and 
informative material being exchanged and the danger of 
censoring the system that carries it." 
     Okay, but here again, access, content, and distribution 
different in a city compared with the net. 
     _Access:_ Young children have access to all areas of 
Usenet, but they aren't so free to roam sleazy urban areas 
and wander into pornographic bookstores. 
     _Content:_ The world online is far freer than the real 
world, even in urban areas. 
     _Distribution:_ The Internet blasts urban-style material 
into quiet suburban backwaters. There's no clear division 
between neighborhoods as there is in a city. 
     Suppose we could modify access, content, and 
distribution to make the net more like the everyday world. 
Would this satisfy the decency activists? Would it outrage 
the libertarians? Is it technically feasible? 
     To answer these questions, we need more information on 
the net itself--and Usenet in particular, since that's where 
most of the controversy has come from. 


     Origins of Usenet 

     Back in 1979 at Duke University in North Carolina, two 
graduate students named Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis were 
looking for a better way to distribute news about Unix, the 
operating system that controlled their minicomputers. Unix 
had been developed for internal use at AT&T; it was given 
away free on an informal basis to anyone who wanted it. This 
meant there was no properly organized system of technical 
support. No one took responsibility for maintaining Unix, 
updating it, and correcting things that were wrong with it. 
You used it at your own risk, and when you ran into one of 
its undocumented problems you had to fix it yourself or find 
someone else who knew how to. While you were doing that, your 
computer could be paralyzed for hours or even days at a time. 
     There were a couple of informal newsletters that offered 
useful news and advice on Unix bugs, but you obviously 
couldn't wait for one of those updates when you had a real 
crisis on hand. Consequently, Truscott and Ellis suggested a 
scheme where a bunch of sites would swap news with each other 
electronically. No single person would be in charge of this 
system. It would be run by everyone, for everyone, and anyone 
would be able to contribute. This, then, was the origin of 
Usenet. 
     Steve Bellovin, a graduate student at the University of 
North Carolina, put together a program that would handle the 
news-swapping. After some tests at the beginning of 1980, the 
program was given away to anyone who wanted it. 
     The system worked well--so well, people started swapping 
news that had nothing to do with Unix. The software was 
upgraded to handle larger volumes of information and sort it 
under subject headings. Finally, in 1986, Network News 
Transfer Protocol (NNTP) was established as a standard for 
packaging and transmitting the data. By this time the 
Internet was a reality, and the news transfer standard was 
finalized after a "Request for Comment" (RFC) from the 
Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC), which is the 
nearest thing to a centralized body administering the net. 
     Now people started writing various news processors and 
news readers to make the system more friendly for the end 
user. Meanwhile, the number of news groups started growing 
wildly. Some system administrators felt that the whole thing 
had gotten out of hand, and they refused to offer the full 
range of groups at their sites. Other system administrators 
didn't approve of this; they felt that information should be 
available on every topic--it wanted to be free, right?--and 
they refused to censor anything. 
     In this way, Usenet evolved as a very flexible, totally 
decentralized system. No one owned it, no one ran it, and it 
quickly became one of the purest examples of anarchy that has 
ever existed. Anyone could say anything at all online. Peer 
pressure exerted a low-key moderating influence, but of 
course there were some troublemakers who took a perverse 
pleasure from being obnoxious, and there was no way to stop 
them. In the words of an anonymous aphorism: "Anarchy means 
having to put up with things that really piss you off." 
     Today, Usenet still functions on this basis. The 
millions of people who use it seem pretty happy with it as it 
is, and hardly anyone online complains about its content. The 
activists who want to impose controls are almost all people 
who _don't_ use it, which means that the inhabitants of 
Usenet are like citizens of a country whose laws are being 
written by a bunch of foreigners. In some ways the online 
environment in 1996 feels like Hong Kong in the last days of 
British rule: a very free community wondering what's going to 
happen as the forces of law and order start moving in. 


     Extreme Content 

     Usenet news groups focus on every conceivable topic, 
including job hunting, travel, humor, golf, and tropical 
fish. Most messages are as mundane as conversations you might 
overhear on a city bus. How do you find the sexy stuff? 
     Most newsreading programs make it easy enough. Here's

     The "alt" groups were created as an alternative to more 
conventional groups that are often supervised by a moderator. 
The "alt" hierarchy is the freest--and most troublesome--
segment of Usenet. 
     In the list above, the number preceding each news group 
shows how many messages have been posted since the group was 
last accessed by this particular user at this particular 
site. If you actually check the contents of a group, you're 
likely to find that many messages no longer exist; they've 
been erased to make room for new ones coming in. 
     Of course, sex isn't the only "sensitive" subject matter 
on Usenet. Non-sexual content can still be mind-boggling to 
consumers whose diet normally consists of TV, national-
circulation magazines, and newspapers. 
     For instance, you may find....

     Most posts on Usenet are _not_ extreme or offensive. On 
sci.medicine you can ask questions and get authoritative 
answers on any topic from circumcision to cancer. You can 
look for employment on misc.jobs.offered, or look for love on 
alt.personals. Cat owners can exchange advice on caring for 
their pets; computer users can find help that goes way beyond 
the typical support provided by a retailer. People on Usenet 
are often selflessly generous and decent to each other. On 
the news group alt.suicide.holiday (which was established to 
discuss why there are so many suicides on national holidays), 
participants have actively helped those in need to cope with 
suicidal impulses. 
     But still the extreme material exists. Can it be 
controlled? Should it be controlled? And how do controversial 
news groups get started in the first place? 


     Cancelling the Spam 

     In keeping with the spirit of decentralized anarchy, 
anyone with some technical knowledge can create a Usenet news 
group. In practice, though, this would be pointless, because 
most sites wouldn't bother to offer the group to their users. 
So how do some groups get widely distributed? 
     It's surprisingly difficult to obtain a clear answer to 
this kind of question, because there's no official entity in 
charge of the situation. One starting point is to ask someone 
who's been involved as an activist on a volunteer basis. 
     Joel Furr fits that description. A long-time net user, 
Furr has participated in policy debates, has written one of 
the primary guides to online "netiquette," helps to publicize 
inappropriate use of Usenet, and became notorious when he got 
into an online fight with a couple of lawyers who took 
advantage of the system as a vast free advertising service. 
     Rapid-talking, sardonic, and irritable, Furr has 
developed a love-hate relationship with net users. "A lot of 
people are determined to make up their own names for news 
groups," he says. "They've got the idea that they can do 
anything they want on Usenet, which is true on a local level 
but not globally. One guy wanted a news group to talk about 
lifelong love. I don't know what there is to discuss on this 
topic that you can't discuss in alt.romance, but he was 
determined to create this news group and he wanted to call it 
alt.forever.linette because his girlfriend is named Linette 
and he was going to love her forever. He said he thought 
people would be interested enough to ask about it. Of course, 
no one ever did find out about his group because only five 
sites bothered to carry it, and no one was interested." 
     Businesses have made similarly misguided attempts to 
create their own forums for online discussion. "You get 
multilevel marketing operations," says Furr, "like Amway, who 
came in and said 'We want to create a group named 
alt.business.amway.' There was in fact an Amway news group, 
but no one ever posted to it, because hardly anyone carried 
it, and everybody knows that Amway is pond scum, and the news 
group was only going to benefit one entity, which was Amway." 
     So what do you do if you want your news group to be 
read? You have a choice. You can create your own "alt" group 
and publicize it on the net in the hope that people will nag 
their local Internet provider into carrying it. Or you can 
take a more formal approach, which means you write up your 
proposal for a new group and email it to a man named David 
Lawrence. 
     Lawrence works for UUnet, an company that feeds news to 
a thousand Internet sites.  But Lawrence's day job has 
nothing to do with his activity creating news groups; like 
Furr, he does that kind of thing entirely in his spare time. 
     Every time Lawrence receives a request, he announces it 
on a special news group named news.announce.newgroups. After 
28 days of discussion, a vote is held. Anyone on the net is 
qualified to cast a ballot for or against forming the new 
group. If two-thirds say "yes," _and_ if the number of "yes" 
votes exceeds the number of "no" votes by 100 or more, the 
new group is created. At this point, Lawrence notifies every 
site on the net that the group exists. This doesn't guarantee 
that all the sites will add it to their list; as Lawrence 
says, "I don't really have any power; I just make 
recommendations." 
     Still, he agrees that people do often follow his 
recommendations, which gives him a kind of guru status. "I do 
have more influence than just about anybody else," he admits, 
"and some people get upset by the notion.... I'm not the only 
one with a vision of how Usenet should be, but I do believe I 
have a better understanding of how it works--and the 
implications--than the average user. So maybe I _should_ have 
some influence." 
     Some libertarian net users resent the voting system and 
accuse people such as Lawrence and Furr of being part of a 
"cabal" that wields censorious power over the net. In fact, 
Lawrence is quick to point out that he has never failed to 
authorize a news group because of its content; he only 
demands that there should be enough people to vote for it. 
     From his point of view, the problem on Usenet isn't 
control, it's "noise." This is the all-purpose term for time-
wasting quibbles, off-topic rants, unfunny remarks, obscene 
insults, arguments that never end, accusations such as 
"You're a Nazi," and general stupidity. "We used to notice a 
phenomenon every September," says Lawrence, "where kids would 
get into college, acquire Internet access, and do lots of 
stupid things. And now the saying goes, 'It's always 
September on the net.' I have a lot of varied interests, but 
even in my passions, like motorcycling, I don't read the news 
groups anymore. There's too much noise." 
     The worst kind of noise is "spamming." Spam is defined 
as junk mail or other text posted to 25 or more groups 
simultaneously. Often it's some kind of advertising--maybe 
for "hot phone sex" or quasi-legal pyramid schemes with 
subject lines such as "Make money fast!" In the early days of 
Usenet this never happened, but in 1993 immigration lawyers 
Lawrence Canter and Martha Siegel sent identical ads for 
their "green card" legal services to _every one_ of the 
thousands of Usenet groups that could be reached via their 
Internet provider, and other entrepreneurs were quick to see 
the potential in this technique. After all, many service 
providers charge a flat rate for net access, so that a user 
pays no more to send 1,000 messages than just one. 
     Obviously, if every business started using the net this 
way, the system would be overwhelmed. Netizens were 
predictably outraged; they mail-bombed the lawyers (sent them 
literally thousands of pieces of email), ordered magazine 
subscriptions in their names, sent them pizza, called them in 
the middle of the night and yelled at them, sent them 
thousands of pages of faxes, and generally did everything 
they could to make their lives miserable. 
     Joel Furr started selling T-shirts with a message 
ridiculing Canter and Siegel. They threatened a variety of 
legal actions against him, although they never actually filed 
a law suit, probably because dozens of other lawyers on the 
net made it clear that they were ready to help Furr with free 
legal services plus a potentially lucrative counter-suit. 
     Today, some companies offer to spam your message across 
Usenet for a fee. Two of these organizations place regular 
classified ads in _USA Today._ Jeffrey A. Slaton of 
Albuquerque, New Mexico came right out and called himself 
"Spam King"--prompting one newsgroup moderator to call for 
massive retaliation. After publicly listing Slaton's address 
and home phone number, the moderator went on: "I'm doing a 
social security number trace on him now, and trying to find 
out where he banks. I'm not certain, but I think he has some 
other employment as well...." 
     Not everyone feels comfortable about this commando-style 
retaliation. There is, in fact, an "approved" response to 
spam: cancellation. 
     Joel Furr co-moderates the news.admin.net-abuse.announce 
group where cases of spamming are reported on a daily basis. 
This group also lists each piece of spam that has been 
cancelled. Following another quirky, arcane system, a group 
of volunteers uses a complex mathematical formula based on 
how many groups have been hit by identical messages, or 
substantially similar messages, within a 45-day period. If 
the formula yields a high number, the volunteers cancel the 
offending message by issuing a special cancel instruction to 
all Internet sites, where news software responds by rendering 
the spam "unavailable" to anyone who tries to read it. 
     Cancelling messages used to be considered a kind of 
crime against the totally open spirit of Usenet. But now, 
according to Furr, "In some groups spam constitutes most of 
the traffic, and if you didn't control it people would stop 
bothering to read those groups. As a result, cancelling has 
become an essential function." 
     Really, this means that a form of net censorship already 
exists. It is absolutely not based on content--but it could 
be. 
     What would happen if a Usenet censor started cancelling 
"offensive" posts on a regular, methodical basis? His fate 
would be far worse than that of Canter and Siegel; worse even 
that the fate of Martin Rimm. He'd be a focus for 
unimaginably rabid hatred. 
     But suppose federal "decency" legislation puts the FCC 
in charge. Now a legally sanctioned government agency has the 
power to do cancels. This might be a First Amendment 
violation; but test cases can take years to reach the Supreme 
Court, and in the meantime, Usenet would be censored. 
     The consequences are hard to predict. Ornery system 
administrators might create some new protocol for swapping 
news via the net, just as they created Usenet in the first 
place. They might work via sites overseas, beyond the reach 
of American decency laws. 
     There's a popular belief on Usenet--really, an article 
of faith--that the net is so decentralized, no one will be 
able to censor it effectively, and the sheer volume of 
messages makes any kind of censorship impractical. 
     "There's no easy way to measure the traffic anymore," 
says Furr. "There used to be choke points where you could 
make measurements, but now there are some groups that cover 
the whole planet, and other groups at just one site, and no 
one really knows what's going on. It's at least a million 
messages a month, probably much higher, but that's the last 
figure with any reasonable accuracy." 
     Obviously controlling the content of Usenet isn't going 
to be easy, and any institution that tries to do it is going 
to face legal problems, practical difficulties, and a major 
grass-roots rebellion. 
     CompuServe has already learned this lesson the hard way. 
Late in December, 1995, it tackled the "alt.sex" problem by 
blocking all news groups with words such as "sex" or "gay" in 
their titles. Supposedly this was in response to a request 
from Bavarian officials who informed CompuServe that many of 
the groups violated German pornography laws. According to a 
journalist who works for _Der Spiegel,_ "Last summer, a kind 
of hysteria about Internet pornography broke out in German 
media. A few journalists had made their first steps in the 
Internet and discovered nasty postings in the 
alt.binaries,pictures.erotica Usenet hierarchy. ... Then, the 
_Time_ article about Internet porn was published and quoted 
by nearly every German newspaper." (This, of course, was 
Philip Elmer-DeWitt's cover story featuring Martin Rimm.) 
     Apparently, a German task force managed to get a search 
warrant for CompuServe's office in Munich, and according to a 
public prosecutor, the service provider was "quite 
cooperative. ... We sat together talking about chances to 
kick pornographic contents out of Compuserve's information 
system." Subsequently, CompuServe was given a list of more 
than 200 news groups that could be problematic, and the 
groups were banned a few days later. CompuServe claimed that 
it was unable to provide different versions of its service in 
different countries, and consequently, the ban affected every 
subscriber worldwide. 
     Like most censorship attempts, it produced some 
untintentionally absurd results. Brad Templeton, founder of 
the ClariNet news distribution system, noted that CompuServe 
didn't subscribe to his service but banned some of his news 
groups anyway--including clari.news.sex, which featured 
purely factual items such as "Vatican: Sex education not 
okay" and "China customs crack down on pornography imports." 
     Netizens were angry; it seemed to them that CompuServe 
was using the Bavarian complaint as a convenient excuse for 
getting rid of any material that could conceivably cause 
trouble at home. There were predictable shouts of outrage 
online, and some CompuServe members moved to services where 
the full range of Usenet was still available. Finally, after 
about a month of censorship, CompuServe was forced to back 
down. It lifted its embargo on almost all the news groups, 
although it still continued to block five that were suspected 
of carrying child pornography. 


     Shoot the Messenger      
     
     Throughout 1995 and into 1996, while federal legislation 
was being drafted, enacted, and then challenged in court, 
decency activists kept insisting on one basic principle: when 
an Internet service provider doesn't take proper precautions 
to protect children from viewing indecent material, it should 
be legally liable. 
     Some commentators saw this as a first step toward 
controlling the net. Writing in _Boardwatch_ magazine, 
editor-publisher Jack Rickard pointed out that it's "terribly 
inconvenient and expensive" for governments to prosecute 
thousands of separate individuals. "It would be much easier," 
he suggested, "to find some pressure point, some mass control 
lever.... So every online service provider becomes a target. 
... We are scapegoating online services in an attempt to make 
them responsible for acts over which they have no control. 
The theory is, if we do it long enough and hard enough, they 
will find some way to control those acts and do our dirty 
work for us." 
     Well, if news stands can keep sexually explicit material 
away from minors, why _shouldn't_ Internet service providers 
do the same thing? 
     Leaving aside free-speech legal issues, it simply isn't 
practical to expect system administrators to check the 
content of a million Usenet messages a month, plus graphics, 
plus email, plus online chat. Bearing this in mind, how can 
we accuse a site of being negligent if some pornography ends 
up on a child's computer screen? 
     Of course, sites could install software that scans text 
and recognizes "dangerous" keywords. Or a program could 
examine image files, check for the color and texture of naked 
skin, trace the outline of skin areas, and then look to see 
if there are any clothes covering the bodies. Far-fetched? 
Not necessarily; a program of this type has already been 
devised by David Forsyth at UC Berkeley. According to an 
abstract from his paper, his algorithm has "60% precision and 
52% recall on a test set of 138 uncontrolled images of naked 
people, mostly obtained from the Internet, and 1401 assorted 
control images, drawn from a wide collection of sources." 
     Still, creative net users will always find ways to fool 
censoring software. A simple way to thwart Forsyth's program 
would be to invert image colors before transmission. Taking 
this kind of approach to its simplest level, when Senator 
Exon first proposed to make it a criminal offense for people 
to say "fuck" online, Usenet contributors suggested using 
"Exon" as a four-letter substitute. No law against that, is 
there? 
     Robert Carr, a small software publisher in Boise, Idaho, 
started distributing a Macintosh program that would "exonize" 
_all_ offensive text for transmission, then decode it back 
into its offensive form at the other end. Titled "Hexon 
Exon," the program would input material such as this 
abbreviated excerpt from the newsgroup alt.drunken.bastards: 

          Last night I got shit-faced and pissed in my 
     pants. My girlfriend threw me out when I tried to grope 
     her tits and ass. What a bitch. 
          Fuck it! Life sucks. 

     --and would transform it into this safely "exonized" 
version, using names of suitable congresspeople: 

          Last night I got NUNN-faced drunk and BONDed in my 
     pants. My girlfriend threw me out when I tried to grope 
     her PELL and KYL. What a LUGAR. 
          Exon it! Life GOREs. 
     
     Censorship always begins to look silly where humor is 
involved. Back in 1988, Brad Templeton (who was then the 
owner of a small business named Looking Glass Software) 
became dissatisfied with a news group named rec.humor where 
the quality was often dismal. Templeton established a new 
group titled rec.humor.funny with himself as moderator, 
omitting jokes that he didn't find amusing. 
     Unfortunately, not everyone agreed with his judgment. 
Jonathan Richmond, a civil engineering graduate student at 
MIT, found one of Templeton's jokes highly offensive. He 
caused so much fuss, Templeton lost his distribution site at 
the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada. 
     News of this micro-scandal eventually reached Stanford 
University, California. After two months of vacillation, the 
vice-president for information resources decided to enforce a 
ban on rec.humor.funny. This generated the usual student 
backlash, including a protest petition endorsed by 100 
people, one of them the woman who had mentioned the problem 
of rec.humor.funny at Stanford in the first place. Bay Area 
newspapers picked up the story and denounced Stanford's ban. 
The president of the university referred the issue to the 
Academic Senate. The Academic Senate Steering Committee asked 
its Committee on Libraries for a recommendation. They 
responded with a statement saying that electronic media 
should be treated no differently from print media, and the 
ban should go. Ultimately, with bad grace, the administration 
followed the recommendation, and students were once more able 
to read rec.humor.funny. A couple years later, the University 
of Waterloo came to the same conclusion. 
     But what was the offensive joke that caused all this 
trouble? Here's a transcript: 

          A Scotsman and a Jew went to a restaurant. After a 
     hearty meal, the waitress came by with the inevitable 
     check. To the amazement of all, the Scotsman was heard 
     to say, "I'll pay it!" and he actually did. 
          The next morning's newspaper carried the news item: 
          "JEWISH VENTRILOQUIST FOUND MURDERED IN ALLEY." 

     Jonathan Richmond, the MIT student who raised the 
initial objection, was Jewish. He found the joke offensive 
because it demeaned Jews. 
     Maybe it's hard for some of us to take it as seriously 
as Richmond did. But some Jewish-related speech online is no 
joking matter at all. 


     Tracking the Hate Groups 

     Rabbi Marvin Hier is dean and founder of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance, located in the 
Los Angeles area. In May, 1995, he testified before another 
Senate group discussing "dangerous" netspeech. This time it 
was the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and 
Government Information. 
     According to Hier, the Wiesenthal institute "regularly 
monitors more than 240 hate groups, from neo-Nazi and Klan 
groups to Holocaust revisionists and Christian identity 
groups." Supposedly, more than 50 of these groups was found 
"utilizing various elements of cyberspace--from electronic 
bulletin boards to sophisticated web sites on the Internet. 
... Cyberspace has suddenly empowered marginal local groups, 
be they overt white supremacists or militias with racist ties 
like the Northern Regional Militia of Michigan. These groups 
market nationally, inflammatory videos and computerized files 
which fuel a conspiratorial, rabidly anti-government and 
often violent world view." 
     It's true that white supremacist views are easy to find 
online, in news groups such as alt.politics.white-power. 
Rabbi Hier wasn't suggesting that these discussion groups 
should be banned, because he realized this would be 
unconstitutional. Instead, he urged that large Internet 
service providers should refuse to carry the groups, just as 
CNN or _The Washington Post_ would refuse to carry 
advertising from "avowed racists or Nazis." 
     No one paid much attention to this suggestion, so the 
Wiesenthal Center escalated its attack. At the beginning of 
January, 1996 it circulated a letter to hundreds of Internet 
service providers pressuring them to block access to any 
Usenet groups or web pages that were spawning grounds for 
hate speech. The center even offered to assist service 
providers "in drafting a code of ethics." 
     Bearing in mind that the Internet functions like a 
telephone system, allowing people to exchange personal views, 
this call for a crackdown was like suggesting that AT&T 
should refuse to transmit phone calls from racists. Still, 
the Wiesenthal press release attracted some sympathetic 
publicity, facing Internet service providers with an 
unpleasant choice: impose a form of censorship, or be named 
as purveyors of antisemitic propaganda. 
     Most sites still refused to censor themselves. Some of 
them pointed out that the racist news groups actually served 
a useful purpose, providing a forum where holocaust 
revisionists could be debated and refuted. Even a group such 
as alt.politics.white-power usually contains dozens of 
messages arguing for tolerance and mocking the bigots. 
     There was a more fundamental issue, though, which no one 
mentioned: is hate speech was really as widespread as the 
Wiesenthal Center chose to imply? 
     At the Museum of Tolerance there is a map of America 
flagged with literally hundreds of "hate group" locations. By 
pressing numbered buttons, a visitor calls up more 
information about the groups. In many cases, this information 
suggests that "hate group" is not an accurate label. A group 
in New Jersey, for instance, turns out to consist of two 
"alleged" skinheads who burned down a warehouse more than 
five years ago and haven't been heard from since. 
     Online, maybe three or four out of more than 10,000 
Usenet groups have a racist agenda. There are also some web 
pages, the best known being sponsored by Ernst Zundel, who 
has spent a large part of his life trying to deny the Jewish 
holocaust. In January, 1996, shortly after the Wiesenthal 
Center circulated its press release, one of two telephone 
networks in Germany was persuaded by the German government to 
block access to Zundel's American web site so that his 
writings could not be viewed by German citizens. Since German 
law prohibits certain forms of speech about Nazism, the 
action was legally justified. Within a day, however, American 
free-speech activists such as Declan McCullagh (who had 
organized the anti-Rimm demonstration at CMU) started 
"mirroring" the Zundel site--duplicating its entire content 
on their own web sites, even though they disapproved of what 
Zundel had to say. The message was clear: if one web site was 
blacked out, half-a-dozen would take its place. A couple 
weeks later, German authorities were forced to admit that 
their effort at censorship had been a failure. 
     Here again, though, most press reports failed to mention 
a pertinent fact: most German citizens didn't bother to 
investigate Zundel's theories. One of the web sites that made 
his text available logged fewer than 200 "hits" in a one-week 
period, even though the site had received substantial 
publicity. Most people simply weren't interested. 
     In fact, racism is a much smaller problem on the net 
than in the everyday world. Netizens are generally 
uninterested in all forms of physical difference: age, 
disabilities, ethnicity, nationality, or race. It's common 
for people to swap messages without knowing any personal 
details about each other--even gender. Bearing this in mind, 
maybe it would make better sense for anti-racism activists to 
forget about the Internet and concentrate on racism in the 
physical world, where it is a very legitimate cause for 
concern. Likewise, since bomb recipes and incitements to 
violence are extremely rare online, law enforcement would 
deploy its resources more effectively on the streets of any 
American city. 
     Of course, some senators refused to see it that way. In 
the Senate Subcommittee hearings on Terrorism, Technology, 
and Government Information, subcommittee chairman Arlen 
Specter suggested that some material on the net--bomb-making 
information, in particular--posed a "clear and present 
danger" to American life. Since speech that poses such a 
danger is not protected under the Constitution, Specter 
seemed to be finding a rationale, here, for censorship. 
     The Department of Justice respectfully disagreed. Robert 
Litt, Deputy Assistant Attorney General from the Criminal 
Division, told the senators what they should have already 
known: a bomb recipe, on its own, is protected speech. 
Moreover, when Litt was asked if he had any statistics or 
direct knowledge of a crime resulting from someone getting 
information from the Internet, he had to admit that there had 
never been a single case of this kind. The "threat" of 
terrorist information on the net was being exaggerated even 
more than the "threat" of hate speech or online pornography--
and there was no way to pass a constitutional law against it 
anyway. 
     In the words of Scott Charney, the leading expert on 
computer crime at the Department of Justice: "Speech that 
incites imminent lawlessness or incitement to riot may not be 
protected, but generally speaking you cannot punish people 
even for reprehensible speech. As soon as you start talking 
about regulating speech, you have to ask who regulates it and 
where do you draw the lines, and you realize it's completely 
unworkable." 
    The challenge of regulating online content thus seems 
thorny at best and insoluble at worst. Will it be any easier 
to control access and distribution?

     The State of the States 

     Decency groups such as the Christian Coalition or Enough 
is Enough are far more powerful than vigilantes such as the 
CyberAngels because they're properly organized and savvy 
about political power. They not only maintain paid lobbyists 
in Washington; in some cases their members work as aides to 
conservative legislators. When some sort of federal online 
decency law ultimately survives constitutional challenges, 
almost certainly it will have been drafted with the aid and 
advice of fundamentalist Christian activists. 
     Federal lawmaking is a slow process, though. Back in the 
summer of 1995, when Senator Exon had only just begun waving 
his famous binder of bestiality pictures on the nightly news, 
many states had already pushed through laws of their own to 
control content online. In fact, some of these laws at the 
local level went even farther than Senator Exon wanted to go. 
     In Kansas, for instance, a law now exists to prohibit 
netizens from making "indecent comments" via their computer 
keyboards. 
     Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, North Dakota, and 
South Dakota have all broadened existing laws covering phone 
calls to include computer communications. As a result, in 
these states it is now a criminal act to send email that is 
obscene, vulgar, offensive, or liable to cause "annoyance" 
(the exact wording varies from state to state). 
     Even if you live elsewhere, you could still be 
prosecuted for sending a message _to_ someone in a state that 
has net-decency legislation. 
     The new state laws controlling online speech have 
attracted hardly any attention. Most netizens remained 
blissfully unaware of what was happening, and there have been 
no test cases, yet, to make people aware of the legislation. 
But local prosecutors have already taken advantage of pre-
existing obscenity laws that were worded so loosely, they 
could be applied to computer graphics just as easily as to 
printed magazines. 
     At the local level, the effects have been traumatic--
especially for BBS owners. Even family-oriented bulletin 
boards usually have adult sections containing some sexy 
pictures, which makes them fair game for local decency 
crusaders. It's simple enough for a local DA to get a search 
warrant, seize the equipment, and net himself a TV appearance 
where he can claim to be fighting the good fight against 
cyberporn. Conservative voters feel reassured, the DA gets 
reelected--while the system owner has his equipment seized 
and finds himself forced to defend himself in court. 


     A Lawman's BBS 

     Lorne Shantz learned about this the hard way. For years 
he operated a BBS out of his home in Phoenix, Arizona. He was 
careful to stay within the law; in fact, Shantz _was_ the 
law. He worked for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, 
in the Highway Patrol. Many of his colleagues in law 
enforcement used to log onto his system, and so did at least 
one judge and one prosecutor. 
     All this changed abruptly in November, 1994 when 
Shantz's computer was seized because it allegedly contained 
obscene materials and child pornography. Shantz protested 
that he had maintained a strict policy prohibiting 
pornographic uploads. Still, he was immediately suspended 
from his job. 
     Four months later, he was indicted by a grand jury. The 
day after that, County Attorney Rick Romley held a press 
conference claiming that his office was "cutting new ground" 
in the war against cyberporn. 
     It turned out that three pictures on Shantz's BBS were 
of women under 18 years of age--according to the prosecutor's 
office. The age was estimated by using the Tanner Scale, a 
rule of thumb devised by doctors to estimate a woman's age by 
measuring breast development and pubic hair. Shantz objected 
that the scale was vague and was based on caucasian women, 
while the pictures on his board were of Asian women whose 
sexual characteristics mature later. His objections were 
ignored. 
     His BBS also contained some pictures of bestiality. 
Shantz readily agreed that those should not have been there--
but he said he had never seen them. They were included on a 
CD-ROM that he had bought by mail order. It was labeled "BBS 
Ready," so Shantz had assumed it was legal. He had sampled a 
couple of pictures, found they were no different from poses 
in _Penthouse,_ and didn't bother to check the other 
thousands of images on the disc. 
     The prosecutor's office ignored this defense, also. 
"We're talking hard-core obscenity," said Barnett Lottstein, 
Special Assistant to the County Attorney, speaking on the 
nightly news. "Mr. Shantz had an _obligation_ to know what 
was on his bulletin board." 
     Well--did he? The grand jury agreed to press charges, 
but Shantz's lawyer complained that Shantz had never had a 
chance to explain himself. The prosecutor had somehow 
forgotten to notify him of his right to testify. When a 
second Grand Jury was convened, they had a chance to listen 
to Shantz, they believed he had acted in good faith, and they 
let him go free. 
     "Almost every BBS around here used to have an adult 
section," commented Jonathan Gillies, 31, a networking 
engineer and former BBS owner. "Lorne actually took more 
trouble than most of them, posting notices warning people not 
to upload certain types of picture, and demanding proof of 
age." 
     According to Gillies, the real value of Shantz's board 
had nothing to do with its erotic content. "This was one of 
the best information resources we had in Phoenix. I made some 
valuable contacts with people using the message base, and 
there was an enormous amount of shareware programs. Plus, he 
had Internet connectivity." 
     If the grand jury hadn't thrown out the charges, Shantz 
would have found himself in court around the spring or summer 
of 1996, during the run-up to the November elections. 
According to Gillies, "Everyone suspected that this whole 
thing was done by Rick Romley to get back into office." 
     Shantz certainly believed this. "The only reason they 
picked on me was they thought it would help Romley get 
reelected," he said. "What happened to me was an abuse of 
prosecutorial power." (A spokesperson at the County 
Attorney's Office refused to comment on the case.) 
     Shantz ended up beating the charges, but he endured six 
months of anxiety and unemployment, he ran up $30,000 in 
legal fees, the police held onto his computer equipment until 
they were legally compelled to return it, and to get his job 
back Shantz had to start a new court battle that promised to 
cost him at least another $20,000. 
     Meanwhile, even though the charges were thrown out, a 
spokesperson for the prosecutor said he hoped the case would 
send a message to all BBS owners in the area. And that's 
exactly what happened. According to local observers, half-a-
dozen BBS operators shut down their systems after they saw 
what happened to Lorne Shantz, and many others who stayed in 
business closed their adult sections just to be on the safe 
side. 
     This is the real danger posed by a local prosecution: 
its effects spread far beyond the site that is actually hit. 


     An Exercise in Paranoia 

     Robert Carr, who circulated the "Hexon Exon" program to 
"exonize" offensive speech, also runs a small BBS in Boise, 
Idaho. He used to offer a huge library of counterculture 
files including erotic stories and his own video games 
mocking religious fundamentalists and the hardcore right. In 
August, 1994 Carr's picture was published in _Wired_ magazine 
as a defiant, anarchist sysop, armed and dangerous. 
     One year later Carr was still armed but no longer so 
dangerous. The erotic stories had gone from his BBS, along 
with most of the games. "The final straw," he said, "came 
when the local police were looking for some kids who had been 
setting off pipe bombs. The kids hadn't actually hurt anyone, 
but the police announced they were going to come online, find 
the source of the bomb recipes, and eradicate it. Also, a 
year previously, a couple of boards had been shut down where 
teenagers were trading GIFs. I couldn't risk getting raided 
because my neighborhood is so conservative, the publicity 
could cost me my job." 
     Carr took everything that he regarded as potentially 
dangerous off his system. He now feels that the BBS scene 
will never be the same again. "When I first started my board, 
it was fun. You could put anything online and nobody cared. 
These days, I have to examine every upload to make sure no 
one's planting something. Running a board has become an 
exercise in paranoia." 
     At One BBScon, the national BBS convention that took 
place in August, 1995 in Tampa, Florida, similar stories were 
told by sysops from all over America. Many of them had toned 
down their libraries of erotica or had removed them 
altogether. There was a mood of caution tinged with fear--not 
because of federal legislation, but because of local 
harassment. 
     The most shocking example of state law enforcement 
running amok occurred in Cincinnati. Here was a classic case 
of systematic intimidation in the online world, chilling free 
speech and shutting down businesses with complete disregard 
for anyone's constitutional rights. 


     Self-Taught Sysop Loses All 

     Bob Emerson is a big, friendly, cheerful midwesterner 
who looks like Santa Claus without the hair and the beard. 
Bob says that one of his guiding principles in life has 
always been to make a living by doing things that are fun, 
and he's succeeded pretty well at putting his principles into 
practice. He had a weakness hot-rodding, so he opened an auto 
accessory store specializing in high-performance parts. He 
got interested in video in the early 1980s, so he opened the 
first video rental store in Cincinnati. It was the same kind 
of thing with his computer bulletin board: he was one of the 
pioneers, starting it out of his own home in 1984, and he 
built it up as a labor of love. 
     Like most of Bob's ventures, the board was successful. 
He had no formal training in computers or electronics, but he 
taught himself what he needed to know, and for a total 
investment of around $45,000 he ended up with a Novell 
network of twenty-three computers serving about 6,000 
subscribers over twenty phone lines. Bob even added Internet 
access, with email service and a Usenet feed. 
     In 1995, he lost it all. 
     He was working in his auto accessory store with his son 
one Friday morning when the phone rang. "It was one of my 
neighbors," he says, "calling to tell me that it looked like 
a SWAT team was in the driveway outside my home. I assumed 
someone must have broken into the house, so I jumped in the 
car and headed over there. I found eight or ten cops, two or 
three police cruisers, and a big black sheriff's van parked 
in the street. And they were all waiting just for me." 
     Emerson found himself served with a search warrant. 
"There was nothing I could do to stop them. They went in the 
house, and the first thing they did was pull out all the 
phone lines. Then they asked me to show them where everything 
was at on my system. I asked them if they would let me keep 
my computers if I did what they wanted, and they said no. I 
said the heck with that, I wasn't going to show them 
anything. So they took it all away, twenty-three computers, 
and the monitors and hard drives. Plus they even took my 
grandchild's multimedia machine which we just use for running 
games." 
     The search warrant listed forty-five graphics files that 
the police believed were obscene, but Bob claims he had gone 
out of his way to be discreet and stay on the right side of 
the law. "The adult area of the board wasn't even listed on 
the main screen," he says. "To get access to it, people had 
to come to me _in person_ so I could make sure they were of 
age. I made absolutely no extra charge for the adult section; 
it was just an extra free service for people who wanted it. I 
estimate that it only amounted to three percent of the total 
usage." 
     A longtime active member of Bob's BBS who describes 
herself as a Christian churchgoer confirms that this was his 
policy. "I was given access myself," she says, "and I looked 
around. What he had and what I saw was what you'd see in 
_Playboy_ and _Penthouse._ I decided it was not for me, so I 
simply stayed away from that section in future." 
     Most users had no idea that the X-rated pictures were 
available. "I used the board for about a year and a half," 
says Steve Guest, who runs a network consultancy business 
named PC Plus. "I hadn't a clue that there was an adult area. 
There was no way for the average user to know that it 
existed." Guest says that he used Bob's board mainly for its 
email and file transfer facilities. "We have five engineers," 
he explains, "and almost 90 percent of our business is 
outside the local area. The BBS was basically our mailbox. 
Ironically, I selected the board because it was among the 
cleanest, most family-oriented that I could find. People on 
the system didn't use any bad language, and I never found any 
pirated software." 
     So why was Bob's equipment seized? One simple answer: 
Local politics. 


     The Sheriff of Hamilton County 

     In Cincinnati, a museum exhibition of photographs by 
Robert Mapplethorpe was shut down by 125 sheriff's deputies 
in SWAT uniforms, carrying automatic weapons. The subsequent 
trial created national publicity. 
     In Cincinnati, _Hustler_'s publisher Larry Flynt had to 
fight in court for the right to distribute his magazine 
through local vendors. 
     In Cincinnati, there are no adult bookstores. One by 
one, they have all been shut down. 
     The man who takes most of the credit for this relentless 
campaign is Simon Leis, sheriff of Hamilton County, which 
covers a large part of the Cincinnati area. Sources close to 
Leis report that he is a devout Catholic who attends church 
every day. (Leis himself refused to accept phone calls in 
connection with this investigation, and no one from his 
office would comment.) Without a doubt, moralistic behavior 
is an entrenched tradition in Leis's family: his father, a 
judge, used to fight smut back in the 1940s. 
     Leis lost in the Mapplethorpe trial, and he lost the 
case against Larry Flynt. In fact, according to local 
attorneys, Leis has lost every obscenity battle that has gone 
to appeal. But still, he has won the war. His policy of 
raiding bookstores and seizing the merchandise has 
discouraged anyone from running similar businesses in 
Cincinnati. 
     To understand the connection between Leis and Bob 
Emerson we have to go back to 1982, when Bob started his 
video rental business. It included an adult section, which he 
ran just as discreetly as his BBS. "The adult stuff was not 
displayed," he says. "If you wanted it, you had to pick it 
off a list of titles, and it was given to you in a plain 
black box." 
     There was a Catholic church on the opposite side of the 
street, and members of the congregation rented tapes from 
Bob's store all the time--because most of his stock was 
family oriented. Patty Volz has been a member of that church 
all her life and was one of Bob's first customers. "I never 
had a problem with the adult section," she says. "You could 
bring anyone into the store, your grandmother or a child, and 
never be ashamed, because nothing offensive was displayed. I 
was raised in a strict Catholic environment but I believe 
that what people choose to watch in the privacy of their own 
homes is no one else's business. This is freedom of choice, 
and that's what's America is based on. Personally I don't 
even like to see people rent violent movies for their 
children. That to me is offensive. But I have no business 
telling them what they should or shouldn't spend their money 
on, and I don't think Simon Leis has any business doing that 
either." 
     But where Bob's store was concerned, Leis had a problem. 
The store was located just outside the sheriff's 
jurisdiction. 
     Still, Leis had a friend: Charles H. Keating, a 
Cincinnati native and lifelong anti-smut crusader (later 
imprisoned in connection with the savings and loan scandal). 
Richard Nixon appointed Keating to the Commission on 
Obscenity and Pornography back in 1969, to add a conservative 
voice to the basically liberal group. 
     In Cincinnati during the late 1980s, Keating created 
Concerned Citizens for Community Values, and they compelled 
the prosecutor in that county to act on their complaint 
against Bob Emerson's video store. The prosecutor charged Bob 
with violating state obscenity laws, took him to court--and 
lost. He tried again, and and lost again. He kept trying and 
kept losing, seven times in a row. 
     Bob was told by his attorney that Simon Leis had offered 
to help the local prosecutor on an informal basis. Having 
cleaned up Cincinnati, the sheriff wanted to extend his reach 
into the suburbs. Unfortunately for Leis, officials in 
neighboring counties were reluctant to cooperate with him and 
insisted on running their own anti-smut campaigns; but in 
1995, something happened to change all that. 
     "Cyberporn" had become a hot issue. News coverage had 
been so intense, many people were under the impression that 
the online world was a cesspool of smut threatening the 
safety of their children. Meanwhile, it happened that the 
Cincinnati area was well supplied with bulletin boards--more 
than 200 of them, serving more than 20,000 users, according 
to one estimate--and many of the boards had adult sections 
featuring explicit photographs. 
     Sheriff Leis finally had his opportunity for a vote-
getting crusade that no elected official could afford to 
ignore. He put together his coalition, a Regional Computer 
Crimes Task Force containing personnel from two counties in 
Ohio and one across the border in Kentucky. (Cincinnati sits 
right on the state line.) It was a great new way to reach out 
and bust someone; and with so many tempting targets, the only 
problem was deciding who to hit first. 
     Bob Emerson was the obvious choice. His video store had 
defied Leis's ideas of decency for more than a decade, and 
unlike Cincinnati bookstore owners, Bob had refused to be 
intimidated. 
     The sheriff could now teach him a lesson. 


     Net Users Strike Back 

     On the day when the task force confiscated his 
computers, Bob recalls one of the cops telling him that he 
seemed to be taking it very calmly. "What do you expect me to 
do?" Bob said. "Jump up and down?" 
     Indeed, Emerson describes himself as an amiable, laid-
back kind of guy. "I don't start anything," he says. But 
then, thoughtfully, he adds: "If somebody pushes me, I do 
push back. I love my country and the freedom that it stands 
for. To me, these people are trying to take away my freedoms, 
and that pisses me off." 
     The very next day after the bust, Bob Emerson went out 
and bought $17,000 of hardware. By Sunday, he had his board 
up and running again. 
     Then he hired Louis Sirkin, president of the local First 
Amendment Lawyers Association. One week later, Sirkin filed a 
suit on behalf of Bob Emerson against Simon Leis and a long 
list of other city employees and departments. Citing 
violations of constitutional rights, the suit requested a 
quarter million dollars in damages. 
     This wasn't all. Steve Guest, the networking consultant, 
decided to push things a step farther. "I'm not a political 
person," he says. "I never get involved in political 
crusades. But in this case, I just got angry. I put out a 
message asking if anyone was interested in helping with a law 
suit on behalf of the users, and I got 200 messages in the 
first day. So I hired a local lawyer to look into it, and he 
found some other attorneys who were experienced in this 
area." 
     Guest still sounds surprised that he got involved. "You 
have to understand," he says, "I'm a conservative kind of 
guy, I'm not a liberal. But Simon Leis--how can I put it 
nicely? I guess I can't. Leis is a Nazi. We just couldn't let 
a corrupt official get away with this. He has to pay for 
forcing his beliefs on everyone else. He's violating the 
basic principles on which this country was founded." 
     Guest is now the first person listed in an unprecedented 
class-action suit filed on behalf of _all_ Bob Emerson's BBS 
users who were deprived of access and had their email 
illegally seized. The suit demands the statutory maximum of 
$11,000 compensation _per person_, plus punitive damages. 
Bearing in mind that Bob's system served at least 5,000 
people, the total compensation could be over $50 million. 
     The filing of this suit was good news for Bob Emerson 
and his online community; but Bob was not the only one who 
had been targeted by the task force. Four other BBS owners 
were raided on the same day--and they didn't have his ability 
to push back. 
     Steve Brown, aged 44, is married with two daughters and 
lives in a neighborhood that he modestly describes as working 
class. Daytime, Steve has a full-time job as a salesperson. 
He started his BBS as a hobby, serving 520 people via just 
one phone line and a single 486SX computer. He kept the 
computer and a couple of CD-ROM drives sitting on a ping-pong 
table in the basement of his suburban home. 
     He was at work when his wife called to tell him that 
police were taking his BBS apart. "I got a sick feeling in my 
stomach," Steve recalls. "I spoke to the cops on the phone, 
and they asked me which computer ran the BBS. I told them. 
Then they asked me where the CD-ROMs were. I told them that, 
too. Then they went to my personal system, which requires a 
CMOS password to get in. I explained that it had nothing to 
do with the BBS. I gave them my password so they could see 
for themselves. But the guy mistyped it, and he got mad and 
just said, 'take it.' So they seized that as well. And it's 
got my finances, my tax records, my whole life in there." 
     Steve says he was shell-shocked for days afterward. "It 
was a nightmare, except that each day I woke up, and it was 
real." He was afraid he would lose his job because the police 
released his photograph to local newspapers and TV stations, 
and they alleged there had been kiddieporn on the BBS. 
     Like Bob Emerson, Steve had allowed users to upload 
material freely. He had no idea what people put there. This 
meant he couldn't even respond to the police allegations, 
because he hadn't seen what they claimed they had found. He 
still doesn't know what the pictures portray. 
     In the months since the bust, Steve has not tried to 
replace his BBS. He says he's through with it; he doesn't 
want any more hassles. 
     The experience has deepened his general distrust of 
government. "I feel they have gone far beyond their duties, 
to the point of malicious persecution of me and my family," 
he says. "I just don't understand what's happening in this 
country. There's always some law coming out that doesn't make 
a whole lot of sense. You know, they just passed a law here 
that if your teenager is found smoking, they can come and 
arrest the parents? Incredible. The fact is, Americans are 
not as free as we think we are." 
     Lorne Shantz, whose system was seized in Phoenix, feels 
the same way. "Let's face it," he says, "our judicial system 
is ill and needs curing. We have to make sure that the 
government remains accountable to us, the people. The federal 
situation is bad enough, but what's going on at the state 
level is more frightening--because they're getting away with 
more than the feds. Big brother has got his nose where it 
does not belong." 
     This from the man who spent fourteen years as a law 
enforcement officer. 


     A Chilling Effect 

     There is a plus side. Scott Greenwood runs a Cincinnati 
law firm (Greenwood & Associates) concentrating on 
constitutional law. He coauthored the class-action suit on 
behalf of Bob Emerson's BBS users, and from Greenwood's 
perspective, Sheriff Leis's men have created a golden 
opportunity. "We're suing the hell out of the sheriff's 
department," he says with cheerful relish. "What the police 
did was totally outrageous, like walking into a post office 
and taking all the mail because one person receives hardcore 
magazines from Denmark. The police didn't need to take 
anything away; they already knew which files they wanted on 
the BBS. They could have copied them onto a few floppy disks. 
If the government can shut down a computer system because one 
individual sees something he doesn't like, then the whole 
communications system of the country is under attack. You 
could just as well shut down a phone switch because organized 
crime is using it." 
     Collaborating with Greenwood on the suit is Peter D. 
Kennedy of George, Donaldson, and Ford, located in Austin, 
Texas. The firm has defended major media clients such as _The 
Wall Street Journal_ and Time-Warner. Kennedy is their 
resident expert on computer law and has also consulted for 
nationwide Internet service providers. He was the lead trial 
counsel in the case of Steve Jackson Games vs. U.S. Secret 
Service, which ended in 1993 with the Secret Service being 
fined for seizing email illegally. 
     Kennedy is not as emphatic as Greenwood. He has an 
erudite, low-key manner. Still, he's openly scornful of 
Cincinnati officials and can itemize a dozen deficiencies in 
the way that the search warrant was requested, issued, and 
applied. And yes, he says it all comes down to politics. "A 
lot of state prosecutors are elected," he says matter-of-
factly. "Federal prosecutors are not elected. That can make a 
big difference in how they behave over issues such as 
cyberporn." 
     In other words, when there's a vote-getting issue, a 
state prosecutor has a strong incentive to do stuff that will 
play well on TV. 
     "Compare what happened in Cincinnati with the federal 
investigators who went looking for child pornography at 
America Online," Kennedy goes on. "Investigators didn't seize 
computers at AOL, they didn't take email, and the system 
stayed up. They used legal process to order AOL to produce 
particular information about particular suspected users. This 
is what is required under the Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act: you have to state precisely what you're looking 
for. Federal law enforcement is now getting the message, 
slowly. But there are fifty states with hundreds of country 
prosecutors apiece who are way behind on the learning curve. 
We're now trying to teach them the lesson that the federal 
people learned in the Steve Jackson case." 
     In fact, Greenwood and Kennedy are trying to set an 
additional precedent, claiming that messages exchanged semi-
publicly in forums on Bob Emerson's system should be 
protected under a separate, noncomputer law, the Privacy 
Protection Act of 1980. 
     "This act traditionally protects a reporter's news 
notes," explains Greenwood. "Our theory is that sending 
messages via Usenet or a BBS conference is the functional 
equivalent of publishing. After all, companies like Lexis 
refer to themselves as being in electronic publishing, when 
all they do is send formatted data." 
     Unfortunately, this kind of civil suit can take a year 
or more to reach trial; and in the meantime, Sheriff Leis 
shows no sign of changing his ways. At the end of August, 
1995 his task force raided and seized several _more_ boards--
this time, systems that were being used by alleged hackers 
and phone phreaks. 
     Commenting on this, Greenwood's voice takes on a tone of 
amazement bordering on awe. "The sheriff just doesn't know 
any boundaries," he says. "Some kids were shaken down who are 
just users of these boards. The sheriff has already prompted 
two law suits, and if he continues doing this--well, there 
will be more." 
     Greenwood agrees that state officials are far more 
worrisome than federal law enforcement. "The Exon amendment 
was horrifying," he says, "but it's worse on the state level. 
For instance, the overwhelming majority of obscenity 
prosecutions are brought by state prosecutors--and given the 
hysteria over cyberporn, we're going to see more activity of 
this type." 
     Also, when new laws are created, it tends to happen 
faster at the state level than in Congress. While Senator 
Orrin Hatch was introducing his bill to criminalize the 
"repulsive conduct" of producing simulated child pornography 
using image-retouching software, similar legislation had 
already been signed into law in Illinois and Nevada, making 
it a crime to create, distribute, or possess sexually 
explicit computer representations of minors even if real 
children have not been harmed. These laws could be applied to 
BBS owners and Internet service providers, even when they 
were genuinely unaware of the material on their systems. 
     Introducing his bill, Mr. Hatch remarked that online 
services have evolved so fast, the law "has failed to keep 
pace with technology." But on the local level this simply 
isn't true. State legislators have moved far faster than most 
people realize, and one gung-go anti-smut crusader like Simon 
Leis is all it takes to activate the new laws, terrify 
service providers, and eradicate constitutionally protected 
speech literally overnight. 
     In Cincinnati the BBS raids have had a massively 
chilling effect. Bob Emerson estimates that more than twenty 
local boards have stopped operating rather than risk being 
raided, and other sysops have reacted like Robert Carr, 
removing any material that might possibly offend a decency 
crusader. 
     Users, also, have felt the impact. "Have I been 
chilled?" asks one person who prefers not to be named, but 
lives in the Cincinnati area. "I certainly have.... What 
happened where I live may seem to be an isolated incident to 
most people. But ... the mindset that brought it about is 
not. This will occur in other parts of the U.S. It's a shame, 
but our own local law enforcement authorities are a greater 
threat to our free speech rights than are any of the 
politicians and bureaucrats in Washington." 
     Bob Emerson fought back, and by spending a large chunk 
of money, he kept his BBS up and running. Even so, it has 
been affected by the raids. Many people have chosen not to 
renew their memberships, and there's a new air of caution 
even in text messages in the chat areas where citizens now 
feel that anything they say may be monitored and possibly 
used against them. 
     Sheriff Simon Leis may lose this battle in court just 
like all the others he has lost over the years. But outside 
the courtroom, once again he has already won the war. The 
Cincinnati BBS scene has been radically altered, and the 
freedoms that have been lost will be hard to restore. Worse 
still, each time there's a local crackdown, other systems 
scattered across America will be temped to censor themselves.      
In January, 1996, a site in Wisconsin claiming to be the 
largest BBS in America announced that it was eliminating 
about 50,000 files containing adult material. Its founder was 
quoted in the _Tampa Tribune_ as saying that "Since it is 
only seven percent of our service and it could result in the 
100 percent loss of our business, the risk is not worth it." 
     And so, camly and quietly, with hardly any publicity, 
the retreat from free speech continues. 


     The Loyal Opposition 

     The only organization fighting for online freedoms 
through affiliates in all fifty states is the ACLU. 
     "Where we have had some time to react," says Ann Beeson, 
ACLU's net expert in New York, "we have been generally 
successful in defeating state bills. We are now considering 
constitutional challenges to bills that passed this year." 
     Beeson joined ACLU in February, 1995 to fill a new 
position that had been established for an activist 
specializing in First Amendment issues in cyberspace. In less 
than a year she became a central figure in the fight for free 
speech online. During 1995, working as an attorney and as a 
public-relations spokesperson, she helped students whose 
universities censored net access, she organized lobbying 
efforts opposing the Exon amendment, co-wrote a statement 
opposing key-escrow encryption, launched a biweekly online 
cyber-liberties newsletter, and worked with ACLU affiliates 
to fight several state bills that threatened to impose net 
censorship locally. In New York and Washington state, the 
bills were stopped.  
     "Ann has definitely taken the lead in bringing the voice 
of the ACLU to the net," comments Mike Godwin, legal counsel 
at EFF. 
     The ACLU is located on West 43rd Street, Manhattan's 
theater district, which rubs elbows with the sleaze district, 
probably the greatest gathering of peep shows and adult video 
stores in America. The ACLU building has an old, gray facade, 
and the ground-floor lobby has a low-rent look, bare and dim-
lit, with no air conditioning, just a massive old 1930s fan 
pointing at a guard behind a desk. For no obvious reason, on 
the day I happened to be there twenty cartons of C-fold paper 
towels were dumped in one corner beneath the fierce gaze of 
Roger Baldwin, the principal founder of the ACLU, who stares 
down from a large oil painting on the brown marble wall. A 
plaque above an old leather couch explains that after Baldwin 
established the ACLU in 1920, he spearheaded battles for free 
speech during World War II and subsequently during the 
McCarthy hearings. 
     The building's upper floors have been renovated, but 
they still have a utilitarian look. One hallway is crowded 
with old four-drawer file cabinets. Another stores a stack of 
five-gallon water bottles. There are frequent reminders of 
liberal causes: near the elevator a sign points to the 
Lesbian and Gay Rights project, and above a recycling bin a 
poster says, "You don't need to have a home to have a voice. 
every American citizen has the right to vote--including 
homeless people." 
     Beeson seems a little less PC than this. Her office 
doorknob bears a little sign that says "Come on in, relax, 
take your clothes off." Inside, she's a slim, dark-haired, 
and stylishly dressed, looking more like a Fortune 500 
employee than the media stereotype of a dowdy rights 
activist. 
     Her personal passion for free speech turns out to be 
quite complex and slightly paradoxical. "Before I went to law 
school," she says, "I did a masters in cultural anthropology. 
As you can imagine, this means I am a cultural relativist. I 
believe in the legitimacy of every culture and set of 
beliefs. Consequently I am well aware that our notion of free 
speech is a particularly American value. To say that it's 
supposed to be the supreme value that trumps all others is a 
culturally situated point of view." 
     By this logic, if Americans impose free speech on other 
cultures they're guilty of cultural imperialism. 
     "But," Beeson goes on, "if there are all these different 
belief systems out there, what are the fundamental goals that 
allow all that diversity to happen? One of them has to be 
freedom of speech." 
     In other words, free speech is necessary to _permit_ 
cultural diversity. 
     Religious conservatives, of course, don't see it that 
way. They feel that some forms of speech are powerful enough 
to erode Christian principles and family values. 
     Beeson totally rejects this point of view. "To talk 
about something is never to destroy it. What if we tried to 
prevent conservatives from talking about _their_ values? It 
should be possible for everyone to speak freely and still 
protect particular points of view. Minority communities would 
actually be better protected in a world in which everyone's 
speech is allowed rather than one in which a majority point 
of view is imposed." 
     Should there be any limits at all on free speech? 
     "I think I would stick by the famous test that there 
should be no penalties unless the speech is an immediate 
incitement to imminent personal violence. Imminent assault." 
     But surely the new technology of the net changes 
everything. It has the power to cross boundaries and invade 
communities more intrusively than any other communications 
medium. 
     Beeson rejects this argument, too. "This battle has been 
fought with every new form of communication," she points out. 
"The ACLU has seen it in their entire history, a new medium 
coming along which people want to censor. Allowing freedom to 
flourish has never yet caused those conservative communities 
to fall apart. Somehow they still manage to thrive." 
     Does she see anything bad about the net? 
     "The positive aspect of free peer to peer communication 
is also the negative aspect: there's a lot of junk out there. 
But it's truly the most democratizing medium we've seen." 
     Beeson speaks rapidly and seems businesslike. Her 
mannerisms are pure New York--but her accent is southern. "I 
come from a very conservative Republican family," she 
explains, "from Texas originally, where 'ACLU' is a four 
letter word." She laughs happily. "In fact, I think my dad's 
the one who coined that phrase. My parents are very 
supportive, but when someone asks them what their daughter 
does they say it under their breath." 
     Before she signed on at ACLU she was an activist at 
Human Rights Watch where she was "working on global free 
expression and cyberspace issues." She moved to ACLU partly 
because she liked the idea of having some influence over the 
evolution of net law. "These are cutting-edge legal issues, a 
chance to be involved in precedents which are just now being 
fought in the courts. I never even considered the alternative 
of a job in corporate law, I've always been involved in 
public interest issues." 
     Why? She shrugs. "I like to advance the cause of what I 
see as justice and fairness." 
     And this, to her, does not allow _any_ form of 
censorship. "More speech is always better than less speech. 
The traditionally disempowered groups are always the ones 
that are hurt by censorship legislation. The perfect example 
of that is the MacKinnon [anti-pornography] legislation, 
which is very popular in Canada and was used right off the 
bat to target gay and lesbian bookstores, _not_ mysoginistic 
literature. The same goes for universities that have similar 
policies, which are used much more against minority groups on 
campus." 
     Ann Beeson's enthusiasm and idealism are infectious. She 
comes across as an exceptionally smart, decent, caring 
person. But statements such as "more speech is always better 
than less speech" can be slightly misleading in that they 
create a mental image of a serious debate rather than racist 
denunciations or dirty pictures. Sometimes, online speech can 
be so extreme, it offends just about everyone--including some 
liberals. 


     The Four Little Pigs 

     Late in October, 1995, four male students at Cornell 
University amused themselves by compiling a deliberately 
offensive document titled "Top 75 reasons why women (bitches) 
should not have freedom of speech." Subtitled "Let's go back 
to the good old days when men were men and women were ribs," 
the list began like this: 

     1. She doesn't need to talk to get me a beer. 
     2. If she's in the kitchen like she should be, no 
        one can hear her anyway. 
     3. If she can talk, all she'll do is complain. 
     4. Because she won't say "I will" instead of "I do." 
     5. No man wants to hear "first down" during a 
        basketball game. 

...and ended like this: 

     71. Hell, if I wanted your opinion, I'd give it to you. 
     72. "Where've you been?" Who the fuck are you, my 
         mother? 
     73. Women on radio? You can't see them, do you really 
         want to hear them? 
     74. Unless the words are "Doctor, can you make these 
         bigger?", shut the fuck up. 
     75. Big breasts should speak for themselves. 

     The list wasn't posted on Usenet and wasn't widely 
distributed. Each of the students sent it to a few friends, 
and under normal circumstances, that should have been the 
beginning and the end of it. 
     But in the age of the Internet, circumstances weren't 
normal anymore. One of the people who received the list 
didn't think it was funny. She circulated some extra copies 
as an example of sexism run amok. The copies generated more 
copies, and within a couple of days--well, it was the same 
old story. The information just wanted to be free. 
     The boys who wrote the original version had signed their 
real names but omitted their email addresses. This omission 
was soon rectified, which was easy enough to do, since a 
single Unix command to the site at Cornell would compel it to 
reveal the email address of _any_ student (or faculty 
member). 
     Now the backlash began. The students were bombarded with 
hundreds of angry messages, including hate mail and death 
threats from outraged feminists. The university itself also 
received countless complaints, and the "75 reasons" list was 
condemned as a form of sexual harassment. Many people wanted 
the students to be suspended or expelled. 
     Vanessa Hosein, a senior psychology major at Boston 
College, went on record as saying that she and her friends at 
the Women's Center were considering whether to crash the 
entire Cornell email system in retaliation against the four 
male students. "These people are incredibly stupid," she 
said. "We want them to pay for what they did." 
     Meanwhile, in discussion groups such as alt.feminism, 
there was more outrage. "Your list was not funny," wrote 
Tracey Spiegel, a student at Wellesley. "The celebration of 
violence against women is abhorrent." 
     Since the Internet had been involved, naturally the 
national media picked up the story. "The young men are 
learning the price of offensive behavior in an era of instant 
communication and heightened sensitivity," wrote Michael 
Grunwald for _The Boston Globe._  
     The university had to respond; but how? Judicial 
Administrator Barbara L. Krause circulated a public statement 
that explored the various options. First, she pointed out, 
Cornell didn't have a hate-speech code; "Therefore, in order 
for our office to take disciplinary action against the four 
students, we had to find either that they engaged in sexual 
harassment or that they misused computer resources. Either of 
these findings would constitute a violation of Cornell's 
Campus Code of Conduct." 
     But since the students had circulated their "75 reasons" 
only to "a handful of people they knew and whom they did not 
believe would find its content offensive," they hadn't tried 
to harass anyone. And they hadn't misused computer resources, 
either; their distribution list had been too small for that 
charge to stick. 
     Krause's statement had an apologetic, frustrated tone. 
It almost seemed to be saying, "These naughty boys really 
should be punished, but we can't find a legitimate way of 
doing it!" 
     Still, Krause came up with a face-saving solution. She 
wrote that the students "recognize that they have caused 
great anger and hurt to many people. They deeply regret their 
actions and want to begin the process of restoring their 
reputations and the community's confidence in them." 
Consequently, she said, they had offered to attend a sex 
education program sponsored by Cornell Advocates for Rape 
Education (CARE) and the Health Education Office at Gannett 
Health Center. Also, each student had agreed--voluntarily, of 
course, since this was _not a punishment_--to perform 50 
hours of community service. "If possible," said Krause, "they 
will do the work at a non-profit agency whose primary focus 
relates to sexual assault, rape crisis, or similar issues." 
And finally the students agreed to meet senior Cornell 
administrators to "express regret for their actions and for 
the embarrassment and disruption caused to the University." 
     Dutifully, the four students circulated their own 
official apology. They wrote: "Our original intention for 
writing this list was as a joke to send to some of our 
friends, male and female. These are people that know us and 
know our personalities. They know it was a joke. As 
individuals, we are in no way sexist or discriminatory 
against any group. ... We had no idea that we were really 
being taken seriously and seriously offending people until we 
received a letter from a young woman who had been sexually 
assaulted. At that point we realized exactly how far this has 
gone. To think that our names were being connected with 
people who condone or even accept this type of violent 
behavior made us all sick to our stomachs.... Our only hope 
now is that every person who has read this list can see that 
we never meant these things and can forgive us." 
     But--wasn't this a little odd? The students had sent 
private email to a few friends, telling some tasteless jokes. 
Wasn't it typical--normal, even--for college students to make 
tasteless jokes? And since when did someone have to do 50 
hours of community service and apologize publicly for 
statements made in private correspondence? If the material 
had been widely read, wasn't that the fault of the people who 
had chosen to circulate it? 
     Robert B. Chatelle, Political Issues Chair of the 
National Writers Union (NWU), sent an open letter to Barbara 
Krause complaining about her attitude and correcting her on 
some legal issues. According to Chatelle, it didn't matter 
whether the students who wrote the "75 reasons" chose to send 
the document to one, 100, or 100,000 recipients. It was 
constitutionally protected speech; therefore, said Chatelle, 
they had "the legal right to distribute it as widely as they 
wish." 
     Chatelle also scolded Krause for mentioning that the 
students hadn't intended to anger or offend anyone. "This 
again is irrelevant," he said. "The courts have been crystal 
clear that offensive speech is protected." 
     He finished up: "Finally, I express skepticism that the 
four students will be attending the rape-education program 
and doing community service 'voluntarily.' This, frankly, 
reminds me of accounts of political dissidents in repressive 
Marxist regimes who attend re-education camps 'voluntarily.' 
I suspect the students were placed under tremendous pressure. 
Their understandable acquiescence, unfortunately, will have a 
chilling effect on speech, not only at Cornell but at all 
college campuses." 
     So here it was again: an institution trying to maintain 
a facade of moderation and respectability, finding itself 
condemned for infringing personal and academic liberties. 
Cornell had handled the fracas more adroitly than Carnegie-
Mellon University, which simply tried to silence troublesome 
speech. Krause was careful to make her letter even-handed, 
scolding people who had responded with hate mail and death 
threats. The right way to deal with the situation, she said, 
was to _explain_ to the boys why their words were "so 
hurtful." This way, she said, it would be possible "to turn a 
very negative incident into a positive learning experience." 
     Well, nice try, Barbara, but it wasn't going to work. 
There was _no possible compromise_ on this kind of issue. 
Cornell was going to make people mad no matter what it did. 
The MacKinnonesque feminists weren't going to be placated by 
anything less than a real crackdown, and the civil 
libertarians weren't going to settle for anything less than a 
ringing endorsement of everyone's right to say anything they 
damn well pleased, regardless of whom it might offend. 
     The situation was never really resolved, because it 
couldn't be. This became evident a few days later when a 
radical group calling itself Online Freedom Fighters, 
Anarchists and Libertarians (OFFAL) sent 21,132 copies of an 
email message to almost every member of the faculty and 
student body of Cornell, ridiculing Krause and satirizing 
her. The "Freedom Fighters" concocted their own imaginary 
version of a Krause memo and put her name at the top of it, 
although since the email originated from an Internet site in 
New York City, it was clearly a spoof. The full text of the 
message read: 

          Memo from Barbara L. Krause, Judicial 
          Administrator, Cornell University 

          to the Ad-Hoc Disciplinary Advisory Committee 

          CONFIDENTIAL 

          I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the 
     many faculty members who advised me regarding the 
     unfortunate matter of the "75 Reasons" letter that was 
     circulated via electronic mail. Your recommendations for 
     dealing with the foul-mouthed "four little pigs" (as I 
     think of them) who circulated this filth was both 
     apposite and prudent. 
          Now that we have had time to evaluate the media 
     response, I think we can congratulate ourselves on a 
     strategy that was not only successful in defusing the 
     scandal, but has actually enhanced the reputation of the 
     university as a sanctuary for those who believe that 
     "free speech" is a relative term that must be understood 
     to imply acceptable limits of decency and restraint--
     with quick and severe punishment for those who go beyond 
     those limits and disseminate socially unacceptable 
     sexist slurs. 
          I am especially pleased to report that the 
     perpetrators of this disgusting screed have been 
     suitably humiliated and silenced, without any outward 
     indication that they were in fact disciplined by us. 
     Clearly, it is to our advantage to place malefactors in 
     a position where they must CENSOR THEMSELVES, rather 
     than allow the impression that we are censoring them. 
          Personally I wish I could have inflicted a more 
     severe response such as suspension or perhaps a public 
     "debate" in which we would have paraded the little pigs 
     in public, for their humiliation. But in some cases (and 
     this is one of them) a subtler approach yields higher 
     dividends on the broad stage of public opinion, even 
     though it provides less gratification for those of us 
     who enjoy the vigorous application of punishment. 
          Once again, my thanks to you all for participating 
     in this highly successful public-relations exercise, 
     which has kept Cornell safe for those who wish to live 
     in a nurturing environment free from offensive speech 
     and degenerate behavior of all kinds. 

          Yours sincerely 

          Barbara L. Krause 
          Judicial Administrator Cornell University 

     The letter reaped a mixed response. At the site where 
the memo originated, some email was received heartily 
agreeing with everything that the memo said. 
     The author of the text granted an interview after he was 
assured that his identity would be protected. He will be 
referred to here as "John." 
     Why did he perpetrate the hoax? "I don't see it as a 
hoax," he says. "I see it as an exercise in verbalizing the 
real mindset of the worst kind of censor--the kind who wants 
to suppress free speech but pretends to be even-handed and 
_nice_ about it. This kind of person can be just as 
oppressive as a Stalinesque demagogue, but she's more 
dangerous, in a way, because she wears camouflage." 
     Does John really think that Cornell wanted to suppress 
free speech? 
     "Of course they wanted to. There's nothing unusual in 
this. Most people have something they hate to hear, because 
they're afraid of it. That's where censorship comes from: 
fear of concepts that may drag society in directions that 
make people nervous." 
     John dismisses the idea that Cornell had to compromise 
for fear of alienating feminists on one side or libertarians 
on the other. "When they compromised, they annoyed everyone. 
If they'd taken a strong stand--if they'd said, 'free speech 
is one of the fundamental principles of this country, and our 
students can say whatever they like, and no one should have 
to apologize for his opinions'--I think most people would 
have respected that. But Cornell has this agenda to impose 
Goodthink." 
     Isn't it true, though, that swamping students and 
faculty with 21,000 pieces of email isn't going to help? It's 
more likely to give new ammunition to people who want some 
control over the Internet. 
     "A freedom isn't worth much if you're too scared to use 
it," John replies. "If we daren't take advantage of the net 
to disseminate a point of view for fear of giving Senator 
Exon a new excuse to crack down--that means we've been 
intimidated, doesn't it? It means he's got what he wanted. 
You have to remember, people in Washington have total 
contempt for people who lie down and do what they're told. So 
we have to fight back. It's the only way. And I fully intend 
to continue doing so."

<p><b>Brief summary of this section:</b>

<p>

In 1995 the federal government forgot its former obsession with
hacking and data piracy and focused, instead, on netporn. Mass media
eagerly helped to create a mood of hysteria; but an obscure
undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University did more than anyone else
to legitimize the clamor of decency activists. His name was <a
href="mailto:martin.rimm@cmu.edu">Martin Rimm</a>, and his "scientific
study" of netporn was featured on the cover of Time magazine. The
study turned out to be riddled with errors (as shown below), and Time
had to print a partial retraction.  Even more embarrassing, Rimm had
been asked if he would testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing--but
became persona-non-grata when a unique alliance of journalists and
net users circulated bizarre revelations regarding his colorful past.

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~declan/rimm/">The fate of Martin
Rimm</a> demonstrates the new power of the net to defend itself using
a policy of Total Humiliation through Total Exposure. This rough
justice remains a relatively untested weapon that may yet be turned
against the same activists who used it so effectively against Rimm.

     Shocking! 

     There was porn on the net, and everyone was shocked. 
     In the Senate, James Exon waved bestiality pictures at 
his fellow legislators and warned that children all over 
America could view this vileness with a click of a mouse 
button. But bestiality was just the tip of the erotic iceberg 
as far as Senator Exon was concerned. He wanted to outlaw 
everything from pictures of naked female breasts to common 
swear words if there was any risk of them being seen by 
minors accessing the Internet. 
     Exon was from Nebraska. Was he promoting a crackdown on 
smut just to win votes from conservatives in his home state? 
Apparently not; he announced that this was his last term in 
the Senate, and he was ready to retire. He had a purely 
personal interest in cleaning up the net--which he compared 
nostalgically with the ham-radio network that he'd enjoyed 
using as a kid. In those days there had been no indecency, 
and on commercial radio stations indecent language was also 
outlawed, at least during periods when children might be 
listening. So why should there be indecency in cyberspace? 
     Civil libertarians were outraged and net users were 
exasperated. Commercial radio, they pointed out, is totally 
different from the net. A radio program emanates from one 
source to many listeners. The net enables everyone to 
communicate with everyone else, like the telephone network or 
the postal system. Why should it be illegal for people to 
type the word "shit" on a keyboard, when they can speak it 
freely on the phone? 
     But Exon didn't just want to punish people sending and 
receiving indecent messages, he also wanted to go after the 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that provide access to the 
net. Lobbyists complained that this was unreasonable, like 
prosecuting postal workers if they happen to deliver indecent 
mail. Moreover, ISPs have no way to monitor the huge volume 
of text and images passing through their systems. In fact, 
under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, they aren't 
_allowed_ to snoop at random in personal communications. 
     Exon responded by adjusting his law so that it would 
only punish ISPs that failed to take reasonable precautions 
to protect children. What, exactly, was a reasonable 
precaution? Maybe at some point the FCC could figure that 
out. Meanwhile, on June 14th, 1995, Exon's legislation was 
approved as an amendment to the telecommunications 
deregulation bill working its way through Congress. A large 
majority of senators voted in favor of it. 
     They were afraid of doing anything else. Netporn was a 
hot issue; all the national media were picking up on it, from 
_Newsweek_ to CNN. Any time you looked at a magazine cover or 
switched on your TV you were liable to see some cute little 
kid who had been strategically posed in front of a computer 
where just about _anything_ might materialize on the screen. 
Conservatives, liberals, Christians, atheists--everyone was 
shocked. 
     Well, not quite everyone. Writing in _The San Francisco 
Chronicle,_ Jon Carroll scorned the whole idea of controlling 
netporn: 

          Fifty out of fifty states have laws against 
     prostitution. [This is true even in Nevada, although 
     counties have the right to opt out.] In fifty out of 
     fifty states, prostitution flourishes.... There will 
     always be sex on the Net, on the phone lines, in the 
     books, on the streets. There will always be sex in your 
     heart and on your mind. The Exon amendment is a lie, a 
     lie you want to believe because society is falling apart 
     and the children you know are surrounded by panderers. 
     Fear makes us all stupid. 

     Still, to be fair, an element of truth was buried in the 
netporn hysteria. Sexy pictures and stories certainly were 
available online, and any unsupervised child could look at 
them. 
     On the other hand, this had been true for years. Why was 
the issue suddenly making headlines in 1995? James Exon 
didn't even have an email address; he seemed clueless about 
computers. No one believed he had found his dirty pictures 
all by himself. Who had helped him? Was a special-interest 
group secretly orchestrating this circus? 
     In fact, the key source of information about netporn 
turned out not to be affiliated with any religious or 
political organization. He was a 30-year-old undergraduate 
student studying electrical engineering at Carnegie-Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His name was Martin 
Rimm. 
     Rimm had spent more than a year conducting secret 
research into pornography online, using grants provided by 
his college. In 1994 he had circulated preliminary data. When 
the final version of his 21,000-word study was published in 
the June, 1995 _Georgetown Law Journal,_ he received a 
tentative invitation to testify before an upcoming Senate 
Judiciary Committee hearing on children and netporn. He found 
himself featured prominently in _Time_ magazine, he was 
interviewed on network TV, and he was quoted in all the major 
newspapers. 
     Rimm's study was even more shocking that James Exon's 
book of dirty pictures. It was precisely the weapon that 
conservatives needed, purportedly proving that netporn was 
more prevalent and more perverse than anyone had thought 
possible. Thanks to Martin Rimm it looked as if the Exon 
amendment (or something like it) could be pushed through the 
remaining legislative stages and signed into law. 
     Yet this turned out to be not so simple. Within a few 
short weeks, Rimm's wild ride to notoriety was derailed. His 
study was swiftly and viciously discredited. He was no longer 
welcome to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and 
the decency crusaders were forced to disown him. 
     The story of how this happened is remarkable. It 
features a most unlikely mix of journalists and rank-and-file 
net users, many of them college students, most of them with 
no experience in activism. Together they mounted a grass-
roots counter-attack that demonstrated some amazing new 
powers of the Internet: to excite the public, agitate the 
media, confuse politicians, shock the nation--and ruin 
someone's reputation almost overnight. 


     A Quick Lesson on Netspeech 

     The first rumblings of controversy surrounding Martin 
Rimm were audible back in September, 1994 when Rimm sent 
email to Robert Mehrabian, president of Carnegie-Mellon 
University (CMU), notifying him that students all over the 
campus were accessing pornography via the university's 
internal computer network. Rimm noted that some of the images 
seemed to have been copied from Amateur Action, a California 
bulletin board system (BBS) whose owners had been convicted 
under federal obscenity laws. So here was the ominous 
implication: CMU's students--some of them under eighteen--
were viewing pictures that had been proven obscene, and the 
college itself was catering this tainted feast. 
     CMU happens to be one of the most thoroughly wired 
universities in the world. It is situated on the backbone of 
the Internet, literally straddling the so-called information 
superhighway. Every single person on campus has an email 
address. Each student's terminal is capable of siphoning data 
from the net more than thirty-five times as fast as the best 
transfer rate available to modem users in the outside world. 
As a result, students can download erotica as swiftly as 
turning pages in a magazine, and according to Rimm, that was 
precisely what they were doing. 
     If some CMU administrators had been aware of the 
situation and had chosen to ignore it--well, Rimm deprived 
them of that option. His warning put them in the position of 
_knowingly_ transmitting obscene images into the dorm rooms 
of students all over campus. 
     You didn't have to be a rocket scientist, or even a 
computer scientist, to predict what would happen next. Orders 
were given to shut the electronic spigot, and the flow of 
porn abruptly ceased. All discussion groups with the words 
"sex" in their titles were henceforth banned. This was a 
rough-and-ready form of censorship; some serious plain-text 
forums for discussing child abuse and safe sex ended up 
getting axed along with the porn. 
     You didn't have to be a professor, or even a grad 
student, to predict how people would respond. Campus 
demonstrations were organized. The ACLU issued a statement. 
Angry articles appeared in the student newspaper. Declan 
McCullagh, president of the student body, called an emergency 
meeting of the Student Senate, which passed a resolution 
condemning the decision. On November 9th McCullagh staged a 
"Freedom in Cyberspace" rally that attracted notable free-
speech advocates such as Mike Godwin, counsel to the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). 
     Godwin told students that no charges had ever been filed 
against any university for allowing full access to the Usenet 
feed that supplied the sexually explicit material. He said 
the volume of messages made it impossible for the university 
to be accused of knowingly distributing obscenity. And he 
waxed eloquent on the educational value of sexually explicit 
text. "They [CMU administrators] want you to remember the 
poetry of Dante and Shakespeare and Shelley," he said. "But 
they want you to forget that human sexuality, which often 
inspired these poets, is equally the inspiration of those who 
write stories and poems for rec.arts.erotica." 
     Did the link between Shakespeare and Usenet seem a 
little bit ... thin? No problem. Student Donna Riley, who had 
been asked to present "the women's perspective" at the rally, 
suggested a different rationale. "We've seen this stuff 
before," she said. "In fact, it permeates our culture. But 
the Internet is one of the few places where we can fight back 
on a more even footing, using the most powerful tools we 
have--our imaginations, our wits, and our keyboards. CMU 
women don't need to be sheltered from a bunch of horny men's 
dirty pictures and stories on the net." 
     This was a powerful argument because it did an end run 
around the whole issue of whether porn was good or bad. If it 
was good, everyone should be allowed to enjoy it. If it was 
bad, the Internet was the best place for it, because everyone 
had an equal voice and women could shout just as loudly as 
the pornographers. 
     Administrator Erwin Steinberg protested that the 
university had a moral obligation to protect students from 
pictures of sex "with women, children, animals, and the 
like." This was a very unfortunate choice of words. First, it 
suggested that sex with women and sex with animals was pretty 
much the same thing. Second, like every censor throughout 
history, Steinberg was claiming the right to shield everyday 
citizens from stuff that was bad for them; and naturally 
enough, the citizens felt they didn't need this kind of help, 
thanks all the same. Donna Riley soon started circulating 
fliers with sarcastic messages such as, "Do good girls think 
porn is icky? Fuck no!" and, "Oh, Erwin! Protect us again!" 
     Three weeks later she formed an action group "to explore 
erotica from a female perspective and fight the CMU 
administration's patronizing decision to censor 'offensive' 
(read: sexually explicit) images from our bboard system 
because of their concern for our fragile sensibilities." With 
an unerring instinct for maximum shock value, she named her 
group The Clittoral Hoods. [sic] 
     Soon the "hoods" were organizing regular "erotic story 
hours" where participants would get together and read to each 
other their favorite fiction and poetry. Meanwhile, the 
Faculty Senate had passed a resolution unanimously demanding 
that their own administration should restore access to all 
the news groups. 
     The backlash had become just as embarrassing as the porn 
--and twice as visible. The story was soon in the national 
press. The November 21st issue of _Time_ magazine contained 
an article by Philip Elmer-DeWitt that referred to Rimm and 
his incomplete study of pornography under the headline, 
"Censoring Cyberspace." 
     So here was a quick lesson on the nature of netspeech. 
If you didn't try to control it, net users were liable to go 
beyond all normal limits, raising the specter of legal 
liability. If you did try to control it, anti-censorship 
forces would rise up in wrath and cause just as much trouble, 
including the prospect of other kinds of legal action. 
     There was no room, here, for compromise. It was an 
impossible dilemma, and the drama at CMU was just a preview 
of what was about to happen on the national stage. 


     Researcher Rimm meets Dirty Marty 

     Why, exactly, did engineering undergraduate Martin Rimm 
decide to warn the president of CMU about porn on the net? 
Did he really imagine that no one knew about it? Did he think 
he was, in some sense, doing the right thing? These questions 
were especially hard to answer since, as Rimm later put it, 
"most people who speculated about my motives never knew me, 
and those who know me well ... were rarely if ever quoted." 
     Rimm came from Atlantic City, New Jersey, where his 
well-connected family included a State Tax Court judge and a 
city commissioner. He was not politically naive and even 
though he claimed to be inexperienced in the thorny issue of 
pornography, he must have had some idea of the furor his 
revelation would create, 
     Was he an decency crusader? He claimed not to be. In 
private correspondence with an anti-censorship activist Rimm 
stated, "I consider myself to be someone who is deeply 
concerned about civil liberties." In discussions with a 
fellow student named Christopher Reeve, he agonized over the 
possibility that conservative organizations could use the 
existence of netporn to advance their repressive agendas. He 
even criticized the CMU administration for closing down the 
sexually oriented news groups. 
     After Donna Riley's speech at the rally, she recalls 
that Rimm came up to her and said he absolutely agreed with 
her because "porn is bad but so is censorship." He didn't 
seem to realize that this was a totally inaccurate rendering 
of her feminist arguments. Was he trying to create some sort 
of working relationship with her? In retrospect this seems 
possible, since he also invited her to contribute to his 
study. Was he trying to placate her by telling her what he 
thought she wanted her to hear, so that she wouldn't cause 
any trouble for him? This is also possible, though Riley had 
no sense of it at the time. "I had no suspicion that the work 
would end up a gift to anti-porn crusaders," she wrote later. 
"I figured he was a clueless undergrad who needed help." 
     According to Riley, Rimm "looked a lot less geeky than I 
expected. He had an urban, Greenwich Village look to him, 
pretty atypical for CMU engineers." She said he wore faded 
jeans, a black motorcycle jacket, and heavy black shoes. He 
had very short blond hair, almost a crewcut. "I figured at 
the time that he was your garden variety horny electrical 
engineering undergrad and had chosen to study porn out of a 
desire to view thousands of pictures of naked women." 
     Actually, Rimm had high ambitions and a strong streak of 
self importance. Riley remembers that he referred to himself 
as the "Principal Researcher" in his sociological study, 
which struck her as pretentious since the label is more often 
reserved for a faculty member or graduate student. 
     Rimm certaintly made some arrogant claims in the study 
itself. He wrote that he had developed an "entirely new 
methodology for the study of pornography." Supposedly, he had 
persuaded various computer bulletin boards to let him to 
count how many times each image was downloaded, circumventing 
the usual problem of consumers lying about their buying 
habits. He claimed this as a genuine breakthrough in 
sociological data gathering. 
     It's important to remember, here, the difference between 
a BBS and the Internet. A bulletin board system is a 
privately owned business, and sexually-oriented boards are 
open to adults only. You have to submit proof of age (such as 
a photocopy of a driver's license) to gain access, and you 
usually have to pay a monthly membership fee plus an 
additional charge for each download. In this sense an adult 
BBS is like a porno bookstore with a strict door policy. 
     By comparison the Internet is global and open to people 
of all ages. You generally get access through an Internet 
service provider's local "point of presence," or your 
computer may be wired into a local network that is connected 
with the net itself (as at CMU). Either way, the net is wide 
open and extremely cheap, like a huge library that charges a 
minimal hourly rate and lets you take a free copy of anything 
you want. 
     Maybe one-tenth of Internet capacity is consumed by 
Usenet, which feeds the Internet in much the same way that a 
TV station feeds programs into a cable network. Usenet 
messages are sorted by topic into discussion groups, to which 
anyone can contribute. It's a sprawling info-exchange 
embracing millions of readers. But almost all the messages 
consist of text; only a handful consist of pictures. This is 
totally unlike an adult BBS, where there's hardly anything 
_but_ pictures. 
     At first, Rimm's research only included bulletin boards. 
In fact he narrowed his scope to a handful of boards that 
contained the biggest stocks of erotic images. Since these 
boards were not on the Internet, he had to dial them via 
long-distance phone lines using a 14,400 bits-per-second 
modem. This meant he couldn't possibly download and inspect 
every single picture, because receiving the huge amounts of 
graphics data would have taken too long--weeks, or months. So 
he took a shortcut: he downloaded just the _contents 
listings_ written by BBS owners to advertise their wares. 
     Rimm claimed he accumulated more than 300,000 of these 
two-line contents listings. Some of the text was highly 
explicit, but he didn't flinch from including it in his 
study. In fact, he tackled the task with gusto. His academic 
prose was peppered with dozens of quotes such as, "Piss orgy! 
3 horny guys piss all over their girlfriends!" 
     Having acquired the text, he asked a programmer to write 
a routine to analyze it and compile a dictionary of recurring 
keywords so that the material could be sorted into 
categories. In other words, he wanted a Dirty Word Detection 
Engine that would classify each piece of pornography 
according to its perversions. 
     This created some semantic problems. As Rimm put it, "if 
the word 'fucks' was assumed to imply the vaginal category, 
the computer dictionary would have classified such 
descriptions as 'he fucks her in the ass' or 'he fucks her 
mouth' or 'she fucks herself with a dildo' as vaginal, when 
clearly they were not." 
     Therefore, he said, it was necessary to check for other 
words that might be used in conjunction with "fucks." These 
"fuck phrases" could establish the dominant theme of each 
picture. 
     But what if a picture included _two_ dominant themes? In 
his serious, academic study, Researcher Rimm picked a random 
example: "'She licks her girlfriend's asshole'. The image 
could be classified as {oral}, {anal}, or {lesbian}." He 
dealt with this by allowing one picture to be classified in 
multiple ways. Yes, it was a tricky business trying to 
deconstruct the vocabulary of porn, but the Dirty Word 
Detection Engine was rewritten and upgraded, and soon it was 
ready for the job. It swiftly sorted the 300,000 listings 
using the criteria that Rimm had developed. 
     There was still one possible snag. Did the listings 
describe the pictures accurately, or had some BBS owners 
pumped up the text to make the pictures sound more exciting? 
The only way to find out was by manually checking some sample 
images. Rimm downloaded 400 of them and commissioned some 
"judges" to decide whether each listing was accurate. 
     These judges turned out to be sticklers for detail. 
Confronted with a picture captioned "She finishes shitting! 
She has shit specs [sic] on her asshole!" Rimm noted, "one of 
the judges unable to perceive fecal matter." Examining 
another image titled "She chokes on thick dog cock! Dog sperm 
on her sexy lips!" Rimm commented, "two of the judges unable 
to perceive the ejaculate." 
     All of these quotes come from the final version of 
Rimm's study, as it appeared in the _Georgetown Law Journal_. 
Imagine the typical reader of this serious review, browsing 
through the pages of solid text, perhaps expecting some 
abstruse essay on recent precedents in criminal law--and 
finding, instead, this head-bending exercise in scatalogical 
weirdness. The study was bizarre; it looked as if it had been 
written by someone with a split-personality disorder. 
Researcher Rimm maintained his dry academic style as he 
discussed methodology, tabulation, and analysis, but he 
seemed to have an evil twin named Dirty Marty pawing through 
the pornography and getting cheap thrills by picking out the 
most extreme examples he could find. He filled whole pages 
with pornographic prose along with his own absurd procedural 
quibbles about detecting fecal matter and dog semen. The 
study claimed to be academic, but it was a wild romp into 
voyeurism.                
     The voyeurism stopped, however, when readers finally 
struggled through to the end. Researcher Rimm regained 
control, here, solemnly warning that online porn was 
available in huge quantities and was even kinkier and nastier 
than the stuff in magazines (which was hard to understand, 
since many pictures online are pirated from magazines). Worst 
of all, according to Rimm, computer users actually _preferred 
the sick stuff._ The more perverted it was, the more often 
they downloaded it. Pictures of plain old vaginal sex were b-
o-o-o-ring. "The supply of vaginal sex imagery exceeds the 
demand," Rimm commented. "The market for computer pornography 
is driven by a strong demand for pedo/hebephilic and 
paraphilic imagery." 
     As a "case study" he singled out Amateur Action, the BBS 
whose owners had been imprisoned under federal obscenity 
laws. Amateur Action was notorious for its no-holds-barred 
policy, but Rimm claimed he picked it merely because it was 
the "market leader" (a term that his study never defined, 
although later he said it meant "the BBS which generated the 
most downloads." 
     He reported that Amateur Action employed sophisticated 
techniques for satisfying users' perverse tastes. In 
particular, the BBS slyly played up a "power imbalance" 
between the sexes, "including a disproportionate 
representation of women in acts which may be considered 
degrading." 
     For instance, women were shown being penetrated by 
animals. "The pie chart in Figure 10," wrote Researcher Rimm, 
"illustrates the variety of animals engaged in sexual acts 
with humans, the most popular of which was 'BRUNETTE SLUT 
TAKES A HUGE HORSE COCK IN HER TIGHT PUSSY!'" 
     Of course, Rimm maintained his objectivity. He didn't 
say he disapproved--but he didn't have to. The material spoke 
for itself. It was outrageous. It was--well, it was shocking. 
     There was just one little problem. Amateur Action wasn't 
accessible via the Internet. _All_ of the pictures analyzed 
by Rimm's judges and sorted by the Dirty Word Detection 
Engine were downloaded from limited-access, adults-only, XXX-
rated bulletin boards that could only be reached by making 
long-distance phone calls. 
     Rimm was a sophisticated online user. He must have known 
the difference between a bulletin board and the Internet, 
just as any reader knows the difference between an adult 
bookstore and a library. But for reasons that he didn't 
explain he chose to blur this sharp distinction. In three 
separate places his study referred to "Usenet boards" when he 
really meant Usenet news groups. In one of his footnotes he 
said that "Information Superhighway" and "Cyberspace" could 
mean "any of the following: Internet, Usenet, World Wide Web, 
BBS, other multimedia telephone, computer, and cable 
networks." 
     Why confuse the issue? Rimm later claimed that he never 
intended "to muddle or deceive." Perhaps he originally 
intended to study only bulletin boards--and then realized, 
during 1994, that the Internet was attracting huge amounts of 
hype. By coincidence or by design, he downplayed the 
difference between adult BBS services and the Internet, and 
he added a small amount of additional work that focused 
exclusively on the net. This enabled him to reap far more 
publicity for his work as an "Internet study." And this was 
how he purported to prove--by a creative use of statistics--
that the entire online environment was a pit of perversion. 


     Deceptive Data 

     There are more than 10,000 Usenet news groups available 
worldwide, and more than 99 percent of them have nonsexual 
themes. Martin Rimm was able to find only seventeen groups 
specializing in explicit sexual pictures, and in August, 
1994, he spent one week browsing through them. 
     He downloaded actual images from only five groups. This 
was still a considerable number; 3,254 pictures altogether. 
But he was on the Internet now, which meant he didn't have to 
use a slow modem through a long-distance telephone line. 
Thanks to CMU's speedy net feed, Researcher Rimm needed only 
a few seconds to capture each image. 
     Usenet pictures aren't consistently captioned, so there 
were no contents listings for The Dirty Word Detection Engine 
to work on. The only way of categorizing the material was by 
evaluating the pictures one by one, and Rimm seemed unwilling 
to attempt this. Instead he divided the pictures into just 
three groups: those that seemed to have been copied from 
adult bulletin boards because they carried text advertising 
the board; those that seemed to have been placed by private 
users; and those that were so "soft core," they weren't 
really pornographic by his definition. 
     So much for content. What about quantity? He quoted data 
circulated by Brian Reid, the world's most widely known and 
prestigious analyst of Usenet activity. Rimm concluded from 
Reid's tabulations that about _one-fifth_ of the Usenet flow 
consisted of data in news groups "containing pornographic 
imagery." 
     How could this be so, when Rimm had only found 17 out of 
10,000 news groups devoted to sexy pictures? 
     Imagine that you have a massive book containing millions 
of words of text, and a handful of pornographic 
illustrations. First, using a magnifying glass, you count all 
the tiny colored dots in the printed pictures. Then you count 
the number of letters and spaces in the text. You find there 
are five times as many letters and spaces as there are dots 
in the pictures. From this, you reach the strange conclusion 
that the "information flow" of the book is one-fifth 
pornographic. 
     This is almost exactly how Rimm chose to measure the 
flow of data online. Text is sent in "bytes" of data. One 
byte can convey either a single alphanumeric character or a 
single dot in an image. A typical text message might require 
only 5,000 bytes, but a single image can easily require 
100,000 bytes. This means that a small number of porno images 
can constitute one-fifth of the Usenet flow while hundreds of 
thousands of text messages make up the remainder. 
     If Rimm had wanted to be fair and accurate he should 
have measured the _number of messages,_ not the number of 
bytes. But this would have meant counting every new message 
every day in every one of the thousands of news groups at 
CMU, and trying to decide how many were pornographic. Either 
because the task was too laborious or because it would have 
yielded less sensational results, Rimm didn't bother. 
     Instead, he chose a third option. He ranked news groups 
according to consumer demand. Instead of counting messages, 
he counted the number of people at the university who 
accessed them. It turned out that alt.sex.stories attracted 
the most users, followed by alt.binaries.pictures.erotica. 
After that came news groups specializing in football, 
baseball, local news, and humor. 
     This, of course, confirmed everyone's worst suspicions. 
Students weren't using the net for serious research, they 
were reading dirty stories, viewing dirty pictures, trading 
off-color jokes, and frittering away their time in chit-chat 
about sport. 
     Once again, though, Rimm's use of data was misleading. 
By concentrating on a few popular news groups he distracted 
attention away from the thousands that have nothing to do 
with sex. In other words: 

     There are a few sexually-oriented news groups. 
     On average, each attracts a moderate number of readers. 
     If we multiply the moderate number of readers-per-group 
by the small number of groups, the total is relatively small. 

     There are _thousands_ of non-sexually-oriented news 
groups. 
     On average, each attracts a small number of readers. 
     If we multiply the small number of readers-per-group by 
the _huge_ number of groups, the total is relatively large; 
although no one would have reached this conclusion by reading 
Rimm's study. 


     The Traumatic Statistic 

     Rimm finished with a few choice conclusions. Most of 
them were general statements, such as "Computer networks 
represent a fundamentally new technology for pornography 
distribution and consumption." But one statistic stood out. 
Rimm wrote: "83.5 percent of all images posted on the Usenet 
are pornographic." 
     Wait a minute! Where had that come from? It seemed 
totally damning. It was, in a word--shocking. 
     Remember, though, pictures on Usenet take up only a 
fraction of its message traffic. Many of the available 
pictures are in fact sexual--but most users of Usenet aren't 
interested in pictures. 
     Moreover, although Rimm later claimed that his figure of 
83.5 percent was "rock solid," in fact it was not reliable. 
He admitted that he was unable to view about thirteen percent 
of his downloads because his software wouldn't display them; 
so he just assumed that they were as pornographic as the 
rest, even though he had no evidence for this. Another 
percentage, which he didn't disclose, turned out to be so 
soft-core, they weren't pornographic by the definition that 
he was using; but he included them in his total anyway. Also, 
he counted text messages in the "pornographic" Usenet groups, 
as well as images. But these defects were barely mentioned 
and were buried elsewhere in the big study. In the summary 
there was just that 83.5 percent figure sitting on the page, 
with its decimal point implying scrupulous scientific 
accuracy. 
     This turned out to be a big mistake--not just for net 
users, but also for Martin Rimm. 


     Bizarre Revelations 

     Philip Elmer-DeWitt had made a name for himself writing 
about the Internet. He was one of a handful of journalists 
who were savvy about technology and trusted by net users. 
     Now, however, he was contemplating a writing assignment 
that could be seen as sabotage of the net. He knew that 
netporn was a sensitive topic--but his magazine wanted a 
story that could sell a lot of copies in its ongoing battle 
for market dominance with _Newsweek,_ and Elmer-DeWitt found 
himself with an exclusive that he later described as "too 
good to pass up." 
     Elmer-DeWitt had learned about Rimm's study back in 
November, 1994, when it was still incomplete. In June, 1995, 
Rimm asked if _Time_ would be interested in an exclusive look 
at the finished text. As Elmer-DeWitt later put it, "I knew 
the Rimm study would be big news and I figured better I cover 
it than someone else." 
     Martin Sirbu, Rimm's advisor at CMU, assured Elmer-
DeWitt that the study was a serious piece of work. After all, 
it had been accepted by _The Georgetown Law Journal._ "If 
they hadn't accepted it for publication," Elmer-DeWitt wrote 
later, "we wouldn't have done our story." He didn't realize 
that the journal is entirely edited by graduate students. 
     Elmer-DeWitt contacted his friend Mike Godwin for 
comments, and Godwin urged him to call Donna Hoffman, an 
associate professor of management at the Owen School at 
Vanderbilt University who had extensive experience 
researching net issues. She had seen an abstract of the Rimm 
study, and she was concerned that it might be sloppy or even 
malicious. When Elmer-DeWitt assigned a _Time_ bureau 
reporter to check with her, she voiced her concern. "I raised 
what I thought were several red flags," she wrote later. 
"Those concerns were apparently ignored." 
     Hoffman's anxieties may have been discounted partly 
because she had seen only an abstract, not the whole thing. 
In fact, she hadn't been _allowed_ to see all of it. Back in 
March, 1995, Rimm had submitted it to the _Georgetown Law 
Journal_ under conditions of total secrecy. Only the 
editorial staff had been permitted to read the text. David G. 
Post was a visiting associate professor of law at Georgetown 
University Law Center; when he was asked for advice on 
questions arising from the study, even he wasn't allowed to 
read it all. 
     Why was Rimm being so secretive? Well, he could have 
feared that a premature leak would lessen the ultimate 
impact. Or, he could have wanted to protect his study from 
advance criticism. Certainly none of his data could be 
challenged and none of his conclusions could be debunked so 
long as people weren't allowed to read them.  
     Philip Elmer-DeWitt started writing his story on 
Tuesday, June 20th. Meanwhile, _Time_'s PR people consulted 
with Rimm. There was a sense at the magazine that this was a 
hot item, and they were going to push it with a sensational 
cover showing the blue-tinted face of a horrified child. They 
even thought they could get some exposure on TV. 
     Rimm had no problem with that; and so, just a few days 
later, before the magazine was actually on sale, he found 
himself reciting the study's shocking conclusions on ABC's 
Nightline. He appeared as a self-conscious, shifty-looking, 
repressed individual. "On the World Wide Web," he said, 
finding pornography was "as easy as the click of a button. 
Within the next year or so it will become child's play." (In 
fact, Rimm's own study had found virtually no porn on web 
sites.) 
     Later in the same show, Ralph Reed of the Christian 
Coalition claimed that one-quarter of all images online 
showed "the torture of women." This statement was total 
fantasy; it wasn't supported by Rimm's study. 
     Then the _Time_ article appeared. In 24-point type 
across all three columns, a headline claimed: "Porn is 
immensely popular: in an 18-month study, the Carnegie-Mellon 
researchers found 917,410 sexually explicit pictures, short 
stories, and film clips online." 
     Wait a minute. What was this _online?_ Did that mean the 
Internet? It certainly sounded like it. But most of those 
explicit pictures had _not_ been on the Internet. They were 
stored on private bulletin boards that were inaccessible to 
kids. Rimm's decision to confuse bulletin boards with Usenet 
was now producing its predictable results: a misleading 
statistical mess with maximum shock value. 
     That wasn't the worst problem. On the first page of the 
_Time_ article, under a subhead that read "There's an awful 
lot of porn online," Rimm's traumatic statistic appeared in 
the text, soberly claiming that 83.5 percent of all images on 
the net were pornographic. 
     Mike Godwin of EFF was horrified. Despite his friendship 
with Philip Elmer-DeWitt, Godwin publicly denounced the 
article, calling it "an utter disaster." He went on: "I think 
this survey will be used again and again and again to 
characterize the Internet as a place of wild and lawless 
behavior that cultivates extreme taste and degrading sexual 
imagery that goes beyond adult bookstores." 
     His reaction was just the beginning, a pistol shot that 
marked the start of a nuclear attack. The denizens of the net 
saw that their freedoms were endangered, and they rose up in 
wrath. 
     They seemed an unimpressive army, just a bunch of nerdy 
guys and couch potatoes scattered around the country with 
keyboards as their only weapons. But the net has powerful 
capabilities as an information retrieval tool. Within a 
matter of hours, triggered by critiques circulated online by 
net personalities such as Mike Godwin and Donna Hoffman, 
highly motivated net-heads were digging for facts about 
Martin Rimm . . . and uncovering a motherlode of bizarre 
revelations that had them gaping in amazement. 
     It turned out that Rimm's study of online porn wasn't 
his first attempt to manipulate controversial data. Ray 
Robinson of the Atlantic City _Press_ revealed that in 1981, 
when Rimm had been a sixteen-year-old student journalist at 
Atlantic City High School, he had conducted another 
"scientific survey" that purported to prove sixty-four 
percent of his fellow students had illicitly gambled in local 
casinos. To dramatize his point young Marty dressed up as an 
Arab sheik and conned his way into the Playboy Hotel and 
Casino. Later he claimed he never intended the stunt as a 
means to seek notoriety, but news of it spread as far as the 
_Wall Street Journal,_ and Rimm ended up testifying before 
New Jersey's gambling commission. Legislators later raised 
the legal gambling age from eighteen to twenty-one. Rimm 
claimed the action was actually taken "because the Division 
of Gaming Enforcement commissioned its own year-long 
monitoring program." His report, though, was the one that 
grabbed headlines. 
     There was more. Ray Robinson revealed that in 1990, Rimm 
had self-published a 208-page novel titled _An American 
Playground._ The book was unavailable in stores, but CMU 
student Declan McCullagh, who had organized the "Freedom in 
Cyberspace" rally, checked the catalogue of the Library of 
Congress, which is accessible via the net. He found that Rimm 
had submitted his novel to the nation's number-one literary 
archive--and there it was, shelved in the Jefferson Building. 
     McCullagh happened to be in Washington during the 
summer, so he went and read Rimm's novel. It turned out to be 
peppered with wildly salacious prose. McCullagh photocopied 
the "good bits," then spent a happy evening feeding them into 
the net. Some of the dialogue was especially memorable: 

          "I'm gonna go pump Nadah with my R.R. tonight." 
          "Your R.R.? What's that, Rich?" 
          "Don't you know? Come on, get with it Donny! That's 
     my _rectum rocket!"_ 

     Or: 

          "After I knock you out, I could inject your 
     ventricle vein with sodium cloroxide, thereby inducing a 
     bioculminary collapse in the lower cavity of your 
     central nervous system, followed by an epileptic seizure 
     from your spinal cord through your intestinal cords, all 
     the way up to your brain, through your stomach, down 
     your dick, and out your ass." (Page 72) 
 
     Researcher Rimm had evidently been out on his coffee 
break when these words were written; they sounded like Dirty 
Marty totally out of control, and they shed a whole new light 
on Rimm's pious warnings about degradation of women online. 
     But this was still only a mild jolt to the system 
compared with the next revelation. Another net user checked 
_Books in Print_ and found that in March, 1995, there had 
been a 67-page nonfiction work by Martin Rimm titled _The 
Pornographer's Handbook: How to Exploit Women, Dupe Men & 
Make Lots of Money._ The book had been published under the 
so-called Carnegie imprint--which, by an odd coincidence, 
happened to be based at the same street address as a Martin 
Rimm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
     Rimm claimed that the book was a "satire on the 
pornography industry which was never printed, published, 
distributed, or sold to anyone." 
     This was hard to believe, especially when a man calling 
himself John Russel Davis (whom Rimm claimed he had never 
heard of) uploaded some excerpts from the supposedly 
nonexistent book, which he obtained from an unspecified 
source. Satire? Apparently not. The book turned out to be 
exactly what the title said it was: a guide for owners of 
adult bulletin boards, telling them how to make money by 
fine-tuning their erotic services. Rimm even included an 
introduction dedicated to Bob Guccione, publisher of 
_Penthouse_, which read, in part: 

          Therefore, Mr. Guccione, take this small gift in 
     the spirit and lust for life with which I sent it. If 
     you consider and read it diligently, you will appreciate 
     my sincere desire to see you at last reap the great 
     riches of the Information Superhighway. And if you will 
     at some time turn your eyes from the summit of your 
     plush office to these low places, you will see how 
     undeservedly I endure a great and continuous malignity 
     of fortune. 

     How eloquent! In fact, _too_ eloquent. Mary Shaw, a 
faculty member at CMU, realized that it had been copied 
wholesale from Machiavelli's introduction to "The Prince," 
dedicated to Lorenzo de Medici: 

          So, Your Magnificence, take this little gift in the 
     spirit in which I sent it; and if you read and consider 
     it diligently, you will discover in it my urgent wish 
     that you reach the eminence that fortune and your other 
     qualities promise you. And if, from your lofty peak, 
     Your Magnificence will sometimes glance down to these 
     low-lying regions, you will realize the extent to which, 
     undeservedly, I have to endure the great and unremitting 
     malice of fortune. 

     But the inside pages of Rimm's "Handbook" made much 
juicier reading then its front matter. For example: 

          When searching for the best anal sex images, you 
     must take especial care to always portray the woman as 
     smiling, as deriving pleasure from being penetrated by 
     a fat penis into her most tender crevice. The male, 
     before ejaculation, is remarkably attuned to the 
     slightest discrepancy; he is as much focused on her lips 
     as on her anus. The slightest indication of pain can 
     make some men limp. 

     (A few weeks later, when Rimm complained he had been 
screwed by people circulating these writings over the net, he 
was told to smile during the experience. "Otherwise, Marty, 
you know we can't enjoy it.") 
     But--could this stuff be _genuine?_ Was "John Russel 
Davis" a pseudonymous prankster who had invented the whole 
thing? 
     Netizens speculated to and fro for a couple of days. 
Then Brock Meeks, Washington bureau chief for _Interactive 
Week_ and self-publisher of an online news service titled 
_Cyberwire Dispatch,_ settled the matter conclusively. He 
quoted a letter to him in which Rimm confessed: "The excerpts 
[from _The Pornographer's Handbook_] circulating around 
Usenet were stolen from my marketing book, Brock. You are the 
only one I'm telling." 
     The only one? _In your dreams, Marty!_ Meeks was a 
professional journalist. There was no possibility--not the 
slightest, faintest chance--that he was going to remain "the 
only one" with this information. 
     The phrase "information wants to be free" was beginning 
to take on a whole new meaning. In fact, netizens seemed 
ready to add a coda: "If we find any information that 
_doesn't_ want to be free, we'll soon take care of that!" 
     Many net users felt that Rimm had gone out of his way to 
damage their environment. Just as a woman may feel justified 
using any method to defend herself from a rapist, netizens 
were ready to use any legal text weapon against Martin Rimm. 
And so he became the first major victim of a technique that 
had devastating implications for anyone with something to 
hide: Total Humiliation through Total Exposure. 
     According to an old legal tradition, the person who 
sends a letter and the person who receives it both have a 
right to quote from it. But like so many other legal 
precedents, this one was stretched to new limits by the 
communicative power of the net. Brock Meeks' _Cyberwire 
Dispatch_ was copied into a Usenet group where it became 
potentially accessible to ten million or more people around 
the globe. No doubt most of those net users didn't bother to 
read the relevant news groups, but those who did were treated 
to some especially choice excerpts from Rimm's personal mail. 
"To say I'm pissed is an understatement," he wrote, regarding 
the excerpts from _The Pornographer's Handbook_ that had 
somehow found their way online. "They all agreed not to 
photocopy it," he added. "I'm going to nail them for 
copyright violation." This seemed to refer to BBS owners who 
had received the handbook from Rimm under yet another 
condition of secrecy. 
     So what had really happened here? Rimm kept trying to do 
damage control; he claimed that the excerpts from _The 
Pornographer's Handbook_ had been written to amuse several 
faculty members at CMU, before he ever considered writing his 
study of netporn. 
     His correspondence with Brock Meeks told a different 
story, so outrageous that it boggled the mind. The Meeks 
scenario ran like this: 
     First, early in 1994 Rimm had telephoned BBS owners and 
offered to analyze their data in order to help them target 
and fulfill the sexual appetites of their horny customers. 
Supposedly Rimm was ready to provide expert services to help 
any adult BBS refine its storehouse of pornography and make 
as much money as possible. 
     Some BBS owners seemed to fall for this offer. They 
allowed Rimm to inspect the images they offered online, and 
they supplied him with proprietary information about the 
viewing habits of their users. 
     Next step (according to Meeks): Researcher Rimm copied 
this privileged information into his CMU study--where he 
concluded, with straight-faced objectivity, that adult-
oriented BBSs were now using surprisingly sophisticated 
methods to enlarge their user base. Well, of course they 
were; they were using _his_ methods, which he had created for 
them! 
     Finally, Rimm treated the BBS owners to a handbook 
summarizing all the tricks of the trade that he had learned 
from his work. Simultaneously, he submitted to the 
_Georgetown Law Journal_ his study warning the public that 
online pornography was out of control, and legislators should 
take heed. 
     No wonder he had looked nervous on _Nightline._ By 
selectively omitting various pieces of information, it seemed 
he must have misled some of the largest adult-oriented 
computer bulletin boards in the country, along with the 
_Georgetown Law Journal._ 
     Rimm claimed that Meeks had quoted him out of context, 
had quoted some comments that were meant to be sarcastic, and 
had taken "considerable liberties." Still, Rimm didn't deny 
what he'd written to Meeks, and in his own study he admitted 
that he and his researchers had "rarely admitted" they were 
working on a study when they spoke to BBS owners. In other 
words, he had gathered the data under false pretenses. 
     Robert Thomas, co-owner of the Amateur Action BBS that 
Rimm had singled out as America's deepest porn pit, was now 
serving prison time; but Mike Godwin eventually managed to 
interview him. Thomas remembered phone calls in which he 
claimed that Rimm sounded like a real porn fan. "He'd say 
things like 'You never cease to amaze me. You're brilliant,'" 
Thomas told Godwin. "I was kind of an idol to him--at least, 
that's what I took it as. Some of his messages to me, he 
sounded kinda like he was in love with me or something. Or in 
love with the BBS. I thought he was probably a wannabe." 
     Were Thomas's recollections fair and accurate? His wife 
Carleen was able to produce a piece of email that Rimm had 
sent: 

          I'll tell you, Robert, in spite of my few comments, 
     I still think you're a fucking genius. Every time I run 
     my list through your computer I learn new things that no 
     one else in the business ever thought of. I'd like to 
     help in any way I can. I hope you count me among your 
     friends. 

     This from the man whose study exposed Thomas's BBS as a 
nightmare of female abuse, bestiality, and pictures of naked 
children! Rimm later claimed he was just trying "to sweet 
talk Thomas into sharing information." He claimed that "In 
journalism and most business professions, this is perfectly 
ethical." 
     Godwin was not impressed. With Carleen Thomas's 
permission, he quickly posted Rimm's email to Thomas on The 
Well, an Internet site that maintains its own local 
discussion groups. Aaron Dickey at Associated Press saw it 
there and helpfully copied it into Usenet so that it too 
could gain worldwide distribution. 
     When Rimm saw this, he wrote: 

          Aaron, you're a prick. You and the others attack me 
     for privacy violations, then you publicly post a message 
     that was clearly marked private between Robert Thomas 
     and myself. 

     Private? For Martin Rimm, the concept of privacy no 
longer existed, and he gradually seemed to realize this. "My 
lynching has been more savage and personal than any other in 
the history of the Net," he wrote.  A couple days later, he 
stopped sending email altogether. 
     But this vilification was only one part of the picture. 
There were other, more traditional forms of punishment. 


     The Academics Strike Back 

     Jim Thomas, the professor of sociology and criminal 
Justice at Northern Illinois University who also co-edits 
_Computer undeground Digest,_ has specialized in studying 
computer culture and, before that, prisoner and civil rights 
law. He has taught more than a dozen academic subjects, some 
at graduate level, including methods of data gathering. When 
Thomas saw Rimm's study he was so concerned he wrote a whole 
paper on what he termed its "ethical lapses." 
     He accused Rimm of invading the privacy of users at CMU 
by checking their Usenet access records without their 
consent. Also, Rimm had revealed private information publicly 
when he discussed Amateur Action BBS. And when dealing with 
bulletin boards generally, "there is sufficient evidence to 
conclude that the research team gathered data deceptively, 
perhaps even fraudulently." 
     Overall, Thomas concluded, Rimm's use of the study 
"seemed more an exercise in media promotion than in 
intellectual inquiry." 
     Meanwhile, David G. Post of the Georgetown University 
Law Center had now seen the full text that student editors 
refused to show him previously. Using words such as 
"preposterous," Post demonstrated that Rimm had made 
elementary blunders in analyzing his own data. As a result, 
his statistics were totally worthless. 
     Donna Hoffman, who had warned _Time_ that the study 
probably contained flaws, wrote a thorough denunciation in 
collaboration with Thomas Novak--who, like her, was a tenured 
associate professor of management at Vanderbilt University. 
In relentless detail they attacked Rimm's work for being 
sloppy, vague, and incompetent. Most damning of all, they 
pointed out that the _Georgetown Law Journal_ is not peer 
reviewed; in other words, by choosing this particular 
publication, Rimm had avoided the process of fact checking 
which is routine at most academic publications. 
     It also turned out there was another study--by two 
Canadians, Michael Mehta, Ph.D., and Dwaine Plaza, B.A., 
M.E.S.--who totally contradicted Rimm's conclusions. Adult 
bulletin boards, they said, "do not usually post a 
statistically significant different amount of material 
depicting illegal sexual acts, such as bestiality. ... We 
never came across an image depicting a sexual act between an 
adult and a child/adolescent, or acts between children." 
     Whose study was more credible, theirs or Rimm's? Well, 
theirs certainly seemed more rigorous. While Rimm never 
explained how he chose his samples of images, Mehta and Plaza 
did the job right with a random number table and 
proportionate random sampling. They explained the distinction 
between Usenet and bulletin boards, they counted Usenet 
pictures that came from commercial and from private sources, 
and they compared the numbers using a correlation 
coefficient, "a symmetric measure of association for 2 X 2 
crosstabulations used when comparing non-parametrically 
distributed variables." 
     Their study was dry and precise, without a hint of 
voyeurism or sleaze. But most damaging of all, theirs had 
come out first. In fact, Rimm had actually called Mehta and 
asked for a copy of it. 
     Mehta said that Rimm had spoken to him on the phone and 
claimed to be the leader of a fifteen-person 
interdisciplinary research team. He had sounded so 
authoritative, Mehta assumed he was a tenured professor. "He 
never corrected me," he said, "when I called him 'Professor 
Rimm.'" And Mehta went on: "I trusted Rimm, and he stole some 
of my ideas, lied to me, and distorted facts beyond belief." 
Declan McCullagh subsequently published a list of nineteen 
phrases from Rimm's paper that were almost identical to 
phrases in the paper by Mehta and Plaza. (Rimm later claimed 
that Mehta "was not at all truthful," although he didn't 
substantiate this claim.) 
     Worse still, it seemed that even Rimm's claim that he 
had counted actual downloads from bulletin boards might be 
unreliable. When Robert Thomas of Amateur Action was asked 
about this by Mike Godwin, he laughed at the idea. He pointed 
out that anytime his BBS software crashed, the download 
records would be reset to zero. 
     Rimm's Usenet data turned out to be just as unreliable. 
Brian Reid, who had gathered the data originally, was a Ph.D. 
employed as Director of the Network Systems Laboratory at 
Digital Equipment Corporation. "Every professional is going 
to vomit when they see this study," he wrote. He added, "I am 
so distressed by its lack of scientific credibility that I 
don't even know where to begin critiquing it. The writer 
appears to me not to have a glimmer of an understanding even 
of basic statistical measurement technique." 
     While charting Usenet for more than nine years, Reid 
said he had always warned everyone that the decentralized 
structure of the net makes accurate measurement impossible. 
In fact, he said, his figures might be wrong by an order of 
magnitude either way. "In other words, if I measure something 
that seems to be 79, the truth might be 790 or 7.9 or 
anywhere in between." 
     Was Rimm aware of this? He should have been. Did his 
study acknowledge the problem? Absolutely not. 
     There was more. Reid said that Rimm had made "beginner's 
errors" that rendered his numbers "completely meaningless." 
He had measured people's access to Usenet news groups only 
inside CMU, where 71 percent of students were male, most of 
them oriented toward technology. In other words, Rimm had 
studied the sexual interests of an enclave of frustrated 
college-aged male techno-geeks whose porn-ogling profile was 
likely to be high. Rimm then presented the figures as if they 
were typical for everyone on the net. 
     Moreover, when he talked about people "accessing" porn 
images on Usenet, he had never defined that term. In reality, 
according to Reid, Rimm's system only recorded whether a user 
checked the whole contents listing of a news group. He 
couldn't tell if someone downloaded all the pictures, or just 
a few, or none at all. 
     No wonder Reid was furious. Naturally, along with the 
other academics, he circulated his comments online. Some 
enthusiasts then got together and set up a web page where 
_everything_ about Rimm was assembled for public derision, a 
chamber of horrors showing all the textual torments that an 
engineering student could expect if he was dumb enough to 
launch an inaccurate and seemingly malicious attack on 
freedom on the net. 
     Was this the end of the story? Certainly not. The 
academics had responded fast compared with the print media. 
For the next month, magazines and newspapers explored the 
story. A Nexis search on July 8, 1995 found thirty-one news 
items mentioning Rimm's name during the preceding two weeks. 
_The New Yorker_ ran a long piece by Jeffrey Rosen describing 
each step of the saga with playful delight, referring to it 
as "wonderfully bizarre." _The New Republic_ included a full-
page story about the scandal in which Rimm was described as 
"unrepentant and making things worse." 
     Faced with this blizzard of scorn, most of Rimm's 
associates quickly abandoned him. Carolyn Speranza, an artist 
and lecturer at CMU, had been listed as an advisor for Rimm's 
paper. She was also credited as an illustrator for Rimm's 
"Pornographer's Handbook," but she hastily informed Usenet 
readers that the credit had been given "without my knowledge 
or consent." Moreover, she said, she had never even seen the 
handbook. This was interesting, because in a letter to Brock 
Meeks, Rimm had said he was "pissed off" about Carolyn, whom 
he referred to as if she was an ex-girlfriend. 
     Another former Rimm associate posted this message on his 
web page: "I've been told that I am listed as a 'contributor' 
in Martin Rimm's study. . . . I'd like to be able to say that 
this is completely untrue. In fact, I did unfortunately write 
a few primitive sed and awk scripts which Mr. Rimm presumably 
used to sift through the data he collected. . . . If I had 
been fully aware of its nature, I certainly wouldn't have had 
anything to do with it." 
     Even _Time_ magazine disowned its former guru of 
cyberporn. A one-page article written by Philip Elmer-DeWitt 
somehow managed to avoid blaming _Time_ but had no problem 
blaming Martin Rimm. The article said that "serious questions 
have been raised" about Rimm's study. Just to make sure 
everyone got the message, _Time_ included a photograph of 
Rimm looking shifty, pouting, and sullen, like a thinner, 
younger version of Alfred Hitchcock. It was captioned: "A 
colorful past and two tawdry books have helped undermine the 
credibility of Rimm's sex research." In online discussions 
Elmer-DeWitt admitted that "I really did screw up by buying 
into the Rimm study." 
     Were any other punishments in store for Martin Rimm? 
Well, he certainly wasn't going to testify at the Senate 
Judiciary Committee hearing on children and netporn. Also, 
his university formed a Committee of Investigation to examine 
his work, noting that "substantial criticism has focused on 
the study's scholarship and the methods by which data were 
acquired and used." It was even suggested that the academic 
credit that Rimm had received for his study could be 
withdrawn--which could cause him to lose the bachelor's 
degree that he was awarded with honors during 1995. Would 
this actually happen? The committee's verdict was not 
expected till mid-1996. Until then, Rimm would have to wait 
and wonder about his fate. 


     Rimm Shots 

     In the meantime, he made a few attempts to salvage some 
remnant of his reputation, later claiming "I was viciously 
attacked by intellectually dishonest people." He wrote some 
specific responses to Hoffman and Novak, Mehta, and Reid. He 
claimed he hadn't tried to avoid peer review. He said that 
"numerous scholars" had read the first draft of his study in 
December, 1994 (in fact, most of them had only seen pieces of 
it). He claimed that his study "drew on the expertise of more 
than two dozen researchers, many of whom hold Ph.D.s in 
statistics, engineering, economics, management, fine arts, 
psychology, history and public policy." (Unfortunately, none 
of them was qualified in the more relevant field of 
sociology.) He complained that Hoffman had tried to "censor" 
the article before _Time_ could publish it, he accused her 
and Novak of "seemingly personal attacks," and finally, with 
a straight face, he complained that they had "no previous 
research experience in the area of pornography." 
     As for the charge of plagiarism, he said that his own 
study had already been "in substantially complete form" in 
November 1994, a month before he had read the paper by Mehta 
and Plaza. Regarding his conversations with Mehta, Rimm 
claimed he "got no ideas" from them. "The charge of 
plagiarism," he wrote, "is part of a witchhunt of fabricated 
charges against our study...." 
     He had a harder time dealing with Reid. "Part of the 
problem here," he wrote, "appears to be one of perception:  
the law journal did not want us to write a statistics paper.  
Some statistics and explanations, that may have alleviated 
your concerns, were left out." He added, "We had hoped that 
the statistics we inserted would be taken in a general 
sense." 
     A general sense? As in "83.5 percent"? 
     Hoffman and Novak responded to Rimm's response, but few 
other netizens bothered. They had already achieved their 
objective. As far as netizens were concerned, Rimm had become 
an unperson. 
     His study, though, lived on. The traumatic statistic 
even found a place in the Congressional Record. Speaking in 
the Senate on June 26, 1995, Senator Grassley stated that 
"83.5 percent of the 900,000 images reviewed--these are all 
on the Internet--are pornographic, according to the Carnegie-
Mellon study." 
     Most of the 900,000 images had _not_ been on the 
Internet. They had been on private, adults-only bulletin 
boards. And the figure of 83.5 percent was based on 
hopelessly faulty data. No matter; in the minds of 
politicians, journalists, TV viewers, and Americans in 
general, the statistic lodged as firmly as Ronald Reagan's 
facts about trees poisoning the air with carbon dioxide. 
     The traumatic statistic filled a valuable psychological 
need: it literalized an incoherent fear. People had been 
afraid of what their kids might find in this weird new 
medium, the Internet. Now someone had measured the danger 
from porn and put a number on it. It was like walking into a 
dark room, feeling afraid of what might be there--and then 
having some smart young scientist from a university switch on 
the light and count the bugs for you. A number--any number--
was better than the unknown. 
     This, finally, was Martin Rimm's lasting contribution. 
The American public had had an inarticulate suspicion. He 
transformed it into an inaccurate fact. 


     The Real Martin Rimm 

     The question still remains: why did he do it? 
     In a footnote to his study he claimed that "the research 
team does not advocate or endorse any particular viewpoint or 
course of action concerning pornography on the Information 
Superhighway." Elsewhere, he even claimed to disapprove of 
CMU for banning sexually oriented news groups: "I have 
publicly criticized the administration, and will continue to 
do so. They used me as a scapegoat for some peculiar agenda." 
     In a letter, he said that while some people would 
probably condemn his popular writing style as being "like 
Jerry Falwell" he considered himself a renegade artist and 
praised De Sade as "a genius." This was an odd reference 
because elsewhere he had referred to Robert Thomas of Amateur 
Action as the "Marquis de Cyberspace." 
     At best, this was muddled; at worst, it looked 
hypocritical. While Rimm was telling free-speech activists 
what they wanted to hear, it now seems that he was probably 
working closely with rightwing activists who were eager to 
censor the net. Rimm claimed that his study had been accepted 
for publication "in substantially complete form" as early as 
November 1994, which suggests that his link with the 
_Georgetown Law Journal_ was long-standing. The editor-in-
chief of the _Journal_ has gone on record as saying that Rimm 
didn't submit his study directly; it came in via "an editor 
on the journal." Who could that editor have been? Well, 
appearing on the same Nightline show as Martin Rimm was a man 
named H. Deen Kaplan who is affiliated with the National 
Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families, 
formerly titled the National Coalition Against Pornography. 
According to Mike Godwin, Kaplan was the one who gave James 
Exon the binder full of pornographic photos that Exon 
brandished in the Senate. Kaplan also happened to be a third-
year student at Georgetown University Law Center--and was an 
editor on the _Journal._ Rimm has neither confirmed nor 
denied that antiporn activist Kaplan was the man who 
recommended the study to the _Journal._ 
     Meanwhile, John McMickle of The National Law Center for 
Children and Families--which claims to be a separate 
organization from the National Coalition for the Protection 
of Children and Families, but shares the same address and 
phone number--became a congressional staffer for Senator 
Charles Grassley in January, 1995. It was Grassley who 
chaired the Judiciary Committee hearings on children and 
Internet pornography. It was McMickle who asked Rimm if he 
would be interested in testifying at those hearings. While 
Rimm has denied any close links with anti-porn crusaders, 
circumstantial evidence makes it look as if his collaboration 
may have been very close indeed. 
     Using his skills as an attorney, Mike Godwin has 
researched this more thoroughly than anyone else, and he is 
now convinced that Rimm was actually assisted in writing his 
study by The National Coalition for the Protection of 
Children and Families, the National Law Center for Children 
and Families, and Enough is Enough, another antiporn group 
(which also testified in Senator Grassley's hearings). Godwin 
concludes that "there are numerous links between Rimm and 
antiporn groups that strongly suggest a team effort to create 
the perception of a pornography problem on 'the information 
superhighway.'" Rimm meanwhile has written in a letter to 
Mike Godwin, "I never had any contact with anyone who is 
affiliated with the 'Religious Right.'" Unfortunately, since 
Rimm doesn't say exactly what he means by "Religious Right," 
this is an inadequate rebuttal. 
     There's no evidence, though, that Rimm is a 
fundamentalist Christian with a personal desire to censor the 
net. Christopher Reeve, a student at CMU who wrote a section 
of Rimm's study surveying the World-Wide Web, believes that 
Rimm was mainly in it for notoriety, plain and simple. "He 
wanted to be at the center of the controversy," Reeve said 
afterward. He added that Rimm realized his study might be 
used by the far right, and "we discussed how to avoid this. 
However, I think in the end, he actually did very little in 
the way of preventing it." 
     Reeve has a personal reason to be annoyed with Rimm, who 
had a bad habit of flirting with Reeve's girlfriend. Still, 
Reeve now tries to shrug this off. "She thought he was kind 
of creepy," he says. "I think he just hit on her a couple of 
times." In fact, Reeve is one of the few people who will 
still say a few words in defense of Rimm. "I don't think 
Marty is extremely different from other CMU undergrads, in 
that he started this project in hopes of making a name for 
himself (and really, I'm convinced that's about as far as his 
intentions go.)" Reeve feels that Rimm simply wanted "to 
blitzkrieg the world as the new pornography expert." 
     Bret Pettichord, a former classmate, remembers Rimm as 
"a loner" who used to have an odd habit of pacing to and from 
while listening intently to tapes of Jerry Falwell. "Not for 
the message," says Pettichord; Rimm was "fascinated by how 
Falwell was able to sway people with his rhetoric." 
     Rimm later disputed this, claiming that he studied 
Falwell because "I was reading Plutarch and some of the great 
Latin orators. I thought it would be creative to compare 
their rhetoric to someone contemporary like Falwell." The 
fact remains, though, he later compared his own writing style 
to that of Falwell. 
     Certainly Rimm was interested in self-promotion--perhaps 
by unusual means. According to the Atlantic City _Press_, in 
1990 Rimm was investigated by the New Jersey Division of 
Gaming Enforcement when fliers advertising his book _An 
American Playground_ were found on the windshields of cars in 
the parking lot of Atlantic City's Taj Mahal casino. The 
fliers promised that anyone who bought the book and showed it 
to Taj Mahal officials would be rewarded with $25 in coins 
for slot machines. This was news to the casino; no one knew 
anything about the offer. 
     Trying to assemble a picture from these fragments, we 
find, perhaps, a secretive, rebellious loner who had such a 
craving for notoriety, nothing else was important by 
comparison--not even freedom of expression on a global 
computer network serving millions of users. According to Mike 
Godwin, "I believe that he'd have been happy if _any_ 
legislation had been passed as an outcome of his article--it 
would have been external validation of his importance." Did 
Rimm want to damage net freedoms? "I don't think that was his 
goal. It was always fame, the spotlight, and the sense that 
he had caused things to happen, even in the United States 
Congress." 
     Rimm categorically denies this. If he'd been looking for 
notoriety, he says, he wouldn't have pursued an engineering 
degree or served in the army. "Mike Godwin never met me," he 
points out, "and spoke to me only once during a one-hour 
conference call with _Nightline_." 
     Rimm also remains defiant about the value of his study: 
"I did not experience 'total humiliation by total exposure.' 
I and many of the people I worked with at Carnegie Mellon are 
very proud of the study, of its quality, originality, power, 
and impact." 
     And yet, this phrase is unintentionally revealing. By 
saying that he's proud of the "power and impact," Rimm 
confirms that he was, in fact, actively interested in 
affecting the status quo. 


     Rough Justice 

     Rimm's name has long since dropped out of sight in the 
national media, but net users have refused to forget. In the 
fall of 1995 Rimm had planned to continue his studies in the 
Technology and Policy Program at MIT, where a place was 
waiting for him. When netizens learned of this, two of them 
visited a member of the admissions committee to warn him 
about Rimm. Evidently he didn't need to be warned; he already 
knew some background. Either way, a few days later, without 
explanation, Rimm stated that his plans had changed. He would 
not be attending MIT in the fall semester after all. Sources 
later suggested that MIT had withdrawn a scholarship that 
they had previously offered. 
     In view of Rimm's distortion of data, maybe he didn't 
deserve a place at MIT. But there were some uneasy 
implications, here. Netizens claimed they had merely told the 
truth about him, and the truth could only hurt someone with 
something to hide. But almost everyone has at least a few 
secrets which would be embarrassing or damaging if they were 
publicized, and on the Internet this means telling an 
audience of millions. 
     Still, the truth can be a devastating weapon even where 
no actual crimes have been committed. Gay activists can wreck 
a macho movie star's career by revealing his private life as 
a homosexual. Journalists can ruin a political candidate by 
revealing incidents from her college days. Many people feel 
ambivalent when public figures are stripped naked in this 
way; but online, anyone can be a target. If people with 
unpopular views are aware that they can be instantly 
subjected to Total Humiliation through Total Exposure, won't 
this act as a chilling effect on free speech? 
     Even where the technique seems fully justified, it's 
still a rough form of justice. When punishments are handed 
down by a judge, they usually include a cutoff date after 
which the offender has paid his debt and is free to go about 
his business. In the online world the cutoff date is 
undefined and may not exist at all. Some activists were 
trading tidbits and minor revelations about Martin Rimm six 
months after his study was published. Years from now, a few 
netizens may still be ready to warn any institution or 
employer that offers a place for Rimm. 
     Moreover, Total Humiliation by Total Exposure is a 
weapon that can point both ways. Imagine the Christian 
Coalition getting online, targeting a free-speech advocate 
who happens to have something to hide in his private life, 
and hounding him mercilessly. There's no way to prevent this. 
Indeed, under the Constitution, it _can't_ be prevented so 
long as no direct threats or libelous statements are made. 
     Mike Godwin acknowledges the problem. "Let's suppose I 
want to damage your reputation," he says. "I have the power 
of the mass media on my desktop, I have no editor above me, 
and I can hide my identity by using a temporary account on 
America Online or Prodigy. I can broadcast my message to tens 
of thousands or maybe even millions, and even if my target 
tries to rebut the statement, his reputation is damaged in an 
irredeemable way." 
     Still, Godwin goes on, "We've had online communications 
for seventeen years, since the first BBS. And in that time 
there have been no more than half-a-dozen well publicized 
libel cases based on online interactions. Let's assume that 
figure is just ten percent of the real total. Sixty cases in 
seventeen years is still nothing." 
     Godwin points out that in the online world, a statement 
doesn't necessarily carry the same weight that it would in 
print. "There's no default assumption of credibility as there 
is when you read _The New York Times,_ especially if someone 
posts from an anonymous account." 
     Still, we should be understand the power of the net to 
destroy privacy, and we should recognize that some Internet 
vigilantes do have a tendency to hound individuals whom they 
dislike. The potential danger, here, is hard to predict; but 
it may ultimately be more significant than the supposed 
danger of downloading sexy pictures of naked people from 
Usenet news groups or computer bulletin boards.

<p><b>Brief summary of this section:</b>

<p>     Jake Baker posted sex stories on Usenet that were 
shockingly sadistic. When one of them named a female student, 
Baker was suspended from his college, placed under arrest, 
and denied bail. He was ultimately charged with making a

seemed to have a strong case, buttressed by email that Baker

started to unravel. To the fury of some feminists, Baker was 
ultimately acquitted.

     Sex Stories 

     On October 3rd, 1994, a nineteen-year-old linguistics 
student named Jake Baker posted a story titled "Gone Fishin'" 
on the Usenet news group alt.sex.stories. Baker preceded his 
text with a warning: "The following story contains non-
consensual rape, torture, and snuff of a teenager by her 
brother and his friend. Consider yourself warned." 
     Was there a difference between ordinary, everyday rape 
and "non-consensual" rape? A linguistics student should have 
known the answer--but semantic quibbles like this soon seemed 
irrelevant when one started reading the story. 
     It was told in the first person, as if Baker was 
recounting events that had actually happened to him. Near the 
beginning was a conversation between himself and his friend, 
Pete: 
 
          See, several weeks ago we admitted to each other 
     that we both thought more about rape than girlfriends; 
     more about sticking hot needles through girls' tits than 
     sucking them, more about abusing them than loving them. 
     So we started to refer to girls in derogatory terms. It 
     turned us on. "Girl" or "woman" makes you think of them 
     as people. "Whore," "bitch," "cunt," "slut" makes you 
     think of them as what they are--fuck toys for the men of 
     the world. Only the bitches've convinced most men they 
     have rights, and so most men don't take advantage of 
     them as they should. 

     Was this the posturing of a shy teenager who felt hurt 
or rejected by women and was using semi-fiction as an outlet 
for his anger? The petulance and resentment toward smart, 
beautiful females was underlined when the narrator explained 
that he wanted to rape and punish Pete's sister because she 
was "a true bitch, and didn't like either of us. She was 
smart, got good grades in school, so Pete's mom liked her and 
not Pete." 
     Predictably, a smartass girl who commits the 
unforgivable crime of ignoring a teenage boy ends up being 
punished. But Baker took the punishment much farther than any 
reader could have expected. 
     In the story, Pete and the narrator follow Pete's sister 
into woodland, where they catch her with her boyfriend. The 
narrator drowns the boyfriend, then he and Pete rape the girl 
anally and vaginally, stick hot pins through her nipples, 
whip her with electric cord, force her to give oral sex, 
torture her with pliers, force tent stakes into her vagina 
and anus, burn her thighs, hang her upside-down and use her 
as a punching bag, cut her with a knife, urinate on her, 
amputate her nipples, repeatedly throttle her till she passes 
out, and then revive her. Pete thrusts his entire arm up into 
her anus and rips at her intestines. "Then, she died, and we 
spent the night fucking and abusing her dead body before 
burning her in the morning." 
     Woven through the various atrocities is a homoerotic 
thread. Pete is the older boy; Jake, narrating the story, 
defers to him. They have an unspoken bond of trust and 
affection. The girl that they lust after is seventeen but has 
an abnormally youthful, boylike body, with breasts that 
haven't developed. Pete's penis is described with more visual 
detail than the girl's genitals, which are barely mentioned. 
And when the narrator has a choice of vaginal or anal sex, he 
chooses anal. 
     It didn't seem to occur to Baker that this story could 
get him into any kind of trouble. He submitted it under his 
own name, via a university email account, to a news group 
that could be accessed by millions of people. Presumably he 
did this because he wanted a response, and since women were 
unlikely to enjoy the story, he seemed to want his response 
from men. 
     He got it. A Canadian net user named Arthur Gonda made 
some positive comments. On November 29th Baker wrote back to 
him saying, "I'd love to meet with you. There's no one else I 
can share my thoughts with." This turned out to be the 
beginning of a two-month correspondence. 
     Meanwhile, Baker wrote another story titled "A Day at 
Work" which he posted on December 15th, 1994, this time with 
a different introductory note: "Comments and criticism always 
welcome. Enjoy." 
     _Enjoy?_ 
     "A Day at Work" was told in the first person, like the 
first story, but in this story the protagonist is a school 
custodian. He traps a young female Korean student, ties her, 
beats her, bites her breasts, whips them with his belt, 
pounds her head against the wall while she is impaled on his 
penis, pauses for a dinner break, then hacks the girl's 
breasts with a knife, pours bleach into the wounds, tears her 
breasts entirely off, ejaculates in her face, and kills her. 
     Once again the victim is childlike, and the first 
preference is for anal sex. 
     On January 7th, 1995, Baker struck a third time. This 
story featured yet another anal rape of a teenage girl. 
Titled "Going for a Walk," it was prefaced with a more 
plaintive note: "For those of you who do, I write this to 
turn you on. For those of you who don't, I write this to 
annoy you. Either way, have an opinion. The greatest insult 
to a writer is not to have any feelings for his work." 
     And the greatest insult to Jake Baker was obviously 
being ignored. Well, he needn't have worried; he soon had 
more notoriety than he could have ever wished for. 
     On January 9th, 1995, Baker posted the story that 
changed his life. "The premise," he wrote, "is that my friend 
Jerry and I have broken into the apartment of this girl ... 
whom I know ... and are proceeding to have a little fun with 
her." 
     The story described another rape-and-mutilation 
sequence. This time the victim is tied and gagged, fondled, 
slapped, and forced to kneel. Bizarrely, Baker describes 
himself forcing his penis "as far as it will go into her 
ear." 
     Next she is suspended from a ceiling fan by her long 
hair, so that her feet kick helplessly in mid-air. Her 
breasts are beaten with a hairbrush, her vaginal lips are 
held open with super-glue, a clamp is applied to her 
clitoris, and her buttocks are whipped till they bleed. She 
is moved to a chair, tied, and forced to perform oral sex 
while a hot curling iron is thrust into her anus. One of her 
nipples is cut off. She is anally raped, then doused in 
gasoline and burned to death. 
     This was comparable to Baker's previous fiction--yet 
there was a crucial difference. This time, he gave the victim 
a name; indeed, he used it as the title of the story. 
     The name just happened to identify a real-life female 
student enrolled at Baker's college. 


     "I need to DO IT." 

     Phil Watson, who runs a computer system for a defense 
contractor, was eating lunch when he browsed through 
alt.sex.stories. He didn't vomit when he read Baker's latest 
effort, but to use Baker's phrase, he did "have an opinion." 
As he said later to a reporter from _New York Newsday,_ "It 
was the grossest thing I had ever read online." From his 
office in Washington, DC, Watson sent an email message to the 
University of Michigan warning them that one of their 
students might be dangerous. 
     Meanwhile, the global reach of the Internet included a 
sixteen-year-old girl in Russia. She read Baker's latest work 
and showed it to her father, who passed it to Richard DuVal, 
an American attorney who happened to be working in Moscow. By 
coincidence, DuVal was an alumnus of the University of 
Michigan. As he later said to a reporter, "There's something 
here that crosses the line from bad taste to pathological." 
He sent his own message to the college authorities. 
     On January 20th, University security officers visited 
Baker's dorm room. Did he admit writing the story? Sure he 
did. He saw nothing to be ashamed of. He waived his right to 
call an attorney, and he willingly divulged the password to 
his Internet account so that officials could read his email. 
As FBI special agent Greg Stejskal later told journalists, 
"It would have been private, except that he signed a waiver." 
     The email included all of Baker's correspondence with 
his Canadian pen-pal Arthur Gonda. In some ways this turned 
out to be even more incendiary that the material Baker had 
posted to Usenet, because it seemed to cross the boundary 
between fantasy and reality. 
     In the excerpts below, typographical errors and 
punctuation have not been corrected. 
     On December 1st, 1994, Baker wrote to Gonda, "I highly 
agree with the type of woman you like to hurt. You seem to 
have the same tastes I have. When you come down, this'll be 
fun!" 
     Less than 24 hours later Gonda wrote to Baker, "I would 
love to do a 13 or 14 year old ... once tey  are tieed up and 
struggling we could do anything we want to them...." 
     By December 9th, Baker seemed to be evolving some 
specific plans: "I don't want any blood in my room, though I 
have come upon an excellent method to abduct a bitch-- As I 
said before, my room is right across from the girl's  
bathroom. Wiat  until late at night. grab her when she goes 
to unlock the dorr. Knock her unconscious. and put her into 
one of those portable lockers (forget the word for it). or 
even a duffle bag. Then hurry her out to the car and take her 
away ... What do you think?" 
     Two days later, Baker wrote: "Just thinking about it 
anymore doesn't do the trick ... I need TO DO IT." 
     The next day, Gonda replied: "My feelings exactly!" 
     The two of them swapped more than forty messages between 
November 29th, 1994, and January 25th, 1995. During the same 
period Baker also corresponded with other people who had read 
his stories. But his letters to Gonda were the ones that 
galvanized college officials. Clearly (in their minds, at 
least) two men were plotting to kidnap, rape, and murder a 
student on campus. Which student? Well, Baker had already 
named her, hadn't he? Her name was right there in the title 
of his most recent story. 
     On January 26th, the university notified the FBI. 
     On February 1st, when Baker emerged from a class he 
found himself collared by a plainclothes university police 
officer and two housing department officers who told him that 
university president James Duderstadt had suspended him 
without a hearing. Baker was taken to his dorm room so that 
he could pack some clothes, was escorted off the campus. "He 
was asked to leave, and he's outta here," said Captain James 
Smiley of the university's Department of Public Safety, 
speaking to a journalist from the _Ann Arbor News._ 
     Baker still didn't seem to understand what all the fuss 
was about. "I'm more than willing to make up whatever harm 
I've done, but not to leave the university," he said in a 
public statement. On February 7th, he offered a compromise: 
to undergo therapy, live off-campus, and only visit the 
university for classes. But college authorities were in no 
mood to make a deal, and neither was law enforcement. Two 
days later Baker was arrested by the FBI at the home of his 
lawyer. He was charged with violating Title 18, U.S. Code, 
Section 875 (c), which prohibits threats to injure or kidnap 
a victim and carries a penalty of up to five years 
imprisonment. Baker was the first person ever to be charged 
with making interstate threats via the Internet. 
     By this time the story was national news. Baker's 
mother, Vilma, launched a fierce publicity campaign in 
defense of her son. Aged 56 but pictured in the national 
press as a youthful woman with shoulder-length shaggy blonde 
hair, wearing a colorful sweater, sweat-pants, and sneakers, 
Vilma turned out to be a spirited woman who taught creative 
writing to high-school students. She had separated from 
Baker's father, a dentist from Kuwait, six years previously. 
     Borrowing a phrase from Rush Limbaugh, Vilma condemned 
university officials as "femi-Nazis" and said they had picked 
on her son because they nursed a "hatred toward men." (This 
could have been an oblique reference to the fact that famed 
anti-porn crusader Catherine MacKinnon just happened to be 
affiliated with the university and had wasted no time 
contacting the girl whom Baker had named in the title of his 
story.) 
     Vilma claimed that Jake had never intended the girl to 
see what he wrote. In fact, said Vilma, when college 
authorities insisted on showing the text to the girl, Jake 
"couldn't eat for a week. He cried and cried and cried." 
Regarding Baker's correspondence with Gonda, she said: "I 
thought it just sounded like a bunch of boys trying to outdo 
each other. I didn't take it very seriously." 
     To complete her picture of Jake Baker as a decent, 
respectable young man, Vilma released a photograph of him 
dressed up in a tuxedo, playing the violin. _People_ magazine 
published it alongside Baker's mug shot from the U.S. 
Marshall's office--but oddly enough, he came across the same 
way in both pictures, as a shy, fragile, nerdy teenager 
looking a little bit lost. 
     The ACLU quickly made a public statement. "The FBI needs 
to go after people who commit violence against women, not 
college students who fantasize about it," said Howard Simon, 
executive director of the Michigan chapter. "His stories may 
have been disgusting and vile, but I have seen nothing that 
would appear to be a threat to any person." 
     Baker's attorney David Cahill told reporters that not 
only Baker's stories, but his entire sex life was a fantasy. 
"He's a virgin," Cahill claimed. "He just has an active 
imagination." 
     And when journalists spoke to Baker's eighteen-year-old 
room mate, Jesse Jannetta, he told them, "I had a hard time 
recognizing the person who wrote that story. I've never seen 
any indication that Jake is a threat. He is not violent." 
     Really, though, it didn't matter how many endorsements 
Baker received, or who they came from. They couldn't compete 
with the deranged sadism of the text that Baker himself had 
written. In the court of public opinion, he had pronounced 
himself guilty; the only question was whether the same thing 
would happen in a court of law. 


     A Ticking Bomb 

     Prosecutors seemed to feel they had a clear and simple 
case. Thanks to the wonders of email, the FBI didn't have to 
collect any evidence, because the evidence had all been 
collected for them, time-stamped, date-stamped, and archived 
on the hard drives at the university's Internet site. 
     In his correspondence with his Canadian friend, Baker 
had emphasized that he was no longer willing to settle for 
fiction; he needed to "do it." He had named his proposed 
victim publicly; she was a student in a Japanese class that 
he attended at the university. According to an affidavit 
sworn by FBI agent Greg Stejskal, the girl was "aware of 
Baker's transmission concerning her and is frightened and 
intimidated by it." What else could anyone need, to prove a 
threat of physical violence? 
     Federal magistrate Thomas Carlson referred to Baker as 
"a ticking bomb" and provisionally ordered him to be held 
without bail. The next day, February 10th, the case was 
formally assigned to federal district court judge Bernard 
Friedman who presided over a detention hearing--and he, too, 
refused to free Baker under any circumstances. This was 
highly unusual; almost all defendants charged with federal 
crimes other than treason or murder are normally granted 
bail. 
     Maybe things would have been different if Arthur Gonda 
had stepped forward and testified that he and Baker were just 
fantasizing online and had never had any intention of 
following through. Unfortunately, however, Gonda had 
disappeared without a trace. His name wasn't listed in 
Ontario tax records and seemed to be a pseudonym. 
     Baker's criminal attorney, Douglas Mullkoff, appealed 
the no-bail ruling to the 6th Circuit Court in CIncinnati--
but on March 7th, they too refused to free him before his 
trial. 
     Then the situation changed. On March 9th, after a month 
in jail, Baker appeared before federal judge Avern Cohn. 
     Cohn had played a highly publicized role in another case 
involving the University of Michigan where he had struck down 
a code limiting student speech. Originally appointed by Jimmy 
Carter, Cohn was an old-school liberal who frankly admitted 
his bias in favor of free speech. On the other hand, he 
wasn't predictably pro-defendant. One court observer 
characterized the judge as "demandingly tough. Even if he 
likes your case, you're not necessarily going to have an easy 
time." 
     At the hearing, Cohn was told that the university had 
conducted their own psychiatric evaluation of Baker more than 
a month ago. The evaluation had determined that Baker 
displayed no risk factors for potential violence. Another 
evaluation on February 7th yielded the same verdict. Still 
another evaluation, on February 9th, concluded that Baker 
"presented no clear and present danger to [the student named 
in his story] or anyone, at the time of the interview." 
     Cohn decided that there should be a fourth and final 
psychological evaluation, and prosecutors agreed to be bound 
by the results. Two days later, when this evaluation turned 
out negative like all the rest, Cohn released Baker on 
$10,000 bail. He told him to stay away from the university, 
not to associate with anyone involved in the case, and not to 
post any more stories online. Apart from that, Jake Baker was 
at liberty pending his trial. 
     But would there actually be a trial? Mullkoff said his 
next step would be to demand that the whole case should be 
thrown out for lack of evidence. 
     _Lack of evidence?_ This seemed to make no sense at all, 
bearing in mind the stack of stories and email currently in 
the possession of prosecutors. Yet the situation was turning 
out to be far less straightforward than most people had 
expected. 


     A Losing Battle 

     There were three main choices for prosecuting Jake 
Baker. 
     1. Publication of obscene literature. His stories were 
certainly shocking, and might be obscene--but the way he had 
distributed them created a problem. The most appropriate 
federal law, 18 USC 1465, was interpreted in 1987 by the 
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals as "restricted in its terms to 
the transportation of tangible objects." Usenet posts 
obviously didn't fit that description. 
     2. Making an obscene communication by telephone. This 
looked more prmising--but since Baker had given his fiction 
away, he could only be accused of disseminating obscenity on 
a noncommercial basis, and the sentence for that was a 
maximum of six months. The case had acquired so much 
visibility, prosecutors wanted more than that. 
     3. Making threats to kill or kidnap. The relevant 
federal law is worded as follows: "Whoever transmits in 
interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing 
any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the 
person of another, shall be fined under this title or 
imprisoned not more than five years, or both." 
     The key word, here, is "threat." In 1976, a Second 
Circuit federal appeals court ruled that a threat must be "so 
unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the 
person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and 
imminent prospect of execution...." 
     This created some new problems. Had Baker and Gonda 
actually named the person they were threatening to kidnap and 
rape? Not precisely; Baker had only used a girl's name in a 
work of fiction. Had Baker and Gonda decided on a specific 
plan of action? No, Baker had just talked vaguely about 
grabbing a girl in the bathroom opposite his dorm room. The 
female students who used that bathroom had been frightened 
when they learned what Baker wrote, and they'd put a notice 
on the door reminding each other to lock it; but in the 
famous words of Supreme Court Justice Brandeis, "Fear of 
serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free 
speech.... There must be reasonable ground to believe that 
the danger apprehended is imminent." 
     Tacitly acknowledging these problems, on March 15th 
federal prosecutors dropped their initial charge against 
Baker, which had assumed that the girl named in his story was 
the one being threatened. They now charged him with five 
other counts based on his email with Gonda. Reading this 
email carefully, prosecutors claimed, it became clear that 
Baker was plotting to abduct various victims ranging from 
female students at his college to the daughter of a neighbor 
in his home town of Boardman, Ohio. The latter charge was 
based on the following exchange: 

          Gonda: "By the way, how about your neighbor at 
     home, you may get a chance to see her?" 
          Baker: "She might have moved. But she'd be a great 
     catch." 

     Would these new charges against Baker turn out to be 
more plausible than the rest? There was only one way to find 
out. 


     Words Constitute the Crime 

     On May 26th, 1995, Judge Cohn presided at a hearing to 
consider Mullkofff's motion to dismiss all charges. According 
to two observers who were present at the time, it was a 
memorable session. 
     Cohn, 71 years old but looking more like 60 with his 
full head of neatly combed white hair, was in a typically 
impatient, irascible mood. He did not project a friendly 
manner. 
     Mullkoff, in his forties, was an unimpressive figure, 
below average height, clean cut, conservatively dressed, not 
at all like a stereotypical flashy, boisterous criminal 
defense lawyer. He was very low-key. 
     Ken Chadwell and Christopher Yates were the prosecutors. 
Chadwell, tall with a dark moustache, was a zealous law-and-
order type, eager to protect society from a dangerous threat, 
and liable to get excited at times. In a previous brief he 
had warned that rape and murder of women and children would 
follow if Baker was released. By contrast, Yates was more 
deliberate, measured, and thoughtful. Described by one 
observer as "the intellectual of the Detroit U.S. Attorney's 
Office," Yates was definitely not prone to emotional 
outbursts. This gave him a better chance than Chadwell at 
getting along with the judge. 
     Baker, meanwhile, was totally unobtrusive, a shy, frail, 
timid twenty-year-old peering through thick-lensed wire-
framed glasses. Throughout the whole legal ritual, he didn't 
say a word. 
     "Hi," said Judge Cohn, as he sat down. 
     "Good afternoon, Judge," said Mullkoff. 
     "I have a couple of questions to ask for some 
clarification," said Cohn, turning to the prosecuting 
attorneys. He then spent ten minutes grilling Chadwell 
relentlessly about witnesses who would be called if there was 
a trial. He seemed skeptical that many of them were relevant, 
especially parents in Boardman, Ohio who were supposedly 
worried sick after reading excerpts from Baker's email that 
had been published in local newspapers. 
     Finally Cohn zeroed in on his first specific point. 
Prosecutors were claiming that a threat had been made jointly 
by Gonda and Baker, but no one knew where Gonda was, or how 
old he was, or even whether he was a man. 
     "I think it's fair to say it's a man," said Chadwell. 
     "Why, why?" Cohn snapped back. "Arthur Gonda could be a 
twelve-year-old boy, couldn't he, or an 80-year-old woman?" 
     "I guess theoretically," Chadwell said. 
     This was relevant because there's no way to evaluate a 
threat without knowing who had made it. If a five-year-old 
kid threatens to punch someone in the face, no one can regard 
this as seriously threatening. If a 200-pound bodyguard says 
the same thing, it's a different matter entirely. 
     Suppose Gonda turned out to be an 80-year-old-woman who 
had just been playing with Baker. Wouldn't that force 
everyone to view the email in a completely different light? 
Wittingly or unwittingly, the judge had picked up on the 
ephemeral, impersonal quality of online communication. 
     There was some more to-and-fro in which Cohn got the 
prosecutors to admit that threat analysis experts at the FBI 
and the Secret Service had never been consulted to determine 
whether Baker was a danger to anyone. 
     Cohn then proceeded to teach the attorneys some history. 
According to his research, in 1932, after Bruno Richard 
Hauptmann had sent threatening letters to the Lindbergh 
family demanding ransom money, Congress passed a law to 
prohibit threats by mail. Two years later, the law was 
broadened to include threats by phone. "And then," said Cohn, 
"in 1939 they amended it and said, people now are not only 
extorting money and things of value, but they're doing other 
things, they're threatening to blow up the Capitol in South 
Carolina unless somebody is released. So we have to broaden 
its language. Now, would you agree that the way it's being 
applied in this case is a substantial broadening from that?" 
Cohn paused for an instant. "Just out of curiosity," he 
added. 
     Chadwell didn't seem to like this question. He simply 
said that the way he was applying the law was consistent with 
the way it had been applied in other recent cases. Cohn was 
ready for this, pounced on it, and rejected it. He didn't 
want to know about recent cases; he wanted to determine the 
original intentions of the lawmakers. Personally he didn't 
believe that anyone in Congress had ever intended the law to 
apply to email messages between a student and an unknown 
correspondent, talking about doing something unstated to a 
woman who wasn't properly identified. 
     Judge Cohn moved on to his next point, which he 
addressed to Yates. Suppose Cohn was walking down the street 
and saw a good-looking woman, and he said to his companion, 
"I would really like to F the broad whether she wanted it or 
not. ... would that be a threat?" 
     "Probably not," admitted Yates. 
     Now that Cohn was dealing with Yates, he focused on the 
question of who, precisely, had been threatened. 
     Yates was thoroughly prepared for this. He quoted the 
email from Gonda: "By the way, how about your neighbor at 
home, you may get a chance to see her?" 
     And Baker's response: "She might have moved. But she'd 
be a great catch." 
     And then later, according to Yates, Baker had written: 
"I HAVE to make a bitch suffer! ... All I think of before I 
sleep is how I'd torture a bitch I get my hands on." Didn't 
this make it seem that the "girl next door" was in jeopardy? 
     Cohn wasn't impressed. "All he's doing is telling the 
thoughts that go through his head. We're not punishing him 
for having lustful or evil thoughts, are we?" 
     "No, we're not," Yates agreed. 
     "What are we punishing him for?" Cohn persisted. 
     Yates quoted some more of Baker's email: "Just thinking 
about it anymore doesn't do the trick... I need TO DO IT." 
     "He's expressing an inner need," said Cohn, "like he's 
talking to his analyst. How is that a threat?" 
     Chadwell took over from Yates and insisted that the 
emailed statements were perfectly clear in their meaning. 
     "I'm not going to go through that one again," said Cohn. 
"I went through it with Mr. Yates. I don't think he did very 
well, and I don't believe you're going to do much better. No 
offense, but I just think--you're not going to clear up the 
ambiguities. It's perfectly clear, Mr. Chadwell, there are 
some ambiguities in these words." 
     To Chadwell, this seemed intolerable. He was a federal 
prosecutor. He possessed correspondence between two men who 
were clearly plotting kidnap, rape, and possibly murder. For 
heaven's sake, how clear did it have to be? "They're planning 
a crime!" he protested. 
     "Well," said Cohn, pouncing again on his unfortunate 
adversary, "planning a crime isn't what they're charged 
with." 
     This was true: the prosecutors hadn't charged Baker and 
Gonda with conspiracy--because there wasn't enough evidence 
for that. Gonda and Baker were charged with making a threat, 
and in that case, as Cohn put it, "The words themselves 
[must] constitute the crime." 
     Finally, Cohn finished picking on the prosecuting 
attorneys and told them to sit down. He invited Mullkoff to 
speak, and took a far more lenient line with him. 
     The defense attorney cited a precedent that said for a 
threat to be a criminal offense, it had to be unequivocal, 
immediate, unconditional, and specific. By comparison, the 
statements in email had been vague, the threat had not been 
immediate (a month had passed without anything happening), 
and no person had been specified. 
     Cohn seemed to agree. He turned back to the prosecutors 
and gave them one last chance. They had five days in which to 
find a case that had been tried in the past and seemed 
similar to Baker's. 
     "Thank you, your honor," Yates said dutifully. 
     That was the end of the hearing. 


     The Undefined Menace 

     Judge Cohn delivered his final written opinion on June 
21st, 1995. He stated that he did not regard the email as a 
threat, and he was scornful of the prosecution's case. He 
wrote: "The government's enthusiastic beginning petered out 
to a salvage effort once it recognized that the communication 
which so much alarmed the University of Michigan officials 
was only a rather savage and tasteless piece of fiction." 
     Naturally, a lot of people were outraged. Susan McGee, 
executive director of the Domestic Violence Project in 
Washtenaw County, released a statement complaining that the 
ruling "shows the judicial system in the United States is 
more interested in men's rights to torture, beat, and harass 
women than it is in women's rights to live their lives in 
peace and safety." Catherine MacKinnon vowed to bring civil 
charges against Baker on behalf of the woman he had named in 
his story. 
     But all the rants couldn't change the fact that Baker's 
right to fantasize publicly--globally!--had been reaffirmed, 
even though he had used the name of a real person in his 
horror scenario and had written to Gonda about actually 
"doing it." He was now a free man. 
     Or was he? The government still had one more option. 
They could appeal Judge Cohn's ruling to dismiss all charges. 
     In November, 1995, Christopher Yates exercised that 
option. Presumably, he hoped that a three-judge appeals court 
would take a more conservative line than Avern Cohn. 
Mullkoff, Baker's defense attorney, seemed convinced that 
this wasn't going to happen. "I think the government is 
grasping at straws," he told a reporter. Still, he had to 
wait till the appeals court considered the case in the spring 
of 1996. 
     Meanwhile, Baker was doing his best to retreat back into 
obscurity. He withdrew from the University of Michigan and 
started attending a community college in Ohio. 
     One question he had never really answered was why he'd 
written the stories and posted them publicly in the first 
place. A net user named Phil Watson, who lived in Virginia, 
shed some light on this when he was questioned by reporters 
from the _Ann Arbor News_. Watson had traded his own series 
of email messages with Baker. He claimed that Baker had 
stated at one point, "I have never hurt anybody, and never 
plan on hurting anybody." According to Baker, he wrote his 
stories "to rid myself of the overwhelming anger I feel."  
     If this was true, then the stories were a form of 
therapy. Probably they would have been ignored and forgotten 
if they hadn't been circulated via the Internet, which had so 
much power to reach out and touch just about anyone, from 
vulnerable young women to federal prosecutors. But the 
stories were still protected speech, no matter how many 
people saw them or how nervous the stories made those people 
feel. 
     At the beginning of his opinion, Judge Cohn quoted a 
statement from a case dating back to 1886: "It is not the 
policy of the law to punish those unsuccessful threats which 
it is not presumed would terrify ordinary persons 
excessively; and there is so much opportunity for magnifying 
or misunderstanding undefined menaces that probably as much 
mischief would be caused by letting them be prosecuted as by 
refraining from it." 
     Of course, this opinion was written in the rougher, 
tougher environment of the 1880s--but maybe it has new 
relevance to the frontier world of the net, where "magnifying 
or misunderstanding undefined menaces" has become a growth 
industry for legislators and journalists alike. 
     Anarchy online does indeed create situations that make a 
lot of people nervous; but if we accept Judge Cohn's opinion, 
laws to suppress the anarchy could cause more "mischief" than 
the anarchy itself. 
     Naturally, people in law enforcement don't see it that 
way. During Baker's hearing, Judge Cohn asked Christopher 
Yates: "What's the great social significance of this case?" 
     Yates had an immediate answer. He said that the case had 
two social values: "specific deterrence" and "general 
deterrence." Specifically, Yates hoped that if Jake Baker was 
punished for what he'd done, he'd be less likely to do it 
again. And generally, _every_ net user might think twice in 
future before posting sadistic stories or swapping 
conspiratorial email. If Baker was put in jail, it would tend 
to discourage "this sort of planning across computer 
networks...." 
     Here was a federal prosecutor admitting what a lot of 
net users had suspected all along: he wanted to fight fear 
with fear. If troublemakers online were doing stuff that 
worried honest citizens, it was time to frighten the 
troublemakers to make them cease and desist--even if this had 
a chilling effect on free speech. 
     In the Jake Baker case, it so happened that a liberal, 
highly literate judge was ready to block this tactic. Next 
time, though, it might be different. It seems a short leap to 
imagine Internet service providers being intimidated by 
federal prosecutors, just as BBS users in Cincinnati were 
intimidated by the local sherriff. After all, this would be 
the simplest possible answer to the problems of content, 
distribution, and access: throw a couple of people in jail, 
publicize the case in all available media, and create such a 
climate of oppression, most people will _censor themselves._

     Clipper vs. PGP 

     If a prosecutor wants to crack down on netporn by making 
an example of someone, the first step is to find some highly 
offensive material. This was no problem at all in Jake 
Baker's case, since Baker surrendered his own text; but if 
evidence isn't so readily available, can law enforcement 
officers easily dig it up? Is it technically possible to tap 
the Internet and listen in on private email? 
     The net has a decentralized structure and carries a huge 
volume of message traffic. Still, methods for monitoring it 
may already be in use. An anonymous contributor to the 
"cypherpunks" online discussion group contributed the 
following message early in 1996: 

          In the 1960's-1970's when international cable 
     traffic was in its computer infancy, access was had to 
     EVERY CABLE MESSAGE passing through the message switches 
     of U.S. common carriers. This means not only every 
     international cable message originating from or destined 
     to a U.S. point, but also included every message ROUTED 
     THROUGH the U.S., such as Europe <--> South America. 
          There was no great skullduggery involved--the 
     common carriers simply made copies of their own log 
     tapes and handed them to messengers from the, ah, FCC 
     (ahem). It was on the operations checklist and no one 
     thought twice about it. It may be urban legend to some, 
     but I've seen it with my own eyes, handled the tapes 
     with my own hands. 
          If anyone else wishes to move this from the status 
     of urban legend to something more solid, all they have 
     to do is locate and ask people who worked in message 
     switch operations at RCA Global Communications, ITT 
     World Communications, or Western Union International, 
     the three common carriers of that time. 
          Knowing this, I would assume something similar was 
     done at overseas locations of the same carriers and at 
     such other access points as could be compromised. An 
     organization such as NSA that viewed this as SOP 
     [standard operating procedure] would have to be brain 
     dead not to be doing the same thing with the Internet. 
     The only question in my mind is how far they have gone 
     beyond Usenet and the newer, fertile ground of web 
     sites. Are they vacuuming packets and reassembling 
     email? Just how many laser discs have been filled with 
     coherent traffic? 
          Time to exercise those plain, brown 
     envelopes. 

     In other words, the only secure defense that citizens 
have against this kind of surveillance is encryption. 
     Cryptography has always been an obscure little backwater 
of mathematics, a black art whose disciples did most of their 
work for national governments under conditions of secrecy. 
The business of creating codes and breaking them has always 
been vital during warfare, but of no special use in civilian 
life. 
     When microcomputers became widely available in the 1980s 
it became theoretically possible to create encryption 
software for the masses--but most programmers didn't know 
enough about it, and many important techniques were 
restricted by patents. Software publishers were also 
discouraged by the total lack of an export market, because 
selling strong encryption to foreign countries is a federal 
crime. The mathematical techniques are classified as 
"munitions," putting them in the same class as nuclear 
secrets. Consequently, by default, the government maintained 
a decades-long monopoly on powerful encryption. 
     In June, 1991, a man named Phil Zimmermann changed all 
that. He released a program that he'd written called PGP, 
which stood for Pretty Good Privacy. In fact, PGP was much 
better than "pretty good"; Zimmermann could easily prove that 
even the largest supercomputer would have to work nonstop for 
many years to break a single encrypted message. 
     The idea behind PGP originated back in 1976 when 
Whitfield Diffie, then at Stanford University, proposed the 
concept of a "digital signature" to authenticate text 
messages. In very simple terms, Whitfield's concept works 
like this. Suppose I run a simple program that adds up the 
bits and bytes of my message and turns them into an 
identification number. Now suppose my program encrypts that 
number. The result is a digital "signature." If someone 
alters my message, the signature won't match anymore. If 
someone tries to send a fake message under my name, they 
won't be able to put a valid signature on it, because they 
won't know the key to my encryption system. Therefore, my 
text is secure. 
     The system is actually more complicated than this, and 
relies on some facts about prime numbers. A prime number 
always leaves a remainder when its's divided by any number 
smaller than itself but higher than 1. For instance, when 5 
is divided by 2, 3, or 4, there's a remainder every time, and 
therefore 5 is a prime number. By comparison, when 6 is 
divided by 2 or by 3, there's no remainder. Therefore, 6 is 
_not_ a prime number. 
     If you take a couple of very large primes (call them A 
and B) and multiply them together, you get an even larger 
number (call it C). This multiplication is easy for a 
computer to do, regardless of how big the numbers are. 
     Now suppose you take the beru large number, which we 
called C, and challenge someone to discover A and B, the two 
primes that were used to create it. Basically, the only way 
to crack it is by trial and error. The simplest approach 
would be to try dividing C by 2 to see if there's a 
remainder. Then you try 3, 4, 5--and so on. If C is big 
enough, this process can demand more computing power than 
exists in the whole world. 
     This principle underlies modern systems of "public key" 
encryption such as PGP. You publicize your very large number, 
C, and people can use it as a key to encrypt messages that 
are sent to you. When you receive the message, in effect you 
use your prime factors (A and B) to decode the message. Since 
no one has enough computing power to calculate A or B, and 
since you don't tell anyone what those numbers are, you're 
the only person who can read encrypted messages that are sent 
to you. 
     When Zimmermann released PGP in 1991, suddenly a 
privilege that had been reserved for national powers was 
available to anyone with a computer. Moreover, Zimmermann 
didn't even charge anything for his product; he was giving it 
away. 
     He did this to combat an ominous trend. "Before 
telephones were invented," he says, "no one could listen in 
on your conversations at all. That's where our expectations 
of privacy should be based. When the Constitution was framed 
there was no need to put the right to privacy in the Bill of 
Rights because every conversation was private. We should have 
the same privacy when we speak over the phone as when we 
speak face to face. An accident of technology should not 
require us to give up our privacy." 
     Zimmermann started out as a computer scientist 
specializing in designing small computing devices for 
consumer goods. At first, he treated cryptography as a hobby. 
He began studying it more seriously in 1984, while he was 
also making a reputation for himself as an anti-nuclear 
weapons activist. "I was involved in civil disobedience at 
the Nevada test site," he says, "and got jailed a couple of 
times, once with Carl Sagan and Daniel Ellsberg--in fact, 
there was so many of us, they couldn't hold us all." 
     He speaks carefully, precisely, and sounds slightly shy. 
Behind his soft-spoken manner, though, he seems to have a 
very stubborn streak; and his record implies that he has a 
deep distrust of government. 
     "Moi?" he says, laughing. 
     Does he think of himself as a radical? 
     "No, my background is more in a sort of quiet middle-
class activism. I used to teach a class in military policy; I 
trained lobbyists for the nuclear weapons freeze campaign. I 
also served as a military policy advisor for some House and 
Senate candidates." 
     Eventually he went into cryptography full-time, and PGP 
was the result. 
     It was available via the net from a computer at MIT. If 
someone from a foreign country tried to log on and download 
the program, the MIT system sensed this and blocked the call; 
but still there were easy ways to get around that. In effect, 
Zimmermann had released something that was guaranteed to 
escape around the globe. Didn't this mean he had effectively 
violated the law against exporting munitions? Federal 
prosecutors saw it that way, and an investigation was 
initiated against Zimmermann in 1993. 
     That same year, the Clinton Administration unveiled 
plans for the Clipper Chip, a pre-programmed component 
designed to be built into every telephone, modem, and fax 
machine. Supposedly, this would _increase_ everyone's privacy 
by encrypting all communications on a routine basis. There 
was a catch, though: each Clipper Chip would have a code 
number embedded in it which would be kept in "escrow" by an 
appropriate government agency. If law enforcement obtained a 
court order, they could demand the code number and would then 
be able to monitor all messages that passed through the phone 
or the modem containing that particular chip. 
     The government seemed to be saying, "We think it's a 
great idea for all your communications to be private--so long 
as they're not private from _us_." 
     Officials seemed genuinely puzzled that anyone would 
object to this. The FBI already had the power to intercept 
mail or monitor phone calls if a court order authorized them 
to do so. The Clipper Chip was just an extension of the same 
principle. 
     Zimmermann disagrees. "By building an infrastructure 
that's required to meet government standards for wiretapping, 
you're building something that is optimized for surveillance. 
If we don't fight this, the government will make it law. And 
that is like requiring you to make it easier for them to 
search your house." 
     Ultimately there were four main objections to the 
Clipper plan. 
     First, every device would have to have a built-in ID 
number that would be linked with its owner. In the words of 
ex-CIA agent Robert Steele, "Clipper was not just a 
encryption scheme, it meant tagging every computer and every 
telephone so that it would broadcast its identity at every 
moment." 
     Second, no criminal in his right mind would rely on the 
Clipper Chip, knowing that it isn't secure from the FBI. 
Anyone planning to discuss illegal activities over the phone 
would obviously use some other code that the government 
couldn't break. Therefore, Clipper would be useles as a crime 
prevention tool. It would only violate the privacy of law-
abiding citizens. 
     Third, American electronics manufacturers would have a 
hard time exporting "Cliperized" products because foreign 
customers wouldn't want to own phones that the U.S. 
Government could tap whenever it pleased. 
     Fourth, many people wondered if the "escrow" system 
would be abused. Would the agency that held the decryption 
keys really remain independent from other agencies? Would the 
keys be properly protected from theft? 
     In a Time/CNN poll, two-thirds of those sampled felt it 
was more important to protect the privacy of phone calls than 
to preserve the ability of police to place wiretaps. When 
Clipper was explained, eighty percent opposed it. In a rare 
display of solidarity, libertarian activists and lobbyists 
from large electronics corporations formed a united front of 
opposition. 
     In February, 1994, after nine months of public debate in 
which almost everyone complained, criticized, and objected to 
the plan, the Clinton Administration announced that Clipper 
would be used by all government agencies for their own 
unclassified communications, but it would remain "voluntary" 
for the private sector. 
     Some activists concluded from this that Clipper was 
effectively dead. They were wrong. In August, 1995, a second 
version was proposed, very little different from the first. 
"Clipper is a vampire policy," says David Banisar of EPIC 
(Electronic Privacy Information Center in Wasington, DC). 
"You keep shooting bullets into it, but it keeps on going. 
The only way to kill it is by driving a stake into it, and I 
don't know if there's one big enough." 
     Meanwhile, PGP had circulated throughout the net, and 
people had started using digital signatures to authenticate 
their messages. Phil Zimmermann kept waiting to find out if 
he was going to be indicted for treason. The statute of 
limitations was due to run out in June, 1996; but his 
attorney felt that prosecutors could probably find a way to 
get around that deadline if they wanted to. Zimmermann was 
was uncomfortably aware that if the feds did decide to haul 
him in, he could face a three-to-five year sentence and up to 
a $1 million dollar fine. This didn't cause him to back down, 
though. He released a new version of PGP and counted more 
than 75,000 downloads from the primary site where it was 
stored. Many of those copies went to other net sites for 
further free distribution. He then developed a totally new 
product to encrypt spoken-word messages for transmission as 
data over the net. (The software can be downloaded from MIT 
at http://web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone.)  
     Despite these provocations, in January, 1996 the 
Department of Justice finally released a short, terse 
statement announcing that Zimmermann was not going to be 
indicted after all. No reasons were given, and the document 
made it clear that no reasons _would_ be given. 
     Naturally, Zimmermann was relieved. "I'm just really 
pleased that the Sword of Damocles is not over me anymore," 
he told a reporter from Associated Press, "and I wonder why 
it took so long." 
     Simson Garfinkel, who wrote a book about PGP, wasn't so 
positive. "It seems to me," he told a journalist, "that all 
the U.S. Attorney is saying is that they don't want the 
public relations nightmare of prosecuting Philip Zimmermann, 
but they still want everyone scared so that they won't 
exercise their constitutional rights." 
     Meanwhile, the future status of encryption remained 
unclear. A Freedom of Information Act request by EPIC 
revealed that as long ago as February, 1993, the FBI, NSA, 
and Department of Justice were arguing for a national policy 
that would outlaw unapproved encryption. A briefing document 
titled "Encryption: The Threat, Applications and Potential 
Solutions" was sent to the National Security Council. It 
contained the following paragraph: 

          Technical solutions, such as they are, will only 
     work if they are incorporated into _all_ encryption 
     products. To ensure that this occurs, legislation 
     mandating the use of Government-approved encryption 
     products or adherence to Government encryption criteria 
     is required. 

     Clearly, government agencies weren't interested in 
voluntary use of the Clipper Chip; they wanted it to be 
compulsory. But would this be constitutional? If commercially 
marketed encryption was outlawed, wouldn't this violate our 
rights to privacy? Even now, no one knows the answer to these 
questions. Most likely, a test case will be needed before we 
find out. 
     Meanwhile, encryption has already made a difference in 
some countries. "PGP is being used a lot in human rights 
activities around the world," Zimmermann told one journalist. 
"Opposition groups working in Burma are training their people 
to use PGP on portable computers in jungle training camps. 
Before, captured documents might lead to the arrest, torture, 
and death of entire families. PGP is used where lives are on 
the line." 
     Inevitably, many governments see this kind of thing as a 
threat. France has prohibited secure encryption, and police 
can arrest the author of any message that seems to be in 
code. The Australian Attorney General's Office has announced 
that it wants to follow the French example. The Council of 
Europe has announced plans to outlaw any products using 
strong encryption if they fail to make keys available to law 
enforcement. Great Britain has a law allowing police to 
obtain a warrant requiring a suspect to produce all 
information on his computer "in legible format." 
     These laws, however, may be hard to enforce. There are 
many ways to hide a message in a stream of data flowing 
through the net. For instance, a totally innocent picture can 
be digitized using 24 "bits," or binary digits (ones and 
zeroes) to specify the color of each dot. When the whole 
picture is transmitted, it becomes a long string of bits. Now 
suppose we take a text message and turn it, too, into a bit 
stream. We can use the picture to hide the text message by 
replacing every 24th bit in the graphics stream with a bit 
from the text stream. In effect, we have fractionally 
modified the color of each dot in the image, but this will be 
virtually indetectable--as _Byte_ magazine demonstrated when 
it illustrated the technique many years ago. 
     This code system is properly known as steganography, and 
there are various programs available (most of them free) that 
will do it for you right now. Check out 
http://indyunix.iupui.edu/~emilbran/stego.html for more 
details. There's also a Usenet discussion group named 
alt.steganography. 
     There are other similar ways to hide a message inside 
another message. Suppose, for instance, the Clipper Chip is 
made mandatory. A user can still encrypt his message with 
some private scheme before passing it through Clipper. Now 
suppose a law-enforcement agency intercepts the message and 
strips away the Clipper code with a "master key." The second 
level of encryption is still there to hide the original 
message. 
     Will law enforcement now accuse the user of obstructing 
justice by applying her own private encryption system? How 
can the FBI prove that the message really is encrypted, and 
is not just some other form of data? Who will decide whether 
an unreadable set of bytes consists of software, graphics, 
encrypted text, or data that has been scrambled by an error? 
     Outlawing encryption raises still more questions--some 
of them bizarre. Writing via an anonymous remailer to the 
alt.privacy Usenet news group, "John Shore" suggested a list 
of questions for the Attorney General of Australia after he 
announced his plan to ban private use of strong encryption 
online. Would the ban extend to disks sent via ordinary mail? 
If so, would it also be illegal to mail a printout of an 
encrypted message? How about transferring the message by 
courier? Or by fax? Could someone be arrested for reading it 
aloud, one character at a time, over the phone? 
     Shore took this a step further. He pointed out that a 
random-number table can create a code that is almost 
unbreakable so long as it is only used for one message. Would 
this mean that random numbers should be illegal, too? 
     A former officer of the Australian Attorney General's 
department, who was jailed for allegedly hacking into their 
email system, suggested a more practical approach. "I doubt 
that anybody is truly interested in decrypting or reading 
messages flying around the net," he wrote. "Rather, I imagine 
that police or other agencies wish to be able to read the 
contents of hard disks and message files once they make an 
arrest and/or seize possible evidence. If you've encrypted 
anything dodgy, then so long as you've hidden the key, no 
evidence is forthcoming." And as Scott Charney of the 
Department of Justice has confirmed, the owner of encrypted 
data in the United States can refuse to divulge the key by 
citing his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth 
Amendment. 
     Moreover, sensitive material can be stored in ways that 
make it very hard to find. Modern hard drives have a huge 
storage capacity, making it easy to conceal an important 
document among thousands of "junk messages." Even very simple 
tactics may be effective if police only conduct a cursory 
search. A document can be disguised with a seemingly innocent 
filename or given a creation date that makes it seem too old 
to be of interest. 
     Police hoping to find evidence on computer systems or on 
the net are thus faced with a needle-in-a-haystack problem. 
Moreover, the haystack keeps getting bigger, and the needle 
can be so cunningly disguised, it will evade every possible 
attempt to detect it. Bad news for law enforcement; good news 
for privacy activists--and for those who want to evade the 
law. 


     Total Privacy 

     Suppose there's no conclusive way to stop citizens from 
using encryption, short of taking away their microcomputers 
or cutting their phone lines. Consider the ramifications when 
every communication can be totally private. Conversations 
cannot be overheard. Phones cannot be tapped. Even financial 
transactions become impossible to monitor. No one knows where 
money goes or who it comes from. Will law enforcement be 
rendered impotent? Will taxation be problematic? Will crime 
run totally out of control? 
     The FBI thinks this is a very plausible scenario. 
Speaking at the American Law Institute in 1994, FBI director 
Louis Freeh warned that "there will be disastrous 
consequences ... federal law enforcement will be crippled and 
the national security endangered." 
     History, however, tells a slightly different story. As 
Phil Zimmermann points out, privacy used to be an everyday 
fact of life. The federal government didn't always possess 
the power to evesdrop on its citizens. The idea of your bank 
revealing your activities to government agencies on a routine 
basis would have been unthinkable a century ago. Financial 
transactions used to be private regardless of whether you 
paid in gold, paper money, or by check. 
     Why shouldn't we still have this degree of privacy 
today? Because, according to law enforcement, the dangers are 
now much greater. "Suppose we believe that two people are 
communicating about blowing up an airplane," says Scott 
Charney at the Department of Justice. "If they're using 
encryption and we don't have access to the key, we will not 
be able to intercept that message, and as a result, four 
hundred people may die. There are those who say that's the 
price of privacy. But you have to be able to live with the 
choices you make, and I'd rather save the 400 people. I like 
to think that if a judge orders access to data and it 
satisfies the Fourth Amendement test, it should be 
permitted." 
     So far as Charney is concerned, law enforcement should 
be able to listen in on computer communications on exactly 
the same basis that they can search a private residence. "If 
a judge says we can go into someone's home, this is to 
protect society, which means we're protecting the rights of 
many people at the expense of the rights of an individual. If 
you buy a bigger lock, we'll bring a bigger sledgehammer. But 
cryptography is a lock so strong, society cannot penetrate it 
at all, unless we are allowed access to a key." 
     David Banisar vigorously disagrees. He feels that law 
enforcement already has quite enough advantages without 
getting access to all private communications. "They're 
spending millions on automatic fingerprint identification 
technology," he points out, "and more millions on DNA 
databases. There are plans for automatic intelligent highways 
enabling them to track any car going anywhere. They can even 
peer through people's walls with forward-looking infrared 
radar. And now they need to be able to monitor the net as 
well?" 
     Phil Zimmermann takes a slightly more moderate position. 
"I think that the government does have some reasonable points 
to make," he says. "Criminals _can_ use this technology to 
hide their activities.... I think the debate on cryptography 
is not an open-and-shut case." 
     Why, then, did he give away a program that puts so much 
power in the hands of the people? 
     "The government would like to be able to get information 
about you. They want to be able to read your mail, listen in 
on your conversations--and if they can do those things, it 
puts them in a much more powerful position. It means that 
political opposition groups cannot function as effectively; 
and I'm speaking of any government around the world, 
including countries such as Burma or Central America." 
     Consequently, Zimmermann feels confident that he did the 
right thing. "I have no doubts or misgivings," he says, about 
giving the power of strong encryption to his fellow citizens 
of the net. 
 

     Electronic Money 

     Writing in _Scientific American,_ David Chaum pointed 
out that it is now possible to compile an "electronic 
dossier" on citizens by putting together data from mail-order 
purchases, tax payments, bank loans, health records, car 
rentals, and all the other trails we leave today as we move 
through the world. It's easy to assemble this data because 
each American is ultimately identifiable by one ubiquitous 
number: the social-security number. 
     Chaum suggested a better idea. What if a person could 
give a separate, different, but verifiable ID number to each 
organization he chose to do business with? 
     Digital signatures would make this possible. But Chaum 
took the concept farther, to a new and unexpected conclusion. 
A system of _digital cash_ could be created (Chaum called it 
DigiCash) allowing each transaction to be unique and distinct 
from the rest. Instead of using one credit-card number again 
and again, which opens up the obvious risk of someone 
stealing the number and also using it, each DigiCash 
transaction would be based around a new, separate ID number, 
just the same way that each time we pay cash, we use dollar 
bills that have different serial numbers. DigiCash would mean 
that our spending habits would become private again, just as 
they used to be, and our money would be more secure. 
     Chaum is chairman of a European Union project to combine 
integrated circuit cards and software-only money. He has 
published over 45 original technical articles on 
cryptography, and founded the International Association for 
Cryptologic Research. He is also managing director of 
DigiCash, which he established as a corporation in 1990. 
Unlike most mathematicians, Chaum has worked to put his 
theory, and his ideals, into practice. 
     He first started thinking seriously about electronic 
privacy when he was a graduate student at Berkeley in the 
late 1970s. "I remember visiting one of my professors," he 
says, "sitting in a hot tub in his back yard, and talking 
about my research ... and how to maintain anonymity in a 
network situation." 
     At that time the digital revolution was so young, few 
people shared Chaum's concerns. "I felt like I stumbled on a 
possibility for preserving the core values of our society as 
we make a transition into the computerized world. And I felt 
it was incumbent on me to push that forward, because I was 
really the only one who was aware of it." 
     At first Chaum imagined that if he merely publicized his 
ideas--as in his article in _Scientific American_--other 
people would put the ideas into practice. But it didn't 
happen, so he started his own company--even though he claims 
not to have strong personal feelings about privacy. "I'm not 
a privacy advocate," he says. "That's not it at all. ... I 
just think I have a responsibility to give this technology a 
chance to be adopted to the extent that people really want to 
adopt it. I'm really committed to this. I wouldn't say 
running a business is what I find the most fun, or it's what 
I'm particularly good at, but I'm willing to do it." 
     The concept of anonymous electronic money is important 
not just for reasons of privacy, but also as a means to 
sustain economic competition. You can't have a truly free 
market if one business knows what many other businesses are 
doing. Chaum clarifies this with an example: "If you're a 
phone company and you know what everyone is selling on the 
net, and how much it costs and where the growth areas are, 
and you're also allowed to compete with everyone, you'd be 
able to compete unfairly." He refers to this as "data 
fascism." 
     Of course, digital money raises a very real possibility 
that almost all commerce could soon be conducted online. Some 
commentators fear it would erode the educational, 
noncommercial values of the net and turn it into a giant 
shopping mall. Kevin Kelly, Executive Editor of _Wired_ 
magazine, has used online services since 1982 and has thought 
about this topic a lot. He sees the danger but argues for a 
middle path. 
     "There's a great attachment within the net for the gift 
economy," he says, "where things are swapped and offered 
without money. But I think that for network civilization to 
occur, there has to be money--secured and encrypted, 
authenticated money--because otherwise it's not going to 
happen. The danger is that we become completely monetized and 
there is no more place to swap or have gifts. I think you 
need to have both." 
     DigiCash took its first small step into functionality on 
October, 1995, when the Mark Twain Bank of St. Louis, 
Missouri started issuing money online using Chaum's system. 
Five other competitive systems have also been developed, 
although not all of them are open for business yet: 
Cybercash, First Data/Netscape, First Virtual, Open Market, 
Inc, and Wave Systems. Two other systems had also been 
announced: a joint venture by Visa/Microsoft, and another 
collaboration by Mastercard/Netscape. 
     Some of these systems merely take existing methods of 
credit-card purchasing and digitize them, using the Internet 
instead of a phone line to convey conventional financial 
data. In other words, instead of calling an 800 number and 
reading your card number to an operator, you dial a remote 
site via your modem and type your number at your computer 
keyboard. A program on your computer encrypts the number so 
that no one else can read it. At the remote site, the data is 
decrypted back into the original number. 
     This provides some added security and convenience, but 
it isn't be radically different from the way we do business 
today, and enterprising hackers could steal and use encrypted 
credit-card numbers just as easily as non-encrypted numbers. 
By comparison, DigiCash provides much more privacy and 
security. 
     In principle it is a _debit system,_ like travelers' 
checks, where you must pay for the money before you can spend 
it. By contrast, conventional credit cards are a _credit 
system,_ allowing you to spend now, pay later. 
     How does DigiCash work in practice? Suppose you want to 
buy goods and services online. First, you have to get some 
ecash. You open an account with a bank that participates in 
the DigiCash scheme, and you deposit old-fashioned money the 
old-fashioned way: by credit card, check, or wire transfer. 
Subsequently the bank sends you a disk containing the 
DigiCash control program that has to be installed on your 
computer. You copy it onto your hard drive, get it running, 
then tell it to call the bank and transfer some ecash from 
your bank account to your computer. At this point, some 
rather special code numbers are stored on your hard drive. 
     Now you're ready to go shopping. Suppose you want to buy 
a music CD from an online store. You use your modem to get to 
the store's home page. You find the item you want, and you 
tell your DigiCash control program to pay the store for the 
CD. This just means clicking your mouse button a few times 
and typing some numbers on the keyboard. 
     The control program transfers your ecash to the store, 
and the store puts your CD in the mail--or maybe it transfers 
the digitized music to you electronically, over the net. 
     Does this sound a little--risky? Everything, here, is 
electronic. Aren't there endless opportunities for fraud or 
error? 
     It's important to remember that transactions between 
banks are _already_ electronic. We write checks with a pen 
and receive our bank statements on paper, but the balance is 
a number on a computer somewhere. DigiCash is just an 
extension of that system into the home. 
     Also, because the DigiCash system uses strong 
encryption, it's actually safer than older methods for 
protecting transactions. Here's what really happens inside 
the computer and on the net, when you make a purchase: 
     First, when you withdraw electronic cash from the bank, 
this is really a two-step operation. Your computer creates a 
random number which will be used as your own secret ID. This 
number is now "blinded." In other words, it's transformed 
mathematically into a different, public ID, in such a way 
that no one can figure out what your secret ID was. The 
principle, here, is similar to public-kedy encryption. The 
public ID is sent to your bank with a request for ecash. 
     The bank makes a note of the public ID. It issues ecash 
that carries a serial number, just like dollar bills. The 
bank keeps a record of this serial number, links it with your 
public ID, and validates the cash. 
     Your computer receives the message from the bank and 
"unblinds" your original ID number. The bank knows that you 
ordered and received some ecash, but the bank does _not_ know 
your secret ID. This means that the ecash is truly anonymous. 
After you spend it, and no one will be able to prove that was 
yours. 
     What's to stop you from spending it many times over, by 
sending the cash's serial number to many different merchants? 
     When a merchant receives ecash, he transfers its value 
to his own bank account and your bank receives a message 
telling it that the serial number for that cash is no longer 
valid. If you now try to spend that cash a second time, the 
merchant who receives it can check with your bank to find out 
whether the cash is valid before trying to deposit it. 
     The privacy advantage, here, is obvious--but there are 
also some potential pitfalls. 
     First, if you pay a merchant who fails to deliver the 
goods, you have to reveal your secret ID in order to prove 
that you sent the cash. This is the only way you can get your 
money back. The same applies if your electronic cash is lost 
or stolen. 
     Second, the bank that issues the money has to have its 
own private ID that it uses to generate and validate the code 
numbers of its cash. If this private ID is stolen, someone 
else can generate counterfeit cash, which means that the bank 
must invalidate all the money that it previously put into 
circulation and must issue new money using a new key. 
     Third, after you withdraw some ecash from your account, 
it doesn't accumulate any interest. It gradually depreciates, 
like real cash stuffed under a mattress. By comparison, when 
you pay a bill using a credit card, your money remains in 
your bank, earning interest, till days or weeks later when 
you settle your account with the card company. 
     Fourth, the anonymity of ecash has caused some people to 
speculate that it could be used for interesting criminal 
activities. In a case of bribery, for instance, totally 
anonymous electronic cash would make it impossible to prove 
that money changed hands, because the payment would be 
untraceable. 
     The current version of DigiCash is not totally 
anonymous, however. It only allows one-way privacy. The 
person who receives a payment is unable to prove where the 
money came from--but the person who makes a payment can 
choose to reveal it, and the system will provide complete 
authentication. This reduces the possibilities for crime so 
much that Chaum now claims it's safer than ordinary cash. 
"I've come to the realization," he says, "that the country 
would be far better off if there were no paper money and it 
was all electronic cash, because paper money is readily 
usable for criminal purposes: extortion, bribery, and black 
markets." He claims that on a recent tour of federal agencies 
in Washington, DC, regulators ended up feeling that his 
product would make their lives easier. 
     There's still the possibility, though, that someone else 
could introduce a competing form of electronic cash that 
_does_ allow total anonymity. Chaum refers to this as 
"underground electronic cash" and fears that it may emerge if 
we take too long to establish the safer standard. 
     The concept of totally anonymous money pleases hardcore 
libertarians, who have never been entirely happy with paper 
money, let along government-monitored credit transfers. It 
does have some radical implications, though. 
     Suppose there's a subversive group of people who believe 
that all politicians should be assassinated. One of them 
circulates a petition calling for contributions to a fund 
that will pay an assassin to kill a government official. 
Naturally, the anarchist passes his messages through 
anonymous remailers. He sends them out across the globe and 
invites people to send electronic money that will pay a 
suitably qualified assassin. 
     The more hated the government official is, the more 
people will pay to get rid of him. Supposedly, this means 
that well-loved figures will be allowed to live while bad 
guys will get what's coming to them. To the anarchists, this 
sounds like poetic justice. 
     Far-fetched? Yes, but it was seriously proposed on a 
Usenet news group. The inventor of the scheme claimed that 
"the goal is not primarily to cause deaths: the goal is to 
dismantle government permanently. It is NOT necessary that 
each and every one of these targets actually die to achieve 
that. In my plan, the main targets initially will be the 
agencies that make the most enemies: IRS, DEA, FBI, CIA, and 
various others. Once the IRS is demolished, none of the other 
organizations will have any money to pay the other employees, 
and everybody (government employees) would be on his own." 
     It's hard to imagine a more extreme use of digital cash. 
There have, however, been other proposals that seem moderate 
by comparison. Among them is DigitaLiberty. 
     Bill Frezza and one-time hacker Bruce Fancher are the 
prime architects of this initiative, which seeks to dismantle 
government by more peaceful means. "DigitaLiberty does not 
seek to educate or influence politicians in the hope of 
obtaining legislation favorable to our constituents," 
according to Frezza. "We plan to make politicians and 
legislators irrelevant to the future of network based 
commerce, education, leisure, and social intercourse." 
     Like many libertarians, Frezza feels there has been a 
scandalous retreat from ideals on which the United States was 
founded. He sees the federal government as a parasite feeding 
off its people. "The Sixteenth Amendment," he writes, "passed 
in 1913 to empower the federal government to collect a tax on 
incomes, has since fueled the growth of a bloated leviathan, 
unleashing unchecked inquisitorial powers that are used to 
pry into the most intimate details of our lives. Not too long 
after our incomes follow our economic activity into 
Cyberspace this inquisition is going to end." 
     Frezza doesn't underestimate federal power. In "the 
physical world" he sees no chance of citizens disentangling 
themselves from the web of assistance programs, agencies, and 
laws. "But we do believe that liberty can and will prevail in 
the virtual domains we are building on the net and that 
national governments will be powerless to stop us. ... We 
believe that no one will hold sovereignty over this new realm 
because coercive force is impotent in cyberspace." 
     His vision requires two future developments. First, 
manufacturing industries must become so highly automated, 
hardly anyone will do manual labor anymore, and almost 
everyone will make a living in information industries. 
Second, their communications, products, and transactions will 
all be encrypted. According to Frezza, this will free us all 
"from the prying eyes and grasping hands of sovereigns." More 
to the point, it will enable wide-scale tax evasion: 
"Encryption is to the Information Revolution what the 
Atlantic Ocean was to the American Revolution. It will render 
tax authorities as impotent in projecting their power as the 
ocean crossing did to King George." 
     Of course, talk is cheap. Should we take any of this 
seriously? Does anyone in government take it seriously? 
     Maybe they should. Frezza's slightly less radical 
partner in DigitaLiberty, Bruce Fancher, suggests that the 
first step toward freedom from taxation could be just around 
the corner. 
      "Suppose an offshore bank starts selling electronic 
cash," says Fancher. "You will be able to send and receive 
messages _and_ money in such a way that the government won't 
be able to detect the sender, the recipient, or the sum being 
transferred. This suddenly makes tax collection very 
difficult." 
     Doesn't Fancher see a downside to this? After all, many 
people depend on government subsidies and services. 
     "I think that government's only legitimate function is 
to protect its citizens from force and fraud. The IRS is more 
of a criminal organization than the mafia, who don't mess 
with you if you don't mess with them. Anyway, there'll still 
be enough revenue from real estate taxes to maintain police 
and fire departments on a local level." 
     But if everyone becomes anonymous and untraceable, this 
doesn't just create problems for government, it creates 
problems for citizens dealing with each other. When every 
citizen can hide his name--when people use their digital 
signatures instead of their physical identities--how can 
anyone be trusted? 
     As a partial answer to this problem, Fancher foresees 
"trust brokers" who will rate the integrity of an online 
identity in much the same way that brokerage houses rate 
municipal bonds. The broker will take a percentage fee, and 
you'll be able to buy insurance against deals that go bad. 
     Fancher still co-owns Mindvox, an Internet site known 
for its liberal policies and anarchist clients. What's he 
planning to do himself, in the immediate future, to help 
achieve his long-term goals? 
     "One thing is we're setting up an anonymous remailer. We 
believe that people should be able to express their opinions 
without fear of retribution from governments or private 
institutions. Some people complain that an anonymous person 
is free to libel anyone without fear of getting sued, which 
is a problem, but I don't see it that way. When someone sees 
a message from an anonymous person, it's going to be taken 
less seriously than a message that someone chooses to sign. 
The culture will adapt to this kind of thing." 
     MindVox has already drawn attention to itself as a 
repository for all kinds of information and discussion on 
topics including drugs, bombs, and perversion. Isn't Fancher 
taking a risk by starting an anonymous remailer service as 
well? 
     "No, it's a civil right to be anonymous. I would love to 
get busted for it." He sounds totally unconcerned. "Let them 
come and try."

<p><b>Brief summary of this section:</b>

<p>     The rebellious spirit in Usenet groups indicates a 
libertarian bias shared by many net users, and this bias can 
be found also in Wired magazine. Louis Rossetto, editor-in-
chief of Wired, discusses his political perspective and his 
view of the future. His scenario assumes that centralized 
authority will become increasingly impotent, but can we count 
on this in the near future? Two "nightmare net scenarios" 
show what could happen if at some point a decency law is 
ruled constitutional--and net users fail to follow through on 
their threats of rebellion. 
<p>     An epilogue summarizes legal events that have occurred 
so far in 1996. 
<p>     This is the final section of <i>Anarchy Online</i>.

     _Rolling Stone,_ Revisited 

     Anyone who browses through Usenet can't help noticing 
the anti-authoritarian mindset shared by many net users. It 
crops up especially in signature lines at the end of people's 
messages. For instance, this one from a post in 
talk.politics.libertarian: 

          You can test my urine when you pry my penis from my 
     cold, dead fingers. 

     Is the online world just a refuge from reality where 
rebels can strike a pose without the risk of real-world 
penalties? Or is there a truly entrenched spirit of rebellion 
that will cause real trouble for regulators and legislators 
who try to eradicate anarchy online? 
     The net was built originally by computer nerds who 
tended to be loners and misfits, not so different from early 
phone phreaks who felt alienated from everyday society. This 
free spirit has persisted through to the present day, and 
even newcomers seem partially infected with it, perhaps 
because we all feel empowered and liberated by the experience 
of mastering a computer and exploring the vast resources of 
cyberspace. This is a freedom that few people will surrender 
willingly. 
     It's no accident, then, that a "don't tread on me" 
attitude is associated with the net. For proof that this is a 
real and widespread phenomenon, look no further than the 
pages of _Wired_ magazine, which _The New Yorker_ has 
described as "The official organ of the digital generation." 
(I am a contributing writer to _Wired_ and have sold more 
than a dozen articles to it, so my evaluation of it may not 
be totally objective.) 
     _Wired_ isn't anti-establishment in the same simplistic 
sense as counterculture publications from the 1960s. It sees 
nothing wrong with commerce and consumerism. Many of its 
features focus uncritically on corporate success stories, net 
celebrities, or glitzy techno-gadgets. 
     Its attitude toward government, though, tends to be 
skeptical at best. This was made clear very early on when the 
magazine ran a substantial feature praising "cypherpunks" and 
condemning the Clipper Chip. 
     Louis Rossetto, _Wired's_ cofounder and publisher, 
denies that he promotes a radical mindset in the same style 
as _Rolling Stone,_ 25 years ago. "There's no concrete 
ideology that we're trying to get across," he says. When 
pressed, however, he admits he has a bias against 
authoritarian systems. "Basically we feel that individuals 
are the best peeople to decide the important issues in their 
own lives. Society works better if people have freedom than 
if they're being directed. We also believe that markets work, 
and micro decisions of the market are better than macro 
decisions of the government." 
     Taken together with Rossetto's known dislike of 
censorship, this sounds like a low-key definition of 
libertarianism. But he dislikes that word. "I shy away from 
libertarian or any other political label. I think we're 
entering a period that's postpolitical. We need to develop a 
new language and way of thinking about it." 
     Does he have any influence in that direction? Perhaps 
because _Wired_ has been accused of arrogance, Rossetto 
downplays this, too. "We started a little magazine here," he 
says, "and it's still a little magazine. I try not to think 
about power. I'm just trying to examine the issues I care 
about and reflect the issues that matter to the people we're 
writing for." 
     Yet when he does start talking politics, he can sound 
surprisingly similar to hardcore rebels such as Frezza and 
Fancher. "The twentieth century has been the century of 
statism," he says. "The dreams of statism have been played 
out, both on the right and on the left--and all of them have 
turned into nightmares. The statist ideology has now been 
proved to be bankrupt. There's no real discussion of the 
future anymore among statists because all the statist futures 
have been disasters."  
     According to Rossetto, a decline in government power is 
already taking place around us and is likely to continue. 
"The power of the state that accreted during the cold war is 
already dissipating. Central authority is already flowing 
away, acceptance of the need for national security is 
evaporating, acceptance of the welfare state is evaporating 
also. President Clinton's historic mission, as inheritor of 
the Roosevelt New Deal tradition of the left, has been to 
reconcile himself to the reality that that model no longer 
applies." 
     Yet the power to make laws and enforce them--using 
weapons, if necessary--still resides in the same old agencies 
and institutions. How, precisely, is this power going to 
"dissipate"? 
     Rossetto seems to feel that as people communicate and 
deal directly with each other via the net, a "network 
economy" will evolve, rendering many functions of government 
irrelevant. This will not necessarily be painless. 
     "I think there can be two ways we move into the future. 
One is by a gradual undermining of inefficient institutions. 
The market will determine how to deploy human and capital 
resources--and this is successfully transforming our society 
right now. On the other hand some social structures are 
rigid, and they end up collapsing, which is what happened in 
the USSR. My sense is you'll end up with both things 
happening, though I hope for the former." 
     To Rossetto--and to many people who write for his 
magazine--the future is full of promise. These techno-
optimists tend to feel that almost everyone will benefit, one 
way or another, from the major social upheavals in store. 
     Rossetto sounds particularly positive on this point. 
"The idea that every person on the planet could live a middle 
class existence is within our reach," he says. "The network 
economy is the best way to use human and physical resources, 
and it'll make for a much more materially satisfying 
existence for almost all the people on the planet. I think we 
can also see a flowering of the arts, because there'll be a 
lot more outlets for individual and eccentric voices. I think 
we can also see the final collapse of state run education and 
the rebirth of real learning, as capital starts to get 
invested in what we really need to help our children become 
part of modern society and help us stay on top of the changes 
that are occurring. I think we'll have a much better educated 
populace than we have today." 
     Why is he so optimistic while millions of people are 
fearful about the future? Rossetto suggests that this isn't 
an accurate description of the situation. People are not 
really scared of technology, they're scared of the idea that 
no one may be in charge anymore. "I'm pretty sure that the 
future won't be any more violent or chaotic than what we have 
now," he says. "It will just seem that way because we will no 
longer have the illusion that some central authority is 
guiding everything." 
     Does he have any fears about this future? What's the 
downside? 
     "Well, a networked society is susceptible to massive 
collapse. Everything going online could be susceptible to 
viruses, terrorism, electromagnetic pulse weapons, other 
things. We're creating a monoculture that doesn't have the 
richness or the redundancy of the natural world, and this 
could be dangerous." 
     He doesn't sound as interested, though, in this gloom-
and-doom stuff--partly because it's unproductive. If we want 
a better future, it's our job to create it. "Despite the 
horrors of the 20th century," he says, "and the pessimism of 
the so-called intelligentsia and progressives, the future is 
not bleak, it is positive--and we'll have a much better 
chance of achieving it if we think it's going to happen than 
if we just sit around moaning and wailing." 


     Nightmare Net Scenarios 

     In a round-table discussion sponsored by _Harper's_ 
magazine, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of EFF and prophet of 
connectivity, faced a couple of self-described Luddites 
calling for a retreat from techno-worship and a return to 
human values. Barlow referred to himself as an "old hippie" 
and claimed he sympathized with their point of view. "I love 
the physical world," he said. "I spent seventeen years as a 
cattle rancher in Pinedale, Wyoming. ... I actually did go 
back to the land, unlike many old hippies. And after 
seventeen years I recognized the historical trends that 
nobody can do anything about, any more than the Indians could 
do anything about the historical trends that changed their 
society." 
     This take-it-or-leave-it annoys people who have no 
special love for technology. They feel they're being offered 
a totally unacceptable pair of options: learn to cope, or be 
left behind. They see changes that have already taken place 
and bigger changes imminent, creating unemployment and a new 
underclass lacking access to the "network economy" and the 
ability to use it. 
     Naturally this creates fear and resentment. Barlow is 
wrong, however, when he says that people who feel this way 
are as impotent as American Indians confronted with white 
invaders. In the short term, at least, people who hate or 
fear the net can do quite a lot. They can lobby for 
legislation to cripple the Internet, they can elect state DAs 
and local sherriffs who will bust a few BBS owners and 
intimidate the rest, and they can present these actions as a 
decent, sensible response to a situation that is totally out 
of control. 
     In reality, the Internet is safer than any urban street, 
even safer than a rural meadow. No one gets mugged online. No 
one is punched in the face, bitten by snakes, or marooned by 
floods; but as Rossetto has pointed out, there's no one in 
control. For many people, this is a disturbing concept. As 
Mike Godwin of EFF puts it, "In 1993 all the news stories 
about the Internet were telling people that the information 
superhighway would turn everyone into a publisher. Two years 
later, people saw the scary consequences of this actually 
beginning to happen." 
     Any journalist knows that scare stories sell newspapers 
and airtime; any legislator knows that by creating a threat, 
then "solving the problem," he can increase his chances of 
getting re-elected. The downfall of communism created a 
"threat gap" in American life, prompting a quick search for 
substitutes on the domestic front, such as crime and the war 
on drugs. Thus the Internet has been a gift to legislators: a 
totally uncontrolled environment infested with hackers, hate 
speech, and netporn. It took hardly any effort to portray 
this as a menace to society, spawning a hasty mess of laws 
drafted by people whose knowledge of the Internet is close to 
zero. 
     People who actually use the net have circulated 
petitions and waged angry campaigns demanding that the net 
should remain uncontrolled. Aside from the Guardian Angels 
(who constitute a tiny minority), no group of net users has 
asked for legislation or stricter law enforcement. Clearly, 
netizens are pretty much content with the online status-quo. 
The loudest demands for control and censorship come from the 
people who know least about the net, are farthest from it, 
and fear it most. This attempt by one community to impose 
laws on another may ultimately cause real conflict. 
Eventually, as Barlow suggests, the consequences of 
technology may be unavoidable; but it would be foolish to 
underestimate the inertia and the power of the status-quo. 
     The situation has been made worse by countless news 
reports written by journalists who aren't computer literate 
and don't seem to see the real implications of connectivity. 
Again and again, they have described the Internet as a way of 
chatting with strangers and viewing pornography. The idea of 
the net serving as a true, enduring substitute for many 
features of the physical world has seldom been taken 
seriously. 
     "It's much bigger than termninals with keybaords," says 
Kevin Kelly. "I'm talking about everything we manufacture 
being connected to everything else: cash registers, soil 
sensors, satellites, all kinds of devices sending information 
into this network where people are communicating with each 
other. The real net is all of this data swishing around, this 
soup of information. It's bigger than we can encompass in our 
own minds. It has a collective smartness that is of a 
wavelength that we can't perceive, because it's too big." 
     Compared with this, the "threat" posed by a few dirty 
pictures on a handful of online news groups seems barely 
relevant. Yet almost all the Internet coverage in 1995 
focused on netporn, which also drove the legislative process. 
     In reality, the online world is already much more than 
an information exchange. It's a fully-featured commercial, 
artistic, and social environment that is already developing 
its own culture and customs. So far, this process has been 
swift because there has been nothing to stop it. 
     Kevin Kelly foresees two possible dangers. "One bad 
scenario is that commercialization proceeds at such a pace 
that it hinders and constrains the range of options, so that 
there is an atrophy of civilization, there is not enough 
elbow room for the kind of civics that we need to make this a 
really open development. In the land rush to develop the net, 
we may not allow enough room for the online equivalent of 
parks, sidewalks, and open space." 
     But Kelly is equally cautious about excesses of freedom. 
"It could become so anarchic, so uncommercialized, such a 
ruthless frontier, there's not enough incentive for the 
domesticated stability that is required to have networked 
civilization unfold." 
     Consequently, he feels there may be some need for 
restraint. "I think that there should be limits to freedom on 
the net just as any society has to have limits to freedom. 
That is the definition of civilization, it is a consensual 
surrendering of certain freedoms that individuals 
theoretically have, as individuals, and they give those up 
because the advantages of doing so outweigh the cost. As the 
net becomes more civilized we should certainly expect to see 
more of that, and I would go so far to say that until there 
are some freedoms surrendered it won't be civilized." 
     But "consensual" may be the key word, here. No society 
should be _coerced_ into giving up its freedoms--least of all 
by outsiders who don't live there. 
     As we enter the last years of the twentieth century, the 
net is like a rebellious eighteen-year-old, still with a lot 
to learn but in some ways already smarter than his parents. 
This precocious adolescent is full of wild utopian ideas 
about building a new worlds and feels quite capable of making 
his own decisions, yet he's confronted with authority figures 
who want to take away his car keys and keep him grounded--
because, they claim, neighbors have been complaining about 
his bad language and "immorality." 
     As any parent knows, this kind of clampdown is liable to 
be temporary, and it can create backlash that's worse than 
the initial problem. 
     Legislators, of course, take a more mundane view. From 
an historical perspective, every new mode of communication 
has been regulated. The post office, the telephone network, 
radio stations, broadcast TV, and cable TV have all been 
brought under government control. Why should the Internet be 
any different? 
     Well, the Internet _is_ different. Moreover, America 
itself has changed. In the everyday world there may be less 
rebellion than we see online, but still there's been a shift 
of opinion against the concept of centralized government. In 
May, 1995, immediately after the federal building was bombed 
in Oklahoma City, _Time_ magazine reported results of a poll 
that it sponsored with CNN. When asked, "Do you think the 
Federal Government has become so powerful that it poses a 
threat to the rights and freedoms of citizens?" an amazing 52 
percent of respondents agreed with the proposition. When 
asked, "In order to combat terrorism, do you think the 
Federal Government should be given more power to investigate 
U.S. citizens?" 61 percent of respondents said they felt that 
the government already had quite enough power--even though 
everyone had spent the previous week watching the aftermath 
of the worst terrorist crime in U.S. history. 
     Backlash against government may be symptomatic of a more 
general change that has occurred since World War II, away 
from conformity, toward individualism. To take one example: 
In the early 1960s, Ralph Nader was seen as a subversive 
influence threatening society by empowering the consumer 
against the corporate status-quo. Today, consumer activism is 
taken for granted, and even _The Wall Street Journal_ views 
it with tolerance. Another example: three decades ago, the 
term "special interest group" didn't exist. Today, 
politicians are reluctant to take position on any 
controversial topic if there's a chance of angering some 
ornery subset of the voting public. 
     As Mike Godwin puts it, "I think a wide range of social 
problems today are the result of giving more power to 
individuals." A microcomputer connected to a network is the 
latest symptom of this trend, empowering users in ways that 
would have been inconceivable to a previous generation. 
     Amid such a groundswell of public opinion against 
government control, is net regulation even feasible? Godwin 
thinks not. He feels that attempts to censor the net are 
going to be "like Canute ordering the tide not to come in." 
He points out that "even in Singapore, reputed to be a highly 
regulated technological society, they can't stop netporn, and 
I'm not sure they're even trying very hard. They block 
certain news groups, but that doesn't necessarily stop 
anything." And, he says, repressive regimes will suffer from 
their own policies. "I think nations that insist of having 
real control of their citizens' access are going to be 
totally cut off. Iran is a pretty good example." 
     But this is a radical-populist position, and radical 
populists traditionally tend to underestimate the power of 
conservatives. The Christian Coalition, the American Family 
Association and Traditional Values Coalition, former attorney 
general Edwin Meese, Eagle Forum's Phyllis Schafly, the 
reverend Donald Wildmon, and half a dozen other conservative 
groups used their influence during 1995 to push for a law to 
criminalize indecent speech online, and their efforts were 
successful. Even if the online indecency law is ruled 
unconstitutional, as seems very likely, we can be sure 
they'll try again, just as they have tried repeatedly to 
concoct legislation controlling abortion. Let's assume for a 
moment that they finally succeed in passing some sort of law 
to limit netspeech. 
     Large Internet service providers will undoubtedly comply 
with the new regulations. So long as a corporation can still 
turn a profit, regulation is just one of the costs of doing 
business. Some businesses actually prefer a certain amount of 
regulation, because it saves them from trying to guess what's 
legal and what's not. 
     Smaller service providers may be less willing (or less 
able) to obey an indecency law--and consequently, some of 
them will be busted. Their equipment will be hauled away and 
they'll face the threat of court cases and possible jail 
time, just like BBS owners in Cincinnati who were raided by 
the notorious Sherriff Simon Leis. 
     This crackdown will be widely publicized, causing other 
small service providers to censor themselves. Users will also 
feel a need to be discreet for fear of breaking the law or 
losing access to the net. 
     Of course, they'll still be able to use encryption--
unless that, too, is made illegal. Suppose this happens; how 
will people react? Will Joe Netuser start using complex, 
devious methods so that he can continue swapping porno GIFs 
with his friends? Net gurus will tell him that steganographic 
encryption is totally secure and indetectable, but since he 
has a hard time understanding technical concepts, he may be 
reluctant to trust their judgment. After all, if they're 
wrong, old Joe could be faced with a hefty fine and even 
imprisonment. He may decide it isn't worth taking the risk 
just to get a bunch of dirty pictures. 
     Not everyone will knuckle under as easily as Joe. Some 
hardcore holdouts will stand firm in the face of scare 
tactics. The question is, how many? 
     Two scenarios are possible. 

     1. Widespread rebellion. 
     Radical net users stir up a groundswell of protest. 
They're ornery, resourceful, and combative. Thousands or 
millions of everyday Americans insist on defying the decency 
laws, just as millions of heartlanders chose to break the law 
in the early 1990s when they used illicit decoders with their 
satellite dishes in order to get free TV programs. 
     Now what? Will federal legislators admit that they made 
a mistake and repeal the legislation that they just passed? 
     This would be unprecedented behavior. It would be far 
more likely for conservatives to demand additional funds for 
law enforcement to crack down on the rebels and "clean up the 
net" as originally planned. 
     The means, of course, a full-scale "war on indecency." 
Result: sources of pornographic material move offshore; the 
U.S. Government tries to persuade other countries to adopt 
its standards; and small nations that refuse to control net 
content are threatened with import tariffs or trade 
sanctions. Meanwhile, in America, net sites must now obtain a 
license to operate and will lose that license if they violate 
decency laws. Rogue sites are traced and shut down by the 
FCC. Hardcore rebel users are randomly arrested and jailed.      
     The war on indecency ends up like the war on drugs: it 
can never be won, but so much money has been spent on it, and 
so many dire warnings have been made about the supposed 
threat to American values, no one in government can afford to 
lose face by backing down. Millions of everyday citizens 
violate the law to a minor extent on a daily basis while a 
minority are arrested and jailed. It's a huge waste of 
resources, and it ruins some people's lives. 
     This may seem to be the ultimate nightmare net scenario. 
But now consider the alternative. 

     2. Minimal backlash. 
     A few rebels defy the new law, but they gradually find 
themselves becoming isolated like leftover radicals from the 
1960s. One by one, service providers quietly impose controls 
and stop allowing access to controversial material. "Decency 
filtering software" becomes increasingly sophisticated, and 
law enforcement uses it to perform random samples of message 
traffic. There are widely publicized busts of net users who 
try to use encryption, and are caught. 
     Ultimately, hardly anyone is willing to risk being fined 
or jailed just for the sake of free speech online. As a 
result, the net becomes a dead, dull environment: a place to 
go shopping and swap totally inoffensive memos and business 
communications. Of course, you can't buy anything "adult" 
online, and many businesses return to regular mail for 
important messages, because secure encryption is outlawed and 
there's always a chance of surveillance online. 
     Similarly, individuals prefer not to use the net for 
anything personal or private because they have the 
uncomfortable feeling that Big Brother may be watching. 
Cyberspace is now supposed to be safe for kids, yet children 
are discouraged from using it because their parents can be 
held responsible if a child uses four-letter words or says 
anything that seems too suggestive. 
     The Luddites rejoice. Anarchy online has been 
eradicated. The concept of a new era of wealth through 
connectivity is mocked as a silly techno-fantasy. Net usage 
diminishes and people look back on the brief years without 
regulation as a bizarre quirk. "It could never last," they 
say. And they were right. 
     Are these two scenarios a realistic prediction of what 
may happen if there's a serious federal attempt to control 
netspeech? I'd prefer not to think so, yet they are quite 
consistent with previous examples of bad social legislation. 
A law may be widely despised and disobeyed, but it can still 
be rigorously enforced. This happened during Prohibition, 
it's still happening in the war on drugs, it happened on a 
more trivial scale with the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit, and 
of course it happened during the Vietnam war--which was one 
of the few occasions where public backlash became so 
widespread, government was ultimately forced to compromise. 
Of course, thousands of young Americans had to be killed 
overseas before this happened. 
     I'd like to think that the need to preserve free speech 
could also rouse national passions. I'm hoping that millions 
of people who want to express themselves freely online won't 
allow a few thousand censors to stop them. I'd like to see 
legislation that derives from rationality and a sense of 
proportion rather than excessive hype and reflexive netfear. 
I'm hoping that as more and more people get online, they'll 
see that there's nothing to be afraid of and no need for 
government controls that will tend to kill the medium they're 
supposed to protect. I'd like to believe that legislation to 
restrict online speech will be ruled unconstitutional, and a 
rich, egalitarian networked society will evolve, free from 
oppression by those who fear change. 
     But this will only happen if we choose to make it so. 


     Epilogue 

     The telecommunications deregulation bill was voted on by 
the Senate and the House of Representatives on February 1st, 
1996, exactly one year after Senator James Exon first 
proposed his decency amendment. After virtually no debate, 
the huge piece of legislation was approved by overwhelming 
majorities in both houses. President Clinton was expected to 
sign it into law a few days later. 
     Despite challenges, protests, and a widespread belief 
that any attempt to outlaw indecency would be 
unconstitutional, most of Exon's original wording survived 
intact. Ann Beeson at ACLU reminded everyone that as soon as 
the amendment became law it would "subject first-year college 
students under 18 to two years in prison and $100,000 fine if 
they engage in overly salacious dating patter online (even in 
their private email) [and] subject adults merely looking on 
their own home computer at something deemed obscene to prison 
for five years for the first peek...." 
     ACLU's Executive Director Ira Glasser also spoke out. He 
warned: "This law restructures the entire telecommunications 
industry and places the free speech and privacy rights of all 
Internet users in permanent jeopardy. It will criminalize 
otherwise protected speech in cyberspace, impose new 
censorship controls on television, and destroy the diversity 
of media ownership. For a Congress that says it wants to get 
big government out of people's lives this law represents the 
most extreme hypocrisy." 
     The day after the bill was approved, some newspapers 
reported that Senator Henry Hyde had made a hasty addition to 
the decency amendment just before the final vote. Hyde's text 
updated the 1873 Comstock Act, named after postal inspector 
Anthony Comstock, a notorious decency crusader who spent most 
of his life combating salacious pictures and immoral 
practices such as birth control. Many parts of the Comstock 
Act had been repealed over the decades, but one section 
outlawing communication about abortions was still on the 
books. It had been unused for decades and was a clear 
violation of the First Amendment, widely regarded as 
unenforceable--so why had Hyde extended it to include 
messages sent via computer networks? And why did he then 
issue a statement (quoted in _USA Today_) claiming that 
"nothing in the bill suggests any restrictions on discussions 
about abortion."? 
     More mixed signals came from President Clinton, who 
pubicly assured net users that the whole decency amendment 
was unconstitutional--even though he fully intended to sign 
it into law. Why would any president tell the world that the 
legislation he was about to create contained a provision that 
was illegal? 
     Perhaps there was a pattern, here; a hint that on some 
issues, legislators were more interested in making public 
statements than in creating sound laws. Henry Hyde could tell 
conservatives in his home state of Illinois that he had tried 
to restrict information about abortion--and if a court 
refused to allow it, well, that was beyond his control. Bill 
Cliton could tell liberals that he hated the decency 
amendment as much as they did, and he was certain that the 
decency stuff would be ruled unconstitutional, so they 
shouldn't think badly of him for creating the law. 
     Maybe most of the senators who had originally voted for 
the decency amendment also thought in these terms. They could 
have cast their votes merely to show their constituents that 
they were "tough on porn," even though they knew they were 
creating pernicious, unconstitutional legislation. 
     At one point, when the Exon amendment was going through 
the committee process, there had been an excellent chance to 
limit its scope. Committee members had nevertheless voted for 
the most extreme form of the amendment. Were they, too, aware 
that they were making a law that violated the Constitution? 
     One thing was certain: hardly anyone in congress cared 
very much about the impact of decency legislation online. 
Probably they saw the Internet as just a new techno-fad. The 
decency amendment wouldn't affect their lives, or the lives 
of their families, and it wouldn't have an economic impact, 
either. If it stopped people swearing online, was that such a 
big deal? Surely, it was trivial compared with the rest of 
the telecommunications bill, which deregulated vast 
industries worth billions of dollars. 
     Many net users seemed disillusioned by the cynicism they 
sensed in Washington. Voters Telecommunication Watch had 
organized a protest in December, 1995, prompting an estimated 
50,000 calls and faxes to be sent to legislators who were 
then debating the decency amendment during the committee 
process. The barrage of protests had absolutely no effect at 
all, causing some netizens to start comparing themselves with 
American colonists suffering taxation without representation. 
There was talk, now, of staging more militant protests, maybe 
even trying to shut the net down. 
     Meanwhile, Bill Clinton ceremonially signed the 
telecommunications bill in the Library of Congress. 
Ironically, his signature instantly criminalized the very 
institution where he sat. The complete catalogue of the 
Library of Congress is available online, including many book 
titles that Senator Exon would regard as highly indecent. A 
quick search of the Library of Congress web site turned up 
the following titles: 
 
     B06+Fuck//(TITL=1) 
     B07 Fuck (The English word)//(SUBJ=1) 
     B08 Fuck journal//(TITL=1) 
     B09 Fuck off, unless you take off that mask//(TITL=1) 
     B10 Fuck you (])//(TITL=1) 
     B11 Fuck you heroes//(TITL=1) 
     B12 Fuck you(]) Underground poems//(TITL=1) 

     Since this listing could be viewed by children all over 
America, the library was now in violation of federal law. 
Should it purge its own catalogues? Would any librarian who 
typed a new "indecent" title into the system be liable for 
the statutory fine of up to $250,000 and five years in jail? 
     The decency amendment created a bizarre situation. 
Hundreds of thousands of libraries, web sites, ISPs, 
universities, and everyday users were suddenly guilty of a 
federal crime with horrendous penalties. 
     The ACLU immediately filed for injunctive relief, just 
as Ann Beeson had promised they would. One week later Judge 
Ronald Buckwalter, a Bush appointee with a conservative 
reputation, granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting 
any prosecutions under the indecency provisions of the 
telecommunications deregulation act until a three-judge panel 
had time to evaluate the ACLU petition along with a response 
from the Justice Department--which had argued against decency 
legislation a year earlier but was now compelled to defend 
the law. When free-speech activists read the statement from 
the Justice Department, they were dismayed to find that it 
contained data derived from Martin Rimm's study. Even now, 
his traumatic statistic lived on. 
     Everyone assumed that after all possible appeals had 
been exhausted, the decency amendment would be ruled 
unconstitutional. In the meantime, Janet Reno signed a legal 
stipulation pledging that she would not "initiate any 
investigations or prosecutions" under the Decency Act. Still, 
if the Act turned out to be constitutional after all, the 
Justice Department would still be able to take action against 
anyone who had placed indecent material on the net during the 
moratorium. 
     Reactions of net users ranged from compliant to defiant. 
     An ISP in Oklahoma started blocking access to about ten 
of the most "controversial" Usenet groups. 
     A former judge named Steve Russell wrote a diatribe for 
an online newspaper, deliberately violating the decency law 
and inviting prosecution. His opening sentence: "You 
motherfuckers in Congress have dropped over the edge of the 
earth this time." 
     On Usenet, in the alt.tasteless.jokes news group, some 
people started cautiously using euphemisms for four-letter 
words. 
     On alt.censorship, users vowed to violate the law as 
often as possible. A netizen named Henry posted the following 
rant: 

          i intend to toss 'fuck' liberally into every 
     Subject: line i touch until the dumb motherfuckers come 
     to get me. i intend to flagrantly defy this law and spit 
     on it until it is overturned by the obvious supreme 
     court judgment. 
          i am well aware that the dipshits who passed this 
     law, deliberately spitting on the first amendment, are 
     completely informed and know that it's a malicious 
     violation of the first amendment. 
          however, these scumsucking pigfucking freaks don't 
     give a fuck about the constitution they swore to uphold.  
     they're faith-breakers, liars and traitors to the united 
     states, and any nation that valued its liberty would 
     declare them traitors and have them shot at dawn. 
          bob dole ought to be castrated and burnt at the 
     stake. 
          senator exon ought to be ripped to shreds by wild 
     boars and left to the vultures, buried at dawn with 
     donkey dicks in each eyesocket and a stake through his 
     chest. 
          (i'd say 'through his heart' but obviously we're 
     discussing a man without a heartbeat.) 

     And Henry finished with a new signature line that he 
planned to append to all his mail in future: 

     fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck 
     f                                                      f 
     u       "When you can't say 'fuck,' you can't say      u 
     c       'FUCK THE CDA!' -- Lenny Bruce rephrased       c 
     k                                                      k 
     fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck 

     The CDA that Henry referred to was the Communications 
Decency Act, the formal name for the Exon amendment. 
     Some netizens started figuring out practical ways to 
evade the law, in case it somehow survived the ACLU's 
challenge or was rewritten and reintroduced in some new form 
that turned out to be constitutional. Jaron Lanier, the 
inventor of "virtual reality," proposed that indecent images 
or text could be broken into tiny pieces, none of which would 
be illegal on its own. The pieces could be distributed at 
dozens or hundreds of Internet sites. Special software could 
then retrieve and reassemble them on a user's screen. Within 
days, Lanier said he was hearing from people who liked the 
proposal and were "busy creating the program with the idea of 
distributing it freely." 
     Other rebels describing themselves as Electronic 
Guerrillas launched a web page for discussing defensive 
tactics. Their URL was http://www.onworld.com/MUT. 
     An organization named Offshore Information Services 
(OIS) started offering totally uncensored net access for $50 
a month from its base in Anguilla, a tax haven in the 
Caribbean with strict privacy laws. The OIS press release 
promised netizens that "Setting up an offshore email identity 
can be as easy as changing the POP [Point of Presence] server 
name, user name, and password in their mail program. Using 
this new identity they can again have free speech on the 
Internet." A web page at http://online.offshore.com.ai/ 
offered additional information. 
     Overall, it seemed that the Internet community was in no 
mood to knuckle under--at least, not in this first tentative 
skirmish. Would the rebels remain defiant if the CDA survived 
its legal challenges or some new version was enacted, and the 
first victims were hauled off the jail? Would millions of net 
users and thousands of service providers still flout the law 
if their own liberty was placed in jeopardy? 
     As I write this in February, 1966 the outlook is still 
uncertain. The net is such a new phenomenon, there are no 
precedents, yet, to indicate how users will behave in the 
long term. 
     During the great legal battles against literary 
censorship in the 1950s, there were no massive populist 
uprisings. The struggle was waged by a tenacious minority of 
writers and publishers while the general public seemed 
unconcerned or even hostile to the idea of sexually explicit 
free speech. 
     Online, though, the situation is different. Everyone is 
a writer, now, and anyone can be a publisher. Computer users 
have grown accustomed to their liberties. As a result, free 
speech may seem more important to a larger number of people 
than forty years ago. 
     When some sort of decency legislation ultimately becomes 
law--perhaps a more limited, revised version of the Exon 
Amendment--the courage and concerns of net users will truly 
be tested. At that time some cynics in congress may be in for 
a surprise.

<DD>report &amp; supporting documents submitted to
    the Australian Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant
    to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies, opposing
    the censorship and regulation of bulletin board systems and strongly
    criticizing the technical igorance of the Computer Bulletin Board Task
    Force's regulation recommendations. From the Australian Computer
    Society and Electronic Frontiers Australia.
<DT><a href="acs_efa_online_reg_icspg.response"><B>acs_efa_online_reg_icspg.response</B></a>
<DD>Initial ACS/EFA Joint Task Force response
    (via email to DCA's comments email address) to the DCS-ICSPG Consultation
    Paper on the Regulation of On-Line Information Services. Stresses that
    the DCA's impression of the Internet is fundamentally off-kilter, and that
    top-down regulation simply will not physically operate in a network of
    this sort.

<DD>STOP! Campaign to stop Australian Net
    censorship legislation. Action alert (expires July 12 1996):
    This Thursday and Friday the State and Federal Attorneys-General will
    consider the draft NSW censorship legislation as the basis for national
    legislation. It is urgent that you contact your State and Federal
    Attorney-General and urge them to listen to the business community and the
    Internet-using public.

    Link your web pages to the STOP! Campaign Page, and contact State

<DT><a href="dca-icspg_online_regulation_070795.paper"><B>dca-icspg_online_regulation_070795.paper</B></a>
<DD>Information and
    Communications Services Policy Group (Department of Communications and
    the Arts), &quot;CONSULTATION PAPER ON THE REGULATION OF ON-LINE
    INFORMATION SERVICES&quot;, an extension of the Computer Bulletin Board
    Task Force regulatory recommendations. A deeply flawed recommendation, but
    at least throws a bone to self-regulation. However, it recommends in
    detailed legislation that would completely criminalize the transmission of
    &quot;objectionable&quot; material, which is very widely defined, and includes
    material that depicts minors in any &quot;offensive&quot; way, regardless of
    whether the depiction is sexual, material that instructs violence (e.g.
    self defense techniques), and games that are &quot;unsuitable for a minor to
    see or play.&quot; Even *advertising* but not providing such materials
    would be a crime under these recommendations. Australians who value
    their free expression rights, such as they are, should be *very*
    concerned about this paper.

<DD>Plaintiff's revised (improved by ACLU
    from EFGA original draft) final complaint (lawsuit) filed by ACLU, EFGA,
    EFF and many other parties against the Governor and Attorney General of
    the US state of Georgia, challenging the constitutionality of the 1996
    GA &quot;Net police&quot; law. The complaint explains that the new law is 
    unconstitutional because it threatens the free speech of Internet and 
    other online service users and providers in numerous ways, that range 
    from making it a crime to use a company's logo to link to their web site 
    (i.e. you get thrown in jail for giving someone free advertising), to 
    making it illegal to use anything but your full, real name online.

    France, UK, Italy, and Germany, and recently also including Russia,
    though everyone still says &quot;G7&quot; instead of &quot;G8&quot;.

<DD>Community Policy &amp; Terms of Service for users of firefly, a 
    free online service and &quot;intelligent agent&quot;, http://www.ffly.com
    Last revision: 1996. Firefly's policy takes a very firm stance on 
    protecting user privacy, and a middling stance on user freedom of 
    expression, noting firefly's own editorial control rights (and 
    potential market imperative to excercise them). Policy also 
    acknowledges legal requirements, and other parties' intellectual 
    property rights. This is basically an exemplary policy for a BBS-type 
    model in which the system may wish to exercise editorial control, e.g. 
    to please a &quot;family oriented&quot; customer base. For an ISP, it is lacking 
    a net.abuse policy, and does not do enough to protect user free 
    expression (since ISPs are not in business of content control, only 
    access provision). Unlike many older policies, this one essentially
    grants the system the right to display advertising to users, avoiding
    any question or confusion on that point.

     I, LEE TIEN, declare as follows:<BR>
     1.      I am an attorney duly admitted to practice law in the State of California and the Northern District of California.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth herein, unless otherwise indicated, and if called as a witness could and would so testify.<BR>
     2.      On or about December 28, 1993, I filed Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") requests under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552 to agencies of the U.S. government.   These requests, made on behalf of a client, sought access to agency records concerning export controls on cryptography.  This matter is currently in litigation in the Northern District of California.  No.  C95-1098-FMS.<BR>
     3.      One such request was made to the U.S. Department of Justice.  On or<BR>
about February 9, 1994, in response to that request, I received from Richard Shiffrin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, the "Memorandum for Davis R. Robinson, Legal Adviser, Department of State, Re:  Revised Proposed International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)," dated July 5, 1984 ("1984 ITAR Memorandum"), with attachments (collectively, the "Source Document").<BR>
     4.      The two attachments are:  the "Memorandum for Dr. Frank Press, Science Adviser to the President, Re:  Constitutionality Under the First Amendment of ITAR Restrictions on Public Cryptography," dated May 11, 1978 ; and the "Constitutionality of Proposed Revisions of the Export Administration Regulations:  Memorandum for the  Director [Henry D. Mitman], Capital Goods Production Materials Division, Department of<BR>
Commerce," dated July 28, 1981.  The latter memorandum is published at 5 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 230 (1981).  <BR>
     5.      I assert that attached hereto as Exhibit A to this Declaration is a true and correct copy of the Source Document, except that the copy is date-stamped.<BR>
     6.      I also received in the same mailing from Mr. Shiffrin the document entitled "Constitutionality of the Proposed Revision of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations:  Memorandum Opinion for the Office of Munitions Control, Department of State," dated July 1, 1981, which is referenced in the 1984 ITAR Memorandum as "Memorandum for William B.<BR>
Robinson, Office of Munitions Control, Department of State, from Theodore B. Olson, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (July 1, 1981) ("1981 ITAR Memorandum").  This document is published at 5. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 202 (1981).  <BR>
     7.      I assert that attached hereto as Exhibit B to this Declaration is a true and correct copy of the 1981 ITAR Memorandum, except that the copy is date-stamped.<BR>
     8.  I also received in the same mailing from Mr. Shiffrin the document "ITAR Controls Over Public Cryptography: Legislative History of &#167; 38 of The Arms Export Control Act," dated June 20, 1978, by Kathryn Fuller of the Office of Legal Counsel ("Fuller Memo").  Attached hereto as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of the Fuller Memo.  I further received the untitled letter from Larry A. Hammond, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, to Col. Wayne Kay of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, dated August 21, 1978 ("Hammond Letter").  Attached hereto as Exhibit D is a true and correct copy of the Hammond Letter.<BR>
     9.      Attached hereto as Exhibit E are true and correct excerpts from the recently released report of the National Research Council, Computer Science & Telecommunications Board Committee to Study National Cryptography Policy, entitled "Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society" (May 30, 1996, Prepublication copy) (hereinafter, "NRC Report").  This study was commissioned by the U. S Congress in November, 1993, pursuant to P. L. 103-160.  I received this report from the National Research Council on or about June 1, 1996.<BR>
     I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true and correct and that this Declaration was executed at _____________, California on this ______   day of  July, 1996.<BR>
                                                                       ____________________________<BR>
                                                                       LEE TIEN

<U>                                                                     </U> )<P>
     I, Dr. Andrew W. Appel, hereby declare:  <P>
     1.       I am currently a professor of computer science at Princeton University.  I teach courses in compilers, programming languages, and software engineering. My research is in efficient compilation of functional programming languages, particularly the language "ML."<BR>
     2.       I received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1985.  I have been at Princeton University since 1986; as Assistant Professor (1986-92), Associate Professor (1992-95), and Professor (since 1995).  I am the Editor in Chief of ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, the major journal in the field of programming languages.  My work as the implementor of the "Standard ML of New Jersey" compiler is well known.  Standard ML of New Jersey is research software that has been distributed widely, without charge, on the Internet since 1988.  It is now in use at over 100 universities and industrial research and development laboratories.<BR>
     3.     Publication of ideas is a fundamental part of the academic world. Publication of ideas is emphasized in academia because it is vital to the scientific method.  This, on a basic level, means that if you have an idea, you toss it out into the "marketplace of ideas" and your peers and others evaluate it, test it and discuss it.  This is how we determine which ideas are good and which are faulty.  <BR>
     4.     For example, I mention two journal papers:<BR>
            a.  "Efficient Computation of LALR(1) look-ahead sets."   F. L. DeRemer and T. Pennello, <U>ACM Transactions on  Programming Languages and Systems</U>, October 1982.  <BR>
This article explains a faster computer algorithm for a certain  task, whose utility was justified by a (claimed) relationship  between two classes of programming language grammars.<BR>
             b.  "On the (non-)Relationship between SLR(1) and  NQLALR(1) Grammars."  M. E. Bermudez and K. M.  Schimpf, <U>ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems</U>, April 1988.  This article  published nearly six years later, described itself as follows:<BR>
"A popular but "not-quite" correct technique for computing  LALR(1) look-ahead sets has been formalized by DeRemer and Pennello and dubbed NQLALR(1).  They also claim that <BR>
the class of SLR(1) grammars is a subset of the class of NQLALR(1)  grammars.  We prove here that no such relationship exists between those two classes.  We do so with a counterexample that, ironically, appeared in DeRemer and Pennello's own paper."<BR>
     5.       Clearly, DeRemer and Penello's idea was not as good or useful as they thought, since Bernudez and Schimpf were able to demonstrate its flaws.  On the other hand, scientific journals are full of good papers that do advance the state of the art.  The way they do so is by reaching their readers, and encouraging the readers to review, test and improve on the ideas.<BR>
     6.       For anyone whose ideas include or involve computer code, this publication process as part of the scientific method includes publication of that code.  This is not only computer scientists, but mathematicians, scientists, economists and others whose ideas are described or demonstrated with the help of computer code.  Descriptions limited to English or mathematics are not sufficient to appropriately describe many things.  They are certainly not sufficient to allow someone else to test many ideas without significant, unnecessary work.  Such testing is required for both the scientific method and academic advancement.<BR>
       7.     For example, early in my career (1986) I became convinced that a certain kind of programming language, called "functional", would be useful for a wide variety of applications.  Up to that point, functional languages were considered useful only in very specialized applications, and systems that used functional languages were invariably extremely slow (these two points are related, since many uses of computers require speed).  <BR>
     8.     I focused my research on the speedy implementation of the functional language ML, implemented in my "Standard ML of New Jersey" software system.  In 1987 I published a preliminary paper (with a colleague) describing the system.  Also in 1987, I began making the software available, for free, to anyone who wanted to use it.  Originally this was done by sending magnetic tapes through parcel post.<BR>
     9.       By 1988 we realized that we could make our software available on the Internet to anyone who wanted to "fetch" it.  We did so in order to allow others to test and review it.  By 1990 there were over 70 academic and industrial institutions using the software, and by 1994 over 100.  It would have been very difficult to sustain this wide a distribution using magnetic tapes, since we were not charging money for the software.<BR>
     10.     From 1987 to the present I have published a series of papers describing the scientific ideas and methods underlying the software.  Any academic scientist is expected to describe his innovations in a form where fellow scientists and the world at large can learn from them.  However, in the "marketplace of ideas" there are many competitors, and the scientist often has a hard time being heard.  When I published my papers, I think that people took them seriously because they knew the software worked well.  <BR>
     11.      Distributing computer code on the Internet enables not only the evaluation of ideas, but also their incremental improvement.  For example, a compiler for the programming language is typically a large software system, often containing hundreds of "modules," where each module represents one or more scientific ideas and days or weeks of implementation effort.  My "Standard ML of New Jersey" compiler, for example, has 422 modules and represents tens of man-years of effort.  <BR>
     12.     A typical scientific idea or innovation usually involves just a small set of these modules.  If a scientist wants to test his new idea, involving one module, he will still have to implement all the other modules just to demonstrate that his idea works.  By distributing the software, I make it possible for a scientist to replace just one module with an innovative one, and use the other modules that I provide.  <BR>
     13.  There have been several occasions since 1988 where computer scientists at other institutions have fetched the Standard ML of New Jersey software on the Internet, made modifications to it, and published scientific papers describing their improvements.  The lack of freely distributed software would constitute a significant "barrier to entry" to scientists wanting to test innovations.<BR>
     14.     Making computer code available on the Internet is an important avenue for academic advancement.  My own career would have been hurt significantly if I had not been able to distribute working computer programs.<BR>
     15.     I also put course materials up on the Internet for student access.  Several of Princeton's computer science courses have "Web Pages", at the address http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses.  Attached hereto as Exhibit "A" is a copy of this web page as of March 1, 1996.  By "clicking" on the underlined items with a mouse you can visit the particular site for each class.  The sites contain course readings, homework assignments and student input, all of which can contain computer code.<BR>
     16.     I often suggest to students that they post their projects on the Internet for peer and professor evaluation.  This allows the students to begin competing early in the "marketplace of ideas", at a stage where their ideas might not be "finished" enough for publication in a scientific journal.  Journals can be very slow in publishing papers, and the students only have a short time before they'll be on the job market.  When they apply for jobs, it is very important that the academic community already knows of their results and has begun to make judgements of them.<BR>
     17.     Cryptography is an area of applied mathematics, just as many areas of computer science are.  It is not, as the government implies, merely a "product" or a "thing" to be used for commercial purposes; it is an academic discipline which is dynamic.  This science may also produce useful things for people, as with many sciences, but it changes and grows with new research and insights gained from the academic process.   The further development of this discipline requires that cryptographers be able to share their ideas, including the sharing of their computer code.<BR>
     I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.<P>

      I, LAWRENCE MILLER, declare as follows:<P>
     1.      I am a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science at The George Washington University ("GWU") in Washington, D.C.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth herein, unless otherwise indicated, and if called as a witness could and would so testify. <BR>
     2.      In fall term 1995, I was enrolled in a graduate computer science course in computer security (Computer Security Systems I - CS229) (hereinafter "CS229") at GWU, taught by Prof. Lance Hoffman. Prof. Hoffman specializes in information security and edited the 1995 book <U>Building in Big Brother:  The Cryptography Policy Debate</U>.  The CS229 syllabus (for Spring 1996, which was substantially the same as the Fall 1995 CS229) is<BR>
attached as Exhibit A to this Declaration and incorporated by reference. <BR>
     3.      I have been a graduate student at GWU since January 1994. During<BR>
my studies at GWU I have found that a high proportion of the students in the engineering school are foreign nationals. In my CS229 class, about 70% of the approximately 30 students were foreign nationals. I know this because students in the class introduced themselves to each other on the first day of class, and stated what country they came from. I believe that<BR>
at least one of the students was from Iran. <BR>
     4.      CS229 addressed computer security, including the use of cryptography in maintaining computer, communications, and data security. As part of the learning experience, students must do a term project on some aspect of computer security. Each project involves the production of a term paper, accompanying transparency masters, and a World Wide Web ("Web") page presentation related to the project.<BR>
     5.      By putting the Project on the Web, anyone with a Web "browser" like<BR>
Netscape Navigator could use the Project and learn how it works.  The Web is a format for displaying and linking information on "pages." Programs that "browse" the Web can display pages containing text, images, sound, animation and moving video.  A page can include "links" to other types of information or resources, so that while viewing one page, one can "click"<BR>
on a link and be connected to the resource itself, wherever it is.  Such links allow people to locate and efficiently view related information even if the information is stored on numerous computers all around the world.  <BR>
     6.      The draft project deliverables (term paper, transparency masters, and Web pages) are turned in in triplicate two or three weeks before the end of the term, and two of the three copies are immediately given to other class members for peer review and evaluation. The students receive reviews of their projects from their fellow students within a week and then have a week or two to take those comments into account in producing their final<BR>
projects.<BR>
     7.      On or about October 15, Prof. Hoffman approved my proposal for a<BR>
term project ("the Project"), entitled "Public Key Distribution and Automated Notarization," which involved the development and implementation of two pieces of software: a cryptographic key management and certification system, and a cryptographic notarization system. The Project does not actually encrypt or decrypt messages.  It manages and distributes keys<BR>
which can be used to encrypt messages.  The Project is also capable of checking digital signatures and acting as an electronic "notary public" which automatically dates and signs documents.  Both systems work through Web "forms," and use Philip Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy ("PGP") public key encryption software to perform key management, cryptographic certification, and digital signature generation and verification functions.<BR>
     8.      PGP is encryption software which is capable of performing encryption and generating digital signatures. Encryption is a technique which allows users to encode a message using a numerical "key" so as to make the message difficult (hopefully impossible) to read if it is intercepted by someone who does not have the key. PGP uses a type of encryption called "Public Key" because encryption is performed using a two-part key pair, one part being public and one being private. By publishing my "public key" it is possible for people to encode messages which only I can decode using my "private key." Providing "public keys" to<BR>
other people is therefore an important part of "public key" cryptography. <BR>
     9.      I selected PGP for the Project because it is believed to be very strong, contains useful and secure key management features, includes both encryption and digital signature capabilities, is widely used, and was freely available to me over the Internet. I knew at the time I began the project that PGP is available in a book published by MIT Press. <BR>
     10. An initial version of the Project, including the cryptographic key management and notarization systems, a written term paper, and an Internet-accessible hypertext document explaining in detail how the software developed for this project works, was to have been submitted for peer review on December 7, 1995. In order for one of my classmates to test<BR>
the Project for peer review, he or she would need to have PGP; without PGP, the Project could not be tested.<BR>
     11. In addition to providing network access to cryptographic key management<BR>
and digital notarization services through the Web, the written Project report and related hypertext documents would explain in detail how the Project works, in particular concentrating on "risk analysis": how secure the system is, how it could be "cracked," and how possible countermeasures could be implemented in a production system to protect the system from<BR>
being "cracked." <BR>
     12.  In order to provide a complete discussion of the Project, the description of the Project on the Web would include program source code for the software which processes data entered in the forms by users of the Project. The source code contains interfaces to PGP. This source code, when combined with PGP itself, and installed on a Web server, constitutes a<BR>
complete, networkable cryptographic key management system. Due to the electronic nature of the publication medium, the hypertext Project report, including the source code, were to be in a computer-readable, network-accessible format.<BR>
     13.  The Project would not and does not encrypt. While PGP was to be used to provide notarization and cryptographic key management services,  direct access to PGP's encryption features was not to be provided.  PGP itself was not to be distributed as part of this project, since the students assigned to review the project will be able to download PGP from a<BR>
number of sites both inside and outside the United States.  Instead, links to these locations were to be provided from the hypertext project description.  The initial version of my project as it existed in October 1995 included a hypertext link to MIT's PGP distribution page, and to a<BR>
site in Germany which provided access to PGP. This initial version of my project was located on a workstation in my apartment and not on a public access web server.<BR>
     <B>HOW EXPORT CONTROLS INTERFERED WITH THE PROJECT</B> <BR>
     14.     While I was aware that there were export controls on cryptography when I began the Project, I did not initially believe that my Project might be subject to these export controls, because it did not encrypt. At this time I was not familiar with the details of cryptography export controls.   It was not until after my proposal was approved by Prof. Hoffman that I<BR>
learned - from a lecture Prof. Hoffman gave - that arms export controls on encryption were more complex than I had originally thought.  In class, I asked Prof. Hoffman about how my Project might be affected, and I got the distinct impression that it had not occurred to him that there would be any kind of legal problem. He suggested that I do some research and summarize<BR>
my concerns to him. <BR>
     15.     I went to the State Department's Web page on the Internet and read what was there.  From another Internet site I downloaded the text of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") and studied it. I searched for text referring to cryptography and software. I discovered that "key management" software is specifically mentioned in Category XIII(b)(1) of the U.S. Munitions List ("USML"). I then became concerned that my project might be subject to ITAR.  <BR>
     16.     On or about October 30, 1995, I sent a letter to Prof. Hoffman ("the Letter") expressing concern that in doing the Project or the CS229, I might violate the Arms Export Control Act ("AECA") and the ITAR. A copy of the Letter is attached as Exhibit B to this Declaration and incorporated by reference.<BR>
     17.     I was concerned that the class requirements - peer review of the Project by other students in the CS229, publishing the Project on the Web, and providing access to cryptographic key management functions - might in the case of my Project constitute "export" of items controlled under Category XIII(b) of the USML in violation of the AECA and ITAR unless a license was obtained.<BR>
     18.     I was unsure as to how I could complete the Project without risking possible criminal prosecution. In order to test the features of the key management system, the students assigned to review the Project needed to use PGP, since the key management system only works for PGP keys. I believed that within the United States, foreign students could not legally<BR>
obtain PGP. Therefore it would be impossible for my foreign classmates to review the Project without either my violating ITAR by giving them a copy of PGP, or their violating ITAR by downloading a copy of PGP. <BR>
     19.     I was also concerned that while the source code of my Project could not function as a "key management" system independently of PGP, it might still fall under Category XIII(b)(5) of the U.S. Munitions List as "ancillary equipment" since it constitutes a component of a "key management" system designed specifically to interface with PGP, which I<BR>
believed was restricted under Category XIII(b)(1) of the U.S. Munitions List.<BR>
     20.     I also believed that publication of the Project on the Web might constitute the "export" of cryptographic key management services for which a license would be needed. Prof. Hoffman had distributed to us parts of a 1994 report from the Office of Technology Assessment ("Information Security and Privacy in Network Environments") which clearly stated that providing services could be an export.  Based on my understanding of ITAR, I believed that even if we were to restrict access of the Web page to U.S. sites only, ITAR would still be violated if foreign persons accessed the key management functions of the Web page, because the Web page might be said to "perform" a key management service for them. It also seemed that even if access were restricted only to members of CS229, this constituted a serious problem, since many of my classmates were foreign nationals. <BR>
     21.   Because part of the Project constituted a cryptographic key management system, I believed that by publishing the source code used as a front end to PGP, I might violate ITAR if the source code could be read from outside the United States or if the source code were read by foreign nationals within the United States.<BR>
     22.   Finally, I believed that discussion of how my software worked, and how its security could be broken, which would be a substantial portion of the term paper, might be subject to "export" restrictions as "technical data," i.e., information directly related to cryptographic software.   <BR>
     23.    I was unwilling to ignore the possible consequences of violating the ITAR, because I believed that the State Department could at any time declare the Project controlled, and if it did turn out to be controlled, I would subject not only myself and Prof. Hoffman, but possibly my institution, my foreign classmates, and any foreign person who accessed the<BR>
Project, to criminal and civil liability. <BR>
     24.     I suggested that Prof. Hoffman consider waiving certain of the normal CS229 requirements to prevent the Project from being "exported" to any foreign nationals.<BR>
     25.     Prof. Hoffman was unwilling to waive these requirements of Web publication and peer review. He expressed his belief that these requirements were integral to the learning experience, since people working in scientific fields need experience with publication and with reviewing and being reviewed by peers. He expressed concern to me that if he were to<BR>
only permit U.S. citizens to review my Project he might be violating university policy by discriminating against foreign students. I was also concerned that if review of my project were to be restricted I would not have access to the same quality of review as those students whose project reviewers were drawn from the general population of the class, and expressed this concern to Prof. Hoffman. <BR>
     26.     On or about Nov. 11, 1995, Prof. Hoffman decided to extend my deadline for submitting the initial version of the Project and to seek clarification as to the legality of the Project per the CS229 requirements.  <BR>
     27.     On or about Nov. 16, 1995, Prof. Hoffman and I jointly made a request ("the Request") to the State Department for guidance as to whether the Office of Defense Trade Controls would require a Commodity Jurisdiction determination, export license, or other approval before I placed my draft deliverable on the Web or had it peer reviewed, as described above. A copy of the Request, which also provides further details on the Project, is<BR>
attached as Exhibit C to this Declaration and incorporated by reference. <BR>
     28.     On or about Dec. 7, 1995 the draft version of my Project was due.  Prof. Hoffman and I agreed that without a clarification from the State Department it would be unwise to proceed with the peer review portion of my Project. Instead of turning in a draft of my Project for peer review, I gave Prof. Hoffman a sealed envelope containing my draft Project on floppy disk and a copy of the Letter I had sent to him earlier. I conspicuously<BR>
marked the envelope on both sides with my attempt at a "legal disclaimer" because I was concerned that some foreign person might get it and that I would be in trouble if that happened.<BR>
     29.     On or about Dec. 15, 1995, Prof. Hoffman received a response ("the Response") to our Request from the State Department signed by Mr. William J. Lowell, Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls. A copy of the Response is attached as Exhibit D to this Declaration and incorporated by reference. It stated, in pertinent part, that: <P>
        With regard to the technical data, the Department of State does not<BR>
        control technical data "concerning general scientific,<BR>
        mathematical or engineering principles commonly taught in schools,<BR>
        colleges and universities or information in the public domain as<BR>
        defined in [22 C.F.R.] &#186; 120.11" (22 C.F.R. &#186; 120.10). <BR>
<BR>
        No license is required for the activities described in your letter <BR>
        so long as no cryptographic software covered under the<BR>
        Category XIII(b) of the U.S. Munitions<BR>
        List is taken or sent outside of the United States.<BR>
                                                                              <BR>
<BR>
     30.     Due to the delay in obtaining the Response, Prof. Hoffman and I discussed my situation and it was decided that I would take an incomplete in the class. It was clear that it would not be possible to for my Project to be reviewed, revised and graded before the end of the semester. We were also unsure how to proceed based on the contents of the Response. <BR>
     31.     The Response left many questions unanswered. First, by saying "with regard to the technical data," the Response implied that the Project involved technical data, but it did not specify what parts of the Project in fact were "technical data," if any. Was my Project source code "technical data," or what? It did not seem that my Project could be "public domain," since it was not yet published. It might have been "general scientific, mathematical or engineering principles commonly taught in schools, colleges and universities," but the Response did not actually say so.<BR>
     32.     Second, the Response used the phrase "cryptographic software,"  implying that some part of the Project was cryptographic software and could not be "taken or sent outside of the United States." But it never actually said that the Project, or any part of it, was cryptographic software.  <BR>
     33.     Third, I remained unclear as to whether cryptographic software was "technical data." The Response suggested that it was not technical data, but only by backward inference. By then, I knew that disclosing technical data to a foreign person, even within the United States, was an export; the Response seemed to say that only if cryptographic software were to be "taken or sent outside of the United States" would a license be needed.  Thus it was possible that cryptographic software was not technical data. <BR>
     34.     I could not be sure, however, because the Response also stated that technical data "concerning general . . . principles . . . or information in the public domain" was not controlled. The Response could be read to say that PGP fell into one of these exemptions, which would seem to indicate that it was technical data. The problem was that while PGP is<BR>
generally available to the public, my software was definitely not in the public domain, because I hadn't published it.  <BR>
     35.     Furthermore, it was not clear to me what would count as cryptographic software being "taken or sent outside of the United States."  Did making information available for access or downloading internationally count as its being "taken or sent outside of the United States?" I believed PGP was cryptographic software for ITAR purposes, but PGP would not be distributed as part of this project. Instead, links to locations where PGP could be obtained were to be provided from the hypertext project description. If someone outside the United States linked to the Project's Web page, and used the link to download PGP from a U.S. location, would I have caused PGP to be "sent or taken outside the United States?" Suppose I<BR>
only provided links to PGP residing outside the United States? Then a person outside the United States would be obtaining PGP from a site outside the United States - but would also be doing so via the link which we provided in the United States.<BR>
     36.     Because the Response did not identify which parts of the Project were "technical data" and which parts were "cryptographic software," I did not know what parts of the Project were subject to State Department jurisdiction.  Consequently, it remained unclear whether placing the Project on a Web page available internationally was an export for which a<BR>
license was needed. Prof. Hoffman expressed the same concern, especially because these issues were likely to arise the next time one of his students proposed a project involving cryptographic software.  <BR>
     37.     All these issues remained unclear.  In the meantime, I still had an incomplete grade.  <BR>
     38.     I discussed the situation with Prof. Hoffman and suggested seeking further clarification about several points: (a) That the cryptographic key management system, when separated from PGP, is not a Category XIII(b) munition, and that the source code for such a system, even when in electronically readable form, constitutes "public domain" information; (b)<BR>
That the cryptographic key management system, with PGP included, is a Category XIII(b) munition; (c) That hosting the cryptographic key management system on a publicly accessible computer does not constitute the provision of a defense service; (d) That the acquisition and use of PGP within the United States by foreign nationals who are students for the purpose of evaluating my project does not require an export license, so students could be given a copy of PGP on a floppy disk to test the Project. <BR>
     39.     We did not pursue the matter further formally with the State Department.  From my discussions with Prof. Hoffman, the main reasons we did not do so were that the University legal office was not interested, and that we would waste time and effort, given the vagueness of the Response and the likelihood that State would not provide further clarification. <BR>
     40.     Another concern we had in deciding how to act after reviewing the Response was that we knew, based on the ITAR (22 C.F.R. &#186; 126.9), that an "advisory opinion" from the State Department was not binding on it and would not legally protect us.  We would have been less concerned if the Response had been more specific, since we would have been comfortable that the peer review process would not have violated ITAR.  But since the Response was so vague, I felt that it was of no help whatsoever if the government did initiate legal action against us, and could even be used against us in court.<BR>
     41.  On or about February 5, 1996, Prof. Hoffman informally contacted a State Department employee, John Sonderman, expressing his puzzlement over the meaning of the Response and emphazing that the problem we faced was bound to recur and that academic institutions need clear guidance.  Prof. Hoffman sent me a printed copy of his e-mail message to Mr. Sonderman, and a copy of it is attached as Exhibit E to this Declaration and incorporated by reference.<BR>
     42.  I had to take an incomplete grade in the class as a result of the legal uncertainty surrounding the Project. There is no question in my mind that the ITAR had a negative effect on my classwork - the way we finally went about reviewing my project was to have two students who were U.S. citizens review my project. This review took place the semester after I took CS229, in May 1996. Prof. Hoffman required that the reviewers be U.S. citizens<BR>
because we felt that the Response did not clarify the situation. <BR>
     43.  The students who reviewed my project were not selected from CS 229, which is very technical. They were instead selected from a public policy class which Prof. Hoffman teaches in the spring. One of the students who reviewed my project had never taken CS 229. I believe that I would have gotten better technical comments if reviewers had been selected from my CS 229 class, as the reviewers for the other students in my CS 229 class were.<BR>
     44.  I am currently revising my Project for final submission, at which time I will receive a grade for CS229. My academic transcript will permanently reflect that I received an incomplete, even after a final grade is submitted.<BR>
     45.  My experience with ITAR definitely left me feeling that if I do cryptography projects in the future as part of my classwork (which well may be the case) I could end up with further problems. I am also concerned that if I propose cryptography projects in the future they may be less likely to be approved by my professors due to the problems I encountered with this<BR>
project, and the time burden it imposed on both my professor and myself. <P>
     <B>TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE PROJECT</B><BR>
     45. The systems which comprised my Project would manage public keys needed to encrypt with PGP in two ways.<BR>
     46.  A person could register a key with the key database. Once keys were registered, the system would act like a phone directory of public keys and allow users to find and download the public keys of other users. Once downloaded these public keys can be used to encrypt messages so that the messages can be securely sent to other users (for instance, once I download a public key I can use my own copy of PGP to encode a message, and then<BR>
send the encoded message to the "owner" of the public key by electronic mail).<BR>
     47.     It allows users, once they have their first key registered in the key database, to submit additional keys to the server, and to "revoke," or mark as compromised, keys which they previously had registered on the server.  Someone might want to do this because they are afraid that someone may have discovered their private key, because they want to use a key with<BR>
more digits (which would be more secure), or because they want to change their key because it has been in use for a long time, and they are worried that someone may have "broken" their key.  The system checks to make sure that a person adding a key already has a valid key.  This procedure also uses PGP and is designed to make it nearly impossible for someone to insert<BR>
a "fake" key into the key database.<BR>
     48.     A digital signature is a number which is generated using a "private key," and which can be checked against the corresponding public key. Therefore, the effect of generating a digital signature for a computer file is similar to signing a piece of paper, because only the true private key can generate a signature decodable by the associated public key. This means that the file was sent by the person with that public key.   <BR>
     49.   In addition to doing "key management" as described above, the Project provides a "digital notary" service which uses PGP's public-key digital signature features to digitally sign text documents. The system permits text documents to be entered into a Web "form." Upon request, the system will respond with an unforgeable cryptographic "signature" with the<BR>
date and time the document was "signed" by the server. Similarly, "signed" documents can be verified by the server using a similar Web form, to which the system responds with a message stating whether or not the signature was valid, and if it was valid, when it was generated. <BR>
     50.  A "form" is a type of Web page which allows someone who accesses the Web page over the Internet to enter information and send this information back to the computer on which the Web page is stored (such a computer is commonly called a "web server"). In the case of my Project, information sent to the "web server" using a "form" caused the "web server" to execute<BR>
software I wrote, which in turn executed PGP to perform the aforementioned cryptographic functions, and which returned the results to the person who filled out the "form."<BR>
     I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true and correct and that this Declaration was executed at Livermore, California, on this __ day of July, 1996. <BR>
                                                                     ________________________________<BR>

     I, MATTHEW BISHOP, hereby declare:<BR>
     1.  I am currently an assistant professor of computer science at the University of California at Davis. I have been a fulltime professional computer scientist since 1984, when I graduated from Purdue University.  I have worked in the area of computer security since 1979, and have taught computer security at the graduate and undergraduate level since 1987 when I joined the faculty at Dartmouth College. <BR>
     2.     From 1984 to 1987 I was a research scientist at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science at NASA Ames Research Center, and I helped implement security measures for the computers at the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation supercomputing facility at NASA Ames Research Center.<BR>
          3.     Computer and network security has three aspects: 1) confidentiality, the ability to keep data private; 2) authentication, the ability to identify both the sender of a message and that the message did not change in transit; and 3) availability, that the message could be sent and received.  Of these three, the first two require cryptography, yet only the first,<BR>
confidentiality,  is controlled by the ITAR. <BR>
     4.     Confidentiality technology can be best understood through analogy.  Let's say you and I want to send messages to one another but keep anyone else from seeing them.  Since this is a legal document, let's say you are my attorney and we are discussing information which is privileged.  How can we do this?<BR>
     5.      Cryptography is analogous to putting the messages into a locked safe and having a courier carry the safe between us.  We know the combination, but no-one else does.  The only way the privileged information can become known is if one of us reveals the combination or the information.  The courier information cannot reveal the information even by accident; the protection is very clear and clean.  This technique is called "physical protection" because an attacker (who is trying to get the information) can't get access to the physical medium over which the message is conveyed - in this case, the paper it's written on.  To do so, the attacker would have to cut through the safe.<BR>
     6.      Our solution of the safe may be theoretically possible, but it's unrealistic.  (Look at what couriers charge for carrying 2-pound packages!)  Cryptography provides more practical physical protection.  Instead of using a safe, the sender simply uses mathematics  to scramble the message; the recipient unscrambles it.  Now, if the courier accidentally mislays the message, the confidential information will be indecipherable to anyone but you or me.  Note this also means we want a strong scrambler, just like we would want a strong safe.  If it's not strong enough, the message can be read (with effort) by someone else.  And if lots of money or an important issue were at stake, the effort would be worthwhile.<BR>
     7.     Now, back to computer networks.  While couriers carry messages in their hands, computer networks carry messages in wires and radio waves.  How can we keep those messages confidential as they fly through the air on radio waves or through telephone wires?  The same way: we scramble those messages.  Then, even if someone else intercepts those messages, that person cannot read them, and our communication is still confidential.<BR>
      8.     Now, why is this important on the Internet?  One clear reason is commerce, since no one will want to put their credit card number or bank information out into public. Yet putting this information into an unscrambled Internet message effectively makes it publicly available, or at least available to anyone on any system that the message passes through on the way to its destination.  Since an Internet message passes through many computer systems, any person with access to any of those computer systems could read an unscrambled credit card number and use it.  Even though such misuse of credit card numbers is a crime, it still happens, and is quite painful to deal with.<BR>
          9.      Another important use of cryptography in my work is the protection of sensitive research data as it is shared between me and my research colleagues.  A major part of my research is the study of vulnerabilities in computer systems: why they arise and how to fix them, and how to prevent them from recurring in future systems.  In order to understand the origin of vulnerabilities, they must be collected and classified, and the information that my colleagues and I exchange often includes attack scripts, which are "cookbooks" for breaking into computer systems.  These demonstrate that a vulnerability exists, and from the script we can determine precisely what the vulnerability is.<BR>
     10.       My colleagues and I have been exchanging data over the Internet since 1985, because its ability to move data quickly from one point to another is very convenient. Without the Internet, we would have to mail floppy disks to one another, adding days -- if not weeks --to our exchanges.<BR>
     11.     I exchange this data only with research colleagues I know very well and trust highly, <U>although some of them are not U.S. citizens</U>.  I would not want this information available to people I don't know, since if they were irresponsible or malicious they could do incalculable damage to many computer systems.  So, before sending the data (which is stored on systems not on the Internet), I use cryptography to scramble the data on the system which is not connected to the Internet, move the scrambled text to a system on the Internet, and then send that.  I shudder to think how we could handle this information without encryption!<BR>
     12.     Now, how does the ITAR impact all this?  ITAR treats cryptographic software as a munition, meaning you need government permission to export strong cryptographic software. <BR>
     13.     This means that I can't use strong cryptography to send my research data to foreign colleagues or my credit card number to merchants and instead either use weak cryptography or must find other, less efficient means to transport my data.  If I use weak cryptography unknown interlopers can easily intercept my data.  If I use other means, my work is greatly complicated and slowed, since I cannot use the same mode of communication for U.S. and foreign colleagues unless the foreign colleagues have somehow obtained the same cryptography, written a program compatible with my enciphering program, and done without my giving them any software.  <BR>
     14.  I fear that ITAR's restrictions aid criminals who want access to confidential Internet data by preventing me and others from properly protecting this information when we send it to others on the Internet.  This leaves information ranging from credit card numbers to sensitive computer security research data much more vulnerable to criminals.  I hope the above shows why.<BR>
     I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.<P>

     I, HAROLD ABELSON, hereby declare:<P>
     1.  I am Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  I give this declaration in my personal capacity and not on behalf of MIT.<BR>
     2.  I have been active in computer science at MIT since 1969, when I began as a graduate student.  I joined the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as a faculty member in 1977.<BR>
     3.  Since 1981, I have been charge of MIT's introductory computer science subject, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (together with my colleague, Prof. Gerald Jay Sussman).  This subject is taught at MIT each year to between 500 and 700 undergraduates.<BR>
     4.  Together with Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman, I am author of the textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs," which is based on our MIT course.  The first edition of this book was published by the MIT Press and the McGraw-Hill Book Company in 1985; the second edition will appear later this year.<BR>
     5.  Through the MIT course and the textbook, my work in computer science education has gained major visibility.  Materials arising from our course are currently used at over 200 colleges and universities worldwide.<BR>
     6.  In recognition of my educational activities, I was named winner of 1995 Taylor L. Booth Award, given by the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society for outstanding contributions to computer science and engineering education.  I was<BR>
cited for continued contributions to the pedagogy and teaching of introductory computer science.<BR>
     7.  I comment from the perspective of someone who has been active in the teaching of university computer science. <BR>
          <B>COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARE A MEDIUM OF EXPRESSION</B><BR>
     8.  The notion that computer programs are a medium of expression is widespread throughout computer science education.  In particular, this notion is central to the approach to computer science used at MIT over the past fifteen years.  The idea appears prominently in the preface to our textbook:<BR>
     Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns.  First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology.  Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute....<BR>
<BR>
     <B>COMPUTER PROGRAMS EXPRESS IDEAS ABOUT METHODOLOGY</B><BR>
     9.  Just as ordinary mathematics and logic serve as a languages for expressing ideas about truth and falsehood (so-called "declarative knowledge"), computer programs serve as languages for expressing ideas about how to do things (so-called "imperative knowledge").  The following excerpt from a paper I wrote in 1990 expands on this point (from "Computation as a Framework for Engineering Education", in Research Directions in Computer Science: An MIT Perspective, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991):<BR>
     10.  "To illustrate the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge, consider the following definition of a square root:<BR>
          The square root of a number X is the number Y such that Y times Y equals X. <BR>
This is declarative knowledge.  It tells us something that is true about square roots.  But it doesn't tell us how to find a square root.   <BR>
            11.  "In contrast, consider the following ancient algorithm, attributed to Heron of <BR>
Alexandria, for approximating square roots.<BR>
          To approximate the square root of a positive number X<BR>
                - Make a guess for the square root of X.<BR>
                - Compute an improved guess as the average of the guess and X divided by the                              guess.<BR>
                - Keep improving the guess until it is good enough.<BR>
           12.  "Heron's method doesn't say anything about what square roots are, but it does say how to approximate them.  It is a piece of imperative "how to" knowledge.<BR>
           13.  "Computer Science is in the business of formalizing imperative knowledge -- developing formal notations and ways to reason and talk about methodology.  Here is Heron's method formalized as a procedure in the notation of the Lisp computer language:<BR>
          (define (sqrt x)<BR>
          (define (good-enough? guess)<BR>
                      (<(abs (- (square guess) x)) tolerance))<BR>
          (define (improve guess)<BR>
                     (average guess (/ x guess)))<BR>
          (define (try guess)<BR>
                    (if (good-enough? guess)<BR>
                  guess<BR>
                  (try (improve guess))))<BR>
               (try 1))<P>
     14.  "Certainly, if the only things we ever computed were square roots, then Computer Science would not be of much interest.  Similarly, if all one ever did in geometry was surveying, then geometry would not be of much interest.  In each case, the importance of having a formalism is that it provides a framework for controlling complexity, a way to think about ideas that are too involved to think about all at once.  The important techniques in Computer Science are the techniques for coping with methodological complexity."<BR>
<CENTER><B>EXPRESSIVE STYLE IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS</B><BR>
</CENTER>          15.  One indication that computer programs have major expressive elements is that teachers of programming regularly evaluate student programs on stylistic issues such as readability (by people) and appropriateness of choice of elements.  This is analogous to the way that teachers of writing evaluate student essays on the style and quality of writing, not just on the meanings of the words.<BR>
     16.  The criteria used in evaluating "programming style" are often unrelated to the sequence of operations that would be carried out by a computer in executing the program.  Two programs might evoke exactly the same process when executed by a computer, and yet be judged very differently, because they express the process in different ways.<BR>
           17.  As an example, the following excerpt from our textbook (2nd edition)<BR>
discusses a technique called "mapping over a list":<BR>
     MAP is an important construct, not only because it captures a common pattern, but because it establishes a higher level of abstraction in dealing with lists.  In the original definition of SCALE-LIST, the recursive structure of the program draws attention to the element-by-element processing of the list.  Defining SCALE-LIST in terms of MAP suppresses that level of detail and emphasizes that scaling transforms a list of elements to a list of results.  The difference between the two definitions is not that the computer is performing a different process (it isn't) but that we think about the process differently.<BR>
<BR>
     I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.<P>
<BR>

 ______________________________)                                      <BR>
     I, RICHARD M. STALLMAN, hereby declare:<BR>
          1.  I am currently the President of the Free Software<BR>
Foundation, located in Boston, Massachusetts.  I have been a computer programmer for over 25 years, starting at age 17.  I worked for the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab from 1971 to 1983, then resigned from that job to start the GNU project, which is now carried out by the Free Software Foundation.  Today I am an MIT research affiliate.<BR>
          2. In 1990 I was awarded the ACM Grace Hopper Award<BR>
for my development of the computer program Emacs in 1975.  There have since been over thirty imitations of Emacs, and some are widely used today for writing and editing programs, letters, books, electronic mail, and many other purposes.  I was also awarded a MacArthur Foundation prize fellowship in 1990.<BR>
          3.  As an experienced programmer, I often communicate<BR>
certain of my ideas in computer languages in order to be more precise about them--just as mathematicians express equations in mathematical notation and composers express music in musical notation.  Computer code is a precise notation for expressing ideas about how to carry out a task on a computer.<BR>
          4.  It is my opinion that software and computer<BR>
science development benefit substantially from the sharing of computer code among computer scientists and programmers.  This is because, as noted above, it permits ideas to be communicated with greater precision and clarity.  As a computer programmer, I can communicate using computer programming languages, within the range of what they can express, just as I would using human languages. <BR>
          5.  It is also possible to communicate in a mixture of a programming language and a human language, much as two bilingual people can communicate in a mixture of two human languages.  A mixture of computer code and human language is useful for expressing theories, problems and models precisely, in many fields ranging from engineering to economics.<BR>
          6.  In my experience, publication of ideas on the<BR>
Internet computer network is essentially equivalent to publishing them on paper, when working to develop computer science or develop software.  The Internet serves the same purpose for scientists and computer programmers as the paper journals do, except that it is faster, more efficient, and allows for direct feedback and conversation.<BR>
          7.  The best example of such communication is the<BR>
World Wide Web.  This method of communication and publication, which is becoming a major use of the Internet, is used for providing access to scientific papers, fiction, political position papers, store catalogs, and many other things, as well as computer software.<BR>
          8.  Another example of this is the GNU Project which I started in 1984.  This project, which is the major project of the Free Software Foundation, joins programmers located around the world in developing, testing, and improving a complete operating system and related programs.  Once the software is written, either by Free Software Foundation staff or by volunteers, it is published on the Internet as source code suitable for human programmers to study, learn from, and alter.  A wide community of users try it out, test it, expand it, fix it, and then share their experiences back to the group, including corrections and improvements in the source code.  In this way many people help make the software more powerful and reliable.<BR>
          9.  Indeed, some GNU programs, including the GNU C<BR>
compiler, are widely recognized as among the best available.  Just as the "marketplace of ideas" in science enables correct understanding to prevail, the marketplace of ideas in software development results in the development of better software.<BR>
          I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing <BR>
is true and correct.<BR>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><font color="#804040"><strong>
Who We Are ~</strong></font> American cotton growers fund their
company, Cotton Incorporated, through per bale assessments
collected by the Cotton Board, an agency responsible to the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Additionally, an
assessment is collected from importers of cotton, yarn, fabric,
and products containing cotton manufactured outside the U.S.
These funds are employed by Cotton Incorporated, under contract
with the Cotton Board. The Cotton Board is comprised of members
representing growers and importers. Cotton Incorporated is
designed and operated to build demand for cotton in the U.S.
market and for U.S. cotton in world markets. </p>

INCORPORATED SET TO LAUNCH<br>
FAR EAST DATABASE</font></a></h3>

<p>NEW YORK, December 22, 1995. <br>
The large export market for U.S. upland cotton fiber should be
getting even bigger. Cotton Incorporated is set to begin a
comprehensive project that will provide sourcing information on
apparel and home product manufacturers in the Far East -
excluding China, which will be added in years to come. </p>

<p>This database will become available on the Internet, CD-ROM
and in print during 1996. </p>

<p>The move, a joint effort between Cotton Incorporated and the
U.S. importer community,is geared toward providing specific
production and capacity information about the Asian
manufacturers, as well as identifying which companies use U.S.
upland cotton. </p>

<p>Based on a recent Cotton Incorporated survey among importers,
it was found that 94 percent believe that the source of raw
cotton affects fabric quality. Yet the survey also showed that
less than 3 percent of the respondents actually know or inquire
about the raw cotton source for their imported products. </p>

<p>&quot;Considering that importers can influence their
suppliers, the database appears to be a tremendous opportunity to
promote U.S. raw cotton,&quot; said J. Nicholas Hahn, president
and chief executive officer of Cotton Incorporated. &quot;As more
spinners and weavers supplying the Asian manufacturers see the
value, quality and consistency of U.S. cotton, they will demand
it. The database will strengthen the link between U.S. importers,
foreign suppliers and the use of U.S. upland cotton.&quot; </p>

<p>Exports of U.S. upland cotton in 1995 are estimated at 6.8
million bales. One bale of cotton weighs 480 pounds. </p>

<p>David Birnbaum of Third Horizon Ltd., a Hong Kong-based-
textile industry consultant is overseeing the database, which
will be updated continuously. </p>

<p>Lisa Helmer, senior director of importer programs at Cotton
Incorporated, said of the 20,000 or so Asian factories that will
be identified in the research directory, most will be apparel
manufacturers. </p>

<p>&quot;There are a slew of other categories, however, including
hosiery, home goods, dyers and printers, yarn- and piece-dyed
makers and denim suppliers,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated said a similar database may be implemented
to cover Central America and the Caribbean, although no timetable
has been set. </p>

<p>A cotton sourcing guide for Asia including spinners, weavers,
circular knitters, hosiery mills, home furnishings, piece dyers,
dyers and printers, cut and sew manufacturers and sweater
knitters. The information will be available late Spring beginning
with Taiwan, adding one country per month. Expect the countries
in the following order: </p>

<p>Taiwan, Hong Kong, Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Thailand, Korea and Malaysia. We anticipate India and
Pakistan to be completed the first quarter of 1997. Due to size,
we hope to have information on China the following year. </p>

name="long"><font color="#800000">Significant Long-Term Shifts in
Cotton Consumption</font></a></h3>

<p>Sluggish world economic growth and tight cotton supplies in
the last two crop years have kept the world&#146;s consumption of
cotton relatively flat since 1990 at about 86 million bales. This
level, forecast for 1995/96, represents essentially no change
from the level five years ago. </p>

<p>The flat world numbers mask the changes that have occurred in
the distribution of cotton spinning since 1990. Cotton
consumption in the Near East (Pakistan, India and Bangladesh) has
had the largest increase in volume, up 2.9 million bales. With
small domestic markets, the vast majority of this consumption
ultimately goes in the export market, mainly to Japan, the U.S.
and Western Europe. The United States spinning industry has had
the second largest growth, up 2.3 million bales. The increase is
the result of large gains in the consumer market which have
allowed for gains for the domestic industry and the imports of
cotton textiles and apparel. Southeast Asia (ASEAN region plus
Vietnam) has increased 1.1 million bales - the only raw cotton
importing region which has grown over this time span. Turkey has
increased 1.3 million bales since 1990. </p>

<p>The largest decline since 1990 occurred in the former USSR
where consumption fell 5.4 million bales; a 64 percent drop in
just five years. The industrial Far East (Japan, Korea, Taiwan
and Hong Kong) has declined 2.4 million bales, reflecting the
loss of spinning operations to low-wage countries like China,
Pakistan and India. Since 1990, consumption in Eastern Europe and
Western Europe has declined by about 400,000 bales each. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> <font color="#800000"><strong>Research
~</strong></font> The drive to building cotton's share of the
domestic textile market is fueled by research. The development of
innovative apparel and home fabric concepts often leads to
significant consumption increases in new areas as demonstrated by
the phenomenal success of 100% cotton wrinkle-resistant apparel.
But product development is just part of the equation. Increases
in consumption are also based on enhancing the cost-effectiveness
of cotton textile production and in quality improvements. Here,
research provides a full spectrum of services from fiber
processing software programs to reaching new horizons in the
science of quality measurements. This effort begins on the farm
with a host of initiatives addressing advancements in growing,
harvesting, and ginning. Technical service calls and information
service reports on the quality of the U.S. crop provide an
important incentive to mills worldwide who are customers or
potential customers of our cotton.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><font color="#804040"><strong>
Who We Are ~</strong></font> American cotton growers fund their
company, Cotton Incorporated, through per bale assessments
collected by the Cotton Board, an agency responsible to the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Additionally, an
assessment is collected from importers of cotton, yarn, fabric,
and products containing cotton manufactured outside the U.S.
These funds are employed by Cotton Incorporated, under contract
with the Cotton Board. The Cotton Board is comprised of members
representing growers and importers. Cotton Incorporated is
designed and operated to build demand for cotton in the U.S.
market and for U.S. cotton in world markets. </p>

        <td valign="top">Cotton Incorporated is committed to
        building a future for world cotton.
        <p>With headquarters in New York City and eight other <a
        href="OFFICE.HTM">offices</a> throughout the world,
        Cotton Incorporated is a research and promotion company
        funded by U.S. cotton producers and importers of cotton
        goods into the United States. </p>
        <p>Now in its 25th year of operations, Cotton
        Incorporated is the originator and owner of the
        well-known <a href="HISTORY.HTM#Seal">Cotton Seal
        trademark</a> which is licensed to manufacturers,
        retailers and importers for use on 100% cotton products.
        Today the Cotton Seal is recognized by more than 7 out of
        every 10 Americans. </p>
        <p>Our television advertising campaign, THE FABRIC OF OUR
        LIVES&#153;, is also highly regarded and well-known to
        American consumers. Developed to increase consumer
        awareness and demand for cotton products, this
        advertising has been instrumental in motivating consumers
        to buy cotton. In just the past decade, cotton's share of
        the U.S. retail market of apparel and home furnishings
        products (other than carpeting) has risen by 35 percent
        to a modern era high of 57.8 percent. </p>
        <p>Through our Raleigh Research Center in North Carolina,
        we are intent upon improving the fiber itself and all
        products that can be made from it. The company is active
        in fabric and finish development, fiber quality and
        processing research and agricultural research, providing
        on-going insights, innovations, information and
        problem-solving assistance to mills, manufacturers,
        designers, producers and importers. </p>
        <p>Cotton Incorporated is a prime source for all
        information regarding U.S. Upland cotton. In addition to
        disseminating information through our nine offices
        worldwide, our technical, economic and fashion
        representatives travel extensively supplying services and
        information to textile mills, manufacturers, designers,
        retailers and the press regarding fashion forecast
        information, agricultural developments, new product
        introductions and technical advancements. We are also
        active as publishers of information of value to users of
        cotton. And, now, with the commercial expansion of the
        Internet, we are embracing this new technology as another
        means of assisting users of cotton fiber. </p>

In 1960, cotton apparel and home fabrics accounted for about 78
percent of all textile products sold at retail. By 1975, that
share had plummeted to an all-time low of 34 percent, threatening
cotton with extinction as a viable commercial commodity. The
reason for this dramatic shift was polyester, a synthetic fiber
designed to offer the consumer an artificial cotton substitute.
Much of polyester's success had as much to do with it being the
right product at the right time -- an easy care alternative for a
push-button society. </p>

<p>In the past, cotton producers would end their involvement with
a crop at point of sale, confident in the market's ability to
consume cotton. But this new competition from man-made fiber
producers presented a major disadvantage for cotton in that
polyester was being aggressively marketed and merchandised at
every point throughout the pipeline: from mills and manufacturers
to retailers and consumers. Such producers as DuPont and Celanese
were committed to cultivating demand for their product through
promotions and technical service assistance. The U.S. cotton
industry, however, had no such system available to support its
markets and build demand. </p>

<p>Realizing the serious erosion in cotton's consumer market that
was underway, producers in the High Plains of Texas called for a
collective national marketing and research effort. With support
from regional producer organizations, growers were successful in
petitioning Congress into passing the Research and Promotion Act
of 1966. The act established a funding mechanism, based on
producer assessments, for the purpose of conducting a widescale
effort to recapture cotton's market. Existence of this
organization led ultimately to the creation in 1970 of Cotton
Incorporated. </p>

<p><a name="Seal"><font color="#804040"><strong>The Story of the
Cotton Seal</strong></font></a><strong><br>
</strong><img src="images/COTLOGO.gif" align="left" hspace="10"
width="157" height="111"><a href="#top"><font color="#804040"><strong><img
src="images/upa.gif" border="0" width="15" height="11"></strong></font></a>
In its inaugural year the company faced a steadily declining
market share, with little product available at retail except for
denim jeans, T-shirts and bath towels. In addition, consumers had
become increasingly enamored of the ease-of-care synthetic
products and textile mills had nearly abandoned the production of
cotton goods.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Cotton Incorporated adopted a
&quot;push/pull&quot; marketing strategy. The objective was to
&quot;push&quot; cotton textile innovations into the market
through product and process development, while building consumer
demand, or a &quot;pull&quot;, through advertising and promotion.
To key this approach, a focal point was needed that could serve
as the basis of advertisements, produce an identity for cotton,
attract instant attention at retail and at one glance communicate
comfort and quality. <font color="#804040">Thus was born the Seal
of Cotton</font>.</p>

<p>Unveiled in 1973, the Seal's function was to provide a branded
identification, allowing consumers to readily identify textile
products containing cotton. Through point-of-purchase signage,
the Seal simplified locating cotton apparel and home fabrics
within a retail setting.</p>

<p>Network television advertising was enlisted to promote the
Seal, build an image and create demand. As the only medium that
could cost-effectively reach millions of consumers, television
delivered national impact. Research showed that women aged 18-49
purchased about 70 percent of all textile items, and advertising
buys were positioned accordingly. Commercial messages were
concentrated on morning new shows, daytime soap operas and other
programming reaching cotton's target audience. </p>

<p>After one full year of advertising, in 1974, consumer
awareness of the Seal and what it represented hit 18 percent.
While advertising would continue to raise consumer awareness, it
could not spur purchases if no viable consumer product existed.
The man-made fiber industry had achieved tremendous success with
ease-of-care, no-iron products. For cotton to compete, it would
have to offer the consumer apparel and home fabric products that
featured similar characteristics.</p>

<p>Work to find a cotton-polyester blend that offered performance
and comfort was underway in USDA and Cotton Incorporated research
laboratories, culminating in the development of fabrics made from
60 percent cotton and 40 percent polyester. Under the name
NATURAL BLENDÆ, these fabrics were introduced by Springs
Industries in 1974 and reached retail with the ushering-in of
cotton-rich product by Manhattan Shirts in 1975. </p>

<p><a name="comeback"><font color="#804040"><strong>The Cotton
Comeback</strong></font></a><a href="#index"
name="The Cotton Comeback"><br>
</a><a href="#top"><font color="#804040"><strong><img
src="images/upa.gif" border="0" width="15" height="11"></strong></font></a>
But while the decline in cotton's market share was slowing, it
would still continue to drop until 1975, bottoming out at 34
percent. Underscoring the severity of the cotton industry's
problems were three key issues: man-made fibers still dominated
at retail and there was very little cotton available to
consumers, even if they wanted it; consumers, for the most part,
were still partial to the wash-and-wear man-made fiber products,
and textile mills had de-emphasized production of cotton fabrics.
But seemingly far-removed from Seventh Avenue and the textile
industry, the tide was beginning to turn. Post-World War II
America was seeing the rise of a large youth group. Diametrically
opposed to mainstream U.S.A. -- from political philosophy to
style of dress -- this group, later known as the Baby Boomers,
was literally growing up in 100 percent cotton denim jeans and
T-shirts.</p>

<p>As the boomers became a more integral part of the economy,
they began to proclaim a tremendous preference for natural
things. Realizing this, Cotton Incorporated actively courted
them. The cumulative effect of advertising also began to show
strong, positive results. In one year alone, from 1975 to 1976,
consumer recognition of the Seal jumped from 35 percent to 46
percent. Meanwhile, NATURAL BLENDÆ fabrics grew in popularity.<br>
Montgomery Ward introduced a cotton-rich shirt in 1976. Similar
products were introduced by Sears and J.C. Penney in 1977. Cannon
introduced the first NATURAL BLENDÆ sheet in 1977 and switched
its &quot;Royal Classic&quot; towel line from blends to 100
percent cotton. WestPoint Pepperell followed suit, moving to 100
percent cotton in three of its towel collections.</p>

<p>Upward momentum for cotton continued to build and man-made
fiber producers took notice. In an effort to capture cotton's
single largest market and the only product category that had
survived the polyester blitz -- denim jeans -- a man-made fiber
producer contracted with a major mill and apparel manufacturer to
produce a blended denim jean. Cotton Incorporated responded
quickly with a $1 million advertising campaign to aid at
point-of-sale, touting the advantages of 100 percent cotton denim
jeans. In less than one month, about 9 million self-adhesive tags
were placed on denim jeans, telling customers: &quot;If it isn't
100 percent cotton, it isn't real denim.&quot;</p>

<p>Retailers and manufacturers lent their support to the campaign
and a blended denim jean never materialized. As better quality
products began to surface at retail, Cotton Incorporated adopted
a competitive positioning in its advertising, &quot;Once you get
a feel for cotton, you won't feel like anything else,&quot; to
entice consumers back to the comfort of cotton. Cotton's upward
momentum continued to build. In 1980 Fieldcrest and Sears offered
NATURAL BLENDÆ sheets and, even more significant, J.P. Stevens
began to produce 100 percent cotton, no-iron sheets. </p>

<p><a name="performance"><font color="#804040"><strong>True
Performance National Campaign</strong></font></a><br>
<a href="#top"><font color="#804040"><strong><img
src="images/upa.gif" border="0" width="15" height="11"></strong></font></a>
By 1983 cotton had registered significant market share gains.
Cotton's share of the total textile market climbed five
percentage points to 39 percent, while Cotton Seal recognition
soared to 63 percent. At the same time consumers were growing
disenchanted with performance problems related to man-made
fibers. In 1984 Cotton Incorporated conducted a nationwide survey
to document consumers' experience with clothing made with those
fibers. Frequent problems cited by consumers included pilling,
snagging, odor retention and an inability for many synthetic
fabrics to wash clean.</p>

<p>Based on that survey, a major national campaign was launched
under the banner, &quot;True Performance&quot;. This program was
an effort to re-educate consumers about the performance of cotton
fabrics. The system provided a convenient check-list at retail,
allowing consumers to identify the performance attributes of
apparel made from cotton. Within two years after its
introduction, many major manufacturers were active participants
in the True Performance promotion.</p>

<p>By 1987 cotton had once again regained its position as the
dominant fiber in the textile industry. Market share climbed to
49 percent. Seal Awareness had grown to 71 percent and mill
consumption of U.S. upland cotton reached levels not seen in 15
years.</p>

<p>Once pegged as a warm weather fiber, cotton was now being sold
for the fall and winter seasons, and denim, previously viewed
solely as a utilitarian fabric, was enjoying strong sales as a
fashion fabric. Cotton was also gaining in such underdeveloped
categories as nonwovens -- personal hygiene products and diapers,
and in decorative items -- window and wall coverings and
upholstery fabrics. </p>

<p><a name="fabric"><font color="#804040"><strong>Fabric of Our
Lives</strong><sup><strong>&trade;</strong></sup><strong>
Advertising Campaign</strong></font></a><br>
<a href="#top"><font color="#804040"><strong><img
src="images/upa.gif" border="0" width="15" height="11"></strong></font></a>
On Thanksgiving Day 1989, a bold advertising campaign was
introduced that portrayed cotton as an integral part of the
American experience. &quot;The Fabric of Our Lives(TM)&quot; was
a ground-breaking marketing strategy. Featuring real people in
everyday situations, and against a musical background featuring
singer-songwriter Richie Havens, the commercials utilized a
series of vignettes subtly depicting how cotton is involved in
the day-to-day rituals of American life. Widely acclaimed for its
innovative treatment, the campaign has won several awards for
excellence in advertising, including a Clio. Since that time two
new generations of &quot;Fabric of Our Lives(TM)&quot; campaigns
have been launched, still focusing on the traditional values of
optimism, sincerity and honesty.</p>

<p>In an effort to extend the impact of the highly regarded
&quot;Fabric of Our Lives(TM)&quot; theme, in 1994 Cotton
Incorporated launched its first interactive consumer promotion, a
photo contest in the pages of Reader's Digest magazine. That push
reached more than 50 million readers and generated more than
55,000 photo entrees, all showing how cotton fits in with
people's everyday lives. About 500,000 people voted for the
winners.</p>

<p>Today, Cotton Seal awareness stands at 73 percent, making it
one of the most widely recognized trademarks in the U.S. </p>

<p><a name="womens"><font color="#804040"><strong>Women's Wear</strong></font><strong><br>

Representing one of Cotton Incorporated's important target
markets is women's wear. Through sponsorship of runway
presentations and more recently, supporting 12 women's apparel
designers at the Women's Wear Daily/Magic International show at
Las Vegas, Cotton Incorporated is aggressively working to further
entrench cotton as the key fiber in women's apparel. By
continuing to work to our partners -- cotton growers, textile
mills, designers, apparel and home product manufacturers and
retailers -- Cotton Incorporated is ensuring that cotton will
continue to be the dominant fiber moving into the 21st Century. </p>

At its state-of-the-art research facility at Raleigh, NC, which
was updated and modernized in 1994, Cotton Incorporated has led
the way in fiber and agricultural research. Cotton Incorporated
has become heavily involved in fabric research, including working
to develop better knitted, woven and nonwoven applications that
call for cotton; on-site technical assistance to mills and
manufacturers; yarn spinning research, and crop improvement.</p>

<p>As a result of that commitment, Cotton Incorporated in 1993
was selected to become a member of AMTEX&trade;, a research
program supported by the Department of Energy and carried out at
10 national laboratories. It's goal is to undertake cooperative
research aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the domestic
textile industry. The analytical chemistry lab has also been
upgraded, and is engaged in several identification, improvement
and trouble-shooting projects.<br>
It was through Cotton Incorporated's facilities that in 1994 the
company helped Lee's Carpets, a division of Burlington
Industries, develop the first 100 percent cotton area rug. </p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated was also instrumental in developing and
refining the technology that allows for wrinkle-resistant 100
percent cotton garments. Through creation of a resinating
finishing process, the wrinkle-resistant products offer a full
range of benefits -- comfort, durability and performance. In 1995
many major slack manufacturers were offering wrinkle-resistant
products and it has started to make some inroads into the women's
wear market as well. </p>

On the international front, Cotton Incorporated has established <a
href="office.htm">offices</a> in Basel, Switzerland; Osaka,
Japan; Singapore, and Mexico City. Through the international
division, opened in 1973, the operation is engaged in supporting
mills that purchase U.S. cotton from around the world.
Additionally, Cotton Incorporated, in conjunction with the import
community, is in the midst of creating a database that will
provide sourcing information on apparel and home product
manufacturers who use cotton in nine Asian textile exporting
countries -- excluding China, which will eventually be added. The
data will become available on the Internet, CD-ROM and in print
during 1996. Cotton Incorporated is also set to service the U.S.
market from its offices in New York, Raleigh, Los Angeles and
Dallas. </p>

COTTON INCORPORATED'S MARKETING SERVICES DEPARTMENT</strong></font><font

1996 -- Effective immediately, the duties of Ira B. Livingston,
Cotton Incorporated's senior vice president, marketing
implementation, are being expanded.</p>

<p>In addition to his current responsibility of supervising U.S.
marketing, which consists of the company's marketing and retail implementation
efforts, Livingston will now oversee marketing services, the
coordinated effort between Cotton Incorporated's advertising and
public relations departments.</p>

<p>Livingston will retain his current title and continue to
report to J. Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive officer
of the company. </p>

<p>Ric Hendee, senior director, marketing services, will continue
to oversee the day-to-day operations of Cotton Incorporated's marketing
services department. He will report to Livingston.</p>

<p>``Ira has played an integral role in furthering cotton's
presence in the apparel and home fabrics markets,'' said Hahn.
``As Cotton Incorporated looks to broaden its reach in such
potential categories for growth as area rugs and carpeting, nonwovens,
women's wear and youth markets, Ira's knowledge of the company,
as well as his industry expertise, will provide invaluable
leadership to these initiatives.'' </p>

<p>Livingston, who joined Cotton Incorporated in 1975, was most
recently vice president, U.S. marketing. In addition, he has served
as vice president of international marketing, in charge of Cotton
Incorporated's offices in Europe and Japan. Livingston has also
been both manager and director of Cotton Incorporated's European
marketing efforts.</p>

<p>A graduate of Philadelphia School of Textiles and Science with
a B.S. in textile chemistry, Livingston resides in Westport, Conn.,
with his wife Cynthia.</p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated is the research and promotion company
representing upland cotton, the number one selling fiber in the world.</p>

elegance, in a warm color palette. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The cotton fabrics we&#146;ve uncovered for this season
are extremely creative and versatile compared to previous
seasons,&quot; said Jo Cohen, manager, THE COTTONWORKS<font
size="2"><sup>Æ</sup></font> Fabric Library. &quot;They define
the solution to the eternal puzzle -- what to wear -- because
there is so much to choose, from casual to formal
fabrics.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This season&#146;s presentation, &quot;Unlock the
Solution,&quot; is the culmination of extensive research
conducted throughout Europe, and focuses on cotton as the
&quot;key that unlocks the solution to apparel dilemmas,&quot;
said Cohen. </p>

<p>THE COTTONWORKS<font size="2"><sup>Æ</sup></font> Fabric
Library presentation, held four times a year, provides seasonal
color, fabric and trend/silhouette direction to designers,
manufacturers and retailers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Colors: Warm and Seasonal</b><b><u><br>
</u></b>THE COTTONWORKS<font size="2"><sup>Æ</sup></font> Fabric
Library tracks color trends through the 10,000 manufacturers,
retailers and designers who utilize the Library. The Library has
indicated 10 important colors for the Fall/Winter season -- peat,
clover, tapestry, portrait, bittersweet, creeping ivy, kelp,
tobacco, bramble and patina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, Indian ink and puddle will also be apparent in
men&#146;s wear and children&#146;s wear. Pansy and fern have
been added to the children&#146;s wear palette, while sepia and
pepperberry appear in the accessories palette. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Solution is Cotton Fabrics</b><b><u><br>
</u></b>The Fall/Winter 1997/98 presentation focuses on three
apparel fabric trends: <strong>Generations, Indulgence and
Define.</strong> &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>Generations</strong> trend is characterized by
traditional, functional garb with new possibilities. These are
the fabrics-of-choice for a new casual lifestyle and appear in
two opposite families: washed/authentic and rustic/urbane. The
group&#146;s fabrics are enhanced by comfort emerging from
soothing and stable elements.</p>

<p>The key fabrics in this segment are denim, calvary twills,
quilted denim, chambray, wide wale corduroy, canvas, flannel,
cable knits, pointelle ribs, fleece (chunky knits), sherpa,
sheered terry and cotton stretch interlock. Prints and patterns
are highlighted by simple calicos, country checks, feed stripes,
tartan plaids, stripes, patchwork and provincial motifs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Generations </strong>is a reliable trend
comprised of fabrics that make everyone feel at ease,&quot; said
Cohen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Indulgence</strong><u> </u>marks the resurgence of
extravagance and luxury, with an emphasis on romanticism. Formal
wear fabrics are regal and majestic, with touches of sheer
elegance and debonair qualities adorned with frills, ornaments
and exotic coatings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fabrics illustrating the <strong>Indulgence</strong> trend
include lace, solid and printed velvets, brocade, damask,
iridescent shirting, burnout velour, matelasse, cotton rich
stretch twill and polyurethane and rubber coated fabrics. Among
the featured patterns and prints for this group are printed lace,
jacquards, flock prints, burnouts, baroque and rococo influences,
bold graphics, Asian medallions, flame stitches and leaf and vine
etchings. In this trend, traditional home furnishing fabrics
transform themselves into rich and luxurious apparel fabric
options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Cohen, the <strong>Indulgence</strong> trend is a
very exciting group of luxury fabrics and novel coatings -- a
brand new look for cotton fabrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last trend, <strong>Define</strong><u>,</u> signifies the
birth of a new classic and adapts a fresh approach to a modern
concept of highly-refined and uncomplicated comfort. This trend
takes career wear and school wear beyond the conventional,
creating a look of distinction and ease.</p>

<p><u>Define </u>features fabrics in basket weaves, tweeds,
cotton-rich double knits, gabardines, herringbones, chevrons,
pinwale corduroy, cotton stretch broadcloth, peach twills, poplin
and matte crepes. Prints and patterns for this trend spotlight paisleys,
argyles, houndstooth, dogstooth, windowpane, refined plaids and
checks, ombre effects, chalk stripes and engineered
stripes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;People still desire to look tailored, professional and
sophisticated, however, they will no longer sacrifice
comfort,&quot; explained Cohen. &quot;The cotton fabrics that
illustrate this trend have that simple polished look, with a very
comfortable hand.&quot; &nbsp;</p>

&#147;GOLD CHAMPIONSHIP&#148;<br>
</strong></font></a>NEW YORK, Nov. 18, 1996 -- Continuing its
push to increase consumer awareness of cotton, Cotton
Incorporated will be the entitlement sponsor of a live,
nationally-televised skating competition, ``The Cotton
Incorporated Gold Championship.''</p>

<p>The two-hour special television event, underscoring Cotton
Incorporated's long-term commitment to figure skating, will be broadcast
live from Halifax, Nova Scotia, at 9 p.m., Saturday, Nov. 23, on
NBC-TV.</p>

<p>The program features three Olympic Gold Medalists in the Men's
competition; three in the Ladies'.</p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated will air seven of its ``The Fabric of Our
Lives<font face="Symbol">‘</font>'' television commercials, as
well as three billboards, throughout the event. Cotton
Incorporated is spending in excess of $1 million for its
entitlement sponsorship.</p>

<p>Olympic gold medal skaters scheduled to participate are Brian
Boitano (who captured gold in 1988), Scott Hamilton (1984), Victor
Petrenko (1992), Oksana Baiul (1994), Katarina Witt (1984 &amp;
1988) and Kristi Yamaguchi (1992).</p>

<p>Under the rules of the competition, each skater will perform
two programs -- one technical, the other artistic -- each comprising
50 percent of the final score. Head-to-head competition will be
held in both the Men's and Women's events, and will be judged by
a panel of international judges.</p>

<p>``This type of exciting programming is compatible with the
image Cotton Incorporated projects for cotton products,'' said J. Nicholas
Hahn, president and chief executive officer of Cotton
Incorporated, who noted that figure skating attracts a large female
audience, the firm's key target audience. </p>

<p>``The Gold Championship also gives Cotton Incorporated an
opportunity to dominate two continuous hours of television during
one of the most important months of the prime-time season,'' Hahn
said.</p>

<p>While the program marks the third time that Cotton
Incorporated has been the name sponsor of a major figure skating
event, The Gold Championship is the first one to be broadcast
live. In November 1995, ABC-TV aired ``Cotton Incorporated Skates
of Gold III,'' while in February, NBC presented ``The Cotton
Incorporated Ultimate Four.''</p>

<p>As part of the evening's festivities, there will be a special
exhibition from two-time Olympic Bronze Medalists Isabelle
Brasser and Lloyd Eisler.</p>

color="#804000" size="2"><strong>WARMTH AND TEXTURE HIGHLIGHT
COTTON INCORPORATED'S SPRING/SUMMER 1998 APPAREL SELLING IDEAS</strong></font></a><br>
NEW YORK, Nov. 18 1996 -- Spring/Summer 1998 will be highlighted
by luxurious, rich, textural fabrications, as well as warm,
comfortable colors.</p>

<p>``This season will provide creativity and versatility to the
consumer,'' said Suzanne Achtemeier, Cotton Incorporated's director,
fashion marketing, apparel at the company's Apparel Selling Ideas
presentation. ``Yet there is one constant that has remained
through the years -- the desire for comfort and fashion.''</p>

<p>Apparel Selling Ideas, held twice a year, provides seasonal
color, fabric and trend direction to mills, knitters and
converters. Research for the presentation was conducted in Europe
and the Far East.</p>

<p>While the trend toward casual dressing continues, based on the
latest findings from the Lifestyle Monitor<font face="Symbol">‘</font>,
Cotton Incorporated's ongoing study on consumer behavior and
attitudes, people are taking more of an interest in fashion. When asked
about their typical (more) new clothing purchases, nearly 56
percent said they are buying new and different apparel as opposed
to replacing current styles. That's up from 52 percent in 1995.</p>

<p>Many more consumers said they are also buying the latest
clothing styles at the beginning of the season -- 35 percent in
1996 versus 27 percent in 1995 -- rather than waiting for sales
at the end of the season.</p>

<p>``Whether it is for a casual shirt or an upscale skirt or pair
of pants, fashion is still important,'' Achtemeier said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>COLOR </b>The seasonal colors are represented by a
palette that has moved from predominantly cool colors to warm, seasonal
ones. The five color groups are Poolside, Spa, Reef, Ruins and
Cafe.</p>

<p><b>POOLSIDE</b> is inspired by happy, splashy brights.
However, they are sundrenched -not baked. Pinks and corals, two
key colors, are joined by citrus orange. The season is also
illustrated by mixing blues, especially soft aqua with a
punched-up turquoise.</p>

<p><b>SPA</b> reflects the space between the sea and sky;
meditative, therapeutic, aquatic colors. There is a mixing of
brights, midtones, darks and pales. Light, mineral purple and
rich fountain purple are key colors. Blue is probably the most
important family, and is mixed in different casts and hues.</p>

<p><b>REEF</b> is cheerful; never dull or discordant. It is
characterized by a mixture of hot, passionate, robust reds --
synonymous with love and romance -- and Chinese culture, luck and
happiness. Coral and mollusks are extensions of the important
brick and terra-cotta colors, but are now more peach-like. Greens
in the group are clean, clear and </p>

<p>austere, while gray is a key color for women's wear,
especially when worked with blues and purples.</p>

<p><b>RUINS</b> bring the old world into the new. Golds and blues
are important, especially in women's wear. Brown, less reddened and
more mellow, is a staple, an accepted alternative to black and
navy.</p>

<p><b>CAFE</b> is inspired by a warm, comforting and naturally
harmonious color environment. One key trend in this group is a
mixing of pales and neutrals, as well as the continuation of warm
beiges, which are more peachy in tone. Complementary colors in the
group are mocha and bright lemon.</p>

<p><b>FABRIC </b>The fabric presentation highlights the
importance of cotton's relationship with fashion in five distinct
trends-- Poetry, Beyond the Blues, Pure-N-Simple, The Next Wave
and Hi-Energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>POETRY</b> combines the feeling of lightness with sheers,
laces and cobweb knits and such heavy fabrics as damask, ottomans and
pucker fabrics. Prints are important in this group, especially
when printed on laces or sheers.</p>

<p><b>BEYOND THE BLUES</b> takes a look at denim jeans and
beyond. For the season, denim is dark -- often unwashed -- stiff and
authentic. Such combination weaves as plain/oxford and
basket/twill are popular. Reflective taping, drawstring waists, pocket
detailing and decorative buttons are among the treatments being
offered to consumers.</p>

<p><b>PURE-N-SIMPLE</b> is characterized by clean weaves, rustic
effects and even textures simulating raffia, rattan mats and nubby,
bark-like textures. Honeycombs, slubbed canvas, seersucker and
yarn-dye checks are also prominent in this group.</p>

<p><b>THE NEXT WAVE</b> features dynamic, retro-type fabrics with
many optical effects. The group is inspired by alternative music,
the underground fashion world of London and street fashion.
Patterns are important as are space dyes and irregular, blotchy
dye techniques.</p>

<p><b>HI-ENERGY</b> is comprised of hi-tech fabrics for athletic
wear, as well as fabrics for sportswear reinterpretation.
Stretch, compact knits, along with french terry knits and coated
fabrics are key for the season.</p>

recognition of his career achievements, charitable activities and
outstanding record of public service, J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton
Incorporated&#146;s president and chief executive officer, was
inducted into the Apparel Industry Hall of Fame at a ceremony on
November 13, in New York City.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Hall of Fame induction ceremony was part of
the 1996 American Image Awards, one of the fashion
industry&#146;s prominent annual events. The reception and
dinner, sponsored by The Fashion Association, benefits the
Clothing Bank/New York Clothes for the Homeless and was held at
New York&#146;s Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mr. Hahn, who has been Cotton

Rockey, president of Levi Strauss North America.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It&#146;s a thrill and an honor to be
recognized by your peers in any endeavor,&quot; said Mr. Hahn.
&quot;To be sharing the award with Nichols and Rockey, men of
such high-caliber who have made tremendous contributions to our
industry, is one of the highlights for me. This honor may
recognize my accomplishments, but, more importantly, speaks
volumes for the successful direction that Cotton Incorporated

consumer awareness of the trademarked Seal of Cotton. Established
in 1973, the Seal of Cotton is the foundation of all Cotton
Incorporated marketing programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Seal tells consumers an item is made of 100
percent cotton and helps bring to mind the important quality
benefits of cotton products; that 100 percent cotton is natural,
comfortable, soft, durable, breathable, practical and
fashionable.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Seal of Cotton, recognized by 75 percent of
all consumers, is currently displayed on more than two billion

FOR THE HOME</font></h5>

<p>NEW YORK, July 25, 1996 -- In its ongoing effort to create new
product ideas for the home fabrics market, Cotton Incorporated
has developed 19 100 percent cotton fabrics, many of which should
appear in manufacturers' lines next year. The 100 percent cotton
fabrics were created by Cotton Incorporated's fabric development
team at its Raleigh, N.C., Research Center, under the direction
of Eike Heymer, the firm's director, fabric development and
research implementation. Cotton Incorporated has been developing
new home fabrics for the past 25 years. Among some of the fabric
innovations from Cotton Incorporated in 1996 include a
double-sided terry dyed with pigments and enzyme washed; a
tightly constructed honeycomb weave, one that produces a stable,
textured upholstery; a dobby weave throw, and a novel bedford cord. </p>

<p>``Home fabrics are a key part of Cotton Incorporated's
research, development and marketing thrust,'' said J. Nicholas
Hahn, president and chief executive officer. ``New textures,
constructions and finishes -- as well as its comfort and quality
-- will help keep cotton the leader in home fabrics at retail.''
Cotton's current share of the home fabrics market, on a fabric
weight basis, is 60 percent, according to The NPD Group. </p>

<p>In addition, based on second quarter findings from Cotton
Incorporated's <em>Lifestyle Monitor</em>&trade;, consumers are
taking a more color coordinated or formal approach when
decorating their homes; 52.6 percent said their home was color coordinated/somewhat
casual in this year's quarter versus 46 percent a year ago, while
10.8 percent said their home was more formal, versus 7.1 percent
last year. </p>

<p>Those who said their homes were mixed casual, or an eclectic
mix of furnishings, dropped to 35.4 percent in the second quarter,
versus 45.7 percent last year. Moreover, of the consumers who
were asked if they were to redecorate their home, 59.8 percent
said they would color coordinate or incorporate somewhat casual
furnishings. That's up from 51.3 percent last year. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, 18.3 percent said this year that they would
decorate more formally, versus 16 percent in the 1995 quarter. Consumers
said they were less inclined this year, 21.3 percent, to
redecorate their homes in a mixed casual style than last year,
31.2 percent. The Monitor also found that a growing number of
consumers said they are planning changes in their home fabrics,
38 percent this year, versus 36.8 percent last year. ``This
movement toward color coordinated or more formal styles for the
home, as well as people's plans to change their home fabrics
heightens the need for new, upscale fabrics,'' said Hahn. </p>

<p>``We've gone out and talked to people in the market, getting
their input on types of things their customers are looking for,
and put those ideas into actual fabrics,'' said Kristie Rhodes,
Cotton Incorporated's manager, fabric designing, who noted the current
crop of fabrics represent the culmination of a year's effort.
``Mills and manufactures can see what these fabrics look like and
how they perform. This gives them a leg up when deciding on next
year's offerings.'' </p>

number one fiber of choice around the world,&quot; said Ira
Livingston, Cotton Incorporated's senior vice president,
marketing implementation, who noted that about 50 percent of the
fiber consumed worldwide is cotton. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the U.S., cotton holds a 58 percent share of the
retail market, up from 56 percent last year. This represents the
highest level in more than a quarter century, and continues the
streak of 16 years of consecutive market share growth. </p>

INCORPORATED CELEBRATES MEXICO CITY OFFICE OPENING</font></a></h5>

<p>MEXICO CITY, March 28, 1996 -- <em>Cotton Incorporated is
committed to Mexico</em>. <br>
In a move that further solidifies its long-term partnership with
the Mexican and Latin American textile, apparel, home furnishings
and retail markets, Cotton Incorporated today cut the ribbon on
its new office here. <br>
<br>
Headed by Gerardo Lastiri, Cotton Incorporated's director,
international marketing/Mexico, the office is at Av. Insurgentes Sur
1605, Piso 9, Modulo C, Col. San Jose Insurgentes 03900, Mexico
D.F. The telephone number is 525-663-4020. <br>
<br>
While the office may be new, Cotton Incorporated's presence in
Mexico is not; the company has been a vital research, promotion
and marketing entity in the Mexican market since February 1993. <br>
<br>
From its site here, Cotton Incorporated will continue to offer
its full range of technical, information, market and fashion services
to those Mexican and Latin American mills, manufacturers and
retailers that use primarily U. S.-grown cotton or feature
textile products made mainly from U. S. cotton. <br>
<br>
&quot;Establishing a true presence in Mexico represents a key
expansion move in our 23-year-old international division,&quot;
said Dean Turner, vice president, international marketing. Cotton
Incorporated's other international division offices are in Basel, Switzerland;
Osaka, Japan, and Singapore. <br>
<br>
&quot;We intend to share with our Mexican partners the same
after-sale, value- added techniques and strategies that have
helped increase cotton's market share in the U.S.,&quot; Turner
added. &quot;We feel this underscores our overall effort to
assist these important firms in building a strong future for 100
percent cotton textile products.&quot; <br>
<br>
Among the key technical services offered by Cotton Incorporated's
Mexico City staff aimed at assisting the industry are spinning,
fabrication and dyeing and finishing -- leading to new fabric
developments. Products such as wrinkle-resistant finishes on 100
percent cotton slack fabrics are a direct result of Cotton
Incorporated research. <br>
<br>
Information on such vital business factors as local and world
economic developments, international crop analyses, fiber supply
and consumer demand are also available through Mr. Lastiri and
his staff of Mexican nationals. <br>
<br>
On the fashion front, Cotton Incorporated is keeping the industry
up-to date on the latest styles, offering fashion presentations,
trend forecasting and information on new developments in color,
fabric and silhouette. The Mexico City office has a complete
COTTONWORKS&trade; Fabric Library, showcasing cotton fabrics from
more than 300 mills, knitters and converters. The library serves
as a one-stop resource center for retailers, designers and
manufactures in the fashion industry. <br>
<br>
The opening of the Mexico City office coincides with a new
execution of Cotton Incorporated's consumer advertising campaign,
first launched in Mexico in September 1994. The newest phase,
themed, &quot;If it Has This Seal, It is 100 percent Cotton,&quot;
is an educational approach created to encourage the Mexican
consumer to identify the Seal with 100 percent cotton products at
retail. Currently, the Seal of Cotton is being licensed with
Mexican mills, manufacturers and retailers for use on 100 percent
cotton products to be sold within the countries comprising the
North American Free Trade Agreement. In addition, U. S. or
Canadian products exported to Mexico may also contain the Seal. <br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated's involvement in Mexico also includes its
primary sponsorship of ExpoTela, held at Mexico City's World
Trade Center, which is slated for April 23-25. <br>
<br>
&quot;As we approach the 21st Century, we continue to see that
the textile, apparel and home products industries are becoming more
global; that the barriers to trade and exchange of information
are coming down,&quot; said J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton Incorporated's
president and chief executive officer. &quot;The ongoing efforts
of Cotton Incorporated in Mexico are all aimed at improving the
cotton industry's collective competitive edge in this dynamic,
exciting world market.&quot; </p>

NEW YORK, Feb. 28, 1996 -- <em>The numbers are in and 1995 was
another banner year for cotton.</em><br>
Based on figures compiled by The NPD Group, cotton's total share
of the apparel and home fabrics market -- excluding carpet --
reached 58 percent in 1995, up from 56 percent in 1994. This
marks the 15th consecutive year cotton's share on a fabric weight
basis has increased.<br>
<br>
Of the total apparel market, cotton's share hit 58 percent, up
from 56 percent; in home fabrics, the share went up one point to
62 percent. <br>
<br>
The women's apparel market -- the single largest cotton-using
segment -- reached a share of 47.2 percent, up from 45.6 percent
in 1994. Among some key women's wear categories, the market share
for all women's shirts rose to 62.1 percent in 1995, up from 58.7
percent the previous year; dresses went to 33.6 percent from 28.5
percent, and sweat apparel climbed to 49.4 percent from 47.7
percent.<br>
<br>
In men's apparel, cotton carved an even larger piece of the
market share pie, posting a share of 73.2 percent, up from 71.1 percent
the previous year. The share in sport shirts climbed to 86.1
percent from 84.2 percent; socks rose to 66.6 percent from 63.4
percent, and men's slacks and pants -- primarily because of the
increase in wrinkle-resistant products as well as the trend
toward upscale casual dressing -- climbed to 62.5 percent from
58.3 percent.<br>
<br>
As for children's wear, its share also went up, to 59.1 percent
from 57.5 percent. Significant gains in share occurred in boys dress
shirts, which climbed to 59.1 percent from 53.7 percent, and in
girls' dresses, which rose to 60.7 percent from 58.3 percent.<br>
<br>
Cotton also scored high marks in the home. Its share in sheet
sets was 61.1 percent, up from 59.3 percent, while blankets moved
to 42.2 percent, up from 36.5 percent.<br>
<br>
&quot;The fact that the market share of cotton apparel and home
products grew substantially during a difficult year at retail, underscores
the consumers' desire for quality, comfort and value -- all of
which are provided by cotton textile products,&quot; said J.
Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive officer of Cotton
Incorporated. &quot;As we continue to explore and develop new markets
for cotton, as well as increase our presence in traditional
cotton markets, we're well on our way to our stated goal of a 62
percent retail share within the next five years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated, funded by U. S. cotton growers and U.S.
importers of cotton textile products, is the research and marketing
company representing upland cotton -- the number-one selling
fiber in the U.S.</p>

<h5 align="center"><a name="pr09"><font color="#804040">SEAL OF
COTTON AWARENESS LEVEL HITS 75 PERCENT</font></a></h5>

<p><a href="#archive"><font color="#804040"><strong><img
src="images/upa.gif" border="0" width="15" height="11"></strong></font></a>
NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 1996 -- <em>The Seal of Cotton continues to
make its mark</em>. <br>
Based on findings from a recently completed study by Roper Starch
Worldwide Inc., 75 percent of U.S. consumers recognize the
trademarked Seal of Cotton and what it represents. That number is
up 2 percentage points over 1994's Seal of Cotton awareness
level. <br>
<br>
The Roper figures are based on face-to-face interviews with 1,978
men and women -- 18 years of age and over -- conducted from Dec.
2 through Dec. 16, 1995. They were shown 12 corporate symbols and
asked to identify them. The symbols were depicted only with their
respective design element; no verbiage was seen. <br>
<br>
The awareness level of the Seal of Cotton ranked third among
symbols shown in the survey, outscoring such highly visible logos
as the CBS &quot;Eye,&quot; the Travelers &quot;Umbrella,&quot;
the Prudential &quot;Rock,&quot; and the Merrill Lynch
&quot;Bull.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Seal of Cotton, established in 1973, tells consumers an item
is made of 100 percent cotton and helps bring to mind the important
quality benefits of cotton products; that 100 percent cotton is
natural, comfortable, durable, soft, versatile, breathable,
practical and fashionable. <br>
<br>
&quot;Today, more than ever, consumers demand value and quality
in the apparel and home fashions they buy,&quot; said J. Nicholas Hahn,
president and chief executive officer of Cotton Incorporated.
&quot;The Seal of Cotton assures them that the 100 percent cotton
products they purchase will meet those expectations. &quot; <br>
<br>
There are currently more than 2 billion seals displayed on
textile products in the U.S. <br>
<br>
In some key demographic groups, awareness of the Seal hit 80
percent and higher. For example, among 18 to 29-year old consumers,
the awareness rate was 80 percent; 81 percent among 30 to 44-year
old consumers. <br>
<br>
In addition, women ages 18-49 had an 83 percent awareness rate of
the Seal, while college graduates and consumers whose annual
household income was $75,000 or above had an 85 percent awareness
level. </p>

NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 1996 -- Viva <i>Algodon</i>.<br>
As part of the ongoing effort to expand its marketing reach
throughout Mexico and Latin America, Cotton Incorporated will be
the primary sponsor of the upcoming edition of ExpoTela in Mexico
City, April 23-25.<br>
<br>
ExpoTela, the showcase of textile products from international
suppliers from the three countries that are part of the North American
Free Trade Agreement -- the U.S., Mexico and Canada -- will be
held at Mexico City's new World Trade Center. More than 5,000
Mexican and Latin American apparel manufacturers are expected to
attend the show, the third edition of ExpoTela.<br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated will occupy a substantial space at the show,
from which the company will work with the textile and apparel
manufacturers to create interest in cotton fabrics, present new
fabric developments and technological advancements in cotton and
display commercial fabrics from companies throughout the world
that use U.S. cotton. <br>
<br>
The booth will include an area that will be utilized for research
presentations focusing on the latest trends in fabric color, texture
and style, as well as consumer research in Mexico as it pertains
to cotton. <br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated will also be a key participant in the
Trendsetters Gallery, where the various exhibitors will be
displaying their latest trend boards. <br>
<br>
&quot;We see ExpoTela as a tremendous opportunity to further the
use of cotton among Mexican apparel manufacturers and textile
mills as well as expanding the use of the Seal of Cotton
trademark,&quot; said Dean Turner, Cotton Incorporated's vice president,
international marketing. <br>
<br>
Turner said that marketing and advertising efforts targeted at
the textile and softgoods trades, as well as the ultimate consumer,
continue to build awareness of cotton and Cotton Incorporated's
services in the region. In addition the trademarked Seal of
Cotton is now being licensed by Mexican mills, manufacturers and
retailers for use on 100 percent cotton products to be sold
within the NAFTA region. U.S. or Canadian cotton products
exported to Mexico may also contain the Seal. <br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated's sponsorship of ExpoTela comes on the heels
of the opening of its Mexico City office, aimed at servicing the
Mexican and Latin American markets with information and technical
services. <br>
<br>
It also follows closely the company's plans to extend its
consumer advertising campaign in Mexico. The newest phase, themed,
&quot;If it Has This Seal, It is 100 percent Cotton,&quot; is an
educational approach created in an effort to encourage the Mexican
consumer to identify the Seal with 100 percent cotton products at
retail. <br>
<br>
ExpoTela is owned, produced and directed by Bobbin Blenheim with
the active support of the Camara Nacional Industria del Vestido
and Camara Nacional de la Industria Textile. <br>
<br>
The show is endorsed by several major U.S. textile trade
associations whose members produce a large amount of cotton fabrics:
The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the American Yarn
Spinners Association, the Knitted Textile Association, the
Northern Textile Association and the Textile Distributors
Association. It is also endorsed by the Canadian Textile
Institute. <br>
<br>
&quot;Cotton Incorporated works closely with both Mexican
organizations, as well with the U.S. and Canadian associations,
and we're pleased to be a sponsor of this effort,&quot; Turner
said. &quot;In addition, the ExpoTela sponsorship fits with our
plan to extend the use of the Seal of Cotton in Mexico.&quot; <br>

<h5 align="center"><a name="pr07"><font color="#804040">COTTON
INCORPORATED</font></a><font color="#804040"> TO EXTEND <br>
ITS CONSUMER ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IN MEXICO</font></h5>

<p><a href="#archive"><font color="#804040"><strong><img
src="images/upa.gif" border="0" width="15" height="11"></strong></font></a>
NEW YORK, February 1, 1996 -- <em>The Mexican push continues.</em><br>
Cotton Incorporated, which recently licensed its trademarked Seal
of Cotton in Mexico, will extend its consumer advertising campaign
there next month. <br>
<br>
Launched in September of 1994, the first consumer advertising
campaign in Mexico highlighted attractive clothing and home furnishings
such as denim, knits and brightly colored towels. The headline
read: &quot;Algodon. Naturalamente Suave&quot; and it was designed
to establish basic recognition of the Seal of Cotton. <br>
<br>
Plans to extend the consumer advertising campaign focus on
increasing awareness of the Seal and the benefits of 100 percent cotton.
One objective of the new execution is to underscore Mexican
consumers' understanding that the English word &quot;cotton&quot;
in the Seal of Cotton means algodon. Developed by Cotton
Incorporated's advertising agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Mexico
City, copy for all segments of the campaign are in Spanish. <br>
<br>
The newest phase, themed, &quot;If it Has This Seal, It is 100
Percent Cotton,&quot; is an educational approach created in an
effort to encourage the Mexican consumer to identify the Seal
with 100 percent cotton products at retail. <br>
<br>
&quot;Independent research in Mexico placed recognition of the
Seal at 16 percent in 1994 and about 24 percent in 1995,&quot;
said Dean Turner, Cotton Incorporated's vice president,
international marketing. &quot;While this is tremendous initial
recognition, the Seal is recognized by more than 7 out of every
10 consumers in the U.S. Our goal is to eventually approach this
in Mexico.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ads will be placed in a minimum of nine consumer magazines,
on billboards in high-traffic zones and on public mailboxes in
areas of high visibility. <br>
<br>
The next consumer message will carry the headline: &quot;Look for
100 percent Cotton. Look for the Cotton Seal.&quot; This generation
of ads, to be introduced in July, emphasizes both the Seal and
cotton's benefits in apparel and home applications by showing
important cotton product categories once again. <br>
<br>
&quot;We see the expansion of our advertising efforts in Mexico
as a tremendous opportunity to further the awareness of the Seal of
Cotton as a powerful sales tool,&quot; said Turner. He added that
10 major Mexican manufacturers are already using the Seal of
Cotton on 100 percent cotton products being sold within Mexico,
the U.S., and Canada, and another 15 applications are presently
being processed. <br>
<br>
The campaign comes on the heels of the opening of Cotton
Incorporated's Mexico office (in Mexico City), aimed at servicing the
Mexican and Latin American markets with information and technical
services. <br>
<br>
Gerardo Lastiri, Cotton Incorporated's director, international
marketing/Mexico, said, &quot;U.S. cotton and its products are becoming
more important in our region and our activity with major mills
and manufacturers has increased significantly in the past
year.&quot;<br>

Supporting the move in November to Mexico, Cotton Incorporated
launched a separate trade advertising campaign with full-page ads
appearing regularly in Mexico's major business publications. The
ads are being utilized to make Mexico's mills, textile
manufacturers and retailers aware of Cotton Incorporated's
services and the Cotton Seal. <br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated, funded by U.S. cotton growers and U.S.
importers of cotton textile products is the research and marketing
company representing upland cotton -- the number-one selling
fiber in the U.S. The address at Cotton Incorporated's New York
headquarters is: 1370 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019.
The phone number is (212) 586-1070. <br>
<br>
The introduction of Cotton Incorporated's Mexican consumer
campaign comes as cotton is enjoying 16 consecutive years of market
share growth and is currently holding a 58 percent share of the
U.S. retail textile market -- excluding carpets. </p>

NEW YORK, January 29, 1996 -- <em>Cotton Incorporated stars on
ice</em>.<br>
Continuing its ongoing effort to increase consumer awareness of
cotton, Cotton Incorporated will be the primary sponsor of a nationally
televised skating competition, &quot;The Cotton Incorporated
Ultimate Four.&quot; The event, showcasing 15 world-class, professional
skaters competing in four separate skating disciplines - Ladies,
Gentlemen, Pairs and Dance - is slated for 8-11 p.m., Saturday,
Feb. 17, on NBC-TV.<br>
<br>
This new event underscores the increased popularity of
competitive figure skating in the US. Cotton Incorporated feels
that this program provides a perfect vehicle for showcasing the
company's &quot;The Fabric of our Lives(TM)&quot; television
campaign.<br>
<br>
This program marks the second time that Cotton Incorporated has
been the name sponsor of a major figure skating event. In November,
ABC-TV aired &quot;Cotton Incorporated Skates of Gold III.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial">The USDA&#146;s December report provided a
widely anticipated increase to the U.S production estimate, up
100,000 bales to 18.7 million bales. The increase in the supply
side was more than offset by an upward revision of 400,000 bales
to the U.S. export figure for 1996/97, currently forecast at 6.2
million bales. The net change in the supply/demand balance was a
reduction of 300,000 bales in the carryover projected for the end
of 1996/97. With a carryover of 4.6 million bales, the
stocks-to-use ratio would be 27%, seeming to indicate a slight
&quot;loosening&quot; of the supply side this year. U.S. mill
consumption remained unchanged in the USDA report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The U.S. export estimate will be of primary
importance to the direction of prices in the futures market in
the near term. Current export commitment levels (sales and
shipments to-date) suggest a year-end export total below the USDA
forecast. The absence of large-scale buying by China, combined
with slower sales rates to many foreign buyers of U.S. cotton
suggests that a significant pick-up in sales would be necessary
in the next several weeks in order to reach the USDA projection.
Strong production in the Southern hemisphere and India this year,
together with declining consumption in China (revised downward by
800,000 bales in the December report) may prove to be
overwhelming obstacles to reaching 6.2 million bales of exports
during this marketing year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The December estimate for world cotton
production was lowered from the previous month&#146;s figure by
more than one million bales to 86.0 million bales, down by 6.3%
from last year&#146;s production. With world cotton consumption
forecast at 85.3 million bales, this leaves world cotton stocks
(excluding China) growing by less than a million bales this year.
Most of the increase should occur in the United States where
stocks may grow by two million bales. Such a scenario sets the
stage for some strength in cotton prices next year, particularly
if world production is not significantly higher than this year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Several factors in the world situation will
be crucial for the direction of the market in the near term.
Production estimates for the CIS and Pakistan continue to fall,
raising the possibility of additional U.S. exports on the world
market to fill a void left by fewer CIS and Pakistani shipments.
Additionally, growing consumption estimates for Pakistan suggest
that the domestic industry may need to import more cotton this
year. Further reductions in the world year-end stocks
figure--resulting in a lower stocks-to-use ratio--may send an
early signal that the market may be tightening in the later half
of 1996/97. Whether such a tightening will raise prices and
entice more acreage into cotton production for next year remains
to be seen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Retail sales of apparel and home fabrics
(excluding carpet) rose 5.6 percent for the first ten months of
1996 compared with the same period in 1995. If this pace
continues through the rest of the year, 1996 would be the highest
percent increase since 1992. The apparel market is up 5.6 percent
to date while home fabrics is up 5.9 percent.</font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font face="Arial">Men&#146;s wear continues to lead the
growth with a gain of 7.5 percent while women&#146;s apparel
increased 4.9 percent. Children&#146;s and infants&#146; apparel
combined also increased 4.9 percent to date in 1996.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The recovery in 1996 continues to be
concentrated in young adults. According to consumer panel data,
consumer spending on apparel by consumers age 14 to 24 rose 14.5
percent to date in 1996 following a healthy 6.8 percent gain last
year. By contrast, spending by consumers age 50 and over has
remained sluggish. In fact sales are off 2.2 percent in 1996
following a 2 percent drop in 1995. Increases in the middle and
older age groups will be necessary for a sustainable longer-term
recovery.</font></p>

<p><strong>Cotton Leads Recovery</strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Apparel and home furnishings products made
with cotton have continued to outperform the market in 1996. The
demand for cotton (weight basis) rose 6.4 percent in the first
ten months of 1996 compared with a 0.6 percent gain for all other
fibers combined. Cotton&#146;s market share rose 1.4 percentage
points to date and was up in all major market segments. In
men&#146;s wear cotton&#146;s share rose 1.9 points; in
women&#146;s apparel, cotton&#146;s share increased 0.6 points,
in children&#146;s apparel, cotton rose 2.5 points and in home
fabrics, cotton&#146;s share was up 0.9 points from 1995.</font></p>

face="Arial"><b>Corduroy Market Stages Comeback</b></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The retail market for corduroy has improved
significantly for the first time in many years. According to The
NPD Group, sales of corduroy jeans and slacks totaled 19.2
million units in the first ten months of 1996, up 16.7 percent
from a year ago. Measured in dollars, sales of corduroy jeans and
slacks rose 50.8 percent over the first ten months of 1996. The
sharp rise in dollar volume relative to unit sales suggest that
average selling prices are also up substantially in 1996 which is
good for margins.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The unit volume gain for corduroy was all
in slacks which posted a 28.5 percent increase. Corduroy jeans
fell 1.6 percent. By age and gender, the increase in corduroy
slack demand was greatest for women&#146;s wear, up 54.9 percent.
Men&#146;s corduroy slacks rose 28.1 percent, while boys&#146;
and girls&#146; corduroy slacks rose 9.5 percent and 7.8 percent,
respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The rise in the market is from a low base.
The corduroy market fell precipitously during the 1980s which
continued into the first half of the 1990s. From 1990 to 1995,
unit sales of corduroy fell 59 percent. By contrast, unit sales
of denim jeans rose 30 percent during the same period. For
comparison, denim jeans in the first ten months of 1996 reached
414 million units which is over twenty times the amount of
corduroy jeans and slacks combined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nevertheless, the sharp gain in this market
reflects the possible need for a dressier look to casual wear.
Research from Cotton Incorporated&#146;s Lifestyle Monitor&trade;
indicates that interest in a dressier casual look has picked up,
especially among younger consumers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As part of its continuous goal to grow
cotton&#146;s market share by increasing awareness of new
developments for knitted fabrics, Cotton Incorporated held a
cotton knit processing seminar for a select group of textile
trade press on Friday, December 6, in Raleigh, N.C. The full day
of presentations was attended by five editors representing
APPAREL INDUSTRY MAGAZINE, HFN, KNITTING TIMES, SOUTHERN TEXTILE
NEWS and TEXTILE WORLD.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">An overview of the technical and market
research capabilities available at Cotton Incorporated was
presented by Wolfgang A. Strahl, Senior Vice President, Textile
Research and Implementation. Dean B. Turner, Senior Vice
President, International Marketing, presented a current status
report and forecast for the export of U.S. upland cotton to
foreign markets. Ira B. Livingston, Senior Vice President,
Marketing Implementation, presented the most current Lifestyle
Monitor</font><font face="Symbol">‰</font><font face="Arial">
and NPD data relating to the retail market, knit market and
insights on consumer attitudes toward casual dress. Mr.
Livingston stated that cotton currently has more than 61 percent
of the total knit apparel market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Technical papers were presented by Michael
Tyndall, Senior Director, Technical Services Dyeing Chemistry
Research and Donald L. Bailey, Senior Director, Technical
Services, Product Research and Implementation. Mr. Tyndall
discussed the quality aspects related to preparation, dyeing and
finishing, and troubleshooting for such challenges as barrÈ,
abrasion, and fabric discoloration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mr. Bailey discussed and demonstrated
Cotton Incorporated&#146;s Engineered Knitting Program. The
objective of the Engineered Knitting Program is to better
understand and control the shrinkage characteristics of 100
percent cotton knit fabrics. The program enables manufacturers of
100 percent cotton knitted products to better meet customer
specifications without having to knit, dye, finish and test every
style.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Guest speaker, Dr. Jim Knapton, President,
Jonathan Cope Associates, Inc., concluded the seminar with a
presentation titled, <i>How to Engineer Cotton Knits at Minimum
Knitting Defect Conditions</i>.</font></p>

Raised</b></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial">U.S. cotton production was forecast by USDA
at 18.7 million bales, the third largest cotton crop in history.
The forecast was 150,000 bales higher than their November
projection and was 550,000 bales above the estimate in October.
Generally, favorable weather helped produce a yield of 704 pounds
per acre, only the third time in history that U.S. yields have
exceeded 700 pounds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">On the demand side, the projection for U.S.
cotton exports was raised by 400,000 bales despite continued
sluggish export sales to date. The increase in the export
estimate resulted from lower than previously projected world
production along with reports that exportable supplies from other
producing countries were tightening. This is expected to lead to
stronger U.S. sales in the second half of the 1996/97 season. The
forecast for mill usage was left unchanged at 11 million bales.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The stronger outlook for exports resulted
in a slightly lower projection for U.S. ending stocks, now
estimated at 4.6 million bales from 4.9 million bales projected
last month. Nevertheless, this stock level is up nearly 2 million
bales from last year and would represent the highest U.S.
stocks-to-use ratio since 1992/93.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Reports of tighter world exportable
supplies have tended to provide a slight boost to U.S. and world
prices. New York futures nearby contract averaged 76 cents over
the first half of December, up 2.9 cents from November&#146;s
average. This level is still within the 70 to 78 cents trading
range which has been in place since the beginning of the 1996/97
season. World prices, measured by the Cotlook A Index, averaged
79 cents in the first half of December, up 3 cents from
November&#146;s average. Even with the recent rise, U.S. prices
for the first four and a half months of the crop year have
averaged 8.5 cents lower than last season&#146;s average and
world prices are down 9.3 cents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cotton prices have moved higher in the last
month despite the likelihood that U.S. ending stocks will rise 2
million bales to 4.6 million by the end of the year. The U.S.
stocks-to-use ratio, now estimated at 27 percent, has
historically correlated with futures prices (May contract basis)
around the mid-70s, so recent prices are still near the level
suggested by U.S. supply and demand fundamentals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With the U.S. crop now essentially known
and with relatively stable U.S. mill demand, prices over the
remainder of the crop year will be heavily influenced by export
activity which tends to be much more uncertain. The latest
downward revisions to production estimates in Uzbekistan and
Pakistan has greatly increased the potential for a rebound in
U.S. exports. However, the sales figures to date, which are 33
percent below last year, have yet to reflect this potential.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cotton consumption by U.S. mills rose to an
annual rate of 11.1 million bales in November, the highest rate
of consumption since last June. Consumption had been stuck at
10.8 million bales for the previous three months of the 1996/97
crop year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The improvement in operating rates is the
result of stronger overall retail sales along with reduced retail
and mill inventories. With lower inventory to sales ratios
throughout the pipeline, the pickup in retail activity has
resulted in a recovery in mill orders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Despite an increase in the U.S. cotton
production forecast, the USDA lowered their estimate of world
production by 1.1 million bales in their December report. The
lower projection reflects significantly lower harvests in the
former U.S.S.R. and in Pakistan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The world estimate tends to confirm reports
that exportable supplies worldwide are becoming somewhat tighter.
Uzbekistan, the world&#146;s second largest exporter behind the
United States, will produce 300,000 bales less than forecast in
November. About 80 percent of the production is for export which
means that the loss in output will be felt in the world market.
Pakistan&#146;s harvest was forecast at 300,000 bales lower than
previously forecast which is also likely to reduce their cotton
exports. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Despite the large downward revision in
production, the forecast for world production (85.9 million
bales) remains 590,000 bales above the projected world
consumption for 1996/97. Cotton consumption worldwide continues
to be hampered by rapid expansion of synthetic fiber production
in China and other Asian countries. According to <i>Fiber Organon</i>,
total synthetic fiber production capacity will rise by more than
10 percent per year between 1995 and 1997 which is well above the
3.4 percent average gain in world synthetic fiber usage over the
past five years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The world&#146;s inventories of cotton are
now projected at 37 million bales compared with 36.2 million last
year. The inventory to usage ratio (excluding China), which is a
key indicator of world prices, is now estimated at 32.8 percent
in 1996/97, up 0.3 percentage points from last year. </font></p>

</strong><a name="Legend"><strong>Legend:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The
upper portion of each chart lists, by classing office, the
percentage of bales that were placed in various grades by the
classers. The &quot;White Grades&quot; section has three columns
that give the percentages of bales placed into grades 21 and
higher (MID+), grades 40 and 41 (SLM), and grades 50 through 71
(LM-). The &quot;TOTal&quot; column gives the total percentage of
bales classified as &quot;white&quot; at each classing office.
The &quot;Light Spotted Grades&quot; section gives percentages of
bales classified into groups 12, 22, and 32 (MID+), 42 (SLM), and
52 through 62 (LM-). The &quot;TOTal&quot; column gives the total
percentage of bales classified as &quot;Light Spotted&quot; at
each classing office. The &quot;Other Grades&quot; column
includes all bales at each classing office that were classed as
&quot;Spotted&quot;, &quot;Tinged&quot;, &quot;Yellow
Stained&quot;, or &quot;Below Grade&quot;. The &quot;% Barky
Grades&quot; column lists the percentage of bales from each
classing office contained bark. </p>

In 1993, the classer grading system was changed. Under the old
system of grading, the classer determined a composite grade of
color and trash content; and bales that contained bark and grass
were reduced one or more grade levels. Under this system, the
classer determines a color grade, a leaf (trash) grade and notes
whether there is bark or grass present in the bale without any
reduction in grade. Each color grade percentage will include all
levels of leaf. For example, the 52.6% of the bales classed in
Florence, SC in 1994 with SLM white color grade includes all
bales at all leaf levels (2-7 leaf) with SLM white color. </p>

<p><a href="#top"><font size="5"><em><strong><img

The lower portion of the chart lists average physical properties
at each classing office. Micronaire (MIC), length (LEN), length
uniformity index (LUI), strength (STR) and TRASH are measurements
taken by the High Volume Instruments (HVI). The TRASH measurement
is an estimate of the percent of the surface of the sample
covered by the trash. The maturity ratio and fineness data are
derived from random samples submitted each week by classing
office and tested using the Shirley Fineness and Maturity Tester
(FMT). </p>

The number of bales graded at each classing office is also given.
Due to classing office consolidation, data for the Dumas office
are listed by state (Arkansas and Mississippi). </p>
