<h2>Curriculum - Courses and Descriptions</h2><br clear=left><hr>

<center><b>Foundation Curriculum</b></center>
<p>

<b>SW 501 	Theory and Practice of Social Work I (3)</b><br>
The first in a series of practice courses which introduces the students to an array of knowledge, values and skills that comprise the core of social work practice.  The focus includes the philosophical foundation, the self-awareness and values of the helping person, the professional relationship and theoretical and practical approaches to problem-solving.  Taken concurrently with the practicum education course, 
SW 591.  In this course are other substantive areas of the curriculum including ethics, human growth and behavior, research and social policy.<p>

<b>SW 502	Theory and Practice of Social Work II (3)</b><br>
A continuation of SW 501, SW 502 reemphasizes contact and contracting while moving to the stages of intervention, evaluation and termination.  The Life Model is the framework for the social work practice emphasized in SW 502.  An equal emphasis is placed on the core helping skills and the various roles social workers may assume.  Taken concurrently with 
SW 592, Practicum II.  Prerequisite:  SW 502.<p>

<b>SW 591	Practicum Instruction I (3)</b><br>
<b>SW 592 	Practicum Instruction II (4)</b><br>

Students spend sixteen hours a week in social work settings, developing knowledge and skill in social work practice by working under qualified supervision.  Focus is on professional use of self as a helping person and on integration of the total learning experience as it relates to and sheds light on social policy and social work practice.  Taken concurrently with SW 501 and SW 502, theory and practice courses.  <p>

<b>SW 601	Psychosocial Analysis of Human Behavior (3)</b><br>
It is essential that the social worker understand how human persons develop and grow as bio-psycho-social beings over their life span; also what life events are anticipated and the ways in which social work practice can enhance this process.  In addition, when life chances are limited due to personal or environmental barriers, social workers also need to understand the consequences and connect theoretical material, practice skills and policy understanding to create maximum positive resolutions.<p>

<b>SW 602	Social Science Perspectives on Human Behavior (3)</b><br>
The goal of this course is to provide knowledge of social institutional factors that shape human behavior.  Aspects of human behavior are examined in their social context, emphasizing structure, culture, class, 
ethnicity, race, sexuality and age.  Social and social psychological theories are examined for understandings of the interactions between individuals and the social environment.  Contemporary 
human-social problems will be discussed from the perspective of social theory and in terms of personal and collective ethical stances.  <p>

<b>SW 635	Human Biology and Social Work (0)</b><br>
A short course for students without undergraduate preparation in human anatomy and physiology, this course is to help social workers identify the biological stresses facing their clients and provide a framework for incorporating this understanding into a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework.  <p>

<b>SW 801	Introduction to Social Welfare (3)</b><br>
This first required course in the Social Policy Sequence examines the social work and analyzes its historical development in the relevant political and economic contexts.  Emphasis is placed on the dynamic relationship between social welfare as an institution and modern 
industrial/post industrial society. Included is an introduction to some basic analytical concepts, such as universality and selectivity, institutional and residual, and public and voluntary. <p>

<b>SW 971	Ethical Issues in Social Work Practice (3) </b><br>
This course has been designed to foster sensitivity to ethical concerns and to provide knowledge and experience in ethical decision-making. Students become familiar with the philosophical base of ethics, while considering social work values and ethical dilemmas in practice at all levels and developing expertise in using a decision-making model.  The implications of such ethical practice are reviewed.  Case materials reflect a variety of issues, levels of practice and diversity of populations.<p>


<center><b>Advanced Curriculum</b></center>
<p>

The foundation courses described previously are taken (with the first elective) in the first year of study by full-time students and in the first two years by part-time students.  As students move to more advanced levels of their studies, more specialized courses are offered to assist in the acquisition of knowledge and skills in greater depth. <p>


Every full- and part-time student is required to undertake two semesters of social work research courses concurrently with the chosen concentration.  These courses assist the student to focus critical analysis on the relationship of social work practice methods to the realities of client needs, agency services and policies affecting the delivery of services.  In these courses the student is to carry out a 
research project that grows out of the practice situations.  It is out of the convergence of the methods concentration, practicum experience and research, supported by elective choices, that the student is expected to develop skill and competence for advanced social work practice.<p>



<center><b>Concentration Courses</b></center>
<p>

<b>SW 511	Social Work Intervention with Individuals, Families 
  and Small Groups I (3) </b><br>

<center><b>Research Courses </b></center>
<p>
<b>
SW 703	Social Work Research: Design and Methodology (3) </b><br>
This course builds upon the research knowledge infused throughout the foundation curriculum and 
focuses on research methodology.  At the end of this course, students submit a proposal for a practice-based research project, including a rationale for the study, a review of relevant research and the 
methodology of the study.  Accordingly, the course content will include the basic forms of research and the logical progression of research from the problem formulation and design stage to various data 
collection techniques and interpretation. <p>

<b>SW 704	Social Work Research: Implementation and Analysis (3) </b><br>
Implementation of the research proposal developed in SW 703 is the central concern of this course.  Students explore analysis issues and expose their individual data sets to a variety of statistical analyses. Students are introduced to the need for and function of qualitative and quantitative analysis as essential components of social work research and practice.  The end products of SW 703 and 704 include a research paper and formal oral presentation or poster presentation.<p>


<center><b>Policy Course </b></center>
<p>

<b>SW 802	Social Policy and Social Issues (3)</b><br>
Historically, the social work profession has sought to change the environmental circumstances which limit people's lives.  This course, building on foundation policy, teaches the student to use a conceptual framework in analyzing social policy issues and advocating for change. Significant contemporary issues in social welfare, including poverty, racism and sexism are selected and examined, and students complete policy analyses of the issues of their choice.  Prerequisite:  SW 801.<p>


<center><b>Electives</b></center>
<p>

Electives allow study of a particular intervention methodology or area of significance for social work.  The School offers a range of elective choices to respond flexibly to priority concerns and emerging issues in social welfare, in accord with faculty resources and student interests. A minimum enrollment of ten students is required for an elective to be offered.  <p>

In consultation with their educational coordinators, students may select some of their elective course work in Marywood's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.  Course offerings in the departments of Art Therapy, Counseling and Psychology, and Public Administration can enrich a student's social work education. <p>

<b>SW 535	Child Abuse and Neglect: Treatment and Strategies (3) </b><br>
Provides the historical and theoretical framework for understanding child abuse. Surveys neglect and 
physical, sexual and emotional abuse, focusing on situations where social workers are likely to be intervention agents.  Provides a foundation of knowledge and skills needed to work effectively with 
families affected by abuse and/or neglect and to apply social work expertise to public policy decisions. Students will assess their personal values and the societal factors that influence work with these client 
systems. <p>

<b>SW 561	Family Intervention (3)</b><br>
Social work theory stresses the importance of interpersonal and societal transactions as equally vital areas of both assessment and intervention. The family is the basic unit of social analysis in this approach.  This course builds on the history and traditions of family therapy in the basic social services and examines practice issues, family therapy concepts and approaches used in contemporary social work intervention. <p>

<b>SW 564	Techniques of Group Leadership (3) </b><br>
This course is designed for students who seek to improve their leadership skills as professional social 
workers with groups of various types.  The structure of the course is developed on the assumption that enrolled students will have been exposed to introductory knowledge regarding group phenomena, together 
with relevant experiences in the practice of group leadership.  Students, then, are expected to have begun to raise specific questions regarding issues of their respective problems in role performance and to be 
oriented toward the refinements in use of self toward the established purposes and goals of the target unit.  The class-group will be structured to provide opportunities for exploring such questions. <p>

<b>SW 565	Social Work Practice with Groups</b><br>
The practice of social work in group settings as presented in this course relies on a conceptual model focused on mutual aid within an ecological framework.  The course also examines the underlying philosophy of group work and a theoretical understanding of small group dynamics.  Specific issues of group practice, techniques and skills are explored.  <p>

<b>SW 571	Supervision in Social Work Practice (3) </b><br>
This course is designed to provide the students with the requisite knowledge for assuming the basic 
responsibilities of supervision.  The course examines the purpose, principles and methods of supervision applicable to many settings in social work.  It deals with the role demands upon the supervisor and 
supervisee.  Emphasis is placed upon the educational and administrative elements of supervision.  The course is taught in the context of the School's emphasis on an eco-system approach.  The commitment of 
the School to women and minorities will be explicitly addressed. <p>

<b>SW 575 Social Work in Employee Assistance Programs (3)</b><br>
This course provides an overview of the role of EAPs in industry, as well as the role of the social worker.  
A clinical focus related to individuals, families, groups and environmental issues develops an understanding for effective social work treatment and intervention. Additionally, a focus on profit 
management philosophies explores strategies for social worker success in the corporate environment. <p>

<b>SW 621	Psychopathology (3) </b><br>
The purpose of this course is to identify and develop an understanding of the issues inherent in the study 
and assessment of abnormal behavior. The course explores current paradigms for viewing psychopathological behavior and analyzes the commonalities and differences among these perspectives, 
emphasizing possible explanations of causality.  Major cognitive, affective, personality and character disturbances will be addressed within the framework of the DSM III-R classification system. <p>

<b>SW 625	Alcoholism:  Addiction and Co-Dependency (3) </b><br>
This course provides an overview of the problem of alcoholism for the individual, the family and society.  Social workers need to be prepared for effective practice with individuals and families so affected. They 
also need to understand current policy initiatives.  The course will provide a model for effective social work treatment and intervention at different levels of practice. <p>

<b>SW 810	Issues in Child Welfare</b><br>
This course considers child welfare practice with diverse and vulnerable families and develops implications for future service design.  The policy context of practice, including public and private programs and services in child protection and child welfare, and current evaluative research provide a base for discussion of contemporary issues.  <p>

<b>SW 906	Experiencing Group Membership (3) </b><br>
This experiential course uses the self and the medium of the group process to develop an understanding of group dynamics, roles, structure and process.  The Pass/Fail evaluation of students facilitates a serious and honest attempt to explore the use of self while developing a conceptualization of group work. <p>

<b>SW 908	Women's Issues and the Practice of Social Work (3) </b><br>
This course focuses on the unique pressures and problems that confront women today, with emphasis on the barriers and stresses facing poor women, minority women and aged women.  Attention is directed toward evolving a practice perspective that is most suited to meeting the particular needs of women clients.  Within the field of social work itself there is evidence that women social workers are victims of discriminatory practices; this issue is also addressed. <p>

<b>SW 925	The Minority Experience and Social Work Practice (3) </b><br>
Social workers have an historic commitment and ethical imperative for practice that empowers disadvantaged individuals and groups.  This course examines devaluing attitudes toward others, the ethnocentrism, prejudice, bias, discrimination and racism that permeate our society, then explores ways these attitudes have shaped the experiences of selected ethnic and minority groups.  Students are prepared for more sensitive and effective practice.  The theme of the course is "achievement against the odds." <p>

<b>SW 941	Concepts and Issues in Gerontology (3) </b><br>
This course is designed to provide a theoretical perspective on the aging process to aid students in understanding and analyzing social policies and treatment programs for aging persons.  Issues related to adult development are examined, with emphasis on biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the process of aging. Implications for social work practice are stressed. <p>

<b>SW 951	Managing Stress: Theory and Practice (3) </b><br>
Based on the supposition that stress increases susceptibility to illness and has negative impact on family and work, this course integrates theories of stress, professional knowledge and interventive skills to help students understand their own and their clients' stress responses. Students will learn new ways to cope with stress and ways to help clients manage stress and enhance mastery over environmental demands. <p>

<b>SW 965	Human Sexuality: Issues for Social Work (3) </b><br>
Given the social work profession's commitment to the right of self-determination for all, this course aids in understanding and analyzing social policies and treatment.  The main focus is upon specific contemporary issues related to human sexuality and their implications for social work practice.  Biological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual development and personal/professional values concerning these issues are explored.  <p>


<center><b>Independent Study </b></center>


Independent study may be undertaken by a student in order to explore a specific area of interest.  The plan 
of study and bibliography are developed by the student, in cooperation with a faculty mentor, according to guidelines established by the School.  Normally, independent study is available to students who have 
completed the courses in the foundation curriculum with a 3.50 average.  Independent study plans must be approved by the student's educational coordinator and the dean.  No course regularly offered by the School 
may be taken as a subject for independent study, though such study may take an existing course as a point of departure for pursuing a topic in greater depth.<p>

   Program Regulations and Policies</CENTER>
 </H2>
 <H3>
 Registration and Residency Requirements</H3>
 <P>
 There is no formal residency requirement.</P>
 <P>
 Students are required to take the core interdisciplinary and research courses with their cohort. This will ordinarily require three continuous Fall and Spring semesters of seven (7) credits each.</P>
 <P>
 Although efforts will be made to schedule courses at times that are amenable to students, registration in this program indicates willingness to abide by the policy described above. Students are expected to show flexibility regarding scheduling and registration.</P>
 <H3>
 Admission Policies</H3>
 <P>
 Admission to the Doctoral Program in Human Development is competitive. The faculty are seeking a diverse student body whose members manifest superior academic achievement, a sensitivity to interdisciplinary inquiry, and evidence of professional leadership in their careers.</P>
 <H4>
 I. Common Admissions Requirements</H4>
 <P>
  <OL>
   <LI>A master's degree from an accredited college or university.<LI>
   Recent graduate-level courses in Research Methodology and in Statistics. (If needed, such courses as PSY 503 and 504 or SW 703 and 704 may be taken during the academic year or summer session prior to enrollment in the doctoral program.)<LI>
   Three letters of recommendation from people who can address in depth the academic achievement and professional accomplishments of the applicant. At least two of these letters should be from teachers or a current supervisor.<LI>
   A reflective essay of approximately one thousand words, addressing the personal and/or professional goals which would be met through participation in this interdisciplinary program.<LI>
   Graduate Records Examinations (GRE) General Test scores. Official scores from exams taken within the past five years may be submitted.<LI>
   TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, if an international student.<LI>
   Personal interview and writing sample. A preliminary review and screening of applications will be done based upon the submission of the materials described above. The Admissions Committee will then invite a small number of applicants to campus for personal interviews. While on campus each applicant will be required to write a brief essay on a topic selected by the committee. Final selection will be made after the on-campus interview.</OL>
 <H4>
 II. Specialization Admissions Requirements</H4>
 <P>
 <U>Social Work</U>: The following would be the usual requirement of expertise for Social Work applicants:</P>
 <P>
  <OL>
   <LI>An MSW degree.</P>
   </OL><P>
 <U>Counseling Psychology:</U>
 </P><P>
  <OL>
   <LI>Coursework and/or experience in psychological assessment and psychotherapy.<LI>
   A preliminary personal interview with the Counseling Psychology faculty.</OL>
 <H3>
 Transfer of Credits</H3>
 <P>
  <OL>
   <LI>The core interdisciplinary courses will not be waived in any case.<LI>
   No more than six credits will be accepted as transfer credits. These will need to be not only post-master's courses, but will need to be clearly doctoral level courses. Such a determination will have to be based on an examination of quality and content of the courses after the student has matriculated in the doctoral program.<LI>
   While it could happen that students already have more than six credits in specialty courses required for certification, the acceptance of these courses for certification would not lessen the number of Marywood doctoral credits required to complete the program.</OL>
 <H3>
 Graduation Requirements</H3>
 <H4>
 Standards for Continuation</H4>
 <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  A cumulative Q.P.A. of 3.25 is the minimum for continuation in the program. Students who fail to maintain a 3.25 average in their course work will be given one semester to re-establish the required 3.25 average.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 </P>
 </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
Qualifying Exam</H4>
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Students will be expected to take the qualifying exam after 30 credits of doctoral courses have been completed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
Time Limitation Policy</H4>
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 All work must be completed within seven years of the beginning of doctoral study. The beginning of doctoral study is defined as the beginning date of the earliest doctoral course, whenever taken, listed on the approved doctoral plan of study.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Extensions of the terminal date are considered only when there is substantial evidence that the student has made regular and consistent progress toward completion of degree requirements. Extensions will be granted only if the student has been granted a leave of absence for medical or other good reasons. <I>Written application for extension, with full documentation of serious cause, must be made to the Chairperson/Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. </I>This period of time is rarely extended. Any extension must have the approval of both the department and the graduate dean.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
Progress Toward Candidacy</H4>
<P>
 <OL>
  <LI>Faculty advisors will monitor students throughout their first year and subsequent years regarding grades, and behavioral and ethical standards. Anyone with concern about the progress of a student academically or professionally should make such concerns known to the advisor.<LI>
  A qualifying exam will be administered after 30 credits are completed, including 9 credits in research, 12 credits in the interdisciplinary courses and 9 credits in the specialization courses . In the case of the student who fails the qualifying exam, there will be allowance to retake the exam twice.<LI>
  Candidacy becomes effective when the comprehensive examination has been passed and the student has successfully defended his/her dissertation proposal.</OL>
<H4>
Dissertation</H4>
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Dissertation committees composed of at least three faculty members must be approved by the Dean. Although the dissertation advisor does not need to be the student's program advisor, at least one member of the committee must have faculty status in the student's specialty area. The Chair/Advisor of the Dissertation Committee must be a faculty member in the <U>respective area</U>. The other two members must be doctoral level professionals, one of whom must be from the Marywood College faculty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
After passing the Qualifying Examination, the student must submit the dissertation proposal to the Doctoral Degree Committee. In addition, proposals must be submitted to Marywood's Institutional Review Board in keeping with academic and professional standards.</P>
<P>
When the dissertation has been approved by the student's mentor and by the other members of the dissertation committee, students will register their intent to defend. Dissertation defenses will be scheduled at least five weeks after such an Intent to Defend form is submitted.</P>

<b><h2>PAC Building is now  being networked!</h2></b>

At the completion of this semester, the PAC building will be the latest 
addition to the campus network.  This is the last classroom building to 
go on-line, thus completing an important phase in the growth of the 
campus network.  Physical plant has completed the wiring stage of this 
process and soon the components to complete the job will be in place, 
bringing on-line the labs, selected classrooms and faculty offices.  
Students and faculty in the PAC will have access to all the services 
provided by Academic Computing Services, the Campus Wide 
Information System as well as full access to the Internet.  State-of-the-art 
technology in this building continues Marywood's trend of providing the 
most current technologies to its students and faculty.<br>  
Further updating of Marywood's network services continues with  the Learning 
Resources Center being rewired and outdated equipment replaced.  This building was first 
wired in 1989 when MELVIN was brought on-line. Use of this network has increased a 
hundredfold; thus re-wiring will provide greater efficiency.<p>

<h2><b>Computing Conference Coming to Marywood</b></h2>
Marywood College will be the host for the Twelfth Annual Eastern Small 
College Computing Conference to be held in the fall, October 25-26, 1996.  
A call for participation is being made for papers, presentations and 
panels.  Topics are to be focused on the impact of computing in an 
academic setting in disciplines as far ranging as music and fine arts to 
linguistics and political science.  The deadline for abstracts and panel 
proposals is March 8 and should be sent to <a href=mailto:dumdum@ac.marywood.edu>Dr. Rex Dumdum</a> or<a href=mailto:smetana@ac.marywood.edu> Dr. Joan 
Smetana</a> of the Dept. of Business and Managerial Science here at 
Marywood.   Please give this careful consideration - Marywood College 
should be well represented at this conference not only as a host but with 
active participants.  For further information, contact Dr. Dumdum or 
Dr. Smetana at 348-6274.<p>


<h2><b><i>Strategic Role of the World Wide Web</b></i></h2>

<i>by Dr. Floyd McWilliams	</i>
<p>
<img src="/acnews/web_erth.jpg" align=left hspace=10>
Before discussing the strategic role of the World Wide Web ("Web" hereafter), let us agree 
on what it is and is not.  The Web is an extension of the Internet with three primary features 
comprising the extension: significant use of graphics, powerful linkages between the almost 
infinite "isles of information" on the Internet, and search machines for taking advantage of 
the linkages.  Ours is a graphical world: television is currently the primary means by which 
people obtain information about the world around them in large part because it is graphic in 
nature.  The Web, then, moves the Internet from text-based to graphics-based.  The quest for 
information can be terrifying -- there is so much of it "out there."  Human beings tend to 
seek information like this: "Hmmm, I want to know about educational software, well actually 
about remedial educational software, well actually about remedial educational software that 
promotes thinking skills, well ..." you get the idea.  Web linkages work much the same way.  
You find an entry that is "about" the subject in which you're interested and it has <b>built into 
the text and graphics</B> keywords that can be clicked on and which take you to other entries 
that may reside on a different computer, possibly in a different country.  The power of the 
linkages is multiplied by the "search engine."  "Search engine" is just fanciful terminology 
for the software that facilitates the searches you make.  The search engine exists to make 
"about the subject" as precise as possible.<p>
	With that introduction to the Web why is it important?  In particular, why is the Web 
important to those of us at Marywood College?  The answer has two parts: first, the Web is 
important because it has the features we just discussed: it is graphic, it has useful linkages, and 
it has a powerful means of finding things; second, the Web is important because of 
McWilliams's fifth law of technology: "In the world of technology, hype is reality."  The 
Web is important because segments of society that are important to us believe the Web is 
important.  Another way of saying this is "Marywood needs to participate in the Web because 
many people who are important to us believe that Marywood should participate in the Web."  
Who are these "people who are important to us?"  One segment of the population that we 
know for certain believes in the power of the Web are prospective students.  We have already 
had high school students ask us "What is Marywood's URL?"  The term "URL," as well as 
"home page" and other terms were explained in the article World Wide Web Addresses, 
Making Sense of URLS  published in our fall edition.  As is discussed in that article, 
Marywood has a home page, but it is still in the "dotting the i's and crossing the t's" stage.<p>
	Let us speak briefly of reality as well.  The Web is not the answer to all of society's 
problems.  It is not a cure for the common cold, nor is it a solution to all of Marywood's 
needs, not even our recruiting needs, although I do believe it can be a useful tool in recruiting 
and other areas.  The two negatives I have observed about the Web at this time in its brief 
history are the extent of the hyperbole and that nobody, not even Bill Gates, knows where all 
the hype and the reality are taking us.  I will posit that it will be an exciting ride once we jump 
on the "Web express," but more than that I will not venture.<p>

<h2><b>Find Pricing Pentiums and Power Macs Perplexing?</b></h2>
<img src="/acnews/flip.jpg" align=left hspace=10>
So you've decided to take the big step and buy that computer you've 
been thinking about for the past year and a half.  Don't try just tossing a 
coin.  Now that you've made that purchasing decision you will find 
yourself facing a lot more choices that have to be made.  How big a hard 
drive do I need?  How fast a processor is fast enough for the software I 
want?  Do I really need 8 megabyte of RAM?  Should I get a Macintosh or 
PC (an IBM compatible for the neophyte)?<p>
Before even taking a step out your door to begin shopping decide exactly what you want this 
computer to do for you.  Some of the following questions should be answered:
<ul>
<li>	What do I think it will primarily be used for?
<li>	What type of computer am I most comfortable with?
<li>	What type of computer do I (or anyone else who might be using the computer) have at work?
<li>	Is there a specialized software program that I need which will work only on a Macintosh or PC?
<li>	In my chosen profession what type of computer am I likely to find in the field?
<li>	Will I want a computer that my children can use?
</ul>
	There are some basic guidelines that most experienced computer owners will follow in 
today's market.  Just keep in mind that the computer you buy today will probably be out of 
date in 6 months.  Technology is moving too rapidly to keep up.  That doesn't mean that 
you should put off buying the computer.  It simply means that you should buy as high-end 
computer as you can comfortably finance.  It is not practical to buy a 350MB hard drive 
when a 500MB hard drive might cost only $100 more.  So here are some things to look for 
whether it be a PC or Macintosh:
<Ul>
<li>	Look for a 500MB hard drive--a gigabyte (1 billion bytes) is better yet.  The hard drive is used to store 
your programs and files.  Perhaps you feel that you will use your computer only for word processing.  
Believe me, once you get hooked you'll find lots more uses for it than just typing reports.  That's when the 
bigger hard drive will really come in handy.  Some software packages are voracious storage pigs!!
<li>	The display (monitor) should be a super VGA (SVGA) color and at least 15".  (This is virtually 
standard on any machine you'll see.)
<li>	8MB RAM is minimal, particularly if you have a CD-ROM drive and 16MB on up is better.  This 
will determine how quickly screen changes will be made and how many different applications you can have 
open at the same time.  It also will affect overall speed to some degree.
<li>	Pentium processors have come down considerably in price and are almost as affordable as a 486DX.  
Buy a Pentium or a Power PC on the Macintosh side if you can swing the cost; they're faster and more up 
to date.
<li>	Look to see what pre-installed software (besides the system software) comes with the computer.  Some 
you may find you will seldom use; but, on the other hand, a good integrated application such as <i>Claris 
Works</i> can be extremely useful and save you the expense of buying additional programs.
<li>	How about extras like a CD-ROM drive or a modem?  Are they really necessary?  Some software 
packages will be on as many as 12 or more disks (<i>Microsoft Office</i> comes on 23 disks), making 
installation tedious to say the least.  Buy the CD version of the application and you'll complete the 
installation in half the time without popping disks in and out.  There are complete encyclopedias now 
available on CDs as well as wonderful children's programs such as <i>Where in the World is Carmen 
Sandiego</i>.   Will you use a modem?  It depends on how fascinated you are with "surfing the Web," doing 
research in Marywood's library in the comfort of your own home or maybe even shopping on American On 
Line or Prodigy.
<li>	An extended keyboard (one with function keys and number pad), a good mouse and Windows ('95 or 
ver. 3.1) or the Macintosh OS 7.5 are essentials.  A      3 1/2" floppy disk drive is pretty much standard.
<li>	Should I get a tower or a computer that my monitor sits on?  This should be determined by the 
amount of space you have to place your computer.  Towers can be placed either alongside the monitor or on 
the floor; but remember your monitor will sit lower.  
<li>	Speaking of space, the question might also arise as to whether a laptop should be purchased instead of a 
desktop computer.  A laptop can do everything a desktop can do but provides the luxury of popping it in a 
briefcase and taking it anywhere you want or sitting it on your lap while you loll in bed, all your materials 
spread around you.  Laptops are a bit pricier which can be an important factor and not quite as flexible to 
upgrade.
<li>	What kind of warranty is provided?  Some manufacturers will come to your home and service your 
machine for 1 year with a limited warranty over 3 years.
<li>	How about a printer?  As far as I'm concerned a computer isn't worth a heck of a lot unless I can print, 
and it's not much fun having to go somewhere else to do it.  We'll talk about printers in the next 
newsletter.
</ul>
	Where should you go to buy this computer?  After careful research, Academic 
Computing usually buys its software and hardware directly from the dealer or through 
magazine ads.  It eliminates the middle man.  You can do the same. The key is to shop just as 
carefully for a computer as you would for a car.  There are lots to chose from with a wide 
variety of prices and features.  Educate yourself first; know at least as much as the salesclerk 
so that you can make an intelligent choice.  If you need more ideas or are still confused, call 
Academic Computing Services, ext. 2391.  Our Coordinator of User Services, Kay 
McClintock, will do her best to guide you towards a purchase you'll be happy with. <p>


<h2><b>Is It Contagious?  A Look at Computer Viruses</b></h2>

<img src="/acnews/sick_mac.jpg" align=right hspace=10>
	Thousands of new computer viruses are discovered every year.  Worse 
yet, that virus that just ate your disk was created by somebody with 
nothing better to do than make your life miserable.  You might say 
viruses are a kind of computer vandalism; and, in most cases, it is 
impossible to track down the culprit.  Unfortunately viruses are fairly 
easy programs to write, so they will probably always be a fact of life for 
computers.  <p>
	Computer viruses got their name from the way they can copy themselves from program 
to program, just like a biological virus duplicates itself.  (Yes, in a sense they are contagious!) 
Basically, viruses change the code of other programs to include a small copy of itself.  When 
you run the infected program, the virus is activated and copies itself to even more programs.  
This keeps going on until the virus is triggered to do its dirty work, which can be anything 
from making the computer slower, to completely erasing your work, to putting something 
silly on the screen.<p>
	Don't think that because your disk doesn't have any programs on it you're safe.  You're 
not!  All disks have a small program contained in a hidden place called the boot sector; and it, 
too, is vulnerable to attack.<p>
	Luckily, avoiding problems caused by viruses is not complicated.  Basically you need to 
follow five rules:<p>
<ol>
<li>Most important:  keep a backup copy of all your work.  That alone will protect you from 
more then just viruses!
<li>Don't panic if a virus is detected on your disk.  More damage could result from a poorly 
thought-out cure then what the virus, itself, might have done.  Just keep in mind that most 
viruses don't do damage right away, but get help to remove it as soon as possible.
<li>Make sure that the computers you use are protected by anti-virus software.  Academic 
Computing Services keeps all of their computers protected, and makes that same software 
available to anyone who wants it.
<li>Write-protect any installation disks you have at home.  That makes it impossible for a 
virus to infect them.
<li>Be careful where you get your programs from.  It is always better to get commercial 
software, or at least get it directly from the author.
</ol>
	If you have any other questions about viruses, just turn your head and cough!  Or 
better yet, ask us!<p>

<h2><b>New Faces</b></h2>
	Two new lab assistants, <b>Lolita Nogan</b> and <b>Mike Florax</b>, have just been hired to 
replace Heidi Erikson and Lisa Polishan who have left Marywood College.<p>  
	<b>Lolita</b> is a full-time non-traditional student who is working towards her BFA degree.  She 
hopes to teach art in the public school system, and currently has five children within it.   
Lolita has joined our staff because she feels that working as a computer lab assistant gives her 
the experience to help and teach,when necessary, other students when they are in need.  <p>
	<b>Mike</b> is a native of the Netherlands, but has lived abroad since the age of sixteen.  His 
first international experience was when his family moved to Brazil, South America, where his 
father had taken a position for AKZO-NOBEL.  Mike attended high school in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil, and graduated in 1987, the same year he moved to the United States in order to attend 
La Salle University, Philadelphia.  Upon graduation Mike has worked in Brazil as well as the 
U.S. for AKZO-NOBEL.  His goal now is to finish his MBA in finance at Marywood and then 
move to Wilmington, Delaware, to get a position with an international corporation.<p>

<h2><b>Computer Problems?  Who to Call . . .</b></h2>
	It's 9 o'clock at night and you've been slaving at the computer for 
the last two hours trying to finish that paper due tomorrow.  You're

<br clear=left><hr>

<h3><a name="state">Statement of Philosophy<p></h3>

 in a variety of organizations, such as financial services, marketing, manufacturing, information systems, 
human resources and governmental enterprises. <p>

<h3><a name="general">General Information<p></h3>
Do you imagine yourself succeeding as a business analyst, bank officer, stockbroker, accountant, administrator, insurance underwriter -- or anywhere in the exciting world of business?  
Then, you want a challenging career -- a career path that takes you beyond the year 2000 through Marywood's Business Programs.<p>

<h3><a name="faculty">Faculty Qualifications<p></h3>
Marywood's business faculty have the practical business experience to add credence to the academic 
knowledge they impart.  Possessing graduate degrees from a wide range of geographical areas, they 
present the various business philosophies both in the United States and in the international sector as 
applied to multi-national corporations.  These skilled professionals can help you invest your energy 
and abilities in an education that can pay dividends in a rewarding future.  The congenial atmosphere 
on campus is felt not only among the students but also by the faculty whose dedication is immediately

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Communication Arts</h2>

<h2><i> Chairperson: Michael M. Mirabito, Ph.D.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>


At Marywood, you'll find a program that 
ranges from telecommunications to theater 
arts, opportunities to gain experience in up-to-date facilities beginning your freshman year  and faculty committed to preparing you for a creative career in the twenty-first century's "hot" field of communication.<p>

Opportunities for creative people abound in the rapidly exploding field of communications:  in video production, advertising, playwriting, desktop publishing, acting, media reporting, teaching, and 
administration.  You'll find that Marywood's broadly based program, which provides professional study and experience integrated with the liberal arts, is an excellent preparation for a challenging career.  You'll 
be able to choose from the following options:  advertising and public relations; telecommunications (specializing in broadcast or corporate communications); theater arts; performing arts; secondary school 
teacher certification; and arts administration.  Or, if you see a career opportunity in communications that goes beyond these established programs, you may choose to put together an ad hoc major with guidance 
from your adviser.<p>

You'll have the chance to use your skills and 
interests right away.  Unlike other programs, Marywood's emphasizes access for first-year students to the 
labs, television production facilities, radio station, theaters and student newspaper.  You'll start using this knowledge on and off campus beginning in your freshman year in a series of practica (mini-internships) 
in the area, with the option of longer-term, for-credit internships beyond those.<p>

In the communication arts program, you'll be encouraged to develop independent and creative thinking skills, as well as concern for the society and environment; you'll graduate prepared to serve that 
interdependent world through enhanced communication.<p>

<h3>Faculty</h3>

You'll have ready access to the communication arts faculty  and you'll find they're dedicated to helping 
you put together the knowledge and skills you'll need for a successful career in the communications field.  Faculty members teach the courses; instruct you in the use of the program's specialized technical facilities; 
advise you on course selection and on opportunities for practicum and internship placement; and still find time for their own creative work.  For example, Professor Berkery produces videos; Professor Hammeran  writes plays and screenplays; Professor Merchel directs department plays; and Professor Mirabito has 
written <i>Space Exploration </i>and <i>The New Communication Technologies.</i><p>

<b>Michael M. Mirabito, Ph.D.,</b> Chair (new communication technologies; space exploration) <p>
<b>Julia Berkery, M.S.,</b> Director, Program in Telecommunications  (media and mass culture)<p>
<b>Jay Hammeran, M.P.W., </b>Director, Program in Advertising and Public Relations  (communications history and effect on society)<p>
<b>Paulette A. Merchel, Ph.D.,</b>  Director, Program in Theater (period plays and television in education)<p>

<b>Adjunct Faculty</b><br>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The communication arts program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with up to date technology.  You'll find that communication-specific resources are available to you from the 
beginning.  These resources include<A HREF="/www2/commarts/vmfm.html"> WVMW-FM</A>, an on-air radio station managed and staffed by students 
and operating year-round; <A HREF="/www2/commarts/tvm.html">TV Marywood (TVM-37)</A>, a modern color television facility with 
complementary electronic field, graphics, and post-production operations; Marywood Theater, a 1,100-seat professionally-equipped auditorium with modern lighting and audio  systems; the Black Box Theater,  
a laboratory theater designed with flexible staging; and <i>The Wood Word</i>, the student newspaper.  You'll 
also find computer laboratories with the latest software for word processing, desktop publishing, computer 
graphics, scriptwriting, set and lighting design for TV and theater, and multimedia production; you'll also have access to the Internet.<p>

<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work</h3>

If you'd like to test the knowledge and technical skills you learn at Marywood in a real world setting, you'll find plenty of opportunities in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre region.  Students can participate in for-credit internships at local radio and television stations, newspapers, advertising and public relations firms, nonprofit organizations, theaters and fine arts centers.<p>

<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

All communication arts students are required to take 12 credits in core courses, which include six practica (mini-internships) taken in the freshman through senior years.  You'll also need to meet the College 
requirement for all students to take Dynamics of Speech Communication (or be exempted by satisfactory achievement in a place-out test); and you'll need to complete 64 credits in the College's liberal arts and skills core curriculum.  Each major in the department has its own course requirements.<p>

<b>Advertising and Public Relations</b> requires 48 credits; <b>Telecommunications: Broadcast and 
Corporate Communication</b> offers two tracks, <b>Broadcast Communication</b> and <b>Corporate Communication</b>; you select and complete 48 credits in one track.  <b>Theater Arts</b> requires 42 credits, and <b>Performing Arts</b> requires 30.  For Secondary School Teacher Certification in 
communication arts, you'll be required to complete a professional educational sequence,          15 credits of basic communications requirements, and an additional 15 core credits in either the theater arts specialization or the nonprint media specialization.  Students seeking a degree in <b>Arts Administration 
</b>take 24 credits in either corporate 
communication or theater arts as their primary concentration, 15 credits in their secondary concentration 
(art or music), and 24 credits in business.  Finally, if none of the existing programs meets your needs, you 
may have the opportunity to design a <b>special ad hoc program</b> in communication arts.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1><h2>Communication 
Sciences and Disorders</h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Janet D. Bissett</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>

At Marywood, you'll find supportive 
professors dedicated to helping you understand the importance of communication and use that knowledge to help others, a variety of practical experiences in the field and preparation for a rewarding career in a wide range of human services.<p>


If you're interested in a career in audiology, deaf studies, or speech-language pathology, Marywood can provide you with an excellent foundation.  The communication sciences and disorders department 
maintains an active membership in the National Academy of Preprofessional Programs in Communication Sciences and Disorders, and the program's objectives are compatible with standards of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, so you're assured of having the strongest set of educational experiences possible.<p>

Your coursework will include theory and practice in the field as well as a background in the liberal arts.  
Your experiences will help you learn to think creatively, develop a sense of social and personal 
responsibility, understand human cultural diversity (including language and value systems), develop confidence, and develop an understanding of human values.  As you may know, the goal of every Marywood student's education is to learn to live responsibly in an interdependent world.  What better way 
to put that goal into practice than to help others develop fully although they may have communicative differences?<p>


<h3>The Faculty</h3>


You'll find that the faculty in the department of communication sciences and disorders are dedicated professionals who will work closely with you to develop the knowledge and skills you'll need to be a strong candidate for graduate school and a professional on the field.  Faculty members teach the courses, 

instruct you in the use of the program's specialized technical facilities, advise you on course selection and opportunities for observation and clinical practice, and still find time for their own research and service to the profession.  Indeed, Dr. Feudo serves as president of the National Academy of Preprofessional 
Programs in Communication Sciences and Disorders.<p>

<b>Janet D. Bissett, Ph.D.,</b> Chair  (licensed in Speech-Language Pathology)<p>
<b>Peter Feudo, Jr., Sc.D.</b>  (licensed in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology)<p>
<b>Carl Frels, M.Ed.</b>  (certified teacher; fluent in ASL)<p>
<b>Elizabeth Kilker, M.S.</b>  (licensed in Speech-Language Pathology)<p>
<b>Margaret Q. Mariotti, M.A.</b>  (licensed in Audiology)<p>
<b>Sheri Skrutski, M.S.</b>  (licensed in Audiology)<p>
<p>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The communication sciences and disorders program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all 
students with state-of-the-art technology.  You'll find computer facilities with the latest in word processing and statistical software in the Learning Resources Center.  Technological support specific to the communication sciences and disorders program includes equipment illustrating anatomy and 
physiology and simulating human performance, as well as for analyzing speech, language, and hearing.  Perhaps of greatest interest to you is that Marywood's Human Services Center, where the program is housed, is home to the Marywood Speech and Hearing Clinic.  Here you'll have the chance to work with 
individuals with speech, language, and hearing needs.  The clinic is equipped with video monitors and a complete audiological evaluation facility.<p>


<h3>The Regional Advantage</h3>

You'll find plenty of opportunities to relate your studies at Marywood to real world situations.  To 
complete your required hours of observation, you may choose such local institutions as Scranton State School for the Deaf, St. Joseph's Center and area public schools.  Since Marywood offers the only 
communication sciences and disorders program in the area, you'll also have the chance to put your skills 
to good use as a volunteer at these and 
other locations.<p>


<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

Students must successfully complete approximately 45 credits in communication sciences and disorders. 
With the guidance of their faculty advisor, they may also identify other courses that complement their individual program of study.  In addition to the academic course requirements, you'll need to complete observation and supervised clinical practicum or other field experience.  Like all other Marywood
 students, you'll need to complete 64 credits in the College's liberal arts and skill core curriculum.<p>


<h3>Sample Communication Sciences and Disorders Courses</h3>

<p>

<h3>Just the Facts</h3>

Student: faculty ratio: 40:1<br>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Education</h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Kathleen O'Neill Ruthkosky, Ph.D.</i></h2>

<br clear=left><hr>


At Marywood, you'll begin field experience 
in teaching during freshman year, find 
supportive faculty and first-rate facilities dedicated to your development as a teacher and benefit from a program whose graduates are actively recruited. <p>

Teacher education has been a vital part of Marywood's tradition for more than 75 years but that doesn't mean you'll find an "old school" approach here.  Instead, you'll benefit from an innovative, personalized program that balances the theory and research you discuss on campus with practical application of that 
knowledge in classrooms on campus (day care and preschool), and in the local area (kindergarten through grade 12).<p>

Effective teachers today need a complex set of skills.  Your professors in Marywood's Department of Undergraduate Education will help you develop your abilities to teach effectively by using a variety of instructional techniques to foster creativity, to actively engage your students in problem-solving and other 
learning activities, and to create an intellectually exciting learning environment.  The knowledge you gain in Marywood's program and put to use when you become a teacher will have a direct impact on the future: 
you'll learn how to encourage your students to be lifelong learners, cooperate and collaborate with each other, develop responsibility, respect individual and cultural differences, apply the principles of wellness 
to their daily lives, and understand their civic responsibility for an interdependent and just world.  You'll graduate prepared to live responsibly in an interdependent world the goal of every Marywood student's 
education and prepared to help your students do so as well!<p>

<h3>Faculty </h3>

You'll find a group of professional, caring faculty members in education, committed to helping you 
become the best teacher you can be.  Faculty teach the education courses, advise you on course selection and research projects, and still find time to keep up-to-date on current educational strategies through their 
own research.  Recently, <b>Professor Burkhouse</b> published an article in the <i>Technology and Teacher Education Annual</i> and collaborated on another which appeared in <i>Cooperative Learning: The Magazine for Cooperation in Education</i>.  <b>Professor Ruthkosky</b> published an article in the <i>International Journal of Media</i>.  Both professors gave presentations at the Joint Conference of the 
International Society for Exploring Teaching Alternatives and at The Institute for the Study of Post-secondary Education.<p>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The education program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with state-of-the-art 
technology.  The department maintains a curriculum laboratory of texts, manipulative materials, and software designed for K-12 programs.  You'll find a media center with sophisticated resources, including 
interactive video for instruction and computer labs offering access to the Internet.  If your goal is to work with infants, toddlers, and preschool-age children, you'll be pleased to know that you can observe and 
teach right on campus, in Marywood's own childcare and preschool programs! <p>

<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work </h3>


You'll find plenty of opportunities in the northeastern Pennsylvania region to test the knowledge you gain 
at Marywood.  You'll complete at least seven semesters of field experience in rural, urban, and suburban schools.  This experience incudes two student teaching placements in schools chosen from a diverse 
selection within 35 miles of the College.  If that sounds like a lot to chose from and to arrange, don't worry: the Office of Professional Education Field Experience coordinates all field placements and student 
teaching assignments.<p>

<h3>Areas of Teacher Certification Preparation</h3>

Marywood's education programs are accredited by the prestigious National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.  The programs leading to undergraduate degrees with professional education certification are designed for students like 
you, who wish to excel in their teaching careers.  Preparation is intended to qualify graduates to seek certification in 15 areas.<p>

<h3>Requirements of the Program </h3>

Marywood's education department has major responsibility for preparing students in elementary education 
(grades K-6) and early childhood education (N-3).  The department cooperates with many other departments to offer the professional education components for prospective teachers of the disciplines 
listed above.  Elementary education students at Marywood earn 65-66 credits in the core liberal arts and skills curriculum.  Additionally,  they complete 48 professional education credits and 18-24 credits in a 
minor of their choice, including: art, communication arts, deaf studies, early childhood, English, foreign language, health and physical education, mathematics, music, psychology, religious studies, science, 
social science, and special education.  Students in secondary and K-12 programs major in their discipline and complete a professional education sequence of approximately 30 credits.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2> English </h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Philip J. Tama, D.Ed.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>


At Marywood, you'll find a comprehensive 
curriculum in English and world literature, 
a dedicated and engaging faculty and a background in critical thinking and writing that will serve you well whatever your goals.<p>

Some people wonder what you can do with an English major; but we take a different approach:  What can't you do with an English major?  At Marywood, you'll develop your abilities to think, to write, to 
communicate: skills that you can call on everywhere from the classroom to the office to the information superhighway.  You'll be required to think critically and analyze what you read for quality, merit, and reason.<p>

But Marywood's program goes well beyond these marketable skills.  You'll find a faculty committed to helping you learn to appreciate literature for its inherent beauty and power and for its relevance to contemporary life.  The background you'll gain in English and other world literatures and the histories 
and cultures behind them will help prepare you to realize the goal of every Marywood student's education: you'll be learning to live responsibly in an interdependent world.<p>



<h3>Faculty</h3>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Foreign Languages</h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Mary Elizabeth Kenny, Ph.D.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>



At Marywood, you'll find a diverse and accessible faculty, a comprehensive and practical curriculum reflecting the latest 
in foreign language teaching  and the chance to polish your skills in study abroad.<p>

As you are probably well aware, the world has been "shrinking" as a result of technological advances and the pace of this change is likely to increase as we move into the twenty-first century.  Study in French and Spanish at Marywood will help prepare you for the rewards and challenges of living in this increasingly 
interdependent world, by developing both your ability to communicate in another language and your awareness of historical and contemporary culture in countries where these languages are spoken.<p>

You'll have a choice of options:  majoring in French or Spanish; doing a double major in French and Spanish; majoring in either language as a path to certification to teach; or majoring in International 
Business, a joint program between Marywood's foreign language and business departments.  Whichever you choose, you'll be encouraged to pursue some of your studies abroad: in France or at Canada's Laval University for French; in a Spanish or Latin American university for Spanish.<p>


Language study opens doors.  Your work at Marywood (which may also include elementary and intermediate study in German) can prepare you to enter and advance in a wide variety of fields such as 
education, international business, banking, government service, international relations, public relations, telecommunications, journalism, health services, and social welfare.  You'll be well on your way to 
achieving the goal of every Marywood student's education: learning to live responsibly in an interdependent world.<p>

<h3>Faculty</h3>

The foreign language faculty is highly qualified, culturally diverse, and dedicated to the field and their students.  You'll have the chance to learn from them in small classes and will find them accessible when 
you want to discuss your individual goals.  Faculty teach the classes, advise on course selection, share knowledge of study abroad opportunities, and still find time to pursue their own research.  They have recently presented papers at regional,  national, and international conferences on topics as varied as 
"Women under Franco: from Dictatorship to Democracy," and "Migrations and Immigrations: Who are We?"  A French professor and two students who participated in the research presented a paper on the use of French theater and storytelling in the classroom.  Another professor  collaborated on the Anthology of Hispanic Women, published in 1994.  You'll find each professor's research interest listed below you'll find their enthusiasm contagious!<p>


<b>Mary Elizabeth Kenny, Ph.D.</b>, Chair  (use of video in the language classroom)<p>
<b>Claudine Chartrand-Wright, Ph.D.</b>  (theater and storytelling in the French classroom)<p>
<b>Teresa Morrison, M.A.</b>  (pedagogy)<p>
<b>Alice Reyes, M.A.</b>  (pedagogy)<p>
<b>Jose E. Reyes, Ph.D.</b>  (Middle Ages; Catalan literature)<p>
<b>Victoria Jaen-Andres, Ph.D.</b>  (Hispanic women in film)<p>
<p>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The foreign languages program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with state-
of-the-art technology.  You'll find computer facilities in the Learning Resources Center (LRC) with the latest in word processing and statistical software, as well as access to the Internet.  Laser disc and 
interactive video programs are also available.   The library, also located in the LRC, has holdings of more than 200,000 volumes; 1,100 periodicals; and 40,000 nonprint items.  The library also participates in a 
national and international interlibrary loan with 5,000 other libraries.<p>

<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work</h3>

You'll find plenty of opportunities to increase your knowledge and put theory into practice in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre region.  If you study Spanish, for example, you'll be encouraged to work within 
the local Hispanic community, in ESL classes or as part of the College's program for migrants.  There's also an active French-speaking community in the area; they welcome students to practice conversational 
skills and join them in the celebration of holidays. If you're preparing to teach, you'll have the opportunity 
to begin getting field experience in your freshman year.  Students with an interest in international business can pursue internships at local banks and businesses or in multinational companies 
headquartered in this region.  And, of course, you'll have the chance to go well beyond the local region if you choose to study abroad!<p>

<h3>Rquirements of the Program</h3>

<b>B.A. in French; B.A. in Spanish</b><br>
For those students majoring in French or Spanish (but not seeking teacher certification), 33 credits in French language courses or 33 credits in Spanish language courses are required.  Students concentrating in one foreign language are encouraged to begin the study of a second foreign language.  A double major in French and Spanish may be pursued by taking 24 credits (beyond introductory level) in the second language.<p>

For students seeking K-12 educational certification in either language, 30 foreign language department 
credits (including the three-credit course "Structure of English") are required.  Such students must also take the professional component of courses from the education and special education departments.  Students seeking certification in a second language, or Elementary Education majors who wish to 
concentrate in French or Spanish, must complete credits in the language, exclusive of introductory coursework. Some of the required credits in these programs will count toward the 64 credits in core liberal 
arts and skills required of every Marywood student.<p>

<b>B.A. in International Business</b><br>
Students majoring in international business are required to take 21 credits in French or Spanish and 
45 credits as outlined by Business and Managerial Sciences Department.  Students are ordinarily expected to spend at least a semester studying abroad.  As above, some of these credits will count toward the 64 credits in core liberal arts and skills required of every Marywood student.<p>

<b>Minor in French or Spanish</b><br>
An 18-credit minor (exclusive of introductory level coursework) is available in French or Spanish.  This popular option works especially well with majors in business, health sciences, or social service fields.<p>

<h3>Just the Facts</h3>

Average class size: 15<br>

<b>Degrees offered:</b> B.A. in French; B.A. in Spanish; B.A. in International Business<p>

<b>After Marywood:</b>  the majority of graduates go directly into careers, including recently as a professional observer for the U.N.; a Peace Corps volunteer; a sales vice president for a multinational firm; an account executive for a Fortune 500 company; and many teachers.  Others go on for further study, including recently at: American University, Boston College, George Washington, Northwestern, Notre Dame and the University 
of Madrid.<p>

<h2><i>Foreign Languages...your passport to success.</i></h2>
<hr>
<b>STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY</b><br>
In order to leave responsibly in an interdependent world where scientific and
technological
advances are breaking down national boundaries, students must learn to
understand, appreciate and
respect other languages and cultures. The student who is able to communicate in
other language
develops a world consciousness, an increased cultural awareness that enables
the student to pursue
truth with more understanding of social concern for others. Improved
communication skills
provide better understanding of our partners in interdependence.<p>

<b>PROGRAMS</b><br>
The Department of Foreign Languages offers a major program in French and
Spanish. The
department also offers a major in International Business in cooperation with
the Department of
Business and Managerial Science.
A minor in TESOL (Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages) is
designed to prrovide
students with the professional training necessary to work effectively with
students whose language
is not English.<p>

<b>FACULTY QUALIFICATIONS</b>  <br>
Marywood's foreign language faculty is made up of highly qualified professors,
able to provide an
in-depth understanding of the culture and people of the country whose language
they teach. All
have studied, traveled or lived in those countries.<p>

<b>STUDIES ABROAD</b> <br>
The Department of Foreign Languages has a study abroad advisor who gives
students individual
assistance in selecting a study abroad program which matches their particular
needs. All students
are strongly encouraged to spend either a semester, a summer, or a year abroad
to deepen their
understanding of the culture as well as the language. <p>

<H2>Music</H2>

<H2>Chairperson: Sister Joan Paskert, I.H.M., M.M.<BR>
</H2>
<HR>

<P>
At Marywood, you'll find a variety of music degree programs, integrating
a strong liberal arts program with excellent music preparation,
small classes and personal attention from faculty - and the chance
to perform with other hard-working and fun-loving music students.
<P>
Music has been at the heart of Marywood since the beginning: the
bachelor of music degree was one of the first degrees granted
by the College.Today's program offers you the opportunity to earn
your degree in music education, performance, church music, or
music therapy. You'll join a department of gifted musicians with
a sense of purpose and tremendous camaraderie. From the start,
you'll have opportunities to perform solo or in ensembles. You
can participate in Project Voice, a unique vocal program with
daily warm-ups, a master class and a weekly applied lesson. Cultural
opportunities abound, with local chorale and orchestra concerts
and trips to New York to see performing artists. Renowned artists-
national and international- come to campus to perform in the annual
benefit concert to raise money for music scholarships.
<P>
You'll leave Marywood with excellent preparation for a career
as a teacher, music therapist, church organist or choir director,
performer, music librarian, arranger, music journalist, or any
number of other careers focused on music. You'll also leave with
a sense of how music can serve people, communities, and society
as a whole. Indeed, you'll be on your way toward the goal of every
Marywood student's education: learning to live responsibly in
an interdependent world.
<H3>Faculty</H3>

<P>
You'll find the music faculty members are dedicated professionals
committed to helping you develop your musical talents. They are
gifted musicians,and most are active performers. They teach the
music classes, advise students on course selection and performance
opportunities, and serve as mentors to aspiring musicians. In
addition, they find time to publish original compositions, musical
arrangements and articles in professional journals (including
book and music reviews). <B>Professor Herrema</B> was commissioned
to write a major choral-orchestral work to celebrate 150 years
of IHM Community and 80 years of Marywood. <B>Sister Joan Paskert</B>
serves as president of the <B>Pennsylvania Music Teachers Association</B>.

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Nursing</h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Mary Alice Golden,  Ph.D.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>



At Marywood, you'll find supportive faculty, state-of-the-art facilities, a wealth of internship opportunities 
and a traditional success rate of 100% of graduates passing the national nursing licensing exam the 
first time.<p>

In the complex world of modern health care, nurses are called upon to make critical decisions, design and analyze nursing care and treatment, master state-of-the-art technology, and communicate as advocates and teachers with other health care professionals, patients, and the public.  Preparing you to meet these challenges as a committed and caring professional is at the heart of Marywood's program.  <p>

Knowledgeable and involved teachers will work closely with you to be sure you take advantage of leading-
edge scientific facilities at Marywood, opportunities in the local region for hands-on clinical experience, and nursing research from around the globe.  You'll leave Marywood prepared to practice in a variety of health care settings: critical care, community health, public health, primary care, acute care, and mental health care.  Add to Marywood's five-semester sequence of nursing courses the broadening foundation of 
the core curriculum in the liberal arts that is part of every Marywood student's experience, and you will be prepared to continue developing personally and professionally, working to meet human needs.  Indeed, you'll be ready to begin living responsibly in an interdependent world: the goal of every Marywood 
student's education, and especially significant for you as a nurse. <p>

<h3>Faculty</h3>

Professors in the nursing program are committed to the nursing profession and to their students.  They 
understand the balance between research and clinical practice that serves as the foundation of a nursing 
career.  Faculty teach the nursing courses, supervise clinical and other practical experience, advise on course selection and local internship opportunities, and still find time to continue their own research 
(you'll see their research interests listed below).  Recently, <b>Professor Perdew</b> published a book on AIDS; <b>Professor Golden</b> published articles in <i>Geriatric Nursing Journal</i> and <i>Journal 
of Long Term Care</i>; <b>Professor McGurk</b> researched turnover in nurse aide employment; <b>Professor Gallagher</b> contributed to <i>Nurse Practitioner Journal</i> and presented a paper at an 
international conference in England; and <b>Professor Gilpin</b> has presented seminars on home health care needs of the critically ill child.    <p>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>


The nursing program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with state-of-the-art technology.  The department is located in the new Center for Natural and Health Sciences, which houses a 
separate nursing computer lab in addition to general computer labs.  You'll find specialized programs in the nursing lab, including CAI (computer-assisted instruction) and NCLEX preparation software, and interactive video capability.

well.  In the nearby Learning Resources Center, you'll find library holdings catalogued on-line of over 200,000 volumes, more than 1,100 journal subscriptions (134 directly related to nursing and medical science), and 40,000 non-print items (600 directly related to nursing and medical science).  The LRC also 
participates in an interlibrary loan network with 5,000 libraries.  The research collection includes The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, International Nursing Index, and Index Medicus.<p>


<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work</h3>

The Scranton-Wilkes Barre region is a great place to apply the nursing knowledge you gain at Marywood.  In addition to getting clinical experience in a variety of hospital settings at three major health care facilities, you'll also have the opportunity to attend regional health-related workshops and seminars.  Internship opportunities abound: at the Community Medical Center, Mercy Hospital's cardiac unit, and Marian Community Hospital.<p>


<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

The  nursing program  consists of 136 credits, 55 of which are nursing credits.  Completion of the nursing program is accomplished by completing, at Marywood, the five senior-level nursing courses and the 
requirements of the College.  Before taking upper division courses, you'll need to successfully complete foundation courses in biology, chemistry, nutrition, psychology, sociology, philosophy, speech, and writing; you'll also take courses in statistics and developmental psychology.  These courses will help you fulfill the liberal arts requirements of the College.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Nutrition and Dietetics</h2>
<h2><i> Chairperson: Marianne Borja, Ed.D., R.D., F.A.D.A.</i></h2>

<br clear=left><hr>



At Marywood, you'll find knowledgeable 
and supportive faculty, a comprehensive program that is the only one in northeastern Pennsylvania and the chance to complete in just 
four years the typical five-year program in nutrition and dietetics.<p>

As you are probably aware from reading newspapers and watching the news, nutrition and dietetics are "hot" topics.  As we approach the twenty-first century, finding answers to questions about the best diet 
for people at various stages of the life cycle, the relationship of diet to health, and feeding world populations, is critical.  A Marywood education will help prepare you for leadership and service in this ever-changing and rapidly-growing field.  Dietitians/nutritionists educated at Marywood are prepared for 
involvement in medical nutrition therapy, community nutrition, food systems management, health promotion and clinical nutrition, private practice, sports nutrition, education, business, and research.<p>

You'll find flexibility in the nutrition and dietetics program.  Students may complete four years of study at Marywood and then pursue a one-year accredited internship.  Qualified, highly motivated students may 
apply during the second semester of their sophomore year for the coordinated program which combines 
the traditional four-year program plus internship into a four- year program.  Either way, you'll learn the high-tech science of applying food and nutrition to health, and be prepared to take the National 
Registration Examination for Dietitians and to abide by the American Dietetics Association Code of Ethics.  Beyond that, you'll leave Marywood ready to put into action the College's goal for every student: 
living responsibly in an interdependent world.<p>


<h3>Faculty</h3>

Your professors at Marywood are dedicated to the field of nutrition and dietetics and to preparing students for rewarding professional careers.  All have strong academic backgrounds and most are Registered Dietitians so you'll be learning from the pros.  The faculty teach the nutrition classes, provide guidance in 
student research projects, advise on course selection, and still find time to conduct their own research. Currently, three professors have a major grant for study of "Health and Nutrition of Children in Military 
Families."  Their talents are recognized beyond Marywood: for example, <b>Professor Borja</b> won the American Dietetics Association's Award for Outstanding Educator of Coordinated Programs in 1996; and <b>Professor Harrison,</b> Director of Education and Professional Development, serves as an officer of the Practice Group for Dietitians in Nutrition Support.<p>

<b>Marianne Borja, Ed.D., R.D., F.A.D.A.</b>, Co-Chair  <br>
(food science, community nutrition, food systems management)<p>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The nutrition and dietetics program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with state-of-the-art technology.  In addition to the program's own food lab, you'll find computer facilities with 
the latest word processing and statistical software in the Learning Resources center (LRC); the computer labs are open to all regularly enrolled undergraduates.  The library, also located in the LRC, has holdings 
of more than 200,000 volumes; 1,100 periodicals; and 40,000 nonprint items.  The library also participates in a national and international interlibrary loan network with 5,000 other libraries.<p>

<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work </h3>

You'll find a wealth of opportunities to put theory into practice in the greater Scranton-Wilkes Barre region.  Marywood's nutrition and dietetics program is affiliated with sixty facilities for supervised 
practical experience.  These include health care facilities acute, long-term, and rehabilitative community agencies, fitness programs, government agencies, school districts, child care facilities, home health organizations, and facilities for the elderly.<p>

<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<h2><i> Chairperson: Michael A. Foley, Ph.D.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>


At Marywood, you'll find an involved 
and engaging faculty, a program that challenges you to examine critically life's ultimate questions and a background that will serve you well whatever your goals.<p>

If you join faculty members in Marywood's philosophy department in agreeing with Socrates that "the 
unexamined life is not worth living," you'll value the chance to examine life from a variety of philosophical perspectives.  You'll have the opportunity to become familiar with philosophical theories 
regarding such areas as art, education, history, religion, law, and society, and to study ethical issues in 
relation to business, the environment, and medicine.  You can survey the work of important American philosophers, inquire into the nature and value of sport and play and even analyze sources for the development of your own possible contributions to a more compassionate, just, and peaceful world.<p>


As you might imagine, such studies in philosophy can prepare you for any number of future endeavors (as well as for your own personal fulfillment).  The very nature of Marywood's program requires you to use 
your philosophy studies in conjunction with other studies: The major is offered on an ad hoc basis as part of a double major with another discipline.  Perhaps you're considering law, business, or medicine as a profession.  Perhaps you're thinking of politics or diplomacy. Perhaps you foresee a career in teaching or 
environmental preservation.  Any of these and more can be enhanced through the study of philosophy.  
Whatever your goal, the philosophy program can help prepare you to reach it and to reach the goal of every Marywood student's education: learning to live responsibly in an interdependent world.<p>


<h3>Faculty</h3>

You'll find the faculty  members in philosophy to be committed both to teaching and to involvement in the field.  All faculty members have earned doctorates in philosophy.  They teach the courses, advise on course selection, counsel students on applications of philosophy to future goals, and still find time to 
pursue their own research and writing projects.  Several have received prestigious post-doctoral study grants through the National Endowment for the Humanities.  All serve as expert reviewers for books in 
the field, and publish in the leading philosophy journals.  In addition, <b>Professors Foley and Mohan </b>have co-authored two introductory philosophy texts.  You'll find the faculty's research interests listed below.<p>

<b>Michael A. Foley, Ph.D.</b>, Chair  <br>
(law and society; courts in American society; death penalty; insanity defense)<p>

<b>Sister Dorothy Haney, I.H.M., Ph.D.</b> <br>
 (social ethics and justice, especially in the pursuit of peace; the philosophy of Gandhi; Utopian theory)<p>

<b>William J, Mohan, Ph.D.</b>  (ethics; politics; biomedical ethics)<p>

<b>Peter H. Spader, Ph.D.</b><br>
(phenomenology; business ethics; the philosophy of Scheler; teaching strategies)<p>


 
<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The philosophy program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with state-of-the-
art technology.  You'll find computer facilities with the latest word processing and statistical software in the Learning Resources Center (LRC); these labs are available to all regularly enrolled undergraduates.  
The library, also located in the LRC, has holdings of more than 200,000 volumes; 1,100 periodicals and 40,000 nonprint items.  The library also participates in a national and international interlibrary loan 
network with 5,000 other libraries.<p>



<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

<i>All Marywood students are required to take three courses 
in Philosophy.</i><p>

<b>Philosophy Major</b><br>
Students can pursue an ad hoc major in philosophy in conjunction with a major in another discipline (i.e., a major in philosophy is available only as part of a double-major program).  Students have found the ad hoc major valuable in combination with any number of other disciplines, including pre-law, social 
sciences,  English, foreign languages, psychology, religious studies, and the physical sciences.  The philosophy major requires 36 philosophy credits chosen in consultation with the department chairperson.<p>


<b>Philosophy Minor</b><br>

Students who choose to minor in philosophy are required to take 18 philosophy credits.  Six credits are to 
be taken in the required courses "Introduction to Philosophy" and "Critical Thinking"; the remaining twelve credits may be elected from any category.<p>



<h3>Sample Philosophy Courses</h3>

Critical Thinking<br>
Biomedical Ethics<br>
Perspectives on Women<br>
Utopian Thought<br>
Philosophy, Society, and Law<br>
Philosophy of Art<br>
Perspectives on Punishment<br>
Political Philosophy<br>
Business Ethics<br>
Philosophy of Religion<br>
Environmental Ethics<br>

<br><p>

<h3>Just the Facts</h3>

Average class size: 22<br>

<b>After Marywood:</b>  While some graduates go on to graduate studies in philosophy, the majority use their Marywood studies as a basis for personal enrichment and professional development.  Philosophy majors and minors are strong candidates for law, medical, public administration, and business school programs.<p>

Even if you're not in the clinical practices 
track, you'll be encouraged to participate in field experiences in these and other settings, and will have the chance to join field trips to various institutions in the region.  Another advantage of Marywood's location is the availability of guest speakers representing a variety of professions in the field.<p>

<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

Students majoring in psychology are required to complete 45 credits in psychology, 30 of which are to be taken in a specified core sequence, and 15 chosen as electives.  You'll also be advised to take a course in statistics for the behavioral sciences and, if possible, one semester of anatomy and physiology.  If you're 
interested in a career in the clinical psychology area either immediately after graduation or after graduate study in clinical psychology you'll want to follow the clinical practices track, which requires a nine-credit course sequence including an internship experience.<p>

Students who wish to minor in psychology must complete 21 credits, arranged in consultation with the department chair.  If you're highly motivated and qualified, you may have the chance to begin graduate study in psychology or counseling in your senior year, through cooperation with Marywood's Graduate Department of Counseling and Psychology.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Religious Studies</h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Michael A. Fuchs, Ed.D.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>


At Marywood, you'll find a caring faculty 
committed to helping you explore the ultimate human questions (and your own), the opportunity to test your beliefs in regional or international settings  and a foundation for your own spiritual development or for ministry to others.<p>


The religious studies program is central to the Marywood experience; indeed, every Marywood student takes three courses in the department.  For students majoring or minoring in religious studies, the 
department offers a wide range of study of the beliefs, practices, and values of the Judeo-Christian tradition as well as other religious traditions.  While special attention is given to the Catholic tradition, the offerings are broad enough to benefit you in your own search for religious meaning and for a basis in 
making ethical decisions.  You'll graduate with general knowledge in scripture, morality, sacramental basics, and spirituality, and with a background in ministry.  You'll be prepared to carry out Marywood's goal for all students: learning to live responsibly in an interdependent world.<p>


<h3>Faculty </h3>

The faculty in the religious studies department represent a variety of backgrounds and experience and, while their grounding is academic, they are sensitive to students' religious needs beyond theory.  The 
members of the faculty know each other well and have worked together for a long time: you'll benefit from their long experience in working with students.  They teach the department's courses; supervise your field experiences; advise you on course selection, research projects, and matters of faith; lead the Bible 
tours; and still find time to conduct their own research.  In addition to publishing numerous articles on timely theological issues in newspapers and magazines, faculty have recently presented papers on Karl Barth, The Peace Movement, and The Role of Play in Theology. <p>

<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

You'll find computer facilities with the latest in word processing and statistical software in the Learning Resources Center (LRC); these labs are available to all regularly enrolled 
undergraduates.  The library, also located in the LRC, has holdings of more than 200,000 volumes, 1,100 periodicals and 40,000 non-print items; the library also participates in a national and international 
interlibrary loan network with 5,000 other libraries.<p>

<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work</h3>

If you're interested in using your studies at Marywood as the basis for hands-on experience, you'll find a wealth of opportunities in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre region.  The variety of internship options is as broad 
as the range of student interests.  Religious studies majors observe, study, and work in schools and in youth education and ministry programs.  <p>


<h3>Beyond the Region: International Opportunities</h3>

If you are committed  or want 
to test your commitment  to sharing your talent and compassion with a different population, you may want to participate in the department's International Service Program, which is offered in alternate summers.  
With the approval of the department chair, you'll observe and participate in the culture of a Third World country, preceded and followed 
by a period of reflection and research.<p>

Another meaningful international experience available to Marywood religious studies students is the Biblical Study Tour offered in alternate summers.  With approval of the department chair, you'll 
participate in a two-week, academically oriented study program in the lands of the Bible, preceded and followed by a period of reflection and research.<p>


<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

For the major, 36 credit hours in religious studies are required (nine of these credits also help fulfill the 
College requirement of 64 credits in the core liberal arts and skills curriculum).  With the advice and approval of the faculty, majors can pursue one of the following areas of concentration: one for majors who intend to engage in some form of church ministry (such as director of religious education, teacher of 
religion, or youth minister); another for those who want to concentrate their study in the Christian tradition; and a third concentration for those majors pursuing the study of religion as a phenomenon.  All three concentrations prepare a student for graduate work.<p>

For students who wish to minor in religious studies, 18 credit hours are required.  Such a minor can be combined effectively with a major in many other fields, including psychology, music, social work, or elementary education.  <p>


<h3>Sample Religious Studies Courses</h3>

Jesus in the Twentieth Century Perspective	<br>
Modern Belief<br>
Christian Spirituality<br>
Religion and Education<br>
The Catholic Experience<br>
Christian Marriage<br>
Introduction to Eastern Religions<br>
Death and Afterlife<br>
Foundations of Christian Morality<br>


<h3>Just the Facts</h3>

Average class size: 10-12 for major courses; 27 for general courses<br>
Degree earned: Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies<p>

<b>After Marywood:</b> Most graduates go directly into such fields as youth ministry and teaching religion while pursuing graduate study.  Recently, graduates have gone on to Notre Dame, Boston College, University of Scranton and Catholic University.<p>

<P>
The science program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide
all students with state-of-the-art technology. The new $6.4 million
Center for Natural and Health Sciences is equipped with four large
laboratories, an environmental wet laboratory, a greenhouse, three
computer laboratories and a multi-media auditorium. Computer software
available to students includes word processing, spreadsheet, statistical
and science programs; you'll also find audio-visual tutorial services.
<H3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work</H3>

<P>
You'll find plenty of opportunities in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre
region to add to and share your knowledge, whether your future
plans involve the health professions, environmental work, teaching
or business. There are many modern medical facilities in the area
which serve as resources for internships and beginning experiences
in medicine and related areas. A number of government agencies,
such as the Lackawanna Conservation District, offer the chance
for practical experience. Internships for environmental science
and biology majors are available at Connaught Laboratories, the
Lackawanna Wildlife Sanctuary, the National Institute of Environmental
Renewal, and Sierra Laboratory. Indeed, Marywood students have
access to and utilize the Sierra Laboratory, located near campus,
for environmental and biological research; students gain experience
with modern instrumentation, such as gas chromatographs, UV systems
and ion selective meters; inductively coupled plasma (ICP); and
other major pieces of analytical instrumentation. You might also
choose to participate in local groups such as the Earth Conservancy,
CARE, and the Sierra Club.
<H3>Requirements of the Program</H3>

<P>
<B>B.S. in Biology/Preprofessional Studies</B>
<P>
The preprofessional studies program focuses on preparing students
who plan to enter the various professions of medicine- including
physician, dentist, osteopath, veterinarian or researcher- but
offers sufficient flexibility to prepare students for future studies
in law, business administration, and education, and to enter the
ancillary fields of the healing professions. A minimum of 44 credits
in biology is required for the major, as well as required courses
in chemistry, math and physics, which total 30 credits.
<P>
<B>B.S. in Biology/Pre-Chiropractic Program</B>
<P>
This program allows students to begin study in chiropractic medicine
during the senior year. Students complete 106 credits in science
and liberal arts requirements in their three years at Marywood;
the fourth year is spent at New York Chiropractic College. After
the first year of chiropractic study, the student earns Marywood's
B.S. in Biology; another two years and four months of study lead
to the Doctor of Chiropractic degree.
<P>
<B>B.S. in Environmental Science</B>
<P>
This program is designed for the student interested in a career
as a professional environmental scientist, professor, teacher,
research specialist, ecologist, or science executive. The curriculum
provides background for the graduate work and advanced degrees
required by some of these career choices. A total of 58 credits
in biology, chemistry, environmental science, math and physics
are required plus 15 credits of electives.
<P>
<B>B.S. in Medical Technology/Clinical Laboratory Science</B>
<P>
Students can choose one of two options in this program:
<OL>
<LI>Students spend three years at Marywood fulfilling the College

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Special Education</h2>
<h2><i>Chairperson: Anthony C. Russo, Ed. D.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>



At Marywood, you'll find an outstanding  
program (one of only 200 in the country 
approved by the Council for Exceptional Children), a faculty committed to helping you excel and the chance to  join graduates who routinely score well above the state average in this specialty area on the National Teachers Examination.<p>

     As the twenty-first century approaches, there is both greater awareness of the variety of special human needs and of the variety of options to enable the physically and mentally disabled live fuller and more rewarding lives.  Opportunities for careers in special education have never been greater or more satisfying than now.<p>

Marywood's program prepares you for the challenges and rewards of teaching persons with physical and/or mental disabilities at all levels of development from birth to age twenty-one.  Your coursework in 
professional studies and liberal arts taught in small classes and enhanced with real-world experience beginning in your freshman year will emphasize creative thinking, the evaluation of contemporary educational issues, and development of leadership skills.  The faculty will consider you a professional 
colleague as well as a student: students are required to maintain professional memberships in the Marywood chapters of Council for Exceptional Children and Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens.  You'll graduate prepared to be a leader in the areas of mental retardation, behavior disorders, 
learning disabilities, and multiple disabilities; you'll be ready to serve as a teacher in grades K through 12 in a school or residential setting, as a professional in adult services, or in another position of responsibility in this growing field.<p>

The goal of every Marywood student's education learning to live responsibly in an interdependent world is especially significant for those pursuing studies in special education.  You'll graduate exceptionally well prepared to make a difference in the lives of others.<p>

<h3>Faculty</h3>

You'll find the faculty members in special education to be professional and supportive.  They have experience in both regular and special education classrooms, as well as in a variety of service agencies; and they will work closely with you to prepare you to be a competent, responsible teacher and advocate for 
persons with disabilities.  Faculty who teach the special education classes, help you choose sites for practical experience, supervise your field and teaching experiences, advise you on course selection, support your research efforts, and still find time to keep up with the field through their own research (you'll find their research interests listed below).  Recently, <b>Professor Russo</b>  presented papers at state and 
regional conferences on <i>"Portfolio Assessment"</i> and <i>"Inclusion and the Regular Educators."</i><p>

<b>Dr. Anthony C. Russo, Ed. D.</b>, Chair<br>
(teacher attitudes towards inclusion; inclusion practices)	<p>

<b>*Michael Ostrowski, M.S., Ph.D.</b> candidate<p>

<i>*Part-time</i><p>


<h3>Facilities and Technology</h3>

The special education program benefits from Marywood's commitment to provide all students with state-of-the-art technology.  Specialized facilities for students pursuing special education studies include the 
Microcomputer Center and the Special Education Curriculum Laboratory.  You'll also find an excellent library with many volumes devoted to special education topics, and a collection of audio-visual materials 
related to the major (including a tape collection on individual assessment and teaching modules for early intervention and the at-risk infant).  <p>

<h3>The Regional Advantage: Putting Knowledge to Work</h3>


You'll find plenty of opportunities in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre region to test the knowledge you gain at Marywood.  From the beginning of your freshman year, you'll participate in field experiences in public 
and private residential facilities and local special education classrooms.  Among the sites to choose from are the Lourdesmont Center (a facility for emotionally and socially disturbed adolescents); the Friendship 
House Children's Center (offering mental heath and mental retardation services); the Northeast 
Intermediate Unit; and the Scranton school district.  As a freshman, you'll observe students with various exceptionalities in diverse educational settings.  Sophomores are assigned as active participants in specific 
academic support areas.  By junior year, you'll begin diagnostic evaluation and prescriptive teaching; 
seniors do formal student teaching culminating in total classroom responsibility.  Along the way, you'll be guided by college faculty members and elementary and secondary school teachers.<p>


<h3>Requirements of the Program</h3>

The major in special education requires completion of 126 credits, 61 of which are requirements of the major (including courses in special education, general education, and psychology).  All undergraduate 
students at Marywood earn 64 credits in the core liberal arts and skills curriculum; you'll need to take specific courses within the liberal arts requirement to support the major (don't worry: you'll find these courses noted in the department handbook given to all enrolled special education students).  When you 
complete the departmental requirement, achieve certain competencies, and complete the appropriate NTE (National Teachers Exam) components, you'll be granted an Instructional I Certificate in special education of children and youth with mental/physical disabilities.<p>

You will also have the option of enrolling in the dual certification program with elementary education, which leads to teacher certification in both special and elementary education.  This option requires additional coursework.  Or you may decide to minor in special education, taking 18 credits in special education and spending 20 hours of observation in addition to your major in education.<p>

Whichever you choose, you'll be glad to know that Marywood's special education programs are accredited by the prestigious National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.<p>

<h3>Just the Facts</h3>
 
Student:faculty ratio: 15:1<br>
Average class size: 15<p>

<b>After Marywood:</b> approximately 90% go directly into teaching or other special education careers; approximately 10% go on to graduate study.  Approximately 85% of students attend graduate school on a part-time basis while teaching.  Recent graduates have pursued further study at Bloomsburg University, George Washington University, Marywood College, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Pittsburgh.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1><h2>Art Programs</h2>
<br clear=left>
<h2><i>Chairperson:  Mathew Povse, M.F.A</i></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Philosophy Statement of the Degree and the Department<br></h3>

In conjunction with the mission of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, 
Marywood's Art Department offers the Master of Arts and Master of Fine Arts 
degrees.<p>

The Master of Arts program in Studio Art is intended for graduates of schools 
and departments of art/art education who want to develop their talents as 
studio artists, illustrators and ad designers. Study with outstanding 
practitioners in these fields acts as a springboard for further professional 
growth and education.<p>

There are two tracks within the M.A. Studio Art program: "fine" art and 
"applied" art. The "fine" art track provides concentration within a studio area of emphasis (painting, clay, fibers, metal, printmaking, photography). The "applied" art track in illustration and ad design, "Get Your Master's with the Masters," is for working professionals and is scheduled so that they may 
continue to maintain full-time employment. Further information is available 
upon request from the Art Department.<p>

The Master of Arts program in Art Therapy is designed to help meet the need 
for trained professionals in the mental health field and in education, to assist in the development of persons through self-discovery, self-awareness and personal growth, using art as a catalyst for healing and self-actualization.  <p>

The personal development of the graduate student as therapist is essential to 
this program. Students use art therapy in collaboration with the approaches 
described by psychologists. Through a course of study combining theory and 
practice, the program follows guidelines for art therapy training 
recommended by the American Art Therapy Association.<p>

The Master of Arts Program in Art Education is intended for graduates of 
schools and departments of art/art education who are certified to teach. The 
program is designed to enrich the scope of their professional work and to 
extend their academic status.<p>

The Master of Fine Arts Program in Visual Arts is designed to provide 
professional emphasis for persons with an intense commitment to their art 
who intend to become serious professional artists. Concentrations within this 
program include: Clay, Fibers, Metal, Painting, Printmaking, Photography, Ad 
Design and Illustration. Students interested in the Ad Design or Illustration 
concentrations can begin in summer only.<p>

Each program is supported by accomplished, professional faculty, visiting 
artists of acclaim, impressive exhibit offerings and excellent academic and 
technical resources. In certain programs, there are both requirements and 
opportunities for internships/practica, museum research and study tours-all 
designed to provide experiences of breadth and depth for matriculating 
graduate students.<P>

<h3>Application Requirements</h3>

 Applicants to the M.A. and M.F.A. degree programs must meet the general 
requirements for admission to the Marywood Graduate School of Arts and 
Sciences. In addition, the applicant must satisfy the following: <P>

<h3>M.A. degrees in Studio Art and Art Education prerequisites:</h3>
<OL>
<LI>A baccalaureate degree in art or art education or an equivalent credit 
background in art that would support master's degree work. Any student 
who, in the judgment of the department, lacks adequate undergraduate 
preparation must arrange to make up the deficiency.
<LI>A portfolio of eighteen to twenty slides or original work, submitted no later than one month before the last official registration date. The portfolio 
will be judged on its demonstration of both conceptual ability and technical 
competency. 
</OL><p>
( A maximum of six graduate credits may be accepted for transfer.)<p>


A student must file an application for candidacy when twelve credit hours of 
studio work have been completed. Acceptance as a candidate will be decided 
after the following:<p>
<OL>
<LI>Successful completion of the Graduate Record Examination or the Miller Analogies Test.
<LI>Maintenance of a "B" average or better in twelve studio credits taken at Marywood.
<LI>Submission of a portfolio of work from the studio courses taken at Marywood.
<LI>Approval of the student's potential as a graduate student by a committee from the departmental faculty.
</OL>
<P>
Upon completion of 36 credits, a student must register the intention to bring 
the program to completion by means of a comprehensive examination and 
execution of a Professional Contribution.
<P>


<h3>M.A. degree in Art Therapy prerequisites:</h3>
<OL>
<LI>A baccalaureate degree with a major in art education or studio art, OR a baccalaureate degree in a related field (e.g. psychology, social work, counseling, special education). Students entering the Art Therapy program with either degree must have at least eighteen credits in studio art (color
theory, drawing and painting, figure-drawing/modeling and 3-D media) and twelve credits in psychology (general psychology, developmental psychology, abnormal psychology and personality theories).
<LI>Presentation of a portfolio of art, including significant examples of human figure work in the media noted above.
<LI>An autobiography and statement of academic/professional goal.
<LI>Evaluation of each candidate's individual competencies by an art therapy admissions committee. In addition, a personal interview may be required.
</OL>
<p>
(A maximum of six graduate credits may be accepted for transfer.)
<P>
A student must file an application for candidacy when eighteen credit hours 
have been completed. Acceptance as a candidate will be decided after the 
following:<p>
<OL>
<LI>Successful completion of the Graduate Record Examination or the Miller Analogies Test.
<LI>Maintenance of a "B" average or better in eighteen credits taken at Marywood.
<LI>Approval of the student's potential as a graduate student by a committee from the departmental faculty.

<P>
After 300 hours of practicum experience, the student will be re-evaluated.
Upon completion of 48 credits, a student must register the intention to bring 
the program to completion by means of a comprehensive examination and 
execution of a Professional Contribution.<P>


<h3>M.F.A. degree prerequisites:</h3>
<OL>
<LI>A Bachelor of Arts degree in Art or a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.
<LI>Completion of at least eighteen credits of upper division work in the area of concentration chosen and a "B" or 3.00 quality point average in that area. Students who do not meet the 3.00 grade point average, but who possess outstanding or unusual qualifications that promise a significant contribution to the Master of Fine Arts program, may petition for a special review from the Art Department graduate admissions committee.
<LI>A portfolio of studio work indicative of above-average or exceptional ability. No fewer than twenty 2" X 2" color slides should be presented. The majority of these should be in the area of the applicant's interest, but the portfolio also should include a lesser emphasis in related areas. Slides are to be labeled with the applicant's name, date of execution, size and medium of each work shown.
</OL>
<P>
In addition, a personal interview with the admissions committee may be 
required.<p>

The M.F.A. student is advised to take a minimum of twelve credits per 
semester.<p>

Within the M.F.A. program there are four reviews of work in progress and 
student development. These reviews are held after completion of 12, 24, 36 
and 48 semester hours of course work and are designated as follows: (a) 
Initial Review; (b) Candidacy Review; (c) Progress Review; (d) Qualifying 
Review.<p>

Qualifying Review will take place after the final draft of the thesis project 
(Artist's Statement) and prior to the exhibit.<p>

Failure to satisfy two consecutive reviews will result in 
dismissal from the 
program. A student denied advancement in the M.F.A. program may seek a 
Master of Arts in Studio Art at Marywood.<p>

At the scheduled Candidacy Review, the student must evidence a successful 
completion of the Graduate Record Examination or the Miller Analogies Test. 
At this time, any transfer credits will be evaulated by the department.
Upon completion of 60 credits, a student must register his or her intention to 
bring the program to completion. Thesis statement and one-person exhibit 
are required.<p>

Applications are due December 1st and July 15th.<P>

<H2>Counseling and
Psychology Programs</H2>

<H2><i>Chairperson: Edward J. O'Brien, Ph.D</i>.</H2>
<br clear=left><hr>

The Graduate Department of Counseling and Psychology provides a range of 
programs designed to serve the interests and professional orientations of 
varied human service practitioners.<p>

Specifically, the Department strives:<BR>
(l) To educate students in understanding the complexity of human behavior.<BR>
(2) To educate students to develop and implement intervention strategies to 
assist clients in attaining a higher quality of life.<BR>
(3) To facilitate students' understanding of the varied roles, obligations and 
ethics of human service providers.<BR>
(4) To develop competencies to critically evaluate research theory and 
practice in the human service field.<p>

Programs have sufficient flexibility to permit individual students, under 
advisement, to plan part-time or full-time schedules appropriate to their 
individual needs and professional priorities. Competencies are developed 
through formal courses, independent study and extensive supervised practica 
and internships, both on and off campus.<p>

Student advisement and staffing are essential components of the overall 
training program. Trainee progress is monitored by the faculty during periodic 
staffing sessions. In order to acquire the required competencies, a student 
may need more than the minimum credits required.<p>

The department has a long tradition of preparing professionals for service in 
the educational setting. Educational Specialist certificates and/or degree 
programs are available in secondary school counseling, elementary school 
counseling and school psychology. Those interested in a broader area of 
service may consider the Master of Arts in Counseling with an applied 
emphasis in diverse settings. Also available is a concentration in clinical 
services leading to the Master of Arts in Psychology. Other psychology degree 
options are available for those who wish to develop a systematic 
understanding of human behavior for purposes of self-enrichment, pre-
doctoral preparation and other related purposes.<P>

<h3>Admission Requirements</H3>
Degree students in Counseling or Psychology must meet the general 
admission requirements of the Graduate School. While a strong undergraduate 
background in psychology is preferred, capable students with course work in 
general psychology, developmental psychology and statistics will be 
considered.<p>

All applicants must submit either a Miller Analogies Test score or a Graduate 
Record Examination Aptitude Test score. Additionally, degree applicants may 
be required to participate in an on-campus interview with other applicants 
and faculty. No more than six credits earned prior to full admission may be 
applied to a degree in the Department of Counseling and Psychology.
The faculty of the Graduate Department of Counseling and Psychology believe 
that advisement is a critical component of graduate training. As such, faculty 
are available to students during posted times. While the student's advisor is 
an essential part of the student's progress throughout the program, students 
are reminded that it is the student's responsibility to schedule appointments, 
to register for courses in a timely manner and to submit various 
departmental and Graduate School forms (Candidacy, Comprehensive Exams, 
Professional Contribution, Internship and Graduation). Students should be 
very familiar with the student handbook and consult with their advisor on a 
regular basis.<p>

Details concerning special admissions requirements for the clinical services 
concentration are available upon request from the Department Chairperson 
and are outlined in the Student Handbook. Consideration for this program is 
made only after the student has completed degree candidacy requirements.<P>

<H3>Counseling Programs</H3>
<i>The counseling programs are seeking national accreditation. The total

focus on specific client populations and areas of expertise. A course of 
studies can be designed that emphasizes work with children and adolescents 
or work with adults. Degree students who have long-range school psychology 
certification goals may also wish to consider this option. Choice of electives

<h3>Master of Science in School Leadership</h3>

36 semester hours <br>
The program in SCHOOL LEADERSHIP consists of 36 hours of graduate work. The  
courses are divided into three categories: nine semester hours in core  
courses which are intended to give the student an understanding of research,  
human development and foundations of education; twenty-four semester  
hours in concentration courses which provide an understanding of  
administration, current issues in education, curriculum planning, supervision  
and evaluation of instruction, law, finances, personnel leadership, and an  
internship in a school setting; three semester hours in elective courses. <p>

The purpose of this program is to provide opportunities for the development  
of the administrative and interpersonal skills needed by practicing and future  
leaders in education. The program is built on the assumption that the public  
and non-public school environments are unique. For this reason, courses and  
other learning experiences are deeply grounded in those principles of public  
and non-public thought and practice. Internships are individualized, based on  
needs and interests of school districts and student participants.   <p>

In addition to an initial interview with the Chairperson of the Department, a  
second interview at the time of candidacy with the Chairperson of the  
Department and a panel of administrators and the successful completion of  
course work, the degree candidate is required to complete a Professional  
Contribution consisting of an oral presentation to faculty and students on a  
topic chosen with the Program Director. To be eligible for an elementary or  
secondary school principal's certificate, the candidate must have had five  
years of professional school experience. <p>

<h4>Coordinator: Sister Patt Walsh, I.H.M. </h4>
36 semester hours <br>
Orchestrated using a brain-compatible learning model, the INSTRUCTIONAL  
TECHNOLOGY Program leads to: <p>
<ul>
<li>PDE certification: Instructional Technologist (24 Credits) 
<li>M.S. in Instructional Technology (36 Credits) 
</ul><p>

IT courses are available in a variety of delivery modes; contact the  
Coordinator for details. Both the certification and the degree programs are  
aimed at meeting the needs of technology coordinators as well as classroom  
teachers seeking to maintain competence in the ever emerging field of  
instructional technology. Though K-12 will serve as the primary focus area,  
instruction is relevant to those seeking positions both in higher education and  
in non-traditional educational settings where the skills of an instructional  
technologist are essential to respond to staff development needs. An  
instructional technologist is considered a "generalist" - one who understands  
both the instructional design process and the technologies that can be  
utilized to best meet the learners' needs. <p>

<h3>Reading Specialist Certification</h3>

A student who wishes to concentrate in the field of reading but who does not  
wish to pursue the master's degree program or who already holds a master's  
degree may obtain Reading Specialist certification by taking the 24 semester  
hours from concentration courses in reading. A student seeking only  
certification is required to take at least two-thirds of the 24 credits at  
Marywood College. State regulations in Chapter 49 of the Pennsylvania Code,  
22 PA Code 49.18, require that those seeking their first Instructional I  
Certificates, June 1, 1987 or after, must demonstrate that they have  
successfully completed a teacher certification exam in these four areas: <p>

<b>Core Battery<br>
<ul>
<li>General Knowledge (literature, fine arts, math, science, social studies)
<li>Communication Skills (listening, reading, writing)
<li>Professional Knowledge (instructional skills)
<li>Specialty Area (reading)</b>
 </ul>

<h3>Reading Supervisor Certification</h3>

The Reading Supervisor certification will endorse a Reading Specialist for  
appointment as a Reading Supervisor. Candidates for this post-masters  
certification shall:<p>

1. follow normal application procedures for admission to the Graduate School  
of Arts and Sciences, indicating desire to seek this certification. Candidates  
must possess a 3.0 average in all prior graduate work.<p>

2. successfully complete an interview after six credits if a master's degree in  
reading or master's degree plus Reading Specialist certification were not  
awarded at Marywood College.<p>

3. successfully complete a minimum of eighteen (18) semester hours in the

At the point of admission/acceptance, the Graduate Education Department  
and the Office of Certification will determine if the candidate has met all  
competencies as outlined by the State Department of Education. If it is  
determined that a candidate is lacking in an area typically part of the first  
endorsement (Reading Specialist) more than 18 semester hours may be  
required.<p>

Likewise, if a candidate has fulfilled some of the courses required for the  
supervision certification, the courses will not be repeated. As with all  
certifications, fifty percent of the required courses must be taken at

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Public Administration Programs</h2>

<h2><i>Chairperson: Alice McDonnell, M.P.A., Dr. P.H.</i></h2>
<br clear=left><hr>


<h2>Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) Program</h2>

<h3>Degree Program Overview</h3>
The M.P.A. degree is a broad area professional degree which focuses on 
management skills. A healthy organization results from excellence in 
management, a product of the Marywood M.P.A. program.<p>

<h3>Program Objectives</h3>
The general purpose of the M.P.A. program at Marywood College is the 
administrative training of men and women concerned with the provision of 
public, health and human services. Specifically, the program strives:<p>

1. To expose participants to a wide range of administrative and managerial 
problems, processes, practices and responsibilities involved in providing 
public, health and human services.<br>
2. To prepare participants in planning, organizing, staffing and generally 
implementing and administering public, health and human services.<br>
3. To facilitate the participant's understanding and command of basic theories 
of management and supervision and applied social science theory related to 
the delivery of public, health and human services. <br>
4. To help participants develop analytical and evaluation skills and techniques 
leading to effective managerial decision-making applied to the complex 
task of providing public, health and human services. <br>
5. To help participants develop an awareness of equity and public interest 
concerns and the political process in which they arise.<p>

<b>The Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.)</b> provides entry-level, post-entry-
level and mid-career participants from a variety of public, health and human 
service settings with practical directed experiences involving use of case 
studies, simulations, group discussion and analyses, interpersonal 
development exercises, audiovisual media, field observation and intensive 
course work.<p>

<h3>Formal Concentration in Nonprofit Management Overview</h3>

Nonprofit organizations provide a wide array of important services to the 
community and represent a critical component in the U.S. political economy. 
Nonprofit administrators, attempting to balance the provision of mission-
focused services with increasing demand and declining resources, face many 
distinct challenges. Marywood College has recognized this and established 
this concentration, which responds to the need for advanced education in 
management issues that are related to the provision of nonprofit goods and 
services.<p>

<h3>Formal Concentration in  Criminal Justice Overview</h3>
The Criminal Justice concentration is a program for working professionals and 
students of criminal justice. The concentration in criminal justice offers a 
broad, multidisciplinary, systems-based approach integrating problem-
solving methods in management, organizational dynamics, human resources 
utilization, personnel systems, labor relations and communication processes 
with criminal justice administration, constitutional impact on criminal justice 
administration, corrections, juvenile delinquency and criminology.<p>

The concentration in Criminal Justice at Marywood provides an opportunity 
for a graduate education that combines criminal justice and criminology with 
administrative and management studies. As a result of integrating these two 
complementary fields of study, students are better prepared to contribute to 
and develop more effective planning and analysis in a variety of 
administrative and treatment settings.<p>

<h3>Master of Public Administration/Master of Social Work Overview</h3>

The Master of Public Administration and Master of Social Work is a dual 
degree program which provides an educational experience for students. The 
program is designed to assure the acquisition of both management and social 
work skills necessary for competence as a manager/administrator in the 
social work field. Today social workers must be knowledgeable in managerial 
and administrative problems, processes, practices and responsibilities in their 
role as middle managers, administrators, department heads and in other 
similar capacities. The M.P.A. curriculum follows National Association of 
Schools of Public Affairs and Administration guidelines, and the M.S.W. 
program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.<p>

Upon successful completion of the M.P.A. /M.S.W., a graduate will be qualified 
to accept a middle management position such as social work director or 
program administrator in a community program.<p>

Admission to the M.P.A./M.S.W. program will be on a selective basis. The 
prerequisites and admission process will follow that of the Graduate School of 
Arts and Sciences, Department of Public Administration, and the School of 
Social Work.<p>

A Professional Contribution is required as an application of the theoretical 
base to a practical situation. The guidelines for the School of Social Work and 
Department of Public Administration will be followed. <p>

<h3>Departmental Admissions Requirements</h3>

l.  The admissions application, two references and official transcript from 
previous educational programs, along with an  essay describing the reasons 
why the applicant wishes to pursue a particular program. <br>
2. The GRE  is recommended but not required.<br>

<h3>Other Requirements of M.P.A.</h3>
Each student is required to discuss with his/her assigned faculty advisor the 
application essay which outlines career goals and objectives and their 
relationship to the M.P.A. Students normally should begin their degree studies 
with PUB 501 and PUB 503. <p>

After completion of class course work, a candidate must take the 
Professional Development Seminar. Any candidate who cannot demonstrate a 
clear record of administrative responsibility must pursue a three-credit-hour 
field internship in addition to, and in conjunction with, the Professional 
Development Seminar. A field internship must be arranged six months prior to 
its intended commencement. Internships in public, human and health service 
agencies each consist of twelve weeks of full-time employment or their 
equivalency, on an extended, part-time basis.<p>

The Professional Development Seminar/Internship is an exceptional feature of 
the program, providing each student with an opportunity to apply concepts 
from course work. <p>

The Professional Contribution is a closure requirement which provides the 
student with an opportunity to work with faculty on a research project. The 
Professional Contribution applies theoretical knowledge to a practical 
situation.  Refer to detailed guidelines for closure requirements.<p>

The course on Problem-Solving Methods for Modern Management provides a 
foundation of knowledge about behavior in public organizational settings. 
This required course affords an opportunity for self-appraisal of one's 
practices from a behavioral science perspective, thereby providing a base for 
enlightened choice and change, i.e. personal and organizational. <p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<H2>Special Education Programs<br clear=left>
<EM>Chairperson:  Anthony C. Russo, Ed.D.</EM></H2><hr>

The faculty of the Department of Special Education believes that there is no 
typical at-risk child or adolescent, nor any one curriculum that matches each 
disability. Similarities among all children  are stressed rather than the narrow 
dissimilar features that separate them.<p>

Students explore the total environment of the disabled child and adolescent, 
including the classroom, home and community. Only after developing an 
understanding of children from a variety of perspectives can the teacher 
develop instructional methods and materials that best meet the needs of the 
individual.<p>

Graduates of the program earn a Master of Science in Special Education 
degree which incorporates the following disabilities into a comprehensive 
category: mentally retarded, socially and emotionally disturbed, learning 
disabled and physically disabled.<p>

The program leads to increased competencies in providing services in settings 
such as the regular class with or without supportive services, the resource 
room and various forms of self-contained special classes.<p>

<h3>Aims of the Special Education Department</h3>
To prepare an individual:<p>

1. To be cognizant of normal growth and development patterns and the range 
of deviations which can occur from these patterns.<p>
2. To be able to act as an instructional leader and resource person in his/her 
professional situation.<p>
3. To be able to critically examine major trends and issues in the field and to 
apply this body of information to the professional situation.<p>
4. To be capable of employing a systematic approach to teaching and 
demonstrating a working knowledge of sound research skills in order to 
effectively measure learn-ing performance.<p>

5. To be a guardian of the ethics of the profession and its related duties and 
responsibilities as described in the Code of Ethics of the Council for 
Exceptional Children.<p>

<h3>Department Programs</h3>

Graduate students seeking an advanced degree must successfully complete a 
30-credit course sequence which leads to the Master of Science degree in 
teaching the mildly impaired. This course work also fulfills permanent 
certification requirements for experienced teachers.<p>


<h3>Department Features</h3>
The graduate program in Special Education has earned the distinction of 
meeting the rigorous professional standards of the Council for Exceptional 
Children and the NCATE. In so doing, the department demonstrated state-of-
the-art facilities for library research, curriculum materials and computer 
assisted instruction. The utilization of these resources by students is woven 
into the carefully planned sequence of courses. The graduate program also 
enjoys a strong relationship with area schools and private centers and, from 
time to time, has participated in joint research projects. Area educational 
personnel and model teaching sites are available to strengthen the graduate 
experience.<p>

<h3>Department Requirements</h3>
All students pursuing a graduate program in Special Education must complete 
a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences application.  Degree-seeking students 
must submit their recent scores on the Miller Analogies Test as part of the 
application process.<p>

 Post-baccalaureate certification students are not required to submit a Miller score.  However, they should arrange a meeting 
with the College Teacher Certification Officer early in the application process.
Transfer students are reminded that no more than six hours of credit will be 
applied to the Special Education master's degree and returning students are 
cautioned that "age of credits" will be considered when planning a formal 
program of studies.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certificate</h3>

Students seeking initial certification to teach in the field of special education 
must first apply for graduate school admission. One-half of a student's course 
work must be taken at Marywood in order to receive a recommendation for 
the certificate. The National Teacher Examination Testing Program is required 
for first certification seekers.<p>

The following Special Education course sequence is required in addition to 
general education prerequisites:<p>

S ED 500 Law and Special Education<br>
S ED 506 Instructional Support/Teacher Consultation<br>
S ED 507 Characteristics and Remedial Strategies for the Mildly Impaired <br>
S ED 508 Characteristics and Program Strategies for the Moderately and 
Severely Impaired<br>
S ED 511 Curriculum Adaptations for the Special Needs Learner<br>
S ED 519 Practicum (Second certification only)<br>
S ED 523 Programming for the At-Risk Infant/Preschool Child<br>
S ED 539 Behavior Management Approaches<br>
EDUC 498 Student Teaching (First certification only)<p>

<hr>
<h3>Professional Concentration Options (9 credits required)</h3>
Because students come to Marywood with a broad range of educational and 
professional experiences, they are given considerable flexibility in planning 
their programs of study.<p>

The unusual diversity of programs offered by the graduate faculty provides 
students with the opportunity to combine the study of Special Education with 
other interests by pursuing nine credits of sequenced courses within one of 
the following graduate areas:<p>

A.	Cognitive Rehabilitation/Remediation<br>
B.	Counseling/Psychology<br>
C.	Early Childhood Education<br>
D.	Elementary Education<br>
E.	Instructional Technology<br>
F.	Reading Education<br>
G.	School Leadership<p>

The student must arrange a planning meeting with the chairperson in the 
chosen area immediately following admission into the Department of Special 
Education.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Program of Study</h3>
Degree-seeking students are required to complete a core curriculum which 
includes major issues in the field and develops broad teacher competencies in 
a variety of areas. The following course sequence is suggested, but the

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>The Gerontology Institute </h2>
 <h2><i>Director: Alice McDonnell, M.P.A., Dr. P.H.</i></h2> 
<br clear=left><hr>


Marywood College established the Gerontology Institute in 1978 to provide 
interdisciplinary graduate education focused on the issues of aging. Four 
cooperating graduate programs form the core of the institute. They are the 
master's degree programs in Counseling, Foods and Nutrition, Public 
Administration and Social Work. Faculty members in each of these programs 
offer specialized courses in gerontology to students pursuing graduate 
professional education in a number of service areas.<p>

The Gerontology Institute offers graduate students the opportunity to focus 
their educational experiences on the problems of aging in American society 
and to develop specialized skills that will enable them to better serve the 
large and growing population of elderly in Marywood's service area.<p>

Students may elect to take courses within the institute to augment their 
graduate programs or choose to pursue a Certificate of Specialization in 
Gerontology. Students seeking the certificate must complete twelve graduate 
credits in aging at Marywood. Because needs are so varied, each student's 
course of study is designed with consideration for individual goals, academic 
background and professional experience. Typically, though, students enroll in 
two core courses, GER 510, Concepts and Issues in Aging, and GER 520, 
Psychological Perspectives on the Aging Process, and then select two more 
courses focusing on their own interests. The twelve credits taken in the 
institute also apply to those required for the master's degree. Courses of 
study will be planned in close consultation with the Chairperson of the 
student's master's program to ensure meeting all requirements.<p>

Upon successful completion of twelve credits within the institute and 
satisfaction of requirements for the graduate degree, the institute will award 
a Certificate of Specialization in Gerontology. Applicants who hold a master's 
degree, upon successful completion of twelve credits, will also be awarded 
the Certificate of Specialization. <p>


<h3>Advisory Board</h3>
The Advisory Board of the Gerontology Institute of Marywood College 
functions to involve constituents and other interested parties in the 
programming of the Gerontology Institute and to help the College develop and 
implement an educational program that is responsive to the needs of 
professionals working with the elderly. The Advisory Board acts as a network 
of support and information which is directed toward addressing the 
continuing education needs of those who work with the elderly. The 
membership includes individuals who represent the disciplines of counseling, 
nursing, nutrition, psychology, social work and others interested in serving 
the needs of the elderly. <p>

Introduction</h1>

On November 10, 1845 a young Belgian priest and three young women met in 
Monroe, Michigan, near Detroit to begin an endeavor whose far reaching 
effects they could little imagine.  The priest, Father Louis Florent 
Gillet, had come to Michigan in 1843.  He saw many needs in his mission 
parish which extended as far away as 60 miles in some directions.  His 
parishioners who were composed of French-Canadians, Irish, and Germans 
suffered a great deal from alcoholism.  He believed that education was 
the key to helping the people whom he served to reach their human 
potential.  To that end he recruited Theresa Maxis Duchemin (co-founder) 
and two other young women to found a religious community of sisters and 
establish a school.
<P>                                                                      
Today, 150 years later, this community is known as the Congregation of 
the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary -- or more 
familiarly, as the IHMs.  It consists of three autonomous branches 
centered in Monroe, MI; Philadelphia, PA; and Scranton, PA with a 
combined membership near 3000.  They serve in more than 300 schools, 
including three Congregation-sponsored colleges, as well as serving in the 
fields of medicine, social work, and pastoral care in the United States 
and in many countries around the world.
<P>
The IHMs have touched the lives of many in their rich and vibrant 
history and their story is one that deserves to be told.  Both founders 
encountered great difficulties in their efforts to live out the mission 
to which they believed they were called.  Their struggles against false 
accusation, racial prejudice, gender issues, politics, and 
misunderstanding are the same issues encountered by contemporary 
followers of vision.
<P>
It is unfortunate that today's society has little understanding and many 
misconceptions about the lifestyle choice of religious sisterhood.  The 
portrait painted in popular media is often demeaning and seldom 
accurate.  Few people understand what it is about or why someone would 
choose to live this kind of life.
<P>
This presentation, About Us:  The Congregation of the Sisters, Servants 
of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Scranton, PA, will tell something of 
the story of the Scranton branch of the IHMs.  In the spirit of the 1995 
celebration of the IHM Sesquicentennial Year, it will celebrate the 
past, illuminate the present, and attempt to give a glimpse of vision 
for the future.

This presentation about the life of Mother Theresa Maxis Duchemin, 
I.H.M., is largely exerpted from <cite>Paths of Daring, Deeds of Hope:  
Letters by and about Theresa Maxis Duchemin</cite> edited by Sr.  
Margaret Gannon, IHM (Scranton) and published by the Scranton, PA and 
Monroe, MI Congregations in 1992 to mark the hundredth anniversary of 
her death. 
<P>
Many of the letters in this collection were written by persons who spoke 
a language other than English as their first language.  Often the 
letters were very personal ones, written in haste and intense emotion.  
For these reasons there are frequent difficulties in the letters' 
composition; irregularities of sentence structure, spelling and 
punctuation often make a clear reading of the meaning a problem.  [The 
urge to correct the composition has been resisted], preferring to 
preserve the authenticity and rely on the readers' patience and 
ingenuity in interpreting the texts.

<h2>Mother Theresa Maxis Duchemin</h2>
Born in 1810 in Baltimore, Theresa was the daughter of a Haitian 
refugee, Betsy Duchemin, and Arthur Howard, a British military officer.  
Betsy's grandfather, whose name, Maxis, Theresa used, was an 
African-American slave in Haiti.  Theresa's parents were not married; 
indeed, Theresa believed that her father never knew of her existence. 
<P>
Theresa was raised in the African-American community by her mother's 
guardians, the Duchemin family, who provided education for her as they 
had for her mother.  She attended a school established for Haitian 
refugee children on Paca Street in Baltimore.  In 1829 the women who 
conducted the school, Elizabeth Lange, Marie Magdalene Balas, and Marie 
Rose Boegue decided to form a religious congregation under the guidance 
of James Joubert, a Sulpician priest.  Theresa obtained permission to 
become the fourth fo unding member of the Oblates of Providence.
<P>
While Father Joubert lived, and while a number of Haitian refugee 
families could afford to sent their children to the school, the 
Congregation prospered.  But reverses began after Joubert's death as 
less sympathetic church leaders looked unfavorably on the existence of 
an African-American congregation, and as the student population shifted 
to U.S. African-American children, whose families could not afford the tuition.
<P>
During these threatening days Theresa served first as Superior General 
and then as Assistant to the Superior General.  She explored a variety 
of solutions to the Congregation's difficulties.  One involved renaming 
the Congregation the Sisters of St. Charles in hope of winning the 
sponsorship of the descendants of Charles Carroll.  Nevertheless, the 
Congregation was ordered not to receive any new candidates, a clear sign 
of the withdrawal of ecclesiastical support.  In the midst of these 
troublesome times, Theresa was visited by <a 
href="../Gillet/gillet1.html">Louis Florent Gillet</a>, a Belgian 
Redemptorist working in the Detroit Diocese.  He invited her to join him 
in the establishment of a new congregation to work among the French and 
English speaking populations of Monroe, Michigan.  This is one of 
several occasions in which Theresa's bilingual capacity pointed her to a 
promising field of ministry. 
<P>
<h3><a href="../../Photos/michigan_map.gif"><img align=middle 
src="../../Photos/michigan_map-th.gif" alt="[Michigan map]"> Theresa in 
Monroe</a></h3>
Theresa left the Oblates and Baltimore in 1845 and traveled to Monroe 
and to the founding of the IHMs.  The journey marked another profound 
transition:  Theresa set aside her African-American identification and 
established herself in the white community.  She was able to do this 
because she was a light-skinned person moving into an area where she was 
largely unknown.  Only in the last years of her life did she discuss her 
early life with the sisters.  Her background, however, was known to the 
bishops she dealt with and doubtless to the Redemptorist priests who had 
been her mentors even from the Baltimore days. 
<P>
<a href="../../Photos/log_cabin.gif"><img align=right 
src="../../Photos/log_cabin-th.gif" alt="[Picture of first log cabin 
convent]"></a>
The first decade of Theresa's life in Monroe seems relatively peaceful 
and productive, although the growth of the Congregation was rather 
slow.  Father Gillet left Monroe in 1847 and was followed by several 
Redemptorist priests, most significantly Egidius Smulders, who 
maintained a constant and energetic support of the Congregation.  This 
tie with the Redemptorists was crucially important for Theresa, who had 
become imbued with Alphonsian spirituality [St. Alphonsus Liguori was 
the founder of the Redemptorists.] and who saw that spirituality as 
essential to the charism of the IHM Congregation. 
<P>
In 1855, the <a name="withdraw" href="maxis2.html">Redemptorists 
withdrew</a> from the Detroit Diocese, a decision of serious 
consequences for Theresa and the Congregation.  Bishop Peter Paul 
Lefevere was enraged at the withdrawal; he attempted to eliminate all 
Redemptorist contacts with the IHM Sisters and to terminate the 
influence of Alphonsian spirituality.  He <a name="letter1" 
href="t-letter1.html">appointed a diocesan priest, Edward Joos,</a> 
Superior and Director of the Congregation, replacing Mother Theresa as 
the actual Superior. 
<P>
<a href="../../Photos/st_joseph_pa.gif"><img align=right 
src="../../Photos/st_joseph_pa-th.gif" alt="[Picture of St. Joseph's]"></a>
Theresa was most dissatisfied about this deprivation of the 
Congregation's identity and autonomy.  When, in 1858, an opportunity 
arose to return to Alphonsian influence by accepting a mission in the 
Philadelphia Diocese of Redemptorist Bishop John Neumann, she <a 
name="letter2" href="t-letter2.html">eagerly pursued the project</a>.  
Bishop Lefevere approved, and in 1858, Theresa traveled to the town of 
St. Joseph in the Choconut Valley, Susquehanna County, to establish the 
first Pennsylvania mission.  However, when Theresa attempted to open another 
Pennsylvania mission in 1859, Bishop Lefevere refused permission.  
Theresa persisted in seeking permission, also incurring the Bishop's ire 
by her assertive insistence that she needed to travel to Pennsylvania to 
settle a pressing concern at St. Joseph's.  After a particularly <a 
name="letter3" href="t-letter3.html">stormy meeting with Father 
Joos</a>, Theresa was deposed from office by Bishop Lefevere and <a 
name="separate" href="maxis3.html">ordered to leave the diocese 
permanently</a> for Pennsylvania. 
<P>
<h3>The Crisis of Separation</h3>
At this point Theresa and her Redemptorist friends initiated a campaign 
to bring all the sisters to Pennsylvania.  Bishop Lefevere, upon 
learning of this effort, permanently split the two branches of the 
Congregation, at the same time <a name="2sisters" 
href="maxis1-1.html">expelling certain sisters</a> who would not agree 
to sever their ties with Mother Theresa. 
<P>
<h3>Theresa's Struggle for Reconciliation</h3>
Theresa much regretted the severing of the Congregation and immediately 
<a name="reconcile" href="maxis4.html">undertook to repair the damage</a>.  
When her apologies and pleas for reconciliation went unanswered by 
Bishop Lefevere for almost a decade, Theresa attempted an unusual 
alternative.  In 1867 she obtained hospitality with the Grey Nuns of 
Ottawa apparently hoping to effect a reconciliation from this neutral 
position.  She traveled to Detroit in 1868 to appeal for readmission to 
the Monroe Congregation but was refused by Bishop Lefevere.  Thereupon 
she traveled to Scranton but was denied permission by the bishop, 
William O'Hara, to remain in the diocese also.  In desperation she 
returned to her home city of Baltimore and from there she contacted 
Mother Elizabeth Bruyere in Ottawa, who kindly agreed that she return to 
the Grey Nuns. 
<P>
<h3><a href="../../Photos/grey_nun.gif"><img align=middle 
src="../../Photos/grey_nun-th.gif" alt="[Theresa in Grey Nun habit]"> 
Theresa's Sojourn in Ottawa</a></h3>
<a name="ottawa" href="maxis5.html">Theresa lived with the Grey Nuns</a> a 
total of seventeen years, during the first twelve of which she had 
virtually no contact with the IHM sisters.  Then in 1881 Sister 
Genevieve of the Scranton IHMs sent Theresa feast day greetings, which 
initiated a five year correspondence between them.  Throughout that 
exchange, Mother Theresa's longing to return to the Congregation is 
manifest, as is her constant ingenuity to arrange her return to the 
Congregation.  Finally, in 1885 that return was permitted by the new 
bishop of Philadelphia, Patrick J. Ryan. 
<P>
<h3>Reunion and Reaction</h3>
<a href="../../Photos/cemetery.gif"><img align=right 
src="../../Photos/cemetery-th.gif" alt="[Photo of Mother Theresa's Grave]"> 
</a>
Mother Theresa lived her <a name="reunion" href="maxis6.html">last seven 
years in West Chester</a>.  Her life seems to have been peaceful and 
contented.  The one painful deprivation she experienced was Bishop 
O'Hara's refusal to allow her to visit in Scranton or to receive regular 
communication from the sisters there.  She died after a brief illness on 
January 14, 1892. 
<P>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In a presentation at the Leadership Conference of Women Religious in 
August, 1990, Sister Donna Markham, O.P. suggested that fear of certain 
losses deters contemporary religious from vigorous pursuit of their 
ministries; we dread the loss of comfort, the loss of security and the 
loss of respectability.  <a name="conclude" href="maxis7.html">Mother 
Theresa is a model</a> for confronting that fear.  Clearly, comfort, 
security and respectability were never priorities with her.  She 
sacrificed them repeatedly in fidelity to her vocation; indeed, she 
seems rarely even to have taken them into consideration which was a 
characteristic of Theresa's life.

This presentation about the life of Father Louis Florent Gillet, C.Ss.R., 
is largely excerpted from <cite>Gift of Fire:  Louis Florent 
Gillet -- 1813 - 1892: Christian, Redemptorist, Missionary, 
Cistercian</cite> which was compiled and edited by the IHM Archives Staff 
in Monroe, Michigan and was published on November 14, 1992 to mark the

Points in Time -- Chronology of Louis Gillet</h3><br>
Rarely does a human life flow undisturbed between its two points in 
time.  For most, there are intersections, turnings, beyond which life 
continues with different meanings and rhythms.  Each new phase draws 
energy and collective wisdom from the past, channeling it forward with 
new vision and courage.  So it was for Louis Florent Gillet:  <a 
href="gillet2.html">Christian</a>, <a href="gillet3.html">Redemptorist</a>, 
<a href="gillet4.html">Missionary Priest</a> and finally, <a 
href="gillet5.html">Cistercian Contemplative</a>.

Throughout our Congregations's history, we have relied on Divine 
Providence and responded to the changing needs of the times.  We strive 
to serve in a joyful, loving, hospitable and self-emptying spirit, 
reflecting that humility and simplicity which present a clear and 
understandable witness to Christ, who welcomed everyone.  In fidelity to 
that tradition we engage in the apostolic works of education, health 
care, social service and various pastoral and spiritual ministries.  We 
are also called to incorporate a sensitivity and commitment to social 
justice in our ministry and to use every opportunity available to affect 
social structures.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
From <cite>Our Call</cite>, the first paragraph of the 
<cite>Constitutions of the Congregation of the Sisters, Servants of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary, Scranton, PA (1992)</cite>.
<P>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<P>
This fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his son, Jesus Christ.
<P>
Our mission as Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of 
Scranton, Pennsylvania is to follow Christ as a community of disciples, 
aware that we are sent to be a clear and understandable witness to the 
presence of God in the world.  Throughout our congregation's history, we 
have responded to the changing needs of the time.  This, of course, 
means knowing the world: how it has changed, why it is changing and how 
we IHMs can respond. 
<P>
IHMs -- Church women:  Who are they, really?
<P>
A Belgian Redemptorist priest, Father Louis Florent Gillet, was led to 
frontier Michigan in the 1840s.  Here in 1845, with the cooperation of 
Mother Theresa Maxis Duchemin, he founded the Congregation with the 
purpose of furthering the human aspirations of the people of the area; 
specifically the preservation, deepening and spreading of the community 
of faith in Jesus Christ.  They chose the work of education as the one 
most appropriate in that time and place for the fullfilment of their purpose.
<P>
Dedication for the poor and spiritually neglected persons led Mother 
Theresa to establish a mission in northeast Pennsylvania in 1858.  She 
thereby set forth the roots of the Scranton IHMs. 
<P>
The early years of the Scranton Congregation were largely occupied with 
supplying education for the immigrant working persons who crowded into 
northeast Pennsylvania's coal mining and railroad camps.  The sisters 
supported the workers struggles to overcome poverty and oppression and 
to achieve more fully human lives. 
<P>
Today, as in our early years, all our ministries are works of justice 
and peace.  They receive and give life in relation to the depth of our 
spiritual union with Jesus and our participation in his mission. 
<P>
Members of the laity have been invited to <a 
name="cby" href="CBY/cby-menu.html">share in our mission</a> in the Church 
as <a name="prayer" href="CBY/prayerasso.html">prayer associates</a>, <a 
name="vols" href="CBY/volunteer.html">associate volunteers</a> or to 
consider seeking full membership through the <a 
name="pre" href="CBY/formation.html">formation program</a>.  We serve in 
<a href="where_are.html">many different places</a> where the reality of 
God's redeeming mercy in Jesus Christ has not yet been effectively 
communicated. 
<P>
Because we are ministers with God, for and with his people, God's 
inspiration has led IHMs to cities, to rural areas, to the barrios of 
Lima, Peru, and the mountains of British Columbia.  Our times and our 
faith call us not only to pray as Jesus did, not only to know how Jesus 
would act, but, in fact, to act as he would act.  We seek to promote 
social justice, the dignity of the human person and the cause of peace 
through every means at our disposal; specifically by raising the 
consciousness of others through our teaching, healing and pastoral ministries.
<P>
We are women who acknowledge the diversity of gifts among us and who 
respect the uniqueness of each of our sisters who live together in 
community with the Eucharistic Christ as the center of our lives.  God 
has led and does lead us to ministries which make the most productive 
use of our God-given talents. 
<P>
Artists ... teachers ... campus ministers ... religious education 
directors ... social workers ... secretaries ... pharmacists ... 
guidance counselors ... administrators ... Christian clowns ... 
advocates for immigrants ... musicians ... nurses ... dieticians ... 
pastoral ministers ... librarians ... canon lawyers ... grief counselors 
... sisters who work with handicapped children. 
<P>
Our lives and labors have a faith dimension that gives special meaning 
to what we do and why we do it. 
<P>
The religious call of each IHM sister is a call to grow in friendship 
and union with the Lord and to share in his redeeming mission.  "I shall 
be with you," he promised in Exodus; and in the book of Jeremiah we hear 
the Lord again, "To whomever I send you, you shall go."  The greatest 
gift we give to the Congregation and to those whom we serve is a life of 
personal wholeness rooted in prayer. 
<P>
Mary is a guiding force who stands before each of us as the ultimate 
embodiment of a life rooted in the Lord. 
<P>
Our <a name="vision" href="CBY/formation.html#vision">religious formation</a> is a 
process which is personal and life-long beginning with a young woman's 
call to the Congregation.  At first (<a 
href="CBY/formation.html#pre">pre-admission</a>) it may involve a live-in 
which offers the young woman an opportunity to spend a weekend of prayer 
and discussion of the basic elements of religious life and at, the same 
time, to experience the community life of the sisters. 
<P>
The first official step of religious formation, the <a 
name="affiliate" href="CBY/formation.html#pre">affiliate program</a>, 
follows.  It is a time of written application and interviews, weekends 
of prayer and serious discussion with a sister advisor and the Director 
of Affiliates.  But it is still a time of search until, one day, a 
decision is made to apply for admission to the IHM community as a 
candidate. 
<P>
The <a name="candidates" href="CBY/formation.html#initial">candidacy phase</a> can 
be as brief as six months or can be longer.  Its goal is initiation into 
community life. 
<P>
The next period, <a name="novitiate" href="CBY/formation.html#initial">the 
novitiate</a>, usually lasts two years, the first of 
which is called canonical.  This first year's primary focus is on 
growing in relationship with Christ through prayer, community life and 
studies, which include the vows and scripture.  The canonical year 
usually includes a formative activity experience of a month's duration 
outside the novitiate. 
<P>
The second year novitiate concentrates on helping the novice to move 
toward ministerial life by emphasizing the integration of prayer and 
ministry.  It may include a short or extended ministerial experience. 
<P>
The <a name="vowed" href="CBY/formation.html#initial">juniorate experience</a> follows 
first vows of povery, chastity 
and obedience, made for three years, during which the young sister continues 
to live in a local community, sharing full responsibility for prayer, 
ministry and community life. 
<P>
After a minimum of three years to a maximum of 6 years, the sister may 
make profession of final vows
as a Sister, Servant of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.  The IHM sister 
continues to participate in ongoing religious formation aimed at 
furthering her spiritual, psychological and intellectual development. 
<P>
In 1979, Our Lady of the Lake Spiritual Renewal Center was opened in 
Verona, New Jersey, to nourish the IHM apostolic spirituality of 
contemplation in action.  The Spiritual Renewal Center was later moved to 
Cresco, Pennsylvania in the heart of the Pocono Mountains where 
it continues to offer <a href="../Calendar.cresco.html">retreats and other 
programs</a> primarily for IHM sisters. 
<P>
Today there are more than 700 IHMs who have come from many parts of the 
country, all with a common desire to serve God well and extend his love 
to others whenever and wherever possible. 
<P>
One of the most precious charisms is a joyful, loving spirit which has 
touched the hearts and faces of untold thousands down through the years 
since we began in 1845. 
<P>
These spirited, prayerful, giving women face the challenge of bringing 
the gospel message to our world today; and with great freedom to 
give their lives away in the service of others as signs of God's 
presence among us, they are sources of hope and vision that the spirit of a 
world in pain and confusion cannot diminish. 
<P>
We share in Christ's redeeming mission and we invite you to come, learn 
more about us that together we may grow in friendship and union with the 
Lord and bring his message to those we serve.

live it ... in the streets of New York City,  a classroom in Scranton, a 
clinic in Silver Spring, a Riverside, MD parish and the Andes Mountains in 
Peru.  These articles were originally published in the Winer 1995

In July, 1994, the General Chapter of the Sisters, Servants of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary, Scranton, Pennsylvania, met to map out a 
direction for the Congregation as it moves into the twenty-first 
century.  What follows are the Reaffirmation of Corporate Identity, 
Corporate Commitment and Strategies for futhering the commitment adopted 
by that body. <P>

<h2>Reaffirmation of IHM Corporate Identity</h2></a>
Our mission as Sisters, Servants of the <br>
Immaculate Heart of Mary, Scranton, <br>
Pennsylvania, is to follow Jesus as a <br>
community of disciples, aware that we are <br>
sent to be a clear and understandable <br>
<strong>Prophetic Witness</strong><br>
to the presence of God in the world.

<h2>IHM Corporate Commitment<br>
1994 - 1998</h2></a>
As a congregation, as local<br>
communities and as individuals, we<br>
commit ourselves to work toward <br>
dignity and justice for all creation by<br>
empowering women and by addressing<br>
structures which are at the root of<br>
women's oppression.

Education on Gender Bias and Women's Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a multimodal process in which each sister will make a 
commitment to learn and to share perspective and experiences about 
gender bias and empowerment of women.
<P>
<li>Gather and disseminate information/resource materials, suitable for 
all ministries, that will address women's issues.

<h2><a name="2">Strategy 2</a><br>
Covenant Relationships</h2>
Increase awareness and knowledge of our sisters' diversified ministries 
by yearly covenants - sister to sister or local community to sister - to 
support one another's ministries in any way possible.  This relationship 
will result in greater inclusivity, more common ownership of our 
ministries, greater collaboration, and evangelization of and by one another.

<h2><a name="3">Strategy 3</a><br>
Advocacy and Systemic Change</h2>
Utilize and expand use of existing resources and technology (e.g. 
Marywood College, St. Joseph Center, Marian Community Hospital, IHM 
Spiritual Renewal Center, Our Lady of Grace Center, Congregation 
committees, collaborative networks, action circles, justice gatherings, 
women's resource centers, IHM Peace and Justice Center, etc.) to enable 
each sister and others with whom we collaborate to become educated 
advocates for systemic change of unjust structures or situations.
<P>
<img src="../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<h2><a name="4">Strategy 4</a><br>
Theresa's Treasure</h2>
Lend financial support to women's causes by:
<ul>
<li>choosing to invest some available monies from the IHM Charitable 
Trust into socially responsible investments that directly help women.
<P>
<li>encouraging individual sisters and local communities to contribute 
to Congregational funds that will provide seed money for women's projects.
<P>
</ul>
<img src="../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<h2><a name="5">Strategy 5</a><br>
Peace Site</h2>
Each sister within the Congregation has the call to be a Peace Site.  In 
addition, every local community and thus the Congregation has the same 
call.  The extension of the concept can become a reality as each one 
focuses on women's issues with a nonviolent stance.  Then each exudes 
Christ's power to all.
<P>
Recommended ways for individual sisters and local communities to link 
the Peace Site concept to women's issues include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>making a commitment to faith sharing on a local community level
<P>
<li>inviting other women to faith sharing on a local community level
<P>
<li>inviting persons from local resource centers to assist with education of 
IHM membership on women's issues
<P>
<li>taking action for justice to empower women
<P>
<li>evaluating yearly each sister's and local community's commitment to 
women's issues.
<P>
</ul>
<img src="../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<h2><a name="6">Strategy 6</a><br>
Technology</h2>
Initiate steps in the IHM Communications Office to receive and 
disseminate information through the use of E-mail and the Internet.  
Such action will mobilize efforts to further Congregational action steps 
and strategies.

<h2>Community:  Life Giving or Stagnant?</h2>
<H3>A workshop on creative and evolving community living</H3></center>
This workshop will focus on the basic foundations which create the atmosphere for communal living:  faith and the human psychological dimension.   What qualities are necessary to facilitate human growth and companionship?  How do we face the shadow side of our own selves and that of community?
<P>
Participants will:
<UL>
<LI>indentify life-giving qualities of contemporary religious community and characteristics of stagnant community patterns
<P>
<LI>explore several dimensions of life-giving community
<P>
<LI>learn to encourage movement away from stagnation toward growth
<P>
<LI>begin reflection on their own "shadow side" and how that is operative in their interrelationships, etc.

student's career goals and personal interests, and with guidance of an academic advisor, majors can select 
Finance Planning, Marketing, or Management as an area of concentration.<p>

<h3><a name="planning">Financial Planning</a></h3>
The Finance area of concentration prepares students for career opportunities in financial management that 
are both challenging and rewarding.  The study of finance blends concepts from Accounting, Economics 
and Statistics into the course work composed of Investment and Portfolio Management, Personal Financial 
Planning, Money and Banking, Financial Management, Advanced Topics in Financial Planning, etc.  
Students selecting this area of concentration must complete 18 hours in Finance, which could include a 
course or two in insurance, real estate or an internship in investment banking or corporate financial 
planning.<p>

<h3><a name="marketing">Marketing</a></h3>
As we move from a "production-oriented society" into a "marketing-oriented society," careers in 
marketing are looking more promising than ever.<p>
With emphasis on quality and customer focus, more companies are going to be looking for individuals 
that are able to understand the importance of a well-integrated marketing program.<p>
Here at Marywood College, we prepare you for such a challenge.  Along with the other business 
requirements, we introduce marketing majors to Marketing Research, Marketing Management and 
International Marketing.<p>

<h3><a name="management">Management</a></h3>
Training and skills to prepare managers to contribute to the development of organizational structure, 
staffing requirements and planning and administering employee benefits, as well as handling labor 
relations problems within organizations are part of the preparation majors receive within this functional 
area of specialization.  Through a set of required and elective courses focusing on management and the 
decision-making process relative to administrative theory, students are prepared to enter business 
firm, social agencies and other organizations in the areas of personnel management and human 
relations.<p>

<h3><a name="cis">Computer Information and Telecommunication Systems</a></h3>
The impact of information technology is widespread.  It has radically changed how business is conducted 
and has become a vital component in achieving and maintaining a competitive edge.<p>
Today, leading corporations are using information technology to develop new products and services, edge 
out competition, forge more effective relationships with customers and suppliers and radically change 
their internal operations and organizations.<p>
Here at Marywood College, we prepare you to become proficient in varied aspects of information technology and in the business aspect of organization.<p>

<h3><a name="ib">International Business</a></h3>
Europe 1992 has become a reality and a true Single Market.  Therefore, the significance of global 
marketing, finance and management of international operations is essential to multi-national and 
trans-national organizations.  The Marywood International Business Program prepares the student 
for the multiple career opportunities available in the various sectors of the multi-national corporate 
global operations.  Students majoring in this field are required to complete 45 semester hours in 
business in addition to 21 credits in a foreign language.  Students should spend a semester abroad in 
a country of their choice relative to the language selected in the program.  Through the advice of both

<Center><H1>WVMW-FM 91.5</H1></Center>
<Body>
<P>	Welcome to the WVMW homepage.  WVMW-FM is a studuent-run and
student-operated FM radio station operating with 100 watts of power at 91.5
megahertz on the dial by authority of the FCC in Washington, D.C.<Br>
It is located in the Learning Resources Center on the campus of Marywood
College.
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>FORMAT</H2></Center>
<P>	The format here at WVMW (or VMFM as it is sometimes called) is<Br>
varied and eclectic.  Normal progrmming consists of mostly underground<Br>
artist who are not getting airplay on commercial stations.  A random<Br>
sampling of our music library consists of anything from ALL to Ween, and<Br>
all of it is good.  You won't find any Van Halen or Green Day or Pearl Jam<Br>
in our studios.  While we respect those artists, they get plenty of airplay<Br>
on other 'commercial' FM stations.  We are not a commercial station<Br>
(meaning we don't sell advertising time to sponsors) therefore, we don't<Br>
have to play the safe route when it comes to music.  We can be
experimental,<Br>
and the style of the programming can shift with each DJ.  To learn more<Br>
about what is currently in heavy rotation here at VMFM, check out our<Br>
<A HRef="currents.html">"Currents"</A> page.<Br>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>OTHER "STUFF"</H2></Center>
Alternative programming is not the only thing we offer here at VMFM.<Br>
There are other shows at set times during the day which offer access to<Br>
specific genres that you can't hear on other radio stations.  You can hear<Br>
blues, jazz, 40's and 50's pop music, and improvisational styles of music, as<Br>
well as other shows which are more fun and offer a more irreverent view of<Br>
music's past.  Show's that fall under this category are "Flashback to the 80's"<Br>
and "Marywood Ballroom".  For more info on our shows, times and DJ's<Br> 
check out the <A HRef="schedule.html">"Schedule"</A> page.<Br>
<P>In addition to music, you can hear basketball here on VMFM.  Everytime the
Pacers are at home, tune into VMFM 91.5.  We bring you all the action - live
and in stereo.  Both men's and women's teams are covered, and on occasion, we
have doubleheaders.  If you want to find out when to tune in, check out our
<A HRef="sports.html">"sports"</A> page.<Br>
If you want in depth information about all the stats and other stuff for ALL of
Marywood's sports, <A HRef="pacerpride.html">"Pacer Pride"</A> is the show for
you.  Your hosts, Bill Jones and John Seitzinger bring you news, stats,
interviews and picks relating to Marywood sports, and then some.  From field
hockey in the fall, to baseball in the spring, they keep you updated if you 
can't make it to the games in person.  This show is for the sports nut in all
of us.

features. Shows range from instructional (e.g. <A href="GH.html">Over at Grandma's House</A>
and <A href="gs.html">Guitar Shop</A>), to news/sports information
(e.g. <A href="CLoserLook.html">A Closer Look</A> ,<A href="TVN.html">TVM News</A>,and
 <A HRef="pacerpride.html">Pacer Pride</A>),to talkshows (e.g.<A href="TL.html">Twilite</A>  and <A href="NE.html">No Clips</A>).

<A href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/" Alt="">Supreme Court Decisions</A>...Brought to you by the Legal Information Institute of Cornell University School of Law, this is an excellent searchable collection of all Supreme Court decisions from 1990 to the present.<P>

<A href="http://www.usscplus.com/" Alt="">USSC+</A>...Provides a searchable database of <U>leading</U> cases since 1793. Among the other points of interest included at this site:<U1>

Listen in to both sides arguing such all time greats such as <I>Gideon v. Wainwright</I> and <I>Terry v. Ohio</I>.<P>

<A href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/fullcourt.html" Alt="">The Justices</A>... Cornell's Legal Information Institute brings us this profile of current Supreme Court Justices. Included are photographs, biographical data, and a list of accessable decisions authored by each.<P>

<A href="http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDCTS/" Alt="">U.S. Federal Courts Finder</A>...The Emory University School of Law has compiled a directory to each of the First through Eleventh, the D.C. and the Federal Circuit Courts.  While most of these searchable sites have only recent decisions, i.e. since 1995, they are nonetheless a fine resource for finding that case decided only last week.<P>

<h3>Redemptorists Withdrawn</h3>
The relative peace of the first decade of IHM was disrupted with the 
announcement by the Redemptorists that they were leaving the diocese in 
May 1855.  Bishop Lefevere was extremely unhappy about the decision, 
refusing to credit the Redemptorist's explanation that finances and the 
need for more cohesive community life made their withdrawal 
unavoidable.  The Bishop appealed to the Holy See to require the 
Redemptorists to stay, an appeal that was not resolved for several 
years.  Meanwhile, Bishop Lefevere determined to eradicate all 
Redemptorist influence from the IHM Congregation. 
<P>
This policy was most disturbing for Theresa, whose commitment to the 
Redemptorist tradition was intense.  Her spirituality had been developed 
under Redemptorist guidance and the Redemptorist priests had been her 
consistent and loyal advisors in the growth of the IHM Congregation.  
She became eager to regain the Redemptorist influence, even if that 
meant identifying another location for the Congregation's activities.  
Her response led both to the establishment of IHM missions in 
Pennsylvania and to the eventual rupture of the original Congregation. 
<P>
After the departure of the Redemptorists, Bishop Lefevere appointed 
diocesan priests to direct the IHM Congregation.  The second was 
Reverend Edward Joos, who remained director of the Congregation for 
forty-four years.  His appointment was announced in a <a name="letter1" 
href="t-letter1.html">letter dated November 5, 1857</a>.  It ought to be 
noted that <a name="joos" href="maxis2-1.html">Father Joos was appointed 
superior</a> as well as Director of the IHM Congregation, a departure 
from the Redemptorist rule that particularly rankled Theresa as 
co-founder of the Congregation.  Gradually Fr. Joos assumed the duties 
and rights of the Superior although she was also designated Superior, if 
only in name.

<h3>Appointment of Father Edward Joos</h3>
Detroit Nov. 5th, 1857<br>
Dear Mother Therese
<P>
I take pleasure in informing you and all your Sisters, that after mature 
reflection and invocation of the Holy Ghost, I have found it expedient 
for the interest of your Community, that, under present circumstances, 
some change be made in the Directorship of the Convent.  And therefore, 
I have nominated and constituted the Rev. Edward Joos, Superior and 
Director of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in the Diocese 
of Detroit.  The Rev. Joos is truly a man of God, has great experience, 
and is endowed with all the qualification that could be desired for the 
important office to which he is appointed.  You will therefore receive 
and acknowledge his as your Superior.  He is invested with all the 
faculties requisite for the direction of the Sisters; and I trust that 
all the Sisters will at all and on all occasions show all the 
confidence, respect and obedience which are due him as to their 
spiritual Father and Director. 
<P>
I have the honor to remain<br>
Your most humble servant,<br>
Peter, Paul, Bp. Zel.<br>
C. of D.

<h3>Mother Theresa to Father O'Reilly</h3>
J.M.J.ALPH.TH.<br>
Reverend Father [O'Reilly],
<P>
On receiving your letter I showed it to our Director who thinks well of 
the mission which circumstance give me the confidence that he will 
obtain our Bishop's consent.  I wrote immediately for that purpose and 
will send you the answer as the Director requested me to do it, he seems 
anxious to know whether any other good works besides instruction would 
be required of the Sisters.  I could give him no satisfaction on that 
Point, but being unwilling he should know I had any other information 
but your letter, therefore, I said nothing and thought I would write 
through obedience. 
<P>
By what I learned in the Right Rev. Bishop Neumann's letter we would 
have to do in your place the very same thing we have been doing here, 
namely, instruction in the ordinary branches and preparing girls for 
receiving the Sacraments.  I cannot help expressing to you my 
satisfaction on hearing that it is among the poor we are called, for it 
is exactly what we like.  We have no desire of being established in 
large cities and among the great ones of the world.  The location and 
all give me the assurance that it is the will of God we should go.
<P>
We will be able to send five sisters, have no music teacher we could 
spare just now, but as I hope to come with the Sisters, we may be able 
to arrange that matter either by taking in the house a postulant, who 
would understand music or some other way. 
<P>
In your answer, which need not be before receiving our Bishop's answer, 
will you please give us some information about coming, which route to 
take, etc.  We are very ignorant about those things, and I presume the 
Director is about the same, he has not been yet two years in America, he 
did not know before the reception of your letter, that there was a place 
called Susquehanna. 
<P>
I will do all in my power to come soon.  Please mention in your next, 
when you want us that I may meet no opposition.  In union of the 
Immaculate Heart, I remain 
<P>
Your unworthy servant,<br>
M. Theresa<br>

A critical moment occured on March 31, 1859.  Theresa received an urgent 
message that she was needed at St. Joseph to resolve a serious 
difficulty.  She sought permission to go to Pennsylvania, which 
permission was denied. Her frustration at this and the denial of her 
desire to open a mission in Reading lead Theresa to engage in an 
acrimonious conversation with Fr. Joos.  Following is Fr. Joos' account 
of the occasion in a letter (which he immediately dispatched to Bishop 
Lefevere). <P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<h3>Father Joos to Bishop Lefevere</h3>
Right Rev. and Most Dear Bishop,
<P>
This morning I had a short but very important conversation with ... She 
asked me whether Your Lordship allowed her to go or not, and on me 
answering that you did not change Your mind "I am not," she said, 
"astonished; we have known since long that no one take interest in the 
Convent, and so all the Sisters know; therefore I have no confidence any 
longer neither in the Bishop, nor F. Hennaert, nor you, and so you may 
write the Bishop who can give me my demission." And so she spoke 
<u>repeatedly</u>. 
<P>
You see, R.R. Bishop, that a final disposition must be taken lest she 
[destroy] the whole institution.  Whatever Your Lordship decide about it 
I think that it is almost necessary that You should come Yourself as 
soon as possible and that precautions should be taken before she has 
time to involve the other houses in her revolt. 
<P>
As for the Sisters I have known them always submissive and Sister Joseph 
(the only one I have spoken to) says they are all always disposed to 
submit; although they feel somewhat affected by mother's disappointment.
<P>
May God dispose of everything in the best way!<br>
expecting Your visit tomorrow, if possible, I remain, R.R. Bishop, with 
all respect 
<P>
Your obedient Servt and Son<br>
Ed. Joos<br>
Monroe, the 31st of March 1859
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
Bishop Lefevere responded by traveling the next day to Monroe where he 
deposed Theresa from her position as Superior and banished her from the 
diocese immediately, ordering her to St. Joseph in Pennsylvania. 
<P>
He ordered two other sisters, all of whom had connections with the 
Redemptorist Fathers, to join her in moving to Pennsylvania.  He 
directed that three sisters already at St. Joseph return to Monroe as 
soon as Theresa and her companions arrived to replace them.

<h3>Crisis of Separation</h3>
When Bishop Lefevere dismissed Mother Theresa from the Detroit diocese, 
he also sent two other sisters to Pennsylvania.  They were Sr. Ann 
Shaaf, her companion from the Baltimore days, and Sr. Ignatia Sheeran, a 
novice.  He also sent instructions for three sisters at St. Joseph's to 
return to Monroe.  When Father O'Reilly learned of this order he was <a 
name="letter7" href="t-letter7.html">unwilling to comply</a>, insisting 
that the sisters who had made their vows in Pennsylvania in December 
1858 could not be required to return to Monroe.
<P>
This conflict over the sisters' return lead to a crucial discussion as 
to the nature of the Congregation and its <a name="letter8" 
href="t-letter8.html">relation to the hierarchical authorities</a>.  The 
bishops and some clergy of Philadelphia and Detroit became <a 
href="maxis3-1.html">involved in the dispute</a> over the issue and in 
evaluation of Mother Theresa's motivations and actions. 
<P>
Complicating the dispute was the effort of Mother Theresa and some of 
her Redemptorist friends to move the entire Congregation to 
Pennsylvania.  Letters were sent to the professed sisters and novices in 
Monroe <a name="letter11" href="t-letter11.html">urging them to move</a> to 
Pennsylvania; these were intercepted and found their way to Bishop 
Lefevere.  His fury at this activity, and at the acceptance in 
Pennsylvania of some of the sisters he dismissed from Monroe, led him to 
<a name="letter12" href="t-letter12.html">sever the Congregation</a> into 
two separate institutions in June 1859.

<h2>The Dismissal of Sr. Mary Whipple and Sr. M. Rose</h2>
Sister Mary Whipple was particularly distressed by [the disruption of 
the Congregation at the dismissal of Mother Theresa from Monroe] ...  
When, in 1859, she appealed to the Bishop for permission to transfer to 
Pennsylvania, he proposed three questions for her to answer related to 
her attitude toward Mother Theresa and the future of the Congregation.  
When he found her answer unsatisfactory, he dismissed her from the 
Congregation.  She traveled to Pennsylvania and was received there. 
<P>
Sister M. Rose shared Sister Mary Whipple's anxiety about the 
Congregation's crisis, and like Sr. Mary, requested permission to 
transfer to Pennsylvania.  She received the same set of questions ...  
Like Sr. Mary Whipple she was dismissed by Bishop Lefevere and received 
into the Pennsylvania community.

<h2>Theresa's Struggle for Reconciliation</h2>
Almost as soon as Mother Theresa was banished from Monroe, she initiated 
appeals to return.  She was greatly disturbed at the splitting of the 
Congregation, an outcome she had never anticipated.  She thought it 
extremely damaging to the chances of the Congregation's receiving papal 
approval.  <a name="letter13" href="t-letter13.html">She wrote 
repeatedly</a> to Father Joos and Bishop Lefevere over the years from 
1859 to 1868, pleading for forgiveness and permission to return to 
Monroe.  <a name="letter14" href="t-letter14.html">Father Joos responded 
kindly</a> to Theresa; it appears that the Bishop did not answer her letters.
<P>
After nine years of serving in Pennsylvania, finding that her appeals 
continued to be ineffective, Theresa decided that she might be more 
successful if she <a name="letter15" href="t-letter15.html">withdrew 
from the Pennsylvania Congregation</a>.  Perhaps she judged that she 
might thereby better succeed in persuading Bishop Lefevere of her 
penitence and submission.  Having arranged acceptance at the convent of 
the Grey nuns in Ottawa, she withdrew there in 1868.  The following year 
she <a name="letter16" href="t-letter16.html">journeyed to Monroe</a> to 
seek reconciliation; however, she was rebuffed by Bishop Lefevere.  Her 
appeal to return to Scranton Diocese was similarly rejected by Bishop 
O'Hara.  Eventually, she returned to Ottawa and remained there un
til 1885, when she was permitted to return to the Congregation in Philadelphia.
<P>
<h3>Some Comments</h3>
Mother Theresa paid a terrible price for her actions of Spring 1859.  
Incurring Bishop Lefevere's ire was a fateful error, one for which she 
could not ever gain his forgiveness.  Her heartfelt appeals and promises 
of future conformity failed to allay his a pprehensions and suspicions.
<P>
When Theresa abandoned her direct appeals and began exploring the 
possibility of moving to Ottawa, she evidenced considerable anxiety 
about the wisdom of the move.  Nonetheless, ever a person of action, she 
selected this alternative as a potentially effective recourse.
<P>
Theresa's timing in seeking readmission at Monroe was most unfortunate.  
If she had waited five months, Bishop Lefevere would not have posed a 
problem, for he died on March 4, 1869.  The Bishop's acceptance of 
Sister Celestine back into the Monroe congregation was a particularly 
disabling decision for Theresa; she lost a faithful companion and 
collaborator in her plans. 
<P>
Perhaps the saddest moment of Theresa's life was that of her exclusion 
from both IHM Congregations because of the Bishops.  She was literally 
<a name="letter17" href="t-letter17.html">homeless at that time</a>.  
Only the kindness of Mother Elizabeth Bruyere rescued her from 
destitution and profound humiliation.  Plans are presently underway to 
introduce Mother Elizabeth's cause for beatification; her compassionate 
treatment of Mother Theresa is an indication of her extraordinary 
Christian spirit.

<h2>Theresa's Sojourn in Ottawa</h2>
Mother Theresa's sixteen years of continued residence in Ottawa began on 
January 7, 1869.  During these years she lived as a guest of the Grey 
Nuns and worked in their ministry.  However, she did not make vows in 
that Congregation, considering her vows that of a Sister, Servant of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary. 
<P>
From 1869 to 1881, Theresa had virtually no contact with the IHM 
Congregation.  Sr. Ann (Charlotte Shaaf), her companion from Oblate days 
and through the earliest days of IHM, was permitted to write to Theresa 
annually.  The other sisters were prohibited by the bishops from writing 
to Mother Theresa. 
<P>
<a name="letter18" href="t-letter18.html">The silence was broken</a> by 
Sister M. Genevieve Morrissey, of the Scranton Congregation, when she 
sent Mother Theresa feast day greetings in 1881.  This initiated a 
frequent and warm correspondence between the two and between Theresa and 
a few other sisters. 
<P>
[Mother Theresa's letters from this time reflect her] <a name="letter19" 
href="t-letter19.html">profound distress at being separated</a> from the 
Congregation.  They also record her <a name="letter20" 
href="t-letter20.html">persevering hope of returning</a> to the 
Congregation and her active planning to achieve this return.  There are 
also regular comments on her living conditions in Ottawa.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<h3>Some Comments</h3>
Who was responsible for the lengthy silence and the long delay in her 
reunion with [the IHMs]? ... 
<P>
Bishop Lefevere was surely one of the prohibitors of communication and 
perpetuators of Theresa's exclusion.  Even before Theresa's sojourn to 
Ottawa, he had banned contacts of the Monroe sisters with the sisters in 
Pennsylvania.  That ban would surely have been extended to Theresa in 
Ottawa.  He was, of course, the primary force in preventing her re-entry 
into the Congregation in 1868. 
<P>
Archbishop Wood and Bishop O'Hara were clearly instrumental in 
preventing sisters from communicating with Mother Theresa and in 
preventing her restoration to the Congregation.  Sr. Ann had to obtain 
permission from the Archbishop to write to Theresa once a year.  Even 
after Theresa returned to West Chester, Bishop O'Hara prohibited the 
sisters from having regular correspondence with Theresa.  The Bishop's 
persistent denials of appeals on Theresa's behalf were clearly decisive 
in the long delay in restoring her to the Congregation.
<P>
Why these limitations?  At the time of the separation, the motive seems 
to have been Bishop Lefevere's anger with the Redemptorists and with 
Mother Theresa.  Later, it seems that fear of Theresa's influence over 
the sisters motivated the Bishop's decisions to isolate her.  From their 
perspective Theresa was a trouble maker and a threat to their 
authority.  Their caution seems excessive and insensitive, especially as 
the years of her isolation became extended and Theresa herself became 
elderly and increasingly unlikely to do them any harm.
<P>
In Theresa's view, her motives were legitimate even if her actions were 
sometimes impetuous.  Her efforts to lead the Congregation in accord 
with the Redemptorist tradition, were, for her, the fulfillment of her 
responsibility.

<h2>Reunion and Reaction</h2>
Theresa's long cherished dream of returning to her IHM Sister <a 
name="letter21" href="t-letter21.html">came to reality</a> on January 21, 
1885 when she arrived at the IHM Motherhouse in West Chester, 
Pennsylvania.  She remained there until her death on January 14, 1892.  
The sisters who lived with her during these last years of her life 
report on her <a name="letter22" href="t-letter22.html">gentle joy at her 
restoration</a> and her desire to be helpful in the work of the house.  
During these years she shared with other sisters her reminiscences of 
earlier days; for the first time she told the detail of her childhood 
and her life in Baltimore. 
<P>
Theresa's life continued to be shadowed by the painful experiences of 
the 1850s and 1860s.  The Bishop of Scranton, William O'Hara, refused to 
allow her to visit the sisters in that diocese.  He also <a 
name="letter23" href="t-letter23.html">forbade the sisters to write</a> to 
Mother Theresa on any but special occasions.  The reason seems to be the 
old fear that Theresa might disrupt the Congregations.  Bishop O'Hara 
had come to Scranton in 1868 for the Philadelphia Archdiocese.  He had 
served under Archbishop Wood as rector of the seminary and pastor from 
1860 to 1868 and as Bishop of Scranton was his suffragan.  It would seem 
he inherited the Archbishop's apprehensions about Theresa as a threat to 
the tranquillity of the Congregation. 
<P>
The occasion of <a name="letter24" href="t-letter24.html">Theresa's 
death</a> elicited comments about her from former associates who 
reflected on various stages in her life.  The issue emerged as to the 
appropriateness of <a name="letter25" href="t-letter25.html">considering 
her a founder</a> of the IHM Congregation -- an issue which is, for 
some, unresolved to this day.  Fr. Schnuttgen, the Redemptorist priest 
whom Theresa had first contacted in 1877, resolved to publish a 
biography of Theresa, in collaboration with Sr. Genevieve, Theresa's 
faithful correspondent from her Ottawa days.  That project did not come 
to fruition. 
<P>
In the years after Theresa's death, she remained a cause of 
controversy.  The main controversy was over acknowledgement of her 
membership in the Oblates of Providence prior to her years as an IHM.  
There were several <a name="secret" href="secret.html">efforts to keep 
secret</a> this significant fact of her background. 
<P>
When one attempts to discern the reason for this reluctance, the only 
credible one is an unwillingness to acknowledge Theresa's 
African-American roots. 
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<h3>Some Comments</h3>
Theresa's most fervent prayer and most urgent desire seemed to be 
fulfilled when she was welcomed back the West Chester.  Yet her 
frustration was not ended, restricted as she was from free contact with 
the Scranton Congregation.  She seems, however, to have lived out her 
days peacefully, surrounded by affectionate and attentive sisters. 
<P>
So many of Theresa's contemporaries seem to have very strong opinions 
about her; perhaps the force of her own personality elicited vigorous 
responses.  Her presence and actions also challenged entrenched systems 
of her day, with predictable results.  She did not conform to her 
generations's expectations of women, and particularly of women 
religious.  She was too assertive and too impulsive to find favor with 
those who tried to control her life.  Her single-minded devotion to the 
Redemptorist tradition led her to dramatic actions, and also sustained 
her through their painful consequences. 
<P>
It is unfortunate that knowledge of Mother Theresa's African-American 
roots was suppressed for so many years.  In our own day, the bigotry of 
her attackers, rather than Theresa's racial background, is a source of 
embarrassment.  We need to acknowledge Theresa's roots wit gratitude, 
while recognizing that the scourge of racism is far from exterminated in 
our own society or in our personal and communal lives. 
<P>
It would seem that the sexism and clericalism that afflicted Theresa 
continue to some extent to cloud an authentic appreciation of her 
central role in the early life of the Congregation.  The reasons for 
this anomaly seem clear.  The culture of religious life did not change 
so very much from Theresa's time until the Second Vatican Council.  
Concepts of blind obedience, episcopal supremacy, personal subjection 
and the suspension of individual judgment still dominated religious life 
until 1970.  Similarly, myriad stereotypes of women's roles and 
limitations infused the early development of many of us present day 
IHMs.  Only as we develop new paradigms of religious life, more 
responsive to the ultimate dignity of the person and to the full 
potential of women, will we grow to appreciate Mother Theresa as one of 
God's choicest gifts to the IHM Congregation.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In the 1980s our attention was drawn to the phenomenon of "refounding" 
of religious congregations.  We reflected on the challenge of responding 
to the changing needs of contemporary society.  We recognized the 
obligation that we offer a radical witness to Jesus and His mission, a 
witness both courageous and compassionate.  The price of this witness is 
high: the abandonment of accustomed comforts and securities for 
unfamiliar but urgent calls to service, the loss of the status and 
prestige we had previously experienced in much of our society, the 
demand of wariness lest we be co-opted by contemporary societal values 
in conflict with Christian spirituality, the challenge of an authentic 
identification with the poor and oppressed in personal and communal 
decisions.  We were advised to "Go where the life is," to seed out the 
life-giving and life-supporting options of lifestyle and ministry, even 
if they required radical departures from choices which, while 
comfortable, were no longer responsive to the needs of the people of God.
<P>
We recognize that the persons who would lead us in our refounding would 
be those who live on the "edges," who by dint of virtue or 
circumstances, or both, have been able to escape the lure of the 
established and familiar and see clearly what needs to be done.  These 
persons, whom Daniel Berrigan once described as the "congenitally 
open-minded," have the freedom that comes of not being so heavily 
invested in the success of the existing institutions.  Often it is 
service to the poor that has brought these individuals to the edges, 
where they signal to us the direction we ought to be taking as followers 
of the poor Christ. 
<P>
... Mother Theresa was invariable ready to "Go where the life is."  Her 
travels and troubles may be epitomized as a life-long pursuit of that 
goal.  She was persuaded that the life of the Congregation depended 
first on its Alphonsian spirituality and then upon its unification.  She 
made some of her most painful choices in support of that life. 
<P>
At every stage of her life, Theresa was willing to forego comfort and 
security in the interest of life-giving service; she was constantly "on 
the edges."  At times her choices were distasteful to others; in some 
cases she herself came to regret them.  But from the perspective of a 
century we can see the life-giving results of those choices:  in the 
foundation of two religious congregations in Baltimore and Michigan; in 
the establishment of a new mission field which eventually gave rise to 
two additional congregations, Scranton and Immaculata; and in the growth 
of faith-supporting ministries, particularly among poor, immigrant, and 
working-class people. 
<P>
Theresa was often impetuous; she seems sometimes to have been rather 
headstrong and stubborn.  But her heart was great and her courage 
undaunted.  Her commitment to Jesus and her devotion to the Immaculate 
Heart of Mary lead her through many choices and supported her in many trials.

<h2>
<img src="../../Graphics/ihmlogo3.gif" alt=""><img 
src="../../Graphics/louis_gillet.gif" alt="Louis Florent Gillet"></h2><br>
<h2>Christian . . .</h2><br>
<h3>1813 + January 12 + Birth in Time</h3>
Louis Florent Gillet was born at 9 AM, [on January 12, 1813,] at 19 Rue 
de Navel in Anvers (Antwerp), diocese of Malines, in Deux-Nethe, French 
empirate of Napoleon I.  Not until 1831 would this place be included in 
the new country of Belgium.  Thus it is equally accurate to speak of 
Louis as "French" or "Belgian."
<P>
Louis was baptized the same day at the Franciscan church of 
St. Anthony.  The oldest of two children, his parents were Florent 
Joseph Gillet and Barbara Catherine Marche Mercier, both of Louvain.  
<P>
Former generations of the Gillet family had been affluent and 
influential.  With the passage of time, however, and the political 
controversies which raged for a century, Catholic families and 
landholders suffered greatly.  Joseph Gillet, consequently, was a 
respectable government clerk who could provide for his family, but the 
affluence of another time was lacking.  Education, however, was as 
highly prized as ever in this Christian family.  Louis would receive the 
best that the times could provide, both in the state schools, and in the 
clandestine Catholic system which flourished in spite of the strictures 
placed upon religious activity.  Much of what is known about Gillet's 
early life has been traced through educational registries in one place 
or another.
<P>
While little can be documented about the childhood of Louis Gillet, the 
framework is clear.  This was a close knit family, with religious and 
cultural values that would generate the ideals and goals of the 
children.  Almost nothing is known of Joseph Gillet other than his 
presence and  benevolent support.  
<P>
<a href="../../Photos/mother_gillet.gif"><img 
src="../../Photos/mother_gillet-th.gif" alt="[Picture of Mme. Gillet]"></a>
Between Barbara Mercier and her son, Louis, there is evidence of a 
strong relationship which would endure until her death at age 98.  
Religious values were very firm and from tiny bits of information we 
know that there was great faith and a deep devotion to Mary, Immaculate 
Mother of Jesus, long before the actual doctrine was promulgated.
<P>
<h3>1820 - 1821 + Family Changes</h3>
Sometime in 1820-1821, the Gillet family moved to Moresnet, about 20 
miles northeast of Liege.  In 1821, eight year old Louis became big 
brother to Marie Catherine.  The brother and sister were closely bonded 
and their affectionate relationship would continue until Catherine's 
death in 1877.
<P>
<h3>1827 - 1832 + Early Studies</h3>
In 1827, the 14 year old Louis began his classical studies at the Royal 
College of Liege, then a state college because of the suppression of the 
Catholic religion.  At the same time, he received religious education at 
the seminary then flourishing in the ancient Abbey of Rolduc nearby.  It 
is safe to suppose that his own religious vocation was wakened sometime 
during these years.  He would have been in contact at Rolduc with the 
Redemptorist missionaries who had recently opened their first house in 
what would become Belgium.  Already fluent in his native French, Louis 
mastered Flemish, German and English with ease.  This linguistic skill 
would be noted and much utilized in his lifetime.
<P>
<h3>1829 + Philosophy</h3>
In 1829, Louis registered for Philosophy studies at the State University 
of Louvain with 403 others.  As before, his religious education would 
keep pace though continued contact with the Redemptorists and other 
Catholic scholars who were skilled at circumventing government restrictions.
<P>
In 1832, at age 19, Louis completed his Philosophy studies and was 
searching for his future.  In December, Louis began the retreat novena 
for the feast of the Immaculate Conception.  On December 8, 1832 [the 
feast day], he announced his determination to enter the Redemptorist 
congregation for whom Mary Immaculate was principal patron.

<a href="../../Photos/sm_gillet.gif"><img align=middle 
src="../../Photos/gillet-th.gif" alt="[Picture of Father Gillet]"> 
Redemptorist . . .</h2></a> <h3>1833 + Redemptorist Beginnings</h3>
At age 20, Louis entered the Redemptorist house at St. Trond, Belgium, 
in 1833. 
<P>
<h3>1834 + October 20 + First Profession</h3>
Both parents and his 12 year old sister were present for his profession 
[on October 20, 1834].  In 1836, the Redemptorists founded a house in 
Wittem, Holland.  A pioneer band of young professed was sent to continue 
studies in the new location, among them Louis Gillet.  Their journey was 
attended by the usual mishaps of travel, including a broken carriage 
wheel which delayed departure for over an hour.  The Wittem house was an 
international community and Louis, like many young Redemptorists, first 
felt the kindling of missionary zeal in this household.  This Wittem 
foundation would be one of many times Louis would "pioneer" in a new 
foundation or an untried venture.
<P>
<h3>1838 + March 10 + Ordination and First Works</h3>
Having completed his studies, Louis was ordained in Liege, Belgium, 
March 10, 1838, by Bishop Cornelius Van Bommel.  Again, both his parents 
and his sister were present for the occasion and for his first Mass on 
March 13.  Six months later, Louis accompanied Father Frederic de Held, 
Provincial, to London where they made plans for a Redemptorist foundation.
<P>
On his return to Belgium, Father Louis was transferred to Tournai.  For 
the next four years he would serve his apprenticeship in the community 
using his many gifts a community librarian, infirmarian and secretary.  
There was little of the missionary work for which he longed.  In 1839, 
the Redemptorists opened their first United States mission, in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  All eyes turned to America, and Louis was no 
exception.  
<P>
Finally, in March of 1843, the call came.  Father Alexander Czvitkovicz 
came to Tournai to collect Father Gillet and begin immediate preparation 
for their departure for the United States missions.  April 4, 1843, the 
ship sailed from London.  The month long voyage was itself a preparation 
for times to come.
<P>
<h3>1843 + Early May + New York/Baltimore/Albany</h3>
The Redemptorists landed in New York and immediately set out for 
Baltimore where the 5th Provincial Council of American Bishops was in 
session (May 14-21).  Present for the conference was the 
Coadjutor-Administrator of the Diocese of Detroit:  Right Reverend Peter 
Paul Lefevre -- also a Belgian.  Lefevre lobbied the Redemptorist 
Provincial in Baltimore for a mission to the French population in and 
around Detroit.  In the back, or perhaps the front, of his mind was the 
bid to have the Redemptorists make a permanent foundation in Detroit.  
His efforts would be successful.  From Baltimore, the Redemptorists 
moved back to New York briefly, then on to Albany by way of the Erie 
canal on "a three-story steamboat 338 feet in length" and "decorated in 
the latest luxury."
<P>
<h3>1843 + August 6 + The Michigan Missions Begin</h3>
Support for missionary work was a problem then as now.  Because Bishop 
Lefevre was himself a missionary, the Redemptorists felt that he would 
understand and cooperate with them.  They agreed to respond to his 
request.  Again, Father Louis and his classmate, Father Francis 
Poilvache, would pioneer.  August 6, 1843, Father Louis preached the 
first mission for which he was wholly responsible, at the church of St. 
Paul in Grosse Pointe, Michigan.
<P>
Here the IHM story begins.  During the mission, young <a 
name="renauld" href="meeting.html">Theresa Renauld</a> 
heard the voice of the Spirit but not clearly.  Father Louis taught her 
to ring the Angelus bells and told her to be faithful to her charge 
until there was another call.  Theresa would become the third in the new 
community.  In her lifetime she would be called "Celestine," "Xavier" 
and, finally, "Celestine Xavier" -- all in the course of providential events.
<P>
It was after his first mission that Gillet wrote a <a name="letter"
href="letter0.html">letter to the Belgian provincial</a>, describing 
the many needs of the American missions and urging that more of his 
brothers from Liege be allowed to join him in the field.
<P>
<h3>1843 + Mid-December + Ste. Anne, Detroit</h3>
Father Louis and Father Poilvache opened a mission at historic Ste. Anne 
in Detroit.  The success of the young missionaries preceded them and 
Bishop Lefevre himself was present to commission them.
<P>
<h3>1844 + March 9 + St. Anthony, Monroe</h3>
The two Redemptorists preached another successful 
mission at St. Anthony in Monroe.  With the blessing of the Bishop and 
the persuasive leadership of Father Louis, the mission resulted in a 
significant change of status for St. Anthony parish.  Parish grounds and 
buildings were signed over to the Redemptorists who agreed to provide 
permanent staffing.  The parish would become a missionary base and its 
name would be changed to St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception. In April 
or May of the same year, Gillet traveled to Baltimore for 
face-to-face conversations with Father Alexander Czvitkovicz, the 
provincial's representative in the U.S., about the Monroe foundation.  
Sometime after that Father Louis, 31 years old, six years ordained, was 
made pastor of the church and superior of the Monroe foundation.  His 
signature is on the June 16 papers turning the parish over to the 
Redemptorists.  After only two months in this country, and no prior 
exposure to the language, Gillet was already preaching sermons in 
English, in language "clear, distinct and forcible."
<P>
<a href="../../Photos/small_theresa.gif"><img 
src="../../Photos/theresa-th.gif" alt="[Picture of Mother Theresa]"></a>
It was in 1844 also, that Father Louis met Almaite Maxis, or Maria 
Theresa Maxis, in Baltimore.  He confided to her the great needs of the 
children in Michigan.  She, in turn, made known her desire to live a 
"regular" religious life, rather than one of some ecclesial uncertainty 
with the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore.  The two were well 
met and another stone was turned in the foundation of the IHM community.
<P>
<h3>1845 + November 10 + Foundation of the "Sisters of 
Providence" at Monroe, Michigan</h3>
<a href="../../Photos/log_cabin.gif"><img 
src="../../Photos/log_cabin-th.gif" alt="[Picture of log cabin]"></a>
On November 10, 1845, the Sisters of Providence were founded in Monroe, 
Michigan.  On this day an eternal bond was formed between Father Louis 
and this community.  Theresa Maxis and Charlotte Shaaf of the Baltimore 
Oblates met Theresa Renauld of Grosse Point for Mass on this founding 
day.  From their profession/reception on November 30, grew the 
international community Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of 
Mary, with its Monroe, Immaculata [Philadelphia] and Scranton branches.
<P>
<h3>1845 + December 8 + St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception</h3>
When St. Anthony's was renamed and consecrated to Mary Immaculate on 
December 8, 1845, Father Louis would write to his provincial that "we 
are the first of the Fathers in America who have a church consecrated, 
and consecrated to Mary Immaculate."
<P>
<h3>1845 - 1847 + Monroe Years</h3>
Father Gillet and Father Poilvache complemented one another.  Gillet was 
the pastor, and also the energetic missionary, personally overseeing ten 
missions within 60 miles of Monroe during the nearly two years of his 
stay in Monroe.  Truly he needed his "fast horse."  It is not surprising 
that Father Poilvache, quieter and more observant of immediate affairs, 
would handle the daily needs of the parish and the new sisterhood. 
Indeed, Gillet himself recognized his shortcomings as an administrator 
and begged his provincial to relieve him of the pastorate in order to 
devote more time to the missions.  Nonetheless, Father Gillet was 
careful in his nurturing of the seedling community, taking personal 
responsibility for the development of habit, rule, prayer and community 
life.  The people of Monroe, Catholic and Protestant alike, appreciated 
Father Gillet's many efforts on behalf of the people of the city.  He 
made many friends, some of whom he retained to the end of his life.
<P>
<h3>1847 + Spring/Summer + Shadowed Flame</h3>
Father Gillet was called to New Orleans to preach the lenten mission in 
1847.  He returned to Monroe, at the peak of his missionary success, to 
continue his rounds among the Michigan missions.  Meanwhile, events were 
smoldering which would wrench the young missionary from his chosen 
course.  First there was an ugly accusation, proven false in court, by a 
disgruntled woman penitent.  Then a man, turned away from the 
Redemptorist brotherhood by Father Louis, took himself to the Detroit 
Redemptorist house and filled the ears of one of the Fathers with 
similar stories.  The Father, in the manner of the times, wrote hastily 
to the Provincial in Baltimore.  On October 6, Gillet was recalled to 
Baltimore and Father Egidius Smulders was sent to Monroe in his stead.
<P>
All accusations against Father Louis were subsequently proven to be 
totally false.  Eventually he was given the option of returning to 
Monroe or going back to Europe.  He chose Europe.  The sequence of 
events, however, resulted in strained relationships between himself and 
the Redemptorist community which he had loved and trusted.  Gillet was 
deeply scarred by this experience, most of all by what he  interpreted 
as lack of support from his Redemptorist brotherhood.  Urged by his 
Provincial, he wrote to Father De Held in Belgium, asking for a 
dispensation from his vows [He would leave the Redemptorist 
Congregation, but still remain a priest.].  It appears that his request was 
not granted immediately.  Gillet wrote again and Father De Held wrote to 
Bishop Lefevre for more information.  Awaiting an answer from Rome,  Father 
Gillet traveled to New York where he lived at Holy Redeemer in New York, 
assisting with priestly duties there and in nearby areas.  He was still 
the missionary, still the preacher who could move hearts and always he 
urged the work to go forward.
<P>
Eventually, Gillet became impatient with waiting.  He answered the pleas 
of a Bishop in Lafayette, Louisiana, near New Orleans, where he entered 
wholeheartedly into the mission work he loved best.

<h2>Missionary Priest . . .</h2>
<h3>1848 - 1858 + The Waiting Years</h3>
In the ten years following his request for dispensation, Father Gillet 
was not idle.  From New Orleans, he traveled to St. Louis in January 
1849.  In March he was in Philadelphia and in April back in Baltimore 
where he once again performed a chaplain's role for the Oblate Sisters 
of Providence.  On Pentecost, he sang high Mass during the Bishops' 7th 
Provincial Council.  From December 1849 until February 1852 he was 
pastor of Holy Family parish in Frenchtown, Ohio, Diocese of Cincinatti.
<P>
From September 1852 through February 1853, Father Louis ministered at 
St. Augustine in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Sometime during these years he 
appeared in Chicago, Illinois.  In May of 1853, his letter to the 
Provincial was postmarked from Constableville, New York.
<P>
Father Gillet's <em>exeat</em> papers were signed on January 8, 1850, and 
supposedly sent on to him.  As late as May 24, 1853, however, he wrote 
to the Baltimore Provincial to ask if the dispensation had been 
granted.  There is no conclusive evidence as to exactly when he received 
word of the dispensation but his letter of 1853 is the last 
documentation of his presence in the United States.
<P>
Sometime in 1853, at age 40, Father Gillet returned to Europe because of 
failing health.  From 1853 through 1857, during his recovery from 
illness, he moved among various churches, including Notre Dame in Paris, 
and parishes in Laon and Soissons, France.  He was well known as an 
eloquent, effective preacher, "an orator entirely above the ordinary."

<h2>Cistercian . . .</h2>
<h3>1858 - 1892 + Fire in Stone:  Cistercian Call</h3>
In 1857, his health restored, Father Louis requested permission from the 
Bishop to return to the American missions, this time in South America.  
Permission was granted and the 44 year old missionary priest boarded a 
ship for South America by way of Africa, a normal pattern for the time.  
Meanwhile, in Senanque, near Avignon in France, a community of religious 
men on November 20, 1857, received a papal indult establishing them as 
the Cistercians of the Immaculate Conception.
<P>
Since Father Gillet was well acquainted with the Bishop of Avignon, and 
since the Bishop was instrumental in bringing about the new Cistercian 
foundation in Senanque, it seems likely that Gillet was aware of the 
effort, though this cannot be determined with certainty.
<P>
What is known, however, is that sometime during the long sea voyage 
Louis Gillet realized a new call to the contemplative life.  No sooner 
had the ship reached its destination than Gillet made arrangements to 
return immediately to France.  He disembarked in Lorient, France and 
traveled in haste to Avignon to pursue his goal.  Was the missionary 
fire extinguished?  Not so, from what is known of his last 34 years.
<P>
<h3>1858 + Cistercian Beginnings at Senanque and Fontfroide</h3>
Father Louis Gillet became a Cistercian candidate on August 3, 1858, in 
the pioneer community of Senanque, France.  Three weeks later, on August 
22, Feast of the Holy Heart of Mary, he received the habit of the 
Cistercians of the Immaculate Conception, with the name Pere Marie Celestin.  
During his year of novitiate, the Cistercians outgrew Senanque and 
established another monastery at Notre Dame of Fontfroide, France.  Soon 
after pronouncing his solemn vows on September 8, 1859, Pere Celestin 
was sent to join the pioneer band.  With his broad experience and skill, 
he must have been a valuable member of that community.  His own notes in 
the annals of Fontfroide provide a vivid picture of the rugged farm life 
of the community.
<P>
<h3>1864 + May 25 + The Royal Abbey of Hautecombe-Savoy, 
France</h3>
<a href="../../Photos/abbey.gif"><img src="../../Photos/abbey-th.gif" 
alt="[Picture of the Abbey]"></a>
The Royal Abbey of Hautecombe-Savoy was given into the care of 
the Cistercians in 1864, after an existence of 730 years, many marked by 
turmoil and suffering, from the time of its founding by the Order of 
Citeaux.  The Royal House of Savoy was patron to the Abbey and the tombs 
of the Savoy royal families were at Hautecombe.  During the French 
Revolution, the tombs were plundered and the abbey closed.  Charles 
Felix had been King of Sardinia for three years when he visited 
Hautecombe in 1824.  Because he knew that 39 of his ancestors were 
buried in the rubble there, he purchased the abbey lands and began the 
restoration which culminated with the return of the Cistercians to 
Hautecombe in 1864.  He himself would be buried in the Abbey grounds.  
Again, Pere Celestin was one of the pioneer band at Hautecombe.
<P>
<h3>1864 - 1889 + Teacher + Novice Master + Chaplain + Prior</h3>
Pere Celestin spent the last 28 years of his life at Hautecombe, with 
only three known excursions to the outside world.  From 1864 to 1875 he 
would be teacher of Philosophy and Theology.
<P>
<a href="../../Photos/pere_celestin.gif"><img 
src="../../Photos/pere-th.gif" alt="[Picture of Pere Celestin]"></a>
1866 was a significant year.  In July, Pere Celestin paid a visit to his 
elderly mother, then living with a community of sisters in Nouen, 
Belgium, near Louvain.  While in Louvain, he met a Monsignor Edward Joos 
from Monroe, who was then in Belgium for his own health.  In their 
conversation, Father Joos told Pere Celestin that he had "succeeded" him 
as director of the Immaculate Heart Sisters in Monroe.  From Gillet's 
own writing, later, it appears that he did not understand at that time 
that the IHM sisters were <em>the same</em> community founded in 1845.  The 
fact that Monsignor Joos apparently made no mention of his meeting with the 
former Redemptorist missionary kept communication closed for another 24 years.
<P>
<a href="../../Photos/sister_gillet.gif"><img 
src="../../Photos/sister_gillet-th.gif" alt="[Picture of Sr. Marie 
Celestine]"></a>
From April 1875 through October 1876, at age 62, Pere Celestin was sent 
as chaplain to the Cisterciennes at Notre Dame du Pres, in Reillanne, 
France.  Not remarkable in itself, this experience must have been a 
great joy to him, since his sister Catherine was then Sister Marie 
Celestine and Mistress of Novices at the same convent.  Catherine's 
journey in religious life, from the Sisters of Charity in Ter Hagen to 
the Cistercian monastery at Reillanne parallels that of her brother.
<P>
Also at Reillanne was a Sister Stephanie, long time friend of Sister 
Clotilde of the IHM Sisters at West Chester.  It would be her remark in 
a letter to Sister Clotilde that would begin the reunification of Pere 
Celestin with the community he founded in Monroe.
<P>
October 1876 found Pere Celestin recalled to the Abbey, this time as 
Novice Master, a post he would hold for two years until his appointment 
as Sub-Prior in January 1878.  This was a brief preparation for his 
election as Prior on July 10, 1878.  Somewhere along the line from 
Monroe to Hautecombe, evidently, Pere Celestin developed administrative 
skill.  For five years he was the much beloved superior of the 
Hautecombe community.
<P>
Completing his term as Prior, Pere Celestin was again called to be Choir 
Novice Master.  He remained in this capacity from July, 1883 to1889 when 
his health became uncertain.  For a little time, 18 months, he was 
persuaded to return to the Cisterciennes at Notre Dame du Pres but 
increasing health problems necessitated his return to the Abbey.
<P>
<h3>1891 + February 8 + Reunion with IHM Sisters</h3>
Sister Clotilde, an IHM sister at West Chester, Pennsylvania, had been 
writing to her friend Sister Stephanie, then a Cistercienne at 
Reillanne, France.  Stephanie and Clotilde had both been members of a 
community in Paris.  When the community dissolved, the two went their 
separate religious ways but kept up a lifetime correspondence.  A chance 
comment of Sister Stephanie, about their wonderful chaplain, "Pere 
Celestin Gillet," aroused Sister Clotilde's curiosity.  The story of the 
<a name="reunion" href="reunion.html">joyful reunion</a> between Father 
Gillet and the Immaculate Heart Sisters is told powerfully by Sister 
Maria Alma in <cite>The Reverend Louis Florent  Gillet:  His Life, 
Letters and Conferences.</cite> 
<P>
<h3>1892 + November 14 + The Final Point in Time</h3>
In spite of many infirmities of which Pere Celestin wrote matter of 
factly, he maintained a <a name="letters" href="letters.html">happy 
communication</a> with his rediscovered American sisters until 10 days 
before his death on November 14, 1892.  On the morning of November 4th, 
he felt well enough to be lifted from his bed to his writing table where 
he penned the <a name="farewell" href="letter3.html">farewell and 
blessing</a> which are part of our IHM heritage 
today.  When he finished, "the pen fell from his hands" and he turned 
from his mission in the world to the loving mystery of eternity with a 
peaceful, joy filled heart -- missionary to the last.
<P>
<h2>Epilogue . . .</h2>
<h3>1929 + March 10 + Return to Monroe</h3>
<a href="../../Photos/gillet_chapel.gif"><img 
src="../../Photos/g_chapel-th.gif" alt="[Picture of the Gillet Chapel 
in Monroe]"></a>
March 10, 1929, was the final point in time recorded for Father Gillet.  
On that day, after three years of effort galvanized by Sister Rosalita 
Kelly of Monroe, Father Gillet's remains were returned to the IHM 
cemetery in Monroe, there to await the final resurrection.  The Gift of 
Fire has been passed to the sisters with whom he labored for so brief a 
time.  His prayer for them is filled still with the fire of the young 
missionary, tempered and tended to a consuming blaze within the abbey walls.

<h2>Dillinger's Hide Out</h2>
John Dillinger was in Pittsburgh and was being followed by the FBI.  He 
came to St. Mary of the Mount Convent and asked for food and a place to 
stay.  The Sister in the kitchen, not knowing who he was, told him he 
had to work so he cleaned the porches and sidewalks for his food and 
accommodations. 
<P>  
One night, Sr. St. Agnes got up to go to the bathroom.  She saw feet 
sticking out from under the curtain in the hallway.  She decided to go 
back into her room and get into bed.  Dillinger followed her into her 
room and, seeing that she was not going to call the police, quietly left 
the convent.
<P>
As soon as he crossed the street, he was arrested by an FBI agent who 
had the convent under surveilance.

<A NAME="vision"><H3>FORMATION VISION</H3></A>


We believe that religious life is a permanent, public commitment to an expression of the mystery of God in our world, which we choose to live out in the context of a particular religious congregation. Through the mystery of our call to religious life, we are invited into an intimate relationship with a loving God and become passionately involved in God's mission.
<P>
Our life together as IHMs is an intentional, communal expression of our belief in the redeeming love of Jesus Christ and of our vowed commitment to share in His redemptive mission.
<P>
The process of initial formation gradually introduces the woman into the congregation's life and prayer, community and ministry. We welcome women of human and Christian maturity who desire to share our IHM vision and participate in our mission of love. We value the unique gifts they offer to the Congregation and to the People of God. We strive to provide a thorough and enriching preparation for a well-informed, free commitment and for a life of zealous ministry with and for God's people.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>

<A NAME="pre"><H3>PRE-ADMISSION PHASE</H3></A>


<B>Initial Dialogue</B>	
<P>
When a woman is interested in entering the Congregation, she meets with the Director of Vocations over a period of time. This allows the Director to get a general impression of her and gives the woman an opportunity to explore the life of the community and to observe the spirit and charism as it is lived among the sisters. In the dialogue the woman and the Vocation Director look for a good fit with the IHM sisters. 
<P>
<B>Affiliate Process</B>
<P>
The affiliate phase is a more direct step toward entrance. The woman meets with the Vocation Director on a regular basis and also works with a Sister Advisor. During this time she and the Vocation Director continue to explore her desires, talents and skills to make sure they are a good fit with IHM. It is a time of mutual discernment. When both determine that the woman is sufficiently ready, she begins the process of application for candidacy.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<A NAME="initial"><H3>INITIAL FORMATION PHASE</H3></A>
 

The initial formation program consists of three phases:  the candidacy, the novitiate and a period of temporary profession. During this entire period there is continual conversation, assessment and feedback regarding the woman's progress and her suitability for the IHM lifestyle.
<P>
<B>Candidacy</B>
<P>
During the candidacy, a woman lives in community with IHM sisters and participates in the work of the Congregation. The Director of Formation initiates her into the Congregation's prayer life, history and spirit. After a period of one to two years, she is accepted into the
novitiate.
<P>
<B>Novitiate</B>
<P>
During the novitiate a woman learns more about the Congregation, its structure and the vowed life. The first year provides the sister with an opportunity to develop her relationship with God through prayer and study. The second year is a time during which the novice learns to integrate prayer, the active life of the Congregation and the vowed commitment. Upon completion of the novitiate phase, the sister requests to make temporary vows for a period of at least three years.
<P>
<B>Temporary Profession</B>
<P>
During the time of temporary profession the sister continues to discern her call to the Congregation and to integrate and deepen the spiritual, communal and ministerial aspects of her life, while living in a local community and participating in full-time ministry. After an appropriate time in temporary profession, she requests to make public profession of perpetual vows. At this point, initial formation ends. The sister is admitted to full membership in the Congregation and commits herself to lifelong, ongoing formation.

<P>
<h2>
<img src="../../Photos/helene.gif" alt=""> Sr. Helene Hicks, 
IHM</h2>
serves as a registered nurse at the Spanish Catholic Center Medical 
Clinic and resides at St. John the Evangelist Convent, both in Silver 
Spring, MD.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
Our local community gathers for morning prayer and Mass in our convent 
chapel every weekday and uses this opportunity to praise and worship the 
Lord with several lay persons who join us.  It is a time of sharing 
concerns, praying for our Church and our world and for building 
community beyond the convent walls.
<P>
The work day begins at 8:30, usually preceded by a leisurely drive 
through Sligo Park -- this is the scenic route and it affords one the 
opportunity to see the seasonal beauty and handiwork of God before the 
hectic, frequently frustrating, workday begins.  Once the door to the 
clinic is opened, there is the almost unceasing ringing of the telephone 
with requests seeking medical advice, asking for vaccine records, 
appointments for laboratory work, pregnancy tests, well-baby check ups, 
OB/GYN exams, requesting food, receiving scheduled appointments from the 
Archdiocesan Health Care Network, as well as other agencies seeking help 
for their clients.
<P>
This particular morning I see several patients who have obstetrical 
problems.  The first is a 22 year old mother who was having thyroid 
problems and had missed her menses.  Is she pregnant again or are her 
symptoms a result of her malfunctioning thyroid?  How can she take care 
of another baby when she already has a 2-1/2 month old infant and the 
whole experience of motherhood is so new?
<P>
I see a second woman who has been married for six years and has been 
unable to conceive.  She had previously been seen at another clinic and 
told "everything" was "normal" and yet given no further help or advice.  
After some discussion and further questioning, she agreed to obtain her 
records and bring them to the clinic at which time we would give her an 
appointment with our OB/GYN doctor.  She departed with a smile and words 
of gratitude.
<P>
The next patient was an unscheduled walk-in, 28 years of age, mother of 
five with complaints about back pain radiating down her legs, having 
difficulty walking and 8 months pregnant without prenatal care.  She 
was crying and nervous.  Since our clinic does not have prenatal 
facilities, we have to refer these cases to other local agencies.  Time 
was given to this woman to calm her and urge her to go to the county 
hospital for immediate care.  I make a note to call her on Monday and 
verify that she had, indeed, gone to the hospital with the note 
describing her symptoms and requesting assessment and treatment as needed.
<P>
The morning passed all too quickly after seeing other patients and, 
since one of the six volunteer pediatricians was coming that afternoon, 
the clinic closed for lunch.  The staff eats in a kitchen at the clinic 
and there was a lively exchange about the latest happenings in the area, 
news topics, and family events -- an over-all relaxing period in a busy 
work day.
<P>
That afternoon, one of our special clients, Pablo, stopped by to say 
hello and to spend some time with us.  Pablo is a 30 year old Guatemalan 
who came to the U.S. so that he could earn money to buy a truck and 
return to his country to help his father transport produce to the 
market.  He had not foreseen that he would be diagnosed with lymphoma, 
be unable to work and have to undergo chemotherapy, but, of course, 
neither did we, when he first appeared at the clinic door with swollen, 
painful arms and nowhere to go for help.  He has a wonderful outlook, 
always has a smile, never complains even though he has lost all his hair 
and frequently feels nauseated.  When he cannot find work or is unable 
to work he comes to the clinic and does "little" jobs that need 
to be done.  Pablo is an inspiration to all of us.
<P>
That afternoon while I was preparing the infants/children for their 
examinations, the social worker from downstairs came up and asked if I 
would be able to "squeeze" another "special" child into the doctor's 
already crowded afternoon.  After I heard the background, my only 
response could be "Yes."  The toddler's story began last July when a man 
requested that Maria take care of his son until he attended to an 
emergency at the hospital.  Needless to say the man never returned and 
Maria has added another member to her family of five children.  She did 
not and does not know the boy's age, name or origin -- but after five 
months she has grown to love this little boy who she has fed and 
nourished and nurtured with motherly care and concern.
<P>
When he came up to be measured prior to seeing the doctor, he appeared 
to be a well-mannered, friendly, well-nourished toddler of about 18-19 
months.  This little "John Doe" immediately won a place in our hearts 
and obviously had a large part of his new mother's for she had named him 
after her own father since none of her birth children had received it.  
Once again I looked at another person sent to us, who was a valiant 
woman, personifying Christian values and not hesitating to act upon them.
<P>
The other infants/toddlers seen that day for checkup and vaccines had 
the routine problems for that age period.  The clinic usually closes at 
5:00 but because of a few "extras," the doctor didn't finish until 5:00, 
so by the time we closed the door for the weekend, night had arrived and 
rush hour was well on its way.
<P>
Dinner at the convent is at 6:00.  There is a real attempt to ask 
everyone how her day went and to share the funny as well as the poignant 
points of the day's work and I shared the story of little "John Doe."  
After dinner the evening news attracts a large number of viewers with 
comments and statements frequently being made about the topic of the moment.
<P>
The chapel offers the quiet and solitude where I can go after the 
evening activities to reflect on the day and how I was able to "see" 
God's presence and workings in the events and persons that made up these 
last 12-14 hours.  He had indeed manifested Himself in various people 
and I was grateful that I was able to see once again.  Thus passed the 
normal  day in the life of a clinic RN.  Yet, I can remember in nursing 
school one of the instructors saying that the word NORMAL is never used 
because what is normal for one person may not be normal for another.  As 
I ponder this thought, an acronym came to mind that might, indeed, allow 
me to use the word "NORMAL" for my work in the Medical Clinic for the 
Spanish Catholic Center:  Numerous Opportunities for Reflection, 
Mission, Advocacy, Love.

<P>
<h2>
<img src="../../Photos/mary_n.gif" alt=""> Sr. Mary 
Newett, IHM</h2>
serves as a pastoral associate at St. Bernard Parish in Riverdale, MD, 
and lives at St. John the Evangelist Parish in Silver Spring, MD.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
Someone asked me, "What is a typical day for you?"  The answer came forth 
immediately, "There's no typical day!"  Because pastoral work involves 
meeting people's needs, it is of necessity flexible, unplanned many 
times and often subject to change.  That has been my experience for 
these past 20 years.
<P>
However, the daily horarium that is somewhat typical is rising about 
5:30 a.m., dressing, eating breakfast, and then spending 30 minutes in 
private prayer, until communal prayers begin at 6:45 a.m. in the 
chapel.  Each sister takes a turn at preparing the morning prayers and 
it is interesting to find out what she has planned.  Mass is at 7:00 
a.m. and by 7:30 it is usually finished.
<P>
Since my commute to St. Bernard's in Riverdale, MD doesn't begin until 
8:30 a.m., I have an hour to continue prayer for awhile, read, etc.  By 
the Washington Beltway it takes about 20 minutes to get to the rectory 
where I have an office and begin my duties as Pastoral Associate.
<P>
Tentative plans for the day are to visit a parishioner in a nearby 
hospital, plan for a Eucharistic ministers meeting that evening, and 
take Holy Communion to two shut-ins, who recently had surgery and are 
unable to attend Mass.  Afterwards, I will assign Eucharistic ministers 
to see them on a regular basis.
<P>
After arriving I may receive word that a parishioner has died.  I then 
call the family to schedule a time to meet with them to plan the funeral 
Mass.  A form is filled out indicating their preferred scripture 
readings, lectors, people for offertory procession, people to place the 
pall on the casket, etc.  This form is given to the priest, cantor and 
organist.  A visit to the funeral home, attendance at the funeral Mass 
and services at the cemetery complete my involvement in the process.
<P>
Three days a week I leave the rectory at 4:00 p.m.; Wednesday is "duty 
day" and I arrive at 11:00 a.m. and leave at 8:00 p.m.  Friday is a day 
off, Saturday I arrive at 3:00 p.m. staying until 6:30 p.m. and Sunday 
goes from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
<P>
Most meetings are scheduled in the evening, i.e., parish council, 
liturgy training sessions, interviews, etc.  The weekend schedule is 
centered around the Eucharistic liturgies.  Greeting the people is the 
ministry of hospitality.  I welcome them to this sacrificial banquet 
where they will be nourished by the Word and Sacrament so that they can 
be witnesses of Christ in all they do during the following week.
<P>
This is the time when people stop to let me know if someone in the 
family is sick, or to ask for prayers for some intention.  In this way I 
have come to know personally many people in the parish.
<P>
The convent community gathers at 6:00 p.m. for supper and afterwards I 
may watch TV in the community room, read, do domestic chores and usually 
watch a program or two until retiring around 9:30 p.m.

<dl>
<dt>4:30 a.m. 
<dd>I spend my prayer time waking and centering myself on the 
readings I prepared for prayer last night.  The two pieces that struck 
me and connect are from Isaiah: "strengthen the weak hands, and make 
firm the feeble knees" and from Luke's Gospel the image of the crippled 
man's friends bringing him to Jesus despite many difficulties.  I find 
myself in touch with my own weaknesses and limitations yet grateful for 
the people who have brought me in faith closer to Jesus to find 
strength.  I pray that I may be that faithfilled person for another day.
<P>
<dt>6:30 a.m. 
<dd>As we gather for communal prayer, I find myself continually 
amazed by the reality of our diversity.  Our commitment to prayer 
reminds me that it is our faith alone that binds us in community.
<P>
<dt>7:00 a.m. 
<dd>Mass is in the school chapel with a consistent group of 
people whom I do not know well and yet with whom I feel a connection as 
we share this celebration together regularly.  As I am reading the first 
reading, thinking about the lines that struck me, I looked up.  Usually 
no one makes eye contact, but I found myself connecting with a parent of 
one of my first graders.  Because she is not someone usually present at 
Mass, I figured that it must be a mass for one of her family members and 
I remember that at a recent conference she shared the pain of loss that 
their family has experienced.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to 
pray with her.
<P>
<dt>7:30 a.m. 
<dd>Quick trip home for breakfast and last minute scheduling of 
after-school plans with one of the sisters.
<P>
<dt>8:00 a.m. 
<dd>The children have arrived and begin to fill the classroom 
with noise and conversations of the past weekend happenings.  They 
notice even the smallest changes in our classroom that I made over the 
weekend.  I appreciate their awareness.
<P>
<dt>8:30 a.m. 
<dd>We gather in our class and remember in a sign language 
prayer that we are all connected and we desire to work together during 
the day.  The children are particularly attentive to our prayer this 
morning.  Excitement builds when we spend our first half hour practicing 
for the Christmas show.  The children are very confident and doing well.
<P>
<dt>9:00 a.m. 
<dd>We join the other primary classes for an advent prayer in 
the hallway.
<P>
<dt>9:15 a.m. 
<dd>It's time for hard work!  Reading time.  Today we are 
practicing rhyming words that will be part of our next story.  I notice 
that the rain outside and the coming Christmas activities are making it 
difficult for the children to concentrate ... so we take those rhyming 
words and make a song.  A song always captures their attention.
<P>
<dt>10:00 a.m. 
<dd>A little break before sending them to Miss Scalese for 
music practice.  We play a number game that is directed toward a couple 
of children having difficulty with auditory perception but which all the 
children enjoy playing.
<P>
<dt>10:15 a.m. 
<dd>While the children are out for music practice I take time 
to make final preparations for lessons for the week and write a thank 
you note to the Post Office for the field trip we took last Friday to 
see Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus.
<P>
<dt>11:05 a.m. 
<dd>We have just enough time to squeeze in some handwriting 
practice before lunch.
<P>
<dt>11:20 a.m. -- Lunch time --
<dd>after getting the children settled with their chicken nuggets, I 
join some of the other teachers for lunch and we talk over some of the 
logistics for the Christmas Show.
<P>
<dt>11:55 a.m. 
<dd>Lunch is over, the children did not get out for recess 
because of the rain and are now feeling the effects of being indoors all 
morning.  I make some adjustments to our afternoon schedule to include 
some light activity to accommodate their little bodies:  acting out the 
twelve days of Christmas in math as we reviewed counting backwards was 
their favorite.  We viewed a video titled, "Nicholas, the Boy Who Became 
Santa," which was my favorite part of the afternoon.  It gave a little 
shift in attitude towards some tasks I needed to do that I wasn't 
looking forward to.
<P>
<dt>2:15 p.m. -- Dismissal time --  
<dd>We remember to pray for a little boy who is absent.  During the day 
we received news that his grandfather had died.
<P>
<dt>3:00 p.m. 
<dd>I met a Sister to run errands.  We had a great conversation 
and she encouraged me in areas that recently have been of great 
discouragement to me.  We experienced what seemed like a comedy of 
errors that brought lots of laughs.  It felt good to laugh.
<P>
<dt>5:15 p.m. 
<dd>We met as a community for evening prayer.  I was conscious 
of one sister's absence, aware that she was working very hard and long 
hours wondering if there is anything I could do to assist her.
<P>
<dt>5:30 p.m. 
<dd>We enjoy dinner together telling stories of family and 
community Christmas celebrations gone by -- most of them very humorous.
<P>
<dt>6:30 p.m. 
<dd>Decorating time for the Christmas show and I am aware that 
I am tired at this point in the day.  Doing what I can, I decide it 
would really be best to go home and take care of some odds and ends to 
be ready for another day tomorrow.
<P>
<dt>8:00 p.m. 
<dd>I jot down notes to be ready to write this journal entry 
tomorrow night and then take time to prepare the readings for tomorrow 
morning's prayer.  It seems sometimes the days pass and they are full of 
"busyness," little details and quick encounters with others.  But it is 
in reflecting on the little things that I find God most present.

DeCesare</title>

<P>
<h2>
<img src="../../Photos/nancy.gif" alt=""> Sr. Nancy DeCesare, IHM</h2>
is the Director of Social Services for the New York Foundling Hospital, 
an agency that cares for over 10,000 children and their families.  She 
resides at Blessed Sacrament Convent, Staten Island, NY.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
I usually rise in the morning between 5:45 and 6:00.  The sisters often 
tease me as I can dress in record time.  It must be a carry-over from my 
novitiate days.
<P>
Today is the Feast of St. Albert the Great who was a theologian in the 
early church and a great writer of policies for the Vatican.  Hearing 
our resident prison chaplain preach about his life this morning reminds 
me of my work as I daily address the policies of our society that both 
protect and exploit our children.
<P>
The gospel reading is from Luke 19:1-10.  Zaccheus is the main character 
who, because he was a tax collector, was considered a man involved with 
"dirty deals."  I have lots of little Zaccheuses where I minister.  They 
are young boys and girls, ages 10 to 15, who are children involved in 
dirty deals through their live on the streets.  These are children used 
and abused by parents and adults who should be their protectors.
<P>
This morning I arrived at the hospital at 7:20 to find Michael running 
down the fire escape with the garbage from the third floor boys' living 
area.  Michael has been with us a little over two months.  This is the 
longest he has stayed anywhere.  He has been in 14 different placements 
since his mother abandoned him at age 10.  She is a drug addict and no 
one has heard from her in over four years.  Most likely she has died 
from her addiction.
<P>
Angel stands guard from the fire escape making sure Michael reaches the 
dumpster.  One could write a book about Angel.  As I soon found out ... 
Angel is no angel.  At age nine he became the youngest drug runner to a 
gang called the Latino Kings in the Bronx.  He rarely attended school 
and he cannot read or write at age 15.  He is a child who was sexually 
abused by his uncle continually as a young boy as was his brother who is 
also in care.  No mother, no father, no extended family, this child is a 
survivor of the streets and proudly wears a blue and white bandana to 
witness to the world his true gang colors.  It is the only family he as 
ever known.
<P>
Angel, as is the case with many of our children, will eventually be 
placed in a residential treatment center, a facility for troubled youth 
in upstate New York.  Perhaps it will offer him the kind of love and 
attention he has never known as a child.
<P>
This morning I attend two diagnostic treatment conferences to discuss 
Doug, age 14, and Anna, age 12.  I chair the diagnostic team consisting 
of the psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, educational staff 
and medical team.  All have completed their testing and have come to 
make recommendations regarding the needs of these children.  We are very 
lucky today since for the first time in many months we have actually 
found not one but two of Doug's parents.  Although divorced they have 
enough interest to attend.  Perhaps in a year or so with family therapy 
it may be possible for Doug to return home to one of them.
<P>
We're not so lucky however with Anna who went AWOL before her conference 
day.  Although she originally went AWOL to her drug addicted mother in 
the Bronx, she ran back to the streets before anyone could intervene.  
We made our recommendations in this conference, but who knows if Anna 
will ever escape the life of the streets to try and implement them?  We 
can only pray for her at this point.
<P>
Time flies quickly in the hospital and my afternoon finds me driving to 
New York City with two other social workers for a case review on eight 
children in care.  We pray there is no traffic as we know this will 
surely make us late.  Our internal review team asks questions as to why 
these children are still in placement after nine months.  There are no 
simple answers and they know it.  These are throw-away children, many 
are already orphans or will be soon as parents die of AIDS.  Even though 
we know most of our children will be placed in residential treatment 
facilities, there is still a need to explore any possible family member 
or foster home placement.  Most of the children are so damaged by the 
time they arrive they cannot return to the community just yet.  For most 
we are their only advocates and family and so daily we struggle to 
provide the best for them.
<P>
The latter part of the afternoon finds me driving home by myself as the 
other two workers finished early and returned by train.  As I cross the 
lower westside I pass Covenant House's Right of Passage Program.  There 
is a young girl standing on 19th Street hustling.  I wonder if anyone 
sees her or will reach out to her.  I take special note of her face, her 
size and her clothing as she may well be our next placement tonight.  So 
many Zaccheuses, so many "dirty deals."  Only God knows how to save all 
of them.
<P>
At 5:00 I return home in time for evening prayer and dinner with the 
sisters.  Tonight's prayer is on community.  It is a good source of 
strength for me as I see so much brokenness each day.  It reminds me 
that we are all in this together.
<P>
Tonight is a good night, no evening meetings to attend.  It is however 
my night to cover emergency intakes for the hospital and the group 
homes.  I wonder as I sit back and relax just how many Zaccheuses will 
God send us this night.  I pray that God will help us to do so much more 
to reach this quickly dying population of street children.
<P>
Although they are living on the streets, stealing and prostituting to 
survive, involved in gangs, they are still God's children who, like 
Zaccheus, if given the opportunity, can find a better quality of live 
and love.  I easily fall asleep but, as I do so tonight, I pray for 
deeper acceptance by our world of children and for the transformation of 
those who do "dirty deals" to them.

<img src="../../Photos/mary_e.gif" 
alt=""> Sr. Mary Elaine Anderson, IHM</h2> 
is a pastoral minister in San Felipe, Sicuani, Peru. 
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
<dl>
<dt>4:30 a.m. 
<dd>I am awakened by the voices of our neighbors who are early 
risers.  I can hear them loading up their trucks and also the voices of 
men, women and children as they prepare for the journey that will take 
them up into the mountains and to market in Santa Barbara.  As I lay in 
bed I too begin to plan my day ... recalling the activities marked on my 
calendar and askng God for the energy to complete each one.
<P>
<dt>5:30 a.m. 
<dd>This time I am awakened by my alarm.  I rise, and as I open 
the door to my bedroom, I am greeted to a blast of cold air and watch 
our dog sleep on the balcony outside my room.  Crossing the patio to the 
kitchen I realize that it rained during the night, and think of our many 
neighbors who have been worried that the dryness will ruin their crops 
and who no doubt are grateful for last night's rain.  In the kitchen as 
I boil water for the thermoses I also wash the dishes left from the 
night before (water is turned off throughout Sicuani from 8:00 p.m. to 
5:00 a.m.) and sweep the floor.  Then I take my cup of coffee to the 
chapel where I spend 15 minutes preparing the day's readings.
<P>
<dt>6:00 a.m. 
<dd>I am back in the kitchen where I get a head start on 
preparing dinner ... washing rice and cutting the meat.
<P>
<dt>7:00 a.m. 
<dd>Peggy (a Sister of St. Joseph who lives with us) and I meet 
for prayer.  We are the only two because Eileen Egan is attending a 
meeting in Puno and Tomasa Fernandez left early for the campo.  The 
readings are filled with rich images of God's kingdom.  I reflect on the 
wolf that lies down with the lamb, the calf that eats with the lion and 
the child who cares for them.  I pray for Peru, for understanding among 
its different cultures and for peace and respect between the rich and 
the poor.  I wonder if I am not a little like Jesus' disciples who fail 
to see the kingdom in their midst, and so I pray for eyes to see God 
hidden in my day.
<P>
<dt>8:30 a.m. 
<dd>I wash my clothes (by hand) and hang them on the line.
<P>
<dt>9:00 a.m. 
<dd>Rufina's father (Rufina is a little girl who used to live 
on the street and is now in an orphanage in Cusco) comes to our door.  I 
scold him for drinking too much, ask him whether he is working and send 
him on his way with an orange.
<P>
<dt>9:15 a.m. 
<dd>I shower, dress and organize the art materials which I will 
need for the children in Sillota.
<P>
<dt>11:00 a.m. 
<dd>As Peggy and I are leaving for Sillota two men stop us 
outside our house to ask about having a funeral in San Felipe's chapel.  
They tell us about a young woman who was struck by lightening the day 
before.  We walk with them to the elementary school where we ask 
Guillermina, the daughter of the sacristan, to open the church for the 
priest and the family at 2:00 p.m.  By now it is too late to take the 
longer route and more gradual climb to Sillota, so we take the short cut 
which means crossing the mountain.  We are huffing and puffing when we 
reach the top, but the view is glorious.  Seeing our house on the edge 
of town and the green fields below, I am energized.  At that moment, God 
is so real to me.
<P>
<dt>12:00 p.m. 
<dd>The children of Sillota are waiting for us.  The school 
includes grades one to four and there are about 30 students.  They are 
the poorest in the area.  Even though they live close to Sicuani they 
cannot afford to go to school there.  The children are anxious to finish 
the nativity sets that we had begun making from stones.
<P>
<dt>2:30 p.m. 
<dd>We arrive home.  I heat up our dinner, and we eat.
<P>
<dt>3:30 p.m. 
<dd>I set out alone taking the back route across streams and 
fields and through the woods to Acobamba.  The catechist and about 30 
children are waiting for me.  We sing carols and practice a play based 
on Luke's account of the birth of Jesus which we are preparing for the 
Christmas celebration.  The children are very happy, and they insist 
that I play a game with them before I leave.  I also enjoy playing, so I 
don't refuse.
<P>
<dt>6:00 p.m. 
<dd>I arrive home, I am tired and decide to relax for awhile.  
I fall asleep.
<P>
<dt>7:30 p.m. 
<dd>I fix a cup of hot chocolate and take it to the community 
room.  Peggy and Thomasa are already there.  As we talk I prepare the 
materials I need for the workshop that I am giving in Yanaoca tomorrow.
<P>
<dt>9:00 p.m. 
<dd>I go to my room.  As I am preparing for bed I think about 
the day's activities and thank God for all the opportunities I had to 
meet Him/Her during the day.  I pray especially for the husband and 
children of the woman who was buried this afternoon.  I read a few pages 
of my current novel, and I am soon sleepy.
<P>
<dt>9:45 p.m. 
<dd>I turn out the light and quickly fall asleep.

<Center>Sports on the Radio</Center>
<Body>
<P>At VMFM, we don't just play music, we carry every home basketball game, for
both the Pacers and Lady Pacers here at Marywood, live as it is happening.  Our
on-air sports team is the best of any college in the area.  Hear the excitement
live on VMFM 91.5!!!<Br>

<Center><B>Upcoming Schedule</B></Center><Br>
<B>1995-96 season completed</B><Br>
<Br>
<P>* - The 1995-96 basketball season has been completed here at Marywood
College.  Tune in next season to see if the young Pacer squad can challenge for
a PAC playoff spot and if the Lady Pacers can advance past the first round.<Br>

<Center>On air personalities for 1995-1996 season</Center>
<P>Carol Dean - Ms. Dean brings a wealth of experience after being a sports
reporter for the local CBS-TV affiliate (WYOU Ch. 22), and she uses it to her
advantage as one of the few female sportscasters in our area.<Br>

<P>Frank Coccuza - A newcomer here to the VMFM Sports team, he has a style all
his own.  An insider with the athletic department, he gets personal and
informative interviews with the all the team members, from the head coach
right down to the 15th player.<Br>

<P>Bill Jones - A member of the men's baskteball team, Bill obviously comes to
us on a limited basis.  But if it is a women's game, watch out Dick Vitale! 
Bill knows more about all the players than anyone else out there.  Also a
co-host and co-producer of <B>Pacer Pride</B>, sports is the name of his
game.<Br>

<P>Jared Rivera - Quick-paced action and a love for the game mark Mr. Rivera's
style.  Three years of experience and a good general knowledge of the game
have helped him become the most active of the group.  A high school basketball
player and the son of a head coach, he's been there and knows what it feels
like to be a part of the action.<Br>

<P>John Seitzinger - If you want to know anything about any sport here at
Marywood, John is the man for you.  The Sports Information Director and an
ex-head coach of the Lady Pacers, John not only has close contact with the all
the players, but with all the local players as well as officials.  He is the
stat man, everything from the leading scorer, down to a detail like steals per
game.  He brings a coach's mentality to the radio and helps dissect strategy.
Also a co-host and co-producer of <B>Pacer Pride</B>.<Br>

Institute of Technology, every week as he teaches not only the flash and 
style of playing guitar, but also the theory behind the music. As a member of
the northeast Pennsylvania group Totally Lost Cause, Charlie is in the process
of recording his third album, and he has also written his own teaching manual, 
 "The Expressive Guitarist", which he uses to teach from during "Guitar Shop".
In addition to the show, Charlie also gives private lessons and instructions in
both guitar and bass. To order a copy of his book, "The Expressive Guitarist",
call Charlie at (717) 963-1676, or write "The Expressive Guitarist, P.O. Box 4,
Scranton, Pa. 18509".  "Guitar Shop" may have started out as a five minute 
student project, but today it is TVM-37's most popular and talked about show.

<h3>About Father Joos's Appointment</h3>
From <cite>Thou, Lord, Art My Hope</cite>
<P>
... Not locating a native American whom he [Bishop Lefevre] judged capable ..., he decided on one of his countrymen whom he had received into his diocese little more than a year earlier; Reverend Edward Joos, assistant at St. Anne's, Detroit, was a mere n
ine years ordained, thirty-two years of age and only a year in America.  His only experience with religious life was the fact that he had attended a Franciscan school in Belgium preparatory to his entrance to the seminary.  Bishop Lefevre, accordingly, un
dertook to instruct him in the principles of religious life.  The Bishop had been a novice in the Congregation of the Mission in Paris but seems never to have made Holy Vows.  Sister Rosalita quotes of the situation:
<P>
...While he was a novice ... he had become conversant with the administrational organization of the Daughters of Charity which provides that their superior shall always be a priest of the Congregation of the Mission.  Belgium, the birthplace of both Bisho
p Lefevre and Father Joos had more than one institute of women with that type of organization.  But, whatever the Bishop's thought or motive, certainly his act in placing an utter stranger -- a foreigner -- over a body of American women, was ill-advised, 
as was evident from the unrest and unhappiness that followed.
<P>
.... [This] was a definite turning point in the history of the Congregation.  Mother Theresa and her Sisters prudently made no comments, but there was a growing resentment in their hearts at the Bishop's high-handed impostition of the Rules and regulation
s of the Congregation of the Mission upon the spiritual principles of St. Alphonsus of which the Redemptorist Fathers had given them so strong and secure a foundation....
<P>
Despite outward appearances, however, life in the Congregation was not so unchanged as Father Joos considered it; little by little, he assumed the privileges of Superior, presiding at the Chapter of Faults, scrutinizing (though not yet censoring) all outg
oing and incoming mail, demanding the right to give or withhold all permissions, supervising the accounts, examining the convent premises, etc., etc.  All these matters were interpreted by the Sisters as intrusions, with the result that restlessness and d
iscontent soon became evident among them.]

<h3>Father O'Reilly to Father Joos</h3>
<pre>
                   St. Joseph's April 19, 1859
</pre>
Rev. E. Joos,<br>
Sir,
<P>
I have been very much surprised to see a letter from you commanding, in 
the name and by the "<u>positive orders</u>" of your Rt. Rev. Bishop, 
the Sister, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary who are located 
here, to return "immediately" to your diocese.  It must be, Rev. Sir, 
that your Rt. Rev. Bishop gave you these instructions without reflecting 
on the many disadvantages which, if such orders were complied with, 
would result from such a step -- disadvantages not only to religion and 
their community in this locality, but also to me individually who have, 
at a great pecuniary sacrifice, established them here, and contributed 
to and supplied all their wants without calling on Monroe for a single 
penny of assistance. 
<P>
As you are aware, Rev. Sir, of all that has transpired between the 
"Sisters" and us previous to their reception into this diocese, you 
cannot be unconscious that no mention was made concerning their return 
to Detroit.  Had it been otherwise, I would never have consented to 
receive them, knowing (as I do too well) how injurious it is to the 
well-being of a school to remove those in whom the affections of pupils 
are concentrated, the confidence of parents, patrons centered. 
<P>
Be it said to the honor of this community that its members have 
succeeded in an eminent degree, in securing the confidence and patronage 
of the people here, and have accomplished more good during this short 
term here that we had hoped, in our most sanguine anticipations, they 
would have affected in years. 
<P>
Under such auspices, then, and without consulting the detriment 
necessarily acruing to their "Congregation", to religion, to education 
here, and to myself, I must confess that I been [sic] greatly deceived 
in my former knowledge and high estimation of your great and good Bishop 
in whom so many virtues shine resplendent, if he knowing these facts, 
lend his counsel and power to advocate and execute a measure this 
injurious to religion and lending so plainly to frustrate the hopes of 
one laboring equally with himself, although on a smaller scale, to 
cultivate, nourish and propagate the "Mustard Seed". 
<P>
Apart from these considerations, Rev. Sir, the obligations of the 
"Sisters" to the Rt. Rev. Bishop of Detroit, existed <u>only</u> whilst 
they were under his jurisdiction, therefore, their obedience to him 
ceased as soon as the received his approbation to depart.  Such follows 
from the "Constitutions" by which they are governed, and from which it 
is unnecessary to make extracts for you who are so well acquainted with them.
<P>
The Sisters renewed their vows <u>here</u> on the 8 of last December, 
and in that renovation professed their <u>obedience</u> to the Rt. Rev. 
Bishop of the diocese of Philadelphia; therefore, to him and <u>to him 
only</u> as Bishop do they owe obedience whatever to the Rt. Rev. Bishop 
of Detroit save what religion in general and the gratitude of generous 
souls to a former superior requires. 
<P>
Such, Rev. Sir, are the logical inferences drawn from their "Rule", such 
the motives that prevent me from complying with your orders. 
<P>
Begging to be excused for an unavoidable delay in replying to your 
respected favor above alluded to; (absence on duty being the cause) and 
requesting you to present my humble respects to your venerated Bishop, 
assuring him at the same time that, whenever in my power, I shall most 
cordially correspond, and feel highly honored in being able to comply 
with any request of his, 
<P>
I have the honor to remain,<br>
Rev. dear Sir,<br>
Yours in Christ<br>
J.V. O'Reilly

<h3>Bishop Neumann to Mother Mary Joseph</h3> 
<pre>
                              I.M.I.
                      Phila June 1st 1859
</pre>
Dear Respected Mother
<P>
About two weeks ago I was in Susquehanna Co. to have a conversation with 
the Very Rev. J.V. O'Reilly, and Sr. Theresa, about the affairs of your 
sisters circumstances.  The General Custom of the Church will hardly 
allow of Sisters regarding the Bishop of another Diocese as their first 
and immediate Superior.  In making the annual vows the Sisters make them 
to the Bishop in whose diocese they actually live, & whenever a Sister 
is to be removed from one Diocese to another, the consent of both 
Bishops will be necessary.  The Rules as they stand now do not define 
the above points with sufficient clearness. 
<P>
As a General Mother Superior is required to keep up the union of all 
houses in different Dioceses, a Rule or Constitution will have to 
determine, how she is to be appointed, whether she is to govern the 
Community during her whole life, or for a certain number of years -- 
where she is to reside and in what relation she is to be with the 
respective Bishops. 
<P>
In Communities, where Sisters are to regard the Diocesan Bishop as their 
immediate Superior (Visitation Nuns, Sisters of St. Joseph's, etc), they 
seem to have a Noviciate for every Diocese, at least when found expedient.
<P>
As long as the Rule remains unfinished I consider it due to the Bishops, 
who have houses of the Community in their Dioceses, that no new 
regulation be added to the Rule, without their approbation. 
<P>
I do not like the idea entertained by some of the Sisters, to leave the 
Diocese of Detroit.  Religious houses, when one is founded, ought not to 
be given up without evident physical or moral necessity.  When God helps 
you, to be poor indeed, it is very good for all, who profess Poverty; 
Monroe being moreover in the Country, is one of the very places which 
according to Rule, is to be benefitted by the ministrations of your 
Sisters.  As long as your Venerable Bishop has any wish that you remain 
in Monroe, the Sisters ought not to think of leaving the cradle of their 
Community. 
<P>
I found the Sisters rather too crowded in St. Joseph's, as the new 
addition is going on but slowly they will have hard times there during 
the heat of the Summer.  The new house in Reading is being put in order, 
and will accommodate, and probably occupy and support sufficiently 8 or 
10 Sisters.  The schools will be opened in the beginning of September. 
<P>
Mother Therese informed me, that Your Right Rev Bp has appointed you 
Superior of the Community, and I assured them that I have no difficulty 
in recognizing you as such.  They all respect and love you, and I can 
assure you, that you need not fear any want of obedience on their side.  
I myself have always hated even the appearance of schism, and shall not 
fail to prevent it as long as I am Bishop of Phila.  If your stay in 
Monroe should have become impossible, and your Rt. Rev. Bishop allows 
you to leave his diocese, you and your Sisters are free to come to this 
diocese, though as I stated, there is as yet but very little room for so 
many more.  Trials and all sorts of afflictions are usually the 
beginning of great favors from heaven, and therefore I would recommend 
patience and forbearance.  In critical circumstances like yours seem to 
be, you require much prayer, purity of intention, and the wise caution, 
never to act precipitately, even when it seems to you, that you are right.
<P>
The projected house in Bellefonte is not yet established.  Want of means 
prevent the Benedictine Fathers of opening it; it may be that in five or 
six months circumstances will be more favorable. 
<P>
I finish this long letter at last after may interruptions, even for 
days.  But I hope it will come into your hands in time. 
<P>
I pray to God to bless you and all Your Community, and remain with 
sincere attachment 
<P>Yours truly in Xt<br>
J.N. Bp Phil<br>
Mother M of St. Joseph

Mother Theresa and some of her Redemptorist friends initiated efforts to 
persuade sisters to leave Monroe when their annual vows expired.  In the 
case of novices, they urged immediate withdrawal and entrance in 
Pennsylvania.  These Redemptorists attempted to contact sister whom they 
had originally directed to Monroe.  The letters were intercepted; their 
contents shared by Father Joos with Bishop Lefevere.  The anger and 
bitterness engendered by these actions gravely exacerbated the tension 
between Monroe and Pennsylvania.

The following is an example of one of the letters.

<h2>Father Jacobs to Sister Coletta</h2>
<pre>
                    Annapolis Md. May 4th 1859
</pre>
Dear Sister Coletta
<P>
When on a Mission in Philadelphia before Easter I had the happiness of 
seeing Rev. Mother Teresa and Sister Ignatius just before they left for 
St. Joseph's, I was indeed delighted with this interview especially when 
Mother told me, that you were doing so well in the Noviciate.  May God 
and His dear Mother assist you to persevere unto the end! 
<P>
But now Rev. Mother Teresa as well as Bishop Neumann and Father Smulders 
want you in St. Joseph's and wish me to communicate this to you.  Since 
you have not yet made your vows, you do not depend upon the Bishop of 
Detroit and therefore I as your confessor, who sent you to Monroe, 
withdraw you again to comply with the wish of Rev. Mother.  You will 
then, dear Sister, please to leave Monroe for St. Joseph's as soon as 
this letter reaches you.  The money for the journey you will get from 
Mr. O'Connor, whom Rev. Mother by a letter has authorized to pay the 
expenses.  I see to my great delight that God by storms and tribulations 
makes your holy ardor take firm roots in the ground of the church.  The 
new foundation in Reading Penna. which I saw, is really beautiful and 
grand and will hold a great many novices.  May the Immaculate heart of 
Mary ever guard and protect her own work and give you all the grace of 
strength and fortitude! 
<P>
This is my sincerest wish, with which, asking your prayers most 
earnestly I remain in the heart of Jesus and Mary. 
<P>
Your unworthy<br>
Fr. Jos. Mary Jacobs<br>

<h2>Mother Mary Joseph to unnamed sister in Pennsylvania</h2>
<pre>
                           J.M.J.A.T
</pre>
Revd & dear Sister in J.C.
<P>
Some days ago a letter was handed me, addressed to one of our Candidates 
& which, on opening, I found to have been written by one of the members 
of you Convent. 
<P>
Pardon me, my dear Sister, if I should myself address you a few lines in 
answer to the above-mentioned letter, which I do with conscientious 
motive of letting you know the position exactly in which we consider 
ourselves with regard to the institutions at Reading & St. Joseph's, & 
consequently the course which now, as in future, we are bound to 
conscience before God to pursue. 
<P>
From the purport of the good Sister's letter, I presume she is under the 
impression that the Communities of I.H.M. in the Diocese of Detroit 
belong to the same Order as that of which she is a member.  This, my 
dear Sister, is a grave mistake; for in a letter of our Rt. Rev. Bishop 
of Detroit, dated 10th of June 1859, in which he pronounces the 
dismissal of two Sisters then belonging to the Institute, he formally 
states, with regard to the Sisters in the Diocese of Philadelphia, that 
they are forever cut off from the Order of the Srs Sevts of the Immte Ht 
[sic] of Mary & consequently no correspondence or fellowship should be 
held with them.  This my dear Sister is the formal decree of our first 
Superior, and given, only after his having heard through me, the 
conscientious opinion of the majority of the members of our Community 
here, respecting the matter, viz: that all disconnection was preferable 
to the unsettled and dreadfully trying state of affairs at that time.  
From that moment we became separated, and the two Institutions are now 
as distinct as is our Holy Rule & as I understand our Customs also. <P>
Be not surprised at the silence of Sr. Dennehy, with whom I would deal 
unfairly were I to conceal from her the course she has to adopt in 
relation to those Sisters whom I believe she tenderly loves, in order 
that she may have time to reflect if she be able to submit to the trial, 
or not before our admitting her as Novice.  She is very well, however, & 
prays for the Sisterhood at Reading, as we all do; and though my dear 
Sister, in the eternal pleasure of an unerring Providence, we know not 
His loving designs in thus permitting a separation among those who once 
possessed (if I may thus express myself) but one heart & one soul in 
common, yet <u>this</u> much we know, that He wills we should be united 
and united forever, in the fervent desire of living & serving our 
Heavenly Master and in accomplishing to the end His adorable Will here, 
in order that we may all enjoy an eternal union in the bosom of His love 
hereafter.  Let us all do this and a happy eternity is ours. 
<P>
Please pray for me & for our beloved Sisters<br>
Sincerely Yrs in the tender love of Jesus & Mary<br>
Sr Mary Joseph<br>
Servant I.H.M.

<h3>Sister Mary Whipple to Bishop Lefevere</h3>
<pre>
                            J.M.J.A.T.
</pre>
Rt. Rev. father in God [Bishop Lefevere]
<P>
I received a letter this morning from father Joos asking three questions 
in the name of your Lordship. 
<P>
For years I have sighed and prayed to be in a religious community and 
not a society and it was only the hope that one day our society would 
come to that, that kept me here where I am, now God seems to have heard 
my prayers, and I cannot in conscience refuse to correspond to his voice 
and desire to go where things will be established on a solid basis which 
is not the case here, for me to find peace of soul and content here, is 
impossible, it is not living, it is a martyrdom, which I feel unable to 
bear any longer -- Still, I would not take any decided steps before 
having consulted, this, I have done and after having exposed the state 
of my soul without disguise to an enlightened and prudent director, who 
was sent by your Lordship.  I am convinced that if I wish to sanctify 
myself and find peace and happiness, I must go elsewhere -- The Will of 
God for me I think is clear. 
<P>
To the first question I say:  that under present circumstances I cannot 
correspond to the views of your Lordship.  I would do it willingly were 
it in my power _____ 2nd knowing that Mother Theresa (our foundress) has 
still authority over me I cannot recognize two Superiors.  3rd I cannot 
consent to break off correspondence with those who have formed me to the 
religious life, to whom after God I owe everything and under whose 
guidance I will always feel in assurances. 
<P>
Now my Lord don't think that I write on the impulse of the movement.  
No.  Ten years refectons [reflections] cound not change a conviction I 
have had years.  Emboldened by the kindness your Lordship has always 
shown me, I humbly and earnestly entreat you, Your Lordship, to give me 
permission to go and join my own community by transferring your rights 
over me to the Bishop of Philadelphia -- but if your Lordship should in 
his wisdom refuse to grant me my request I will try to do my duty till 
the 8th of December in which period I will be no longer bound by my vows 
which it is not my intention to renew here -- Begging a share in your 
prayers and your holy Benediction. 
<P>
I am your obedient Servant in Christ<br>
Sister Mary<br>

</pre>
June 6, 1859<br>
Revd. Father,
<P>
I have written to you that it was almost impossible for me to answer the 
questions proposed by his Lordship, without further consultation.  I 
have done so, but as the answer to my questions delays so much I think 
myself bound in conscience to let you know at least my dispositions with 
regard to the proposed questions.  I have and still do consult both God 
and my conscience in this matter -- As to the first question which is to 
second his Lordship's efforts to retain the Institute in His Diocese -- 
I cannot say that I am willing to do so, for I am convinced of the contrary.
<P>
As to the second which is if we recognize Mother M. Joseph for Superioress.
<P>
According to our rules and constitutions I consider neither one nor the 
other as lawful Superior but should I wish to remain in the same 
religious order that I have embraced some years past I must follow our 
foundress Mother Theresa whom I consider to be at the heart of the 
Institution.  Yet, consequently, considering her as bearing a right over 
me I cannot give up all correspondence with her. 
<P>
You might be, Revd Father, under the impression that I have been 
somewhat influenced in these matters, believe it not for I have not in 
the least deviated from my first sentiments which were to obey and be 
submissive to those whom God has placed over me, until the expiration of 
my vows reserving to myself then the liberty of choosing whatever ... 
would be more advantages [sic] for the sanctification of my soul, but 
Holy Providence has thought it best to bring to a enlightened person on 
the subject (without my seeking it) therefore do I feel bound to abide 
by his decisions unto the last moment.  Should I have been too bold in 
addressing this to you, Dear Father, cast a look then of charity upon 
what I have said, and forgive by granting your blessing, to the most 
unworthy of all the servants of Mary. 
<P>
Your humble servant in Christ<br>
Sister Mary Rose

<h3>Sisters Mary and Rose to Bishop Lefevere</h3>
Dear Rev. Father in Christ,
<P>
We have just received a letter from Rev. Fr. Joos, informing us of our 
discharge from the community. 
<P>
We are very sorry to see, that we have been misunderstood by your 
Lordship.  It was never our intentions to do anything contrary our holy 
vow of obedience, nothing was ever commanded us, should it have been, we 
would not have refused to obey, questions were proposed to us we had to 
answer according to our consciences. 
<P>
Knowing now, that we no longer belong to your community, we think it 
more prudent for us to leave immediately. 
<P>
We will take the cars tomorrow morning for St. Joseph, if holy 
providence permits it. 
<P>
Your most humble servants,<br>

<h2>Letter from Mother Theresa to Bishop Lefevere</h2>
<pre>
					JMJAT
</pre>
My Lord Bishop and Father in God [Lefevere]:
<P>
After seven years of penance and tears, I venture again to intercede for 
pardon and mercy, for the love of Him who never rejects "a contrite and 
humbled heart." 
<P>
Believe, Father, I have not known one hour's happiness since I had the 
misfortune of displeasing you, and would have returned at the time to 
cast myself at your feet begging forgiveness, but, never was allowed to 
do so before. 
<P>
Do then, receive me again among your children, if you do, Rt. Rev. 
Father, time, better than my words, will prove to you Lordship the 
purity of my motive.  God alone knows, the interior martyrdom, I have 
endured since my errors.  If I only can see your Lordship once before death!
<P>
Sr. Celestine also crave [sic] the same privilege, she too, is on exile 
here, and the poor soul is innocent. 
<P>
I will go daily, until I hear from you Lordship, to the portals of the 
Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, asking them to vouchsafe to incline 
your heart to sentiments of mercy towards your unworthy, sorrowful and 
humble servant, and child in Christ.

I received a letter from Mother Teresa craving hers and Sister

<h2>Mother Theresa to Mother Elizabeth Bruyere</h2>
<pre>
                  Susquehanna, December 9, 1866
</pre>
My very dear and good Mother,
<P>
Your letter sent on the first of the month was received on Wednesday the 
fifth.  After having read it, I feel fulfilled and greatly consoled.  I 
can no longer doubt that Will of God.  I will as much as possible act 
according to the decision of this worthy religious.  I received the 
Bishop's answer which permitted the renovation of vows; at the same time 
as yours, this ceremony consequently took place yesterday in our chapel 
Sister Celestine and I did the same as the others.  I renewed my vows 
with the intention that God would approve in our case, when we gave 
ourselves to God it was for always and now we wish to do nothing to the 
contrary in our plans, more so, we want to put ourselves in a situation 
where we can fulfill them more faithfully. 
<P>
I do not know exactly when we will be leaving, perhaps with the help of 
God, it will be this month next year.  I will from now 'til then arrange 
a few things, so that all will be in good order before departing.  It 
will be necessary to make it known to the Bishop and the community.  I 
unite my prayers to yours daily, I have great confidence in the Hail 
Mary said in common.  We hope that Divine Providence will complete what 
has begun by facilitating our departure; indeed who would have thought 
that my writing for Sister Mary, only to add force to her request, would 
open a door for me also, while all the steps I have taken to return to 
Monroe have served for nothing. 
<P>
I am exceedingly grateful for the offer that you make for furnishing the 
means of paying for our journey.  I hope to have enough money for that.  
I would like to know the cost, Sister M. must remember.  It was too 
generous a gift.  I recognize my unworthiness and I fear that you 
consider me something that I am not.  For whatever you think you will 
get your reward.  We could not read your letter filled with tenderness 
and sympathy, without shedding tears.  I feel younger by ten years since 
our correspondence.  You will have time, dear friend, to write once more 
before I have the happiness of joining you, in order to learn to love 
the good God more and to become a saint.  Until now I had no means of 
communicating to others the good news that they could hope to be 
admitted, but I shall try, and I shall leave the address which you have 
given me with one or another before leaving. 
<P>
I remain, dear Mother, in the hearts of Jesus and Mary, Always yours,
<P>
Mary Therese<br>
Servant C.I.M.

<h2>Mother Theresa to Mother Elizabeth Bruyere</h2>
<pre>
				 Convent of St. Alphonsus
				Adrian, [October] 11, 1868
</pre>
Reverend and Very dear Mother,
<P>
I will wait no longer to give you our news, such as it is.  Your 
Lordship was away, our destiny is not yet decided; we have been to 
Monroe as we planned, where we were received with kindness by Father 
Joos as well as by all the Sisters; our feelings of acceptance toward 
one another were mutual, all, even those who had never seen us, 
expressed as much happiness as all the others.  It was Sister Alphonsine 
who opened the door, for Father had already announced our arrival; on 
meeting, we remained immovable for a few seconds, like stupefied, 
looking at one another before being able to embrace. 
<P>
Father could not keep us without the consent of the Bishop, he advised 
us to go at once to Detroit to obtain permission of his Lordship -- we 
arrived there with new hope -- only to be obliged to return without 
success.  Perhaps the Bishop will not be returning for a week.  That is 
the reason we were sent here, as much to see Sister Francis as to avoid 
the stir which the news of our arrival would cause among the people if 
we were to spend Sunday in Monroe.  You see, my good and very dear 
Mother, that we have yet a great need of your fervent prayers, also 
those of the Community, as long as we have not seen his Lordship, we 
will be uncertain, yet, we are hopeful. 
<P>
The Superior [Father Joos] being well disposed in our favor has even 
given me a letter for the Bishop to tell him that he has no objection to 
receiving us back among your Sisters.  On the other hand Father Hespelin 
frightened us not a little in speaking of the firmness of Bishop 
Lefevere, he said that we were going against his wishes, when once he had 
pronounced a resolution on anything whatsoever he rarely changed [his] 
mind.  Meanwhile we rely on the hope of the hopeless. 
<P>
It is now fifteen days since we left Ottawa and it seems more like a 
month, so much so that this state of uncertitude make the time seem 
long.  There is no need to tell you that I am always with you in spirit 
and I imagine that I see you all. ... 
<P>
We must remain here until we receive a telegram that Father Hennaert 
promised to send us when the Bishop arrived.  In reading my letter you 
will have no problem believing that I am not yet settled -- I hope that 
the next one will be more hopeful, also, I will not try today to express 
the sentiments of gratitude I have in my heart for you, that I always 
will consider you to be my best friend, and also for your holy community.
<P>
Farewell then my good and very dear Mother.  I am always yours in Jesus 
and Mary 
<P>
Sister Mary Theresa

Mother Theresa was taken by surprise at Bishop Lefevere's decision:  he 
decided to permit Sr. Celestine to return to the Congregation in Monroe, 
but he denied permission to Mother Theresa.  Having been thus rejected, 
Theresa traveled to Scranton, but the Bishop William O'Hara refused to 
allow her to remain.  Theresa then returned to her native city, 
Baltimore, to seek some refuge.  However, she found none, and turned 
again to the Grey Nuns.  At this darkest hour of her life, homeless and 
penniless, she wrote this most poignant of all her letters.

<h2>Mother Theresa to Mother Elizabeth Bruyere</h2>
<pre>
				St. Anthony's Orphan Asylum
				Baltimore November 28, 1868
</pre>
Reverend and very dear Mother,
<P>
After many hesitations, at last we must come to this.  It is a 
confession and humiliation which I have well deserved for my  
inconsistency and for having counted on uncertainty.  You have no doubt 
already learned that his Lordship of Detroit did not permit himself to 
yield in regard to me.  Sister Celestine remained after having pleaded 
her cause, consequently I have to return alone, and since then all my 
efforts to be received again among my own in the Diocese of Philadelphia 
have been fruitless.  There is not the least difficulty on the side of 
our Sisters; they are unanimous in desiring that I remain.  My departure 
has caused them much sorrow.  Mother Jerome was the first to go to 
Bishop O'Hara but he does not wish to permit it and sends her to the 
Bishop of Philadelphia.  Father O'Reilly himself received me with 
kindness and took the trouble to go to intercede for me with the Bishop 
of Scranton, without much success because he did not wish to displease 
Bishop Wood.  The Archbishop of Baltimore does not wish to get mixed up 
in it saying that he knows nothing of the affair. 
<P>
Here I am then an outcast neither more nor less -- Up to the present 
while I was taking all these steps I have triedf to keep myself hidden 
so that the affair woudl not cause any disturbance, but that cannot go 
on.  I have as a last recourse obtained hospitality in this orphanage 
for a few days only and I do not know where to go. 
<P>
You know dear and good Mother, that I would never have left you except 
to return to my own ... In asking you permission to go to Monroe, I did 
not even think of making the condition that you would take me back in 
case I did not succeed.  Now I do not know how to make such a prayer; 
words fail me byu I know that I am understood.  God wills it since I 
have not been able to succeed in anything since I had the misfortune of 
leaving you.  You can more easily imagine the shame and confusion that I 
experience than I would be able to tell you.  It is enough that you 
understand.  Answer me, I pray you, by telegraph -- that is rapid and I 
am in danger.  Please pray for and have prayers said for her who 
recognizes herself unworthy of your kindnesses. 
<P>
May Our Lady of the Sacred Heart obtain for you all the graces you desire.
<P>
Sister Mary Theresa

There are ... numerous anomalies of sentence structure [in the following 
letter] indicating the spontaneous and hurried nature of the writing and 
the fact that Theresa did not learn English as her first language and 
had not often written it for the previo us twelve years.

<h2>Mother Theresa to Sister Genevieve</h2>
<pre>

                            J.M.J.A.T
                   Convent of the Gray [sic] Nuns
                    Ottawa  October 9, 1881
</pre>
My dear Child, Sr. M. Genevieve,
<P>
Your very welcome letter come duly to hand and was for me a cause of 
both joy and sorrow.  I was glad to learn that I was not forgotten by 
you and by many others of those ever dear to me, and grieved at so cruel 
a separation, doubt not that you are all always present in my memory and 
are objects of my daily prayers, my life here has been a long martyrdom 
indeed, it is was possible for the Archb. and Bp. to know the extent of 
the sufferings and unhappiness this state of things brings, the tears 
that are still flowing, their hearts would be moved to compassion should 
it be of stone, and all this for what, I could not say!  Now that earch 
[each] diocese has its own Convents and Sisters independent of the 
others I should think that Bishop O'Hara [first Bishop of Scranton] 
could grant the permission necessary for my return without Arch Wood's 
having any thing to say against it, anyhow, he need not know of it, for 
my part, if I had the happiness of being again with my own I would be 
very quiet and silent, they need not apprehend any trouble from me, 
should they be merciful.  It is now an old story, the anger of Bp. 
Lefevere ought to be in oblivion now.
<P>
You tell me dear Child, that everyone would like to have me back in the 
Order in fact, which I never left in heart, for I am now just the same 
as when I came here, necessity obliges me to wear another habit that is 
all by you know "L'habit ne fait pas le moine".
<P>
Now, why dont you write a petition to Bp. O'Hara. begging my admission 
and have every Sister in his Diocese write their name at the end in case 
it was the desire of all.  I think you would be capable of doing it 
should you be chosen to do so in the name of the Superior.  You may tell 
the Bishop that I am but a poor exiled member of the Instition [sic] of 
the Imm. Heart there is no inconsistency in me, for miserable I have 
been since; living in hope that Divine Providence would permit me to go 
back to my own, and pray daily for that object in reciting the Litany of 
Divine Prov. and many other prayers.
<P>
I have written to Father Smuder [sic] on the subject for I know that he 
has no other wish but that I should be with my Sisters, but got the 
answer that the Priest in charge of the Sisters, did not seem to care 
about it.  I was not surprised at this from Father Joos, the Order is 
now altogether in his hands and is considered as his own work and I 
think he has done well for it is in a very good standing, however, could 
I return and have my choice I would prefer Pennsylvania to Detroit, 
havin [sic] been a victim in the transportation of the Order to 
Philadelphia, for this is the origin of all the trouble.
<P>
The Bp. of Detroit had given permission to have a mission in that state 
and a foundation was made instead, he got angry and on seeing that all 
the Sisters wanted to follow those that were there, he made the Division 
in the Order and wrote to Bp. Wood against the Fathers and poor me -- 
You say that you never gave up hope, I can say the same -- did all I 
could to make the sacrifice sometimes being told that I ought.  Still in 
the most inmost recess of my soul always indulged the thought that I 
would not die here and with this strange habit on, I have kept the blue 
habit of flannel and scapular I wore when I came I sleep with my Rosary, 
have the same Im. ring on my finger besides, the prayers of the 
community I say my own privately.  Even the good health I enjoy 
notwithstanding my years has been for me a subject of hope -- It is very 
seldom any Sister write to me I used to write sometime to one sometime 
to another and received no answer, and had to be silent even that 
consolation was denied me for Mother Gonzaga said many years ago that 
she dared not give my letters to the Sisters nor write to me herself.  
The good Sr. Ann writes every New Year to Sr. Mary [Whipple] and I, so 
this is the only sympathy I got, that, I don't know whether is the Bp. 
or the Superior who gave the privilege Sr. Mary and I are much pleased 
of it and always expect her letter tho' very short for she does not 
write herself.  Mother Anastasia wrote too some time past I thought she 
would write again after the retreat. -- You must all have been pleased 
to have a Redemptorist. --
<P>
I am glad you expect to have a new mission, I remember Father Whitty he 
is a real gentleman, once I had to go to Phila. I think it was with Sr. 
Ignatia, as it was necessary to stopt [sic] over night Father Hugh 
[Monaghan] sent him word about it, when we got at his house I found on 
his table a very polite note regretting of having been obliged to be 
absent from home but he had charged his housekeeper to take good care of us.
<P>
Sr. Mary is in the same city, but not in the same Convent with me.  She 
is in the boarding school and I am at the Motherhouse we often see one 
another.  Her case is altogether different from mine.  She is a Gray 
[sic] Nun since she made a noviciate [sic] and profession here; this I 
did not I came with my habit and remained as I was could never change.  
In case I would be able to return home there would be no difficulty on 
this side, only the want of means, but feel capable on [sic] begging all 
the way, a thing I never did.  I would not leave without the permission 
of the Bp. here, which I think would be obtained for in [he] knows my 
painful situation having opened my heart to him at his first pastoral 
visit in the convent which takes place every year every Sr. has to go 
speak to his Lordship privately.  There has been three visits and each I 
mention my feelings, all he can do in the matter is to encourage me to 
bear my cross with patience.
<P>
The Sisters here dont understand why my Sisters dont exert themselves 
and make some effort to remove the obstacles.  Tell you dear young 
Sisters to pray hard to our Blessed Mother teller her that I am in her 
Imm. Heart.  Let those who are learning french study well for when I'll 
come I will hear their lessons.
<P>
Please present my most affectionate remembrance to Mother Francis and 
thank her for the picture she sent me, accept my thanks for the nice one 
I received from you.  I trust that the Heart of a Mother will help her 
exiled child.
<P>
The Superior here was pleased with your presents and returns her thanks 
for the same.  As for myself I have no pictures here but those that came 
from my own Sisters of the Im. Heart.  I like the Scapulars much the 
work is so well done making Scapulars and Agnus Deis is one of my 
employments and at this present there is such a press for the brown 
Scap. it [is] by the hundreds I have to made [sic] and everyone are 
[sic] so busy that it is hard to get help.  You can judge by that, why 
my letter is in such confusion, as I wanted to write without delay could 
not wait until I would have time but had to snatch a little moment in 
haste therefore it is all broken and even the wrong page was taken and 
it must be full of mistake.  However I fear not of not bein [sic] 
understood for, by the tone of your letter and the sentiments of 
affection it contained I doubt not of being understood anyhow this 
scrawl will be seen only by my dear children in the I.H. as it is with 
permission of my Confessor I need not show them to the Superior my case 
is an exception my life here has been that of a religious and [I have] 
.. observed the rule of this order as punctually as any member.  As it 
is I would wish you to write as soon as possible after you receive this 
to let me know what foundation you have for [hope] of my return.  I 
think by the little I said the sooner would be the better for many 
reasons that I cannot mention in writing.
<P>
The S. General has many houses to visit so she is often absent and the 
Assistant Sup. who receives letter in her stead when she is absent is so 
considerate that when any letter is addressed to me she gives unopened.  
The Mother is leaving today or tomorrow for perhaps two weeks so by your 
writing soon you need not think anyone but myself will see it write 
freely.  For the directions to be more sure direct as follows:
<P>
<pre>
                   Convent of Gray [sic] Nuns
                          Water Street
                  Ottawa, Province of Ontario
</pre>
<P>
The Superior of the Boarding School has the name of Theresa of Jesus, so 
it has happened that letter to my address has been found in the box at 
her convent and was opened by not taken [sic] tome to read the whole 
direction.  This will not be by mentioning the street as above however 
your letter came direct I must now conclude I trust that you will write 
soon my sincere regards to all have no time to read this.
<P>
As ever truly and affectionately yours<br>
In the Immaculate Heart of Mary<br>
Sr. Mary Theresa<br>
Servant of Cor Immaculatum Mariae<br>
Nunc et Semper
<P>
Had I have time and made the enclosed Agnus Dei purposely to send they 
would be better but they are the best I have now one for Mother Francis 
and one for you.

<h2>Mother Theresa to Sister Mary Rose McNamara</h2>
April 19, 1882
<P>
LAUDENTUT JESUS ET MARIA SEMPER VIRGO!
<P>
Sr. Mary Rose<br>
Very dear Child,
<P>
You may be sure your letter was most pleasing to me, for to hear from my own 
dear Sisters of the Imm. Heart, far from increasing my sorrows, is the 
greatest solace I have in my bereavement, on the contrary the long and dead 
silence kept with me has been very painful.  It would have been otherwise had 
I been so disposed and able, when the strength of circumstance brought me 
here, to give up my own community which I intended never to leave and join 
another, but such was not the case, in spirit and in heart I remained always 
the same as when I left.  At all times I feel as if the Sister-hood of the 
Imm. Heart was on my side my corporal eyes do not see them as does the eye of 
my imagination, but it is so, every one and every event are ever present in 
my memory, you in particular, dear child, I can yet see a little girl, when 
Sr. Aloysia and I arrived at St. Joseph's to prepare the way for the others 
to come running from Fr. O'Reilly's house to the Convent to bring us what we 
need and help us along, your hair flying in the air my memory is as good as 
ever and my heart does not grow old.  When you have the opportunity do tell 
my dear Sr. Agatha that she is often present in my recollections and more 
than once have I shed tears on thinking of our sad meeting at good F. 
O'Reilly's in 1868 when I tried to be again with my own beloved Sisters, but 
all my endeavors was [sic] in vain my life ever since has been a slow and 
long martyrdom, few are the days, if any, on which I have been tearless but 
all before my God, when in the Community and in time of recreation I am as 
lively as the others you know it has to be so and that I am not of a 
melancholy turn of mind.  There is only one thought that kept me up all 
along which is the hope of returning, no matter what was said to me on the 
subject or my efforts to change my feelings was [sic] fruitless.  In the 
inmost recess of my soul I always felt as tho' I would not die here and that 
our Imm. Mother would obtain this grace from her Divine Son.  Could we but 
meet again how may past reminiscences we would have to speak about & which 
it is impossible to trace on paper.  Let us pray and hope, God can remove 
every obstacle should it be His Holy will.  In the meantime make a good use 
of our tribulations.
<P>
***
<P>
Tell Mother Anastasia not to send back the relic of St. Theresa if she does I 
will think that she lost all hopes of seeing me in this life.  My advanced 
age makes wish of going soon.  Tho' having as yet no mortal disease I am 
sometimes subject to weak spells & need something strengthening.  Some sudden 
disease may take me off still my health is remarkably good & often I take 
this a sign that Our Heavenly Father will have me go.
<P>
***
<P>
Have you a Chapel in your house?  Are you near the Church?  Can you go to 
Mass everyday?  Unable to say all I would wish I will [keep] the rest for 
another or when we meet which is the most desirable.  Pray my dear child 
daily for your old Mother rest assured that you are not and never was forgotten.

Before your letter came I felt lonely, seeing nothing but letters going 
& coming.  The Srs. from the near missions come here during Christmas 
time, they are all so joyful on meeting and it makes me sad thinking how 
far I am from mine.  My joy on such occasions is, I think, very much 
like the children of Israel when in captivity at Babylon being in a 
strange country. 
<P>
... In my present feelings, I believe that I would be nearer heaven if I 
was with my own, it may be an illusion but I am not the only one who has 
it.  You yourself think it would be the most desirable happiness for me 
to die in my order with my immaculate habit surrounded by the Srs. of 
Imm. Heart. ... 
<P>
Now, in your last you say that when your good Bishop was asked, he 
replied plainly that he <u>would</u> have nothing to do with the matter; 
until now I thought it was on account of ArchBp. Wood, that should God 
call Him to himself he would be at liberty to receive me, even Sr. Paul 
in her letter said that the Srs. told her the Bp. O'Hara was favorably 
disposed towards me, this meant that he would give the desirable 
permission, but I fear it not so.  Now, about a <a name="coadjutor" 
href="#note1">Coadjutor</a> would he be consulted.  I know from good 
authority that it will not be necessary, for every Bp. is master to do 
what he pleases in his own Diocese.  This was exemplified in this very 
Com. a few weeks ago.  There was a Sister here from another Order who 
after remaining over two years a postulant, was by the exertions of the 
Bp. Duhamel received in her own Order, in another Diocese and by another 
Bp. contrary to the one who had sent her here.  She and I had a great 
sympathy for one another, therefore, I rejoiced much for her happiness.  
Before leaving, she made me promise to be sure to write to her if I 
should obtain my ardent and lawful desire.  She promised to continue 
praying.  I have her direction.  Do you correspond with Father 
Smulders?  I should think so since you get news from Monroe.  I must 
tell you a thought I had that if he should find out that you wish and 
trying to have me return, he would advise you to leave me where I am, 
that I have a good home and how does he know it?  Yes, a good home to do 
penance, however, I think I have enjoyed it long enough now that I am 
old.  I think Fr. Smulders who is our <a name="smulders" 
href="#note2">founder</a> is very indifferent, when I write he does not 
answer.  I may be wrong having those feeling but I tell you in all 
confidence, that you my undeceive me if I am mistaking.  My age ought 
not to be an obstacle in his estimation, since our years are about the 
same and he is still laboring for the glory of God with the assistance 
of my own Srs. 
<P>
I must mention another idea which causes me to fear, should you have a 
mission in another Diocese.  Would not Bp. O' have something to say 
about the choice of members to be sent there and perhaps I would be 
rejected.  Now, my very dear child, I told you all my painful 
apprehensions with all I cannot lose hope therefore please, as soon as 
convenient, let me know what you think.  I dont wish to trouble you 
about writing so often but only a few words to ease my mind on the subject.
<P>
... Do not conclude from what I have said, that I do not value the place 
I am in, for on the contrary, I rather be here than anywhere else, if I 
cannot be at my beloved home.  for the spiritual here is nothing 
wanting.  Everyday I thank God for all the blessings I receive here.  
Nevertheless, my position is a painful one, the inconvenience cannot be 
told in a letter, besides it is not necessary.  Were I not blessed with 
the remarkable good health I have, it would [be] a great deal worse to 
live in so numerous a community.  Sleep in a full dormitory where 
silence is as strict as in the Chapel.  One can breathe and that is 
all.  To clear my throat I cover my head not to make a noise.  To go 
down to my meals, three story in the refectory, etc.  But my strongest 
reason for wishing to go is to die in my order.  I would not send such a 
letter to anyone else.  I trust you will understand it must be this way 
or not write at all, have no corner to go, my desk is in the community 
room, noise and disturbance all the time.
<P>
Sr. Ann sent a letter to Sr. Mary and I as usual for New Years, again 
she mentions the Archp. health and says he is failing rapidly.  Another 
thing she never said before is "I hope and pray you may die in the Order." ...

My dear Child,
<P>
Have the kindness to read the following announcement to your community 
assembled at some convenient time on Sunday, 11th inst. 
<P>
Having written to Our Most Reverend Archbishop for permission to recall 
Mother Teresa, His Grace has, by letter given me full power to act in 
the matter.  I am preparing to effect her return in the most quiet 
manner possible.  The necessity of secrecy for the present will, I am 
sure, appear obvious to every member of the Congregation. 
<P>
We will now substitute for the "Veni Creator" the 90th Psalm, to be said 
at Night Prayer, immediately before the offering of the following day's 
prayers, works, etc. 
<P>
Believe me in Jesus and Mary,<br>
Affectionately,<br>

Sister M. Genevieve<br>
Ever dear Child
<P>
Your kind favor of 4 inst. came duly to hand yesterday and was perused 
with pleasure.  The box of good things was received also, tho' Friday.  
Mother had a little feast last evening.  Many thanks, 
<P>
I am sorry to hear of Mother Francis, suffering so much with 
Rheumatism.  Did she not try the remedy I wrote to her about sometime 
ago, which was learned form an indian and which I think would cure her?  
Anyhow, it would do no harm being simply equal part of sarsaparilla and 
squaw root infused with gin.  Taking a small quantity every day it works 
in the system. 
<P>
Words are inadequate to express my joy and grateful feelings to our dear 
Lord for His great mercies to me in restoring me to my own.  I am so 
happy in being in the Institution, so dear to me and which I had never 
left in heart, indeed, we have been here in jubilation ever since my 
arrival.  I have received the visits of several missionaries, letters 
and presents from many. 
<P>
Notwithstanding my long absence, on arriving, as soon as I had the sight 
of the Sisters with the habit of the I.H. I felt at home.  Mother 
Superior had had such a fine cell prepared for me, that when taken to 
it, I was surprised and felt confused, and since, I am loaded with 
kindness form Mother, and all the Sisters.  Every day she brings me 
something new, I have no chance to practice poverty.  It is a great 
consolation for me to find everything here the same as in the beginning, 
the rules strictly observed.  I am also edified by the fervor of the 
Community. 
<P>
In one of your last letters you said that you had not yet got the 
manual, compiled for the use of the Sisters, Servants of the Imm. Heart, 
indeed, you ought not to be without it in Scranton, it is complete, 
having the prayers prescribed for every exercise in the institution; the 
office of the B.V. and Office for the Dead.  I like it very much, it is 
just the thing we wanted. 
<P>
Now, I know that you and all the Sisters in Scranton had prayed hard for 
me, to obtain my deliverance, do then help me in returning thanks to Our 
Heavenly Father for all His blessings.  We can now expect to see one 
another in this life, in some future time.
<P>
Please thank Sister Agatha for the fine book she sent me and the many 
welcomes she expressed.  O how happy, I will be to see her again! ... 
<P>
I have written and received from Ottawa more than one letter since my 
arrival, one from the Bishop, from Rev. Father Gaudet, etc.  The morning 
I left, after receiving his last blessing, kissing his cross, I said, 
Father are you glad that I am going?  <u>Yes</u>, he said <u>I am glad 
you are going home</u>.  On thinking of the past tribulations I can 
hardly realize the change that has taken place.  How grateful I feel 
towards all those who shared in my afflictions and have been the means, 
by their prayers or otherwise of restoring me to by beloved Community.
<P>
Kind and affectionate regards to dear Mother, and every one in the 
Community, also to my little Genevieve. 
<P>
Truly yours in the SS Hearts of Jesus and Mary Immaculate<br>
Sr. M. Theresa, C.I.M.

Sister M. Genevieve<br>
Ever dear Child
<P>
As a note I had written to you some day last January did not reach you, 
and being anxious for you to be informed of at least a part of its 
contents.  I again make the attempt to write without any scruple, since 
I have received no prohibition in that regard as you have, and for which 
I cannot see the reason why.  Even M. Gonzaga sent letters I had written 
to Scranton.  Still for prudence sake, the Superiors and myself think it 
is better for me not to write only on some particular occasions.  So I 
intend sending this note, if I can find the opportunity, wrapped up in 
such a way that the bearer will not think it is a letter, but only a 
small parcel.  I pray daily for a change in circumstances. 
<P>
Now, for the matter in question, the fine picture of the Holy Face, 
which you left with me, when you were here last November to be sent to 
Rev. F. Gaudet in your name.  This I did when writing him for Christmas, 
and it happened well, having at the time no card to send as I had the 
year previous, and which was one of those fine one I had received from 
M. Francis and yourself the last Christmas I spent in Ottawa, which I 
had kept for that purpose. 
<P>
Well in the Father's letter to me he first thanked for the picture, as 
he always does on receiving the Annual every year, for he feels very 
grateful and is much pleased with the attention.  In his first letter 
after my arrival here, he sent his most hearty thanks to M. Francis and 
to you for all you both done [sic] for my return for which he had been 
as much interested as if it was for himself.  I did tell you about it at 
the time. 
<P>
***
<P>
Being here now, I understand better the state of perplexity existing in 
our Order, and I think that the present situation of things the best for 
us, is remain quiet and pray, pray daily to obtain a more favorable 
prospect in regard to our beloved Institution and the completion of what 
is yet wanting. 
<P>
God alone knows what a great and painful disappointment it is for me of 
not having been after nearly 3 years able to visit Scranton, and see 
there all my dear Sisters.  I who thought that when once here, I would 
be at liberty of choosing my own home, and my heart prompted me for 
Scranton, since it was from there all sympathy and encouragement came to 
me.  To all I say <u>Fiat</u> and still hope in the Almighty power of 
God for a change. 
<P>
***
<P>
As I liked [sic] very much to know if you have received this paper, 
since you cannot write I will suggest one way to let me know, which 
would be, if you should send me by mail a nice card directed to me 
before of after your retreat, that I may have it to send to Fr. Gaudet 
for his feastday the 28 of August, St. Augustin, then I will be sure 
that you received my note.  Besides dear M. Francis told me when here to 
ask if I should want anything.  I would have more to say had I more 
assurance. 
<P>
With sentiments of deep affection for dear Mother Francis and yourself, 
I will conclude, embracing you both with my whole heart. 
<P>
Believe me dear child, in union of prayers,<br>
Truly and gratefully yours,<br>
In the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary Immac.<br>

My Reverend Mother,
<P>
You have without doubt learned through the letter written to Reverend 
Father Gaudet, the death of our poor Mother Teresa and of the fervent 
prayers offered for her by the dear community of Ottawa....  The good 
Mother never forgot the pure and disinterested charity of which she had 
been the object in your community after she left ours.  If the glass of 
water given for the love of God has its reward, what blessings have been 
merited during these 18 years of generous hospitality.  Pardon me, my 
good mother if I have delayed so long to give you details which interest 
you, I am sure.   Our Reverend Mother had asked me to write to you some 
time ago, but I had lost the address. 
<P>
Sunday the 10th of January, Mother Theresa was at Holy Mass, received 
Holy Communion with the Community and took breakfast in the 
refectory....  In the afternoon, she had chills, we put her to bed and 
the doctor was called immediately.  He pronounced the case as 
influenza.  She did not believe that she was sick, for she was not 
suffering; she was only tired.  Wednesday evening, during recreation, 
our Reverend Mother came to spend some time with her.  She was all 
Gaiety, conversing, laughing, and she even sang with us in a voice as 
strong as mine, the verse, "It is the month of Mary."  The night was 
very calm....  But at her age there is always so much danger.  Our 
Mother thought it prudent to have her receive the last Sacraments.  
Thursday morning the doctor, who arrived earlier than usual, warned us 
that the end was near.  She made her act of resignation to God's Will.  
The French aspirations that we made for her made her very happy.  I 
remained at her side until the last moment.  In the afternoon, the 
breathing was more painful.  The oppression increased more and more.  At 
5 o'clock, we began the prayers which she answered in a firm voice.  
Aloud she thanked God for the grace she had received to die in the 
Community of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.  About 8 o'clock, she joined 
us in prayers until the last moment.  She seemed to fall asleep.... but 
it was in order to awaken in Eternity.

she could be regarded as a founder.  In the following letter, Father 
Smulders responds.

I received your kind letter, beautiful pictures and very kind wishes of 
August 29th, with real heartfelt pleasure.  My delay in answering is not 
indifference, for I think of you every day and every Sister Servant of 
the Immaculate Heart of Mary, in Pennsylvania is in my memento at Holy 
Mass every time I say it.  I have long wished to see you all at your 
annual retreat but it seems not the be the Will of God.  His Holy Will be done!
<P>
You wish to know who is the founder of your Congregation?  Father Louis 
Gilet [sic] brought Mother Theresa and Sister Ann from Baltimore to 
Monroe, he wrote a sketch of the Rule, Father Francis Poilvache, a man 
of God inspired them with the true Religious spirit.  Mother Theresa 
received Sister Alphonsine and Sister Celestine and they made their 
profession under her.  When I succeeded Father Gilet in 1847, I took 
charge of them by authority of the Bishop.  I blessed their new house on 
the feast of our Mother Immaculate, and then at the request of Mother 
Theresa and the Community, I announced that henceforward their name was 
"Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary."  The Bishop 
afterwards approved of it.  Mother Theresa asked my consent to give 
the Sisters the blue scapular.  I consented; then to change the black 
habit to sky blue.  I consented and blessed them (the habits).  We 
Redemptorists helped them to perfect the Rule according to our own 
Rules, and Father Poirier, who succeeded me did the same.
<P>
Ergo:  Mother Theresa is the founder with help of the Redemptorist 
Fathers. --I begin my retreat of ten days, tomorrow.  Pray for me.  I 
pray for you. 
<P>
Truly yours, in J. & M.<br>
E. Smulders, C.SS.R.

... we find [Father Gillet] giving the first French Mission in August, 
1843, at St. Paul's Church, Grosse Point, some ten miles from Detroit.  
Joseph Renauld, on whose land the church stood, gave hospitality to 
Father Gillet who, here for the first time, met Mr. Renauld's 
daughters.  The eldest, Theresa, acted as sacristan and at that time 
confided to the Redemptorist her desire to serve God more closely, 
adding that she had heard of religious but had never seen one.  Father 
Gillet taught Theresa the meaning of the Angelus and how to ring it 
three times daily, and promised her that very soon he would return, and 
try to arrange for the realization of her desire.

<img src="../../Graphics/ihmlogo3.gif" alt=""><img

<h2>Letter:  April 13, 1845</h2>
The following is Father Louis Gillet's letter to his Provincial, Very 
Reverend Frederic de Held in Belgium, April 13, 1845, from Monroe.  This 
translation is taken from Mother Marie Alma's book, <cite>Sisters, 
Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</cite>, 1967, pp. 6-7.  
Paragraph separations have been added for the reader's convenience; 
there are none in the translation.  Father Gillet was 32 years old when 
this letter was written.  He was superior of the Monroe foundation and 
in charge of the entire mission operation out of Monroe.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
Very Reverend Father Provincial: 
<P>
It is always with the greatest joy that I receive news from Belgium, and 
above all from your reverence.  I received your last letter in August, on 
my return from the long journey I had made to Baltimore to regulate affairs
 with Father Alexander concerning our new French foundation.  I am glad 
to hear that you approve of my enterprise, and I count on your reverence 
to support it; for it must contribute greatly to the glory of God in a 
country where are found so many abandoned souls, deprived of all the 
aids of religion.
<P>
In selecting the little city of Monroe for our establishment I had in 
view to make it the center of the mission, from whence our fathers can 
go to different parts of the large State of Michigan, and even beyond 
it, to give regular missions and to repeat those already given.  We have 
been more than a year at Monroe.  My companions at present are Father 
Poilvache, two candidate lay brothers, and an Irish student of 
theology.  Our church, which is Gothic, is 100 feet long and 50 feet 
wide, with a tower 100 feet high; but as it is too small to accomodate 
the faithful, we have commenced the work of adding a sanctuary of 
twenty-eight feet.  At the back of the church I have laid the foundation 
of a brick convent, which will be thirty-five feet wide and seventy 
long.  I hope to complete the work this year.
<P>
Our parish at Monroe is composed of French Canadians. Irish and 
Germans.  Besides the parish, properly so called, nine stations, 
constituting part of the parish, are attended by us, seven of which are 
composed entirely of Irish.  Judge by this whether I stand in need of a 
fast horse.  I will soon have served an apprenticeship in the art of 
riding.  Being forced to speak English, I have succeeded pretty well, so 
that I now frequently preach in that language.  Father Poilvache usually 
attends the parish and the French missions.
<P>
As to missions which are called for from all parts, I have been obliged 
to refuse them until the arrival of our fathers.  My furthest station 
from here is about sixty miles.  We therefore carry the Holy Viaticum to 
the sick to the distance of sixty miles from Monroe.  An immense field 
is open in this country to the sons of St. Alphonsus.  The good that 
already has been performed by the grace of God is incalculable; but who 
can measure all that is yet to be done?  How many missions demanded!  
How many French congregations yet deprived of priests, and for how long 
a time!  I desire to be everywhere when I think of so many needs.  
Often, in casting my eyes on Europe, and particularly on Belgium, I 
cannot but be astonished to see among so many priests so few 
who dream of the vast field that lies open here to their zeal.
<P>
The Catholic religion has spread particularly in Monroe; many 
Protestants have already made their abjuration, and I have about a dozen 
more who are under instruction!  Catholics by becoming temperate have at 
the same time become fervent.  To renounce spirituous liquors is the 
chief point; thus I insist upon it, and unceasingly preach temperance 
from a conviction that it is the first step for a Canadian towards 
becoming a good Catholic.  During the past year and a half I have given 
the pledge -- that is to say, received the promise of temperence -- to 
four thousand Canadians, who are divided into seven societies.  That of 
Monroe numbers one thousand two hundred members.  This society is 
established in the manner of a confraternity, have monthly meetings and 
a rule approved by Mgr. Lefevre, Bishop of Detroit.
<P>
Such, Very Rev. Father, in a few words, is the result of our labors.  
God has blessed them, and has made use of weak instruments like 
ourselves to recall so many abandoned souls to the practice of their 
religion.  All bless our Lord for the happy change effected among the 
French.  Even the Protestants are astonished, and more than once they 
have borne witness to the truth in their journals, and acknowledged 
their inability to effect like results.  I alone complain in seeing fall 
upon me the cares of this new foundation, the fatigues of so many 
stations, and, above all, those for the Irish.  I am always sustained by 
the hope that you will not abandon me, and that you will lighten the 
burden that has been laid upon my shoulders in placing me at the head of 
this mission.
<P>
Send me, if you please, a good father to take charge of the mission, and 
above all, some zealous missionaries.  As for health, there is nothing 
to fear; no one was more feeble than myself in this respect, and now, 
with the Canadian fare, frugal as it is, I am able to sustain alone the 
fatigues of an entire mission, preaching two or three times a day.  Why 
have I not here some confreres from Liege?  Have the goodness to thank 
M. K. for me for his goodness in sending me his journal which I receive 
regularly.
<P>
My regards to all my confreres at Liege, etc.
<P>
Father Louis Gillet, C.SS.R.

Reunion</title>

<h2>Reunion . . .</h2>
The following description of Father Gillet's reunion with the IHM 
Congregations is adapted from Sister Maria Alma's (Immaculata) <cite>The 
Reverend Louis Florent Gillet:  His Life, Letters and Conferences</cite>, 
1940, Philadelphia:  The Dolphin Press.
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif" 
alt="____________________________________________________________________">
<P>
A special blessing was reserved for Pere Marie Celestin in his declining 
years.  His whereabouts were sought for many years.  It was known that 
he had entered a Cistercian community, but there all traces ended.
<P>
To the motherhouse in Reading came in 1868 (20 September) one who had 
long been familiar with religious life.  At her reception in December of 
the same year she took the name, Sister M. Clotilde.  Few besides Mother 
Gonzaga, who received the postulant of thirty-eight years of age, 
dreamed of the interest attaching to her earlier life.  She had been for 
almost twenty years a Visitandine, in Moselle, France, and for one term, 
at least, Mother Superior ...
<P>
In this same Visitation Convent lived her friend in Christ, Sister Marie 
Stephanie, who later sought the monastic life of Citeaux, and who with 
many of her Sisters [after the dissolution of their community] joined 
the community of Cisterciennes of Notre Dame de Pres d'Hautecome, at 
Reillanne in Southern France.  The Cistercian Fathers of Hautecombe 
served as chaplains to the community at Reillanne, and thus Father 
Gillet, who spent the last twenty-eight years of his life at Hautecombe, 
met and knew well Sister Marie Stephanie, who was for several terms the 
Prioress of Notre Dame de Pres.
<P>
To these same Cisterciennes had come, in 1867... Sister Marie Celestine, 
Father Gillet's sister Catherine, who for twenty-eight years (1839 - 
1867) had been a Sister of Charity of Ghent in Belgium, but who, 
following the example of her brother, sought the contemplative life.  It 
was Mother Marie Celestine who welcomed the Visitandines to Reillanne.
<P>
Sister Clotilde has left some very interesting correspondence between 
herself and Sister Marie Stephanie, covering a period of forty-two 
years, (1866 - 1908) from which may be gleaned precious scraps of 
information regarding the long-sought Founder, who was a chaplain at 
Notre Dame de Pres and life-long friend to the Cisterciennes.  To the 
Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, however, these held 
no connotation:  to Sister Marie Stephanie he was Pere Marie Celestine, 
the Cistercian; to his American children, he was known as Father Louis 
Florent Gillet; neither dreamed that the two were the same person.
<P>
Then in 1888 a chance word in the correspondence lead to the suspicion 
that this much-loved Cistercian was in some way connected with the 
long-sought Founder;  Sister Marie Stephanie chanced to write:
<P>
<blockquote>
     I ought to write very soon to the good Reverend Father 
     Superior at Hautecombe, and I shall not forget your 
     commission for Father Gillet.  It is almost ten years 
     since he was elected Prior.
</blockquote>
<P>
Sister M. Clotilde at once began inquiries through her nephew, Father 
Cesaire, a Cistercian, stationed at the motherhouse in Lerins.
<P>
The Sisters in Michigan, in commemoration of the forty-fifth anniversary 
of their foundation, published in the Michigan Catholic  of 25 December 
1890, a short account of the community, with sketches of the first log 
convent and of Father Gillet.  Mother de Chantal secured one of these 
for Sister Clotilde, who immediately forwarded it to Father Cesaire, at 
Lerins.  The letter was transmitted to Hautecombe, and to Father Marie 
Celestin.  Very soon -- one can surmise with what emotion -- the Father 
and his "daughters" were <a name="letter1" 
href="letter1.html">reunited</a>!  The tiny seed planted in 1845 in 
the unpromising soil of pioneer Michigan had become a great tree whose 
branches spread over three separate sections of our country, sheltering 
within their shadows thousands whose lives were touched by the Sisters, 
Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
<P>
Sister Marie Stephanie's letters make very frequent references to Father 
Gillet, telling of the joy he experienced in finding again his "spiritual 
daughters of the new world," a joy shared not only by his good Father 
Abbot, but also by all the Cistercians at Hautecombe...
<P>
The Sisters, in their joy at the long expected but nevertheless 
surprising answer to their years of persevering prayer, invited the 
founder to visit them.  To this the increasing infirmities of advancing 
years proved an insurmountable obstacle, for he was now seventy-eight 
years of age.  He sent, however, in a letter dated 4 May 1891, a detailed 
and authentic account of the <a name="letter2" href="letter2.html">origin 
of the community</a> ... 
<P>
But the years were taking their toll on the life of the founder; his 
infirmities increased until each day became an oblation of prayer and 
suffering.  Writing of these last days, his Prior, Father Marie 
Symphorien, says:
<P>
<blockquote>
     He seldom left his cell; he occupied his days with prayer, 
     saying the divine office regularly, and directing from this holy 
     solitude his beloved retreatants.  On All Saint's Day (1892) he 
     received the Last Sacraments in the presence of the 
     assembled community.  Responding with feeble voice to the 
     exhortations of the Prior, he spoke touchingly, as only his 
     noble heart could, of his love for the Christ of the Holy 
     Eucharist, his remembrance of the needs of those who 
     surrounded them, with the promise to pray for each in heaven,
     his regret for the faults of his entire life ...
<P>
     For a short space it seemed that the grace of Extreme Unction 
     had given the dear Father a new lease on life; he even, with 
     great effort went to his work table to pen some <a name="letter3" 
     href="letter3.html">last words of adieu</a> to his daughters in 
     America.  But scarcely was he able to write six short lines, almost 
     illegible, when he laid down the pen forever.
</blockquote>
<P>
On the night of 13-14 November, 1892, his agony began.  After touching 
prayers and the recommendation of his soul to God he pressed the Prior's 
hand to signify that he still understood; then the Reverend Father 
bestowed upon Father Gillet the last absolution and the Apostolic 
Benediciton.  "Very soon the soul of God's Priest passed sweetly to 
Heaven on the wings of prayer, the Holy and adorable Name of Jesus."  It 
was one o'clock in the morning of Monday, 14 November 1892.

<P> So you clicked on me, Nicky T.  Well, this isn't a personal page or
anything like that, so if you want to know more about me, your going to have to
be a bit more resourceful.  Nice try though.  This page is my own personal

Next Monday, April 8th 1996, local band Dick Fawcett will be live in the studio
with me, Nicky T. Starting at 10pm, Scranton's premier all-original band will
be in the studio playing songs that they wrote, as well as a Q & A with me. 
Think of it as a live concert for free!  It should be a very entertaining
evening, so be sure to tune in.  That's Monday April 8th, 1996.  <Br>

<P>Well, that's it for this month.  Listen to VMFM or I'll come to your house
and kill you!!!  Ok, well maybe I'll just feel insulted.<Br>

<B>Guitar Shop</B><BR> 
Join Charlie Russello, a graduate of Musician's Institute and the Guitar
Institute of Technology, every week as he teaches not only the flash and 
style of playing guitar, but also the theory behind the music. As a member of
the northeast Pennsylvania group Totally Lost Cause, Charlie is in the process
of recording his third album, and he has also written his own teaching manual, 
 "The Expressive Guitarist", which he uses to teach from during "Guitar Shop".
In addition to the show, Charlie also gives private lessons and instructions in
both guitar and bass. To order a copy of his book, "The Expressive Guitarist",
call Charlie at (717) 963-1676, or write "The Expressive Guitarist, P.O. Box 4,
Scranton, Pa. 18509".  "Guitar Shop" may have started out as a five minute 
student project, but today it is TVM-37's most popular and talked about show.

<P>You mean you haven't heard???  VMFM is on in the morning now.  That's right,
every weekday morning between 7am and noon, you can hear WVMW-FM on the air
bringing you your morning dose of the usual chaos.  You also get news, sports,
and weather interspersed between it all, so that you can get to where you're going
without a hitch.  In the house, in the car, and in the workplace, let VMFM be
your companion.  Check out our <A href="schedule.html">schedule</A> to see
who's on at what time.  Maybe your favorite DJ has gone mad in the morning.

<h3>Father Joos to Bishop Neumann</h3>
This letter was particularly difficult to record because of a 
combination of Father Joos' cramped and sometimes illegible penmanship 
and his grammatical eccentricities.  Some sections are rather incomprehensible.
<P>
Right Rev. Bishop,
<P>
The kind letter Rev. Mother Joseph had the favor of receiving from Your 
Lordship is the only one that has given anything else but sorrow and 
trouble since the sad event of last April, that has so much disturbed 
the Dear Community of which I am the unworthy Director.  The joy I felt 
in reading it has been equal only to the gratitude that I owe your 
Lordship, for helping, so much by it, to bring to an end all those 
troubles which I consider as the most powerful weapon of the enemy of 
all good to destroy the religious spirit of the good Sisters.
<P>
Thus your letter, RR Bishop, makes me trust that you will excuse the 
liberty with which I come to give you a simple and exact account of what 
happened -- to do so I felt myself bound in conscience since several 
weeks, but did not do it because my most Dear Bishop, whose heart has 
been so much grieved, intended to write Himself.  I doing so, may be 
wrong, or imprudent, or fail in some way; but if so, I hope Your 
Lordship will excuse me anyhow and still believe that I do not write but 
through pure zeal for the good of my Community and to defend our Dear 
Bishop, who has been really ill-treated in the whole affair. 
<P>
Since the RR Bishop appointed me Director of the whole Community, on the 
9th of Nov 1857, I have been indeed very well satisfied of the religious 
spirit of all the subjects in general:  -- but one thing was destroying 
all the good; the R Rev Bishop, although not possessing the proofs that 
He has now, knew well enough that Mother Theresa, seconded by Rev. 
Smulders, worked since long to remove the Institute from this diocese, 
and, therefore, He deemed in necessary to forbid any correspondence 
between them.  Notwithstanding this most strict prohibition, 
correspondence continued to be kept up through other Fathers, who went 
so far as to make, by letter and words, postulants believe (contrary to 
all the Rules) that the Rev. Father, whom I still reverence, was 
the very director of the Congregaton:  this alone justifies the Bishop's 
act; still it was told as a tyranny and an oppression.  Your Lordship 
knows what precautions have been taken as far as the foundation of St. 
Joseph's, and the conditions, under which the Bishop, as first Superior 
of the Congregation consented to establishing the Sisters in other dioceses.
<P>
In the meantime things were arranged for commencing in Reading, and the 
first word the R. Rev. Bishop and the Director knew about it was the 
letter of Your Lordship of last March; that new foundation being 
proposed as involving the removal of the whole Institute from this 
diocese.  I could not by declare that I had no right to decide the 
matter, and the Bishop, to whom the question was referred, refused so 
much the more because He was commencing a house in Detroit (that is now 
entirely furnished). 
<P>
By this decision many plans were deranged, and then the Mother commenced 
to declare if the Bishop was not willing to give His consent, that He 
should have been compelled, sooner or later, (although He had never 
formally been asked to let them go).  Shortly after she received a 
letter from one of the Sisters of Susquehanna that her presence there 
was absolutley necessary because of a too great familiarity between the 
Superioress with one of the priests and asked me that I should intercede 
for her to obtain leave to start immediately, and so I did, observing 
still that everything that could be done by Sister Josepha [sic] (as her 
assistant) who intended to go to St. Joseph's for her health. 
<P>
On receipt of the Bishop's negative answer the tempest broke out:  
Mother gave her demission declared that she would not submit to such 
oppression and tyranny, and that all the Sisters woudl enforce [sic] the 
Bishop, at least on the 8th of December for, she said, then we shall do 
what our vows prevented us from doing now.  In such circumstances what 
was to be done?  The good Bishop, for fear of further revolt and public 
scandal removed Mother Theresa and called Sister Magdalen to smother all 
at once what commenced in St. Joseph's, proposing at the same dtime to 
write to Your Lordship.  His order being laughed at, and writing to you 
had been put off, I suppose, by too much business.  Then commenced the 
great and deplorable work of making all the Sisters leave Monroe; 
letters after letters arrived preaching zeal and fervor to force the 
Bishop, and to leave, at least on the 8th of December, if the Bishop 
would not grant dispensation.  Such was the theme debated in every way 
in the letters of Mother Theresa and several Sisters old and young, and 
even of Novices.  This all was no malice; the good Sisters thought, I 
wish to believe, they were right, and, after all, this was but the least 
part of the debate; the work was carried on at every side; a Redemptorist 
Father wrote to Mother Joseph that she had to understand the importance 
of her position, and to leave, the sooner the better, without any regard 
to the Bishop; -- another having been six months ago the Confessor of 
one of the Novices during 4 months, let her know that it is Your 
<u>Lordship's wish</a>, and <u>his command</u> that she should leave the 
same day (the money 100$) being sent for that purpose to a layman -- a 
third one sent letters in the same sense to a layman to hand them to a 
professed sister and a novice -- Finally altogether thay invoked 
theology and Canonical laws and especially Your Lordship's authority to 
prove that Mother Joseph had now lawful authority and ... the Superior 
of Vienna is not _____ under obedience and this here is made known that 
she will very soon receive the changes and the additions made to the 
Rule by Your Lordship, etc.  They do not even reflect that if the Rt. 
Rev. Bishop had no right to _____ the Superioress in an ordinary case he 
had it surely in such an urgent case according tothe Spirit of the H. 
Role.  They do not think that all Mother Th's authority since the 8th of 
Dec. emanated from the same source -- that she has still always been 
recognized as lawful Superioress -- that she has given her demission on the 
30th of March -- that she has been dismissed by the Bishop on the next 
day and that she herself has plainly acknowledged her fault. 
<P>
I should have liked, Rt. Rev. Bishop, to enter more in details byt I 
fear I am already to [sic] long.  One thing more I wish to add, that I 
do no write to accuse either the Rev. Smulders or the Sisters or any of 
them but to give You only a more or less clear view of this side of the 
question.  I love this institute very tenderly, I excuse very readily 
what has been done wrong and am ready to make yet all exertions to 
restore good harmony between all the good Sisters.  For the rest I write 
confidentially to your Lordship, stating if anything perhaps might 
better be left our for charity's sake, no one word still but truth has 
been written and that only of which evident proof exists.

<h2>Bishop Lefevere to Bishop Wood</h2>
[In July of 1859, Bishop James F. Wood, coadjutor of the diocese of 
Philadelphia, wrote to Bishop Lefevere seeking information about the 
IHMs.  The following letter is Bishop Lefevere's response.  It] includes 
a lengthy account of his perspective about Mother Theresa.  It ought to 
be noted that none of his allegations about Mother Theresa are 
substantiated by other sources.  Indeed, Sr. Rosalita, in <cite>No 
Greater Service</cite>, the definitive history of the congregation's 
early days, appends the following note to her transcription of the letter:
<pre>
		"This letter will bear serious criticism before it 
		can be used as history.  Glaring mistakes, either
		intentional or unintentional, were written into 
		this document.  We have documentary proof in our 
		own archives to set forth as evidence."
</pre>
The letter's significance ... is not so much what Bishop Lefevere says 
about Mother Theresa, but what we can infer about the Bishop himself 
from this writing. 
<P>
<img src="../../Lines/sb10-1.gif"

<P>
Tt Rev. J.F. Wood
Bishop Coadj. Philada.
Rt. Rev. & Dear Brother in X.
<P>
I had well suspected, as I now see by your letter of the 28th inst. that 
you have all the time been kept in the dark about the mean, unmanly & 
shameful proceedings, in relation to the Convent of the I.H.M. in 
Monroe.  For this reason I have taken the trouble of writing our and 
sending you the above and foregoing copies of the letters of F.F. Jacob, 
Smulders & Gieson which were sent to me by the Rev. Supr. of said 
Convent.  These letters will at once show you that they were instigated 
& written by a very bad spirit, too bad and mean for a priest or 
religious, neither will you fail to discover in them a refined & deep 
rooted rascality unworthy not only of the priest & religious, but even 
of the man possessed of any decency or honor.  And the worst feature in 
all these proceedings is that having discovered that the Bishop of 
Philadelphia is, by these letters, implicated in this dirty affair, I 
had directed Mr. Joos Supr. of said Convent in Monroe, to draw off 
copies of said letters to send them to said Bishop with the request to 
inform him whether in reality these letters had been written by his 
suggestion, consent or assent.  But up to this time he had not even 
deigned to send an answer.  Neither has said Bishop or Dr. O'Reilly ever 
written to me.  Now, as I wrote a few days ago to the Provincial of the 
Redemptorists (sending him copies of the above letters) if these things 
must remain in statu quo, or go on the way they have commenced, I am 
determined to have these letters printed together with a full statement 
of the whole affair, & such comments as I shall deem proper or 
necessary, & send copies of the same not only to the Cardinal Prefect, 
of the Prop. Fide in Rome, but also to each Archbishop & Bishop in the 
U.S. & to all Pastors of souls, in order that they may be put upon their 
guard against such wolves in sheep's clothing. 
<P>
The said Convent in Monroe was commenced about the year <a name="first" 
href="#1">1844</a> by Rev. Father Gillet, C.S.S.R. who was the first 
Supr. of the house of Redemptorists in Monroe.  This Fr. Gillet, before 
coming to Michigan, having attended for some time the Convent of the 
Oblate Sisters of Providence, a Community of colored women in Baltimore, 
& knowing that this same Mother Teresa so often mentioned in the above 
letters, & a Sister Ann both Oblate Sisters who are now either in 
Reading or Susquehanna, were much discontented & about to leave the 
Convent, because perhaps they had more pretensions & thereby raised 
jealousy, as they were much whiter than any other of the Sisters, Fr. 
Gillet thought he could avail himself of their services to commence a 
Convent in Monroe.  So he wrote to the Supr. of that Convent in Balte. & 
had all matters arranged <a name="second" href="#2">to the great 
satisfaction</a> of the whole Community.  Things went on in Monroe, very 
slowly but quietly, until it became known that Fr. Gillet showed <a 
name="third" href="#3">too much attachment</a> to the Mother Theresa.  
There when, at last for this and other reasons, the Provincial dismissed 
him from the Order & his place was supplied by Father Smulders, who 
drove things at a more rapid rate.  But in the course of time as there 
was some rumor afloat among the people about Fr. Smulders & the Convent, 
he in his turn was by the Provincial discharged from the office of Supr. 
& Fr. Poirier put in his place. 
<P>
Now, things went on apparently better & better until in 1854 the 
Redemptorists of their own accord, discontinued & abandoned their house 
in Monroe.  From that time up to the present this Fr. Smulders together 
with some other Redemptorists have not ceased to keep up a 
correspondence either directly or indirectly with Mother Theresa.  But 
when I perceived that this correspondence began to make her very 
restless & dissatisfied continually pining after the FF. Redemptorists, 
I then strictly forbid her all correspondence with the Fathers who had 
been in Monroe.  This prohibition, however, was of little avail.  For 
Fr. Smulders continued his correspondence by writing to other Sisters & 
causing other Fathers to write.  The effect of all this was that nearly the 
whole Community became more or less dissatisfied.  The ultimate object 
was the removal of all the Sisters to the Diocese of Phila.  To this 
end, they got Fr. O'Reilly to write to Mother Teresa, to allow some 
Sisters to take charge of a school at St. Joseph's in Susquehanna Co., 
offering the greatest inducements for this.  When this letter was 
communicated to me I readily consented to the establishing of a house of 
the Order at St. Joseph's with these express conditions:  1st that this 
should be done with the full consent & approbation of the Bishop of 
Philadelphia, 2nd that the Community at St. Joseph's should always be 
dependent upon the Mother house in Monroe, & 3rd that each Sister should 
receive a certain yearly salary.  I then also directed that Sr. M. 
Magdalene should be sent as Local Supr. of that new establishment.  My 
particular reason for sending that Sister was, not only her competence, 
but because I had learned that, a short time before she became a novice, 
a young gentleman from Detroit, had sent her, at his own expense to 
school in Monroe, with a view to marry hereafter she had received some 
education, & continued to show some hankering after her.  So then four 
Sisters started in company with Mother Teresa who was to install them & 
make all the required necessary arrangements with the Bishop and Fr. 
O'Reilly.  After a very long absence, Mother Teresa at last returned & 
told me that the cause of her staying so long was that the Bishop was on 
the Mission & could not come to St. Joseph's then, but when he did come, 
then Fr. O'Reilly was absent, & thus no arrangements could be made but 
that the Bishop would soon write to me (which he never did).  Thus 
things went for a considerable time, whilst I was daily expecting that 
letter from the Bishop.  But at last to my utter astonishment, Mother 
Teresa made suddenly her appearance one day in Detroit, having traveled 
40 miles from Monroe to see me & showed me a letter from Bishop Neumann 
writing to her that the house in Reading had been purchased, would soon 
be ready, & requested the Sisters to come on.  To all my various 
questions she answered that it was the Will of God, that no good was to 
be done in Michigan, & that all things had been arranged to remove the 
Community of Monroe to the Diocese of Phila.  I then positively told her 
to return quietly to Monroe, that no such thing could be done, & that no 
other house in the Diocese of Philadelphia could be accepted.  Not 
disconcerted at this, Mother Teresa some time after, went to see Rev. 
Mr. Joos the Director of the Convent, informing him that she had just 
received a letter from Sister Aloysia in St. Joseph's saying that Sister 
Magdalene was much too familiar with one of the priests in the College & 
that she really feared there would soon be great scandal ensuing.  
Mother Teresa then wanted to start immediately for St. Joseph's.  But 
when the Director told her that she could not do that, before he had 
written to the Bishop of Detroit, she broke out in a most violent 
passion, & said that she had no confidence any more, neither in him (The 
Director) nor the Bishop, nor Mr. Hennaert (the Extraordinary 
confessor).  When I was informed of that I went to Monroe & seeing 
Mother Teresa had already caused great general dissatisfaction in the 
Community, was bent upon destroying its peace & creating a schism, I 
thought at first to expel her at once from the Order, but fearing some 
greater scandal, I discharged her from the office of Supr. General, & 
sent her in company with two other Sisters to Susquehanna, there to be 
local Supr. in place of Sister Magdalene whom, on account of her 
perilous situation I recalled to Monroe together with two other 
Sisters.  But Father O'Reilly seconding the shameful & rascally part of 
the Redemptorists, retained all the Sisters & thus completed the 
schism.  Since this time letters were continually written <u>to</u> and 
<u>from</u> which have completely turned the heads of some Sisters in 
Monroe, two of whom, viz.: Sister Mary & Sister Rose, I was obliged to 
expel for their disobedience & spirit of revolt, even a few days ago, 
Sister Egidius, the favorite & beloved Sister of Fr. Smulders, abruptly 
left the Convent, of her own accord.  Still these three Sisters, (as Fr. 
Smulders had promised) were <u>warmly received & with open arms</u>.
<P>
 Such, Monseigneur, are the outlines of the information which, for the 
present, I can give you on the subject.  These proceedings look 
certainly mean & shameful enough in the eyes of the world, but in the 
eyes of God, they cannot be but very criminal.  But how the Bishop of 
Philada. [sic] can possibly take part in, or countenance such things in 
his Diocese, is more than I can conceive.  This same Mother Teresa has 
already occasioned the ruin of one Fr. Redemptorist, & nearly the fall 
of another one:  & now let him see for the future the consequences of 
all these shameful proceedings.  If you take the pains to go & see that 
Mother Teresa & Sister Ann, & converse with them a little, you will soon 
discover in them, notwithstanding their advanced age, all the 
softness, slyness & low cunning of the mulatto & surely the colored 
Sisters in Baltimore will rejoice at hearing that one of their body is 
at the head of such an establishment as that in Reading. 
<P>
Please accept, Monseigneur, the expressions of the high regard & esteem 
with which I have the honor to remain

</pre>
Venerable Mother Superior<br>
Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary<br>
Elm Avenue<br>
Monroe, Michigan<br>
Venerable and dear Mother Superior:
<P>
I am engaged in compiling the history of the Oblate Sisters of 
Providence.  In studying the affairs of the order I find here a 
connections between the Oblates and the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart 
of Mary.  I am enclosing some of the data which I have in my possession 
which leads me to make this statement. 
<P>
Your own work "The Sisters of the IHM" does not make clear this 
connection.  Under the date of Jan. 17, 1914, Mother M. Mechtildis 
through her secretary, wrote to the Superior of the Oblates, seeking 
information concerning Ann Constance, Ann Schaef or Schaefer and Theresa 
Maxis.  She mentions "they came to Monroe in 1845" and asks "were they 
postulants or novices of your congregation?"  These names appearing in 
your book noted above and also the annals of the Oblates, together with 
the names of Frs. Gilet, Zackert, and others, seem to confirm the 
statement contained in the account which I enclose. 
<P>
Will you help me to settle this point?  In justice to the Oblate Sisters 
it is necessary to show why one of the founders withdrew.  Is Sister 
Theresa and Ann Constance, former Oblates of Providence, founded your 
wonderful Order then the Oblates should share in the glory.  From the 
historical standpoint what has been stated is either true or not true.  
The data in the archives of the Oblates leads [sic] us to believe it is 
true.  This point should be settled only on evidence of a most 
trustworthy nature.  Dr. Guilday, who has a deep interest in you Order, 
advised me to secure what information I could from you so that the 
matter might be truthfully and justly presented.  You may be sure that I 
shall submit that portion of my manuscript which concerns the IHMs to 
you before publication.  May I depend on you for an early reply? 
<P>
Sincerely yours in Christ<br>
Hugh J. Duffy, SSJ

Rev. Hugh J. Duffy, S.S.J.<br>
Epiphany Apostolic College<br>
Mewburg, NNY
<P>
Rev. Dear Father:
<P>
In response to your kind letter permit me to say that it is evident that 
Mother M. Mechtildis did not receive a reply to the inquiry she made in 
January 1914 since there is no letter on file regarding the subject.  We 
have reason to believe that our sister Theresa was not the same as 
Sister Maria Theresa (Almaide) Duchemin as all our records give "Maxis" 
as the family name of the former. 
<P>
We regard the Reverend Louis Florent Gillet as the founder of our 
Community He wrote the first Rule which was based on that of St. 
Alphonsus and approved by Right Rev. Bishop Lefevere.  In justice we 
must state that we owe the support and progress of the order, during the 
first ten years of its existence to the Redemptorists.  They changed 
both the name and the holy habit. 
<P>
Some years ago probably at the time of M. Mechtilde's letter, a 
Sulpician who was writing an account of the Oblate Sisters requested 
information.  We asked him to please not refer to the Immaculate Heart 
Sisters in his article.  Our Eastern Sisters are most anxious that no 
reference ever be made to this connection since the bitter attack made 
by a certain Fr. Slattery possibly familiar to you, we are convinced 
that silence is the fairest, wisest and most agreeable way of committing 
to oblivion this subject.
<P>
Very sincerely yours,<br>
Mother M. Domitilla<br>
Servant of Mary

Le 9 Fevrier, 1891
J.M.J.B.				Abbaye Royale de N.D. d'Hautecombe
						Ordre de Citeaux (Savoie)
</pre>
<P>
Very Reverend Mother,
<P>
A most mysterious letter reached me a few days ago; it was accompanied 
by a paper (The Michigan Catholic) and a prospectus of Villa Maria 
Boarding School.  The packet was directed by a person who signed herself 
Sr. M. C. from the Convent of Villa Maria, religious of the Immaculate 
Heart of Mary, to her nephew, with the request that he forward it to 
me.  This gentleman who is unknown to me (unless it is our Father 
Cesaire) has sent all to me through the kindness of our Father Abbot of 
Lerins, and it was thus that I received the letter that you directed to 
your nephew, the Michigan paper, etc.  The whole packet was a mystery to 
me, as I received it without explanation, without direction, without a 
word from Father Cesaire.
<P>
After a serious reading of the letter, I began to understand!  And it is 
that charitable kindness of yours that brings me to break the silence of 
fifty years!  In truth that is a very long time!  But the thousand 
vicissitudes of my career, my profound distaste for things of the world, 
my entrance into the Order of Citeaux in 1858, where I have since led 
the contemplative life; all these motives have contributed to break up 
for me all intercourse with the world.  Our manner of life being one of 
continual silence, with the exception of one half-hour recreation on 
Sundays, you will understand that, knowing nothing, one finds nothing to 
say.  Having lived all these years in the beautiful solitude of 
Hautecombe, I little thought that, far away across the ocean, there was 
still some remembrance of me, and that from a legion of Mary's Children, 
sprung from Monroe, the cradle of your Congregation which is today so 
flourishing, should come at the end of my days, the consoling message 
that the little grain which I planted long ago, has produced a great 
tree under whose shadow numberless souls have been sheltered, have been 
saved!
<P>
May God be praised for the deep consolation this news has brought me!  
It is to your charity, [Very Reverend Mother], that I owe it all; 
receive here the expression of my gratitude.  For all that you tell me 
recalls to my mind memories which the long years past could never 
efface!  I have read with care the paper with its good picture of 
myself.  What is said there of the beginnings of your Congregation is 
correct.  Miss Renauld is, I think, Sister St. Celestine.  After her 
came Mother Theresa with Sister Anne.  Then the [cousin] of the Mayor of 
Monroe, the first after them to take the habit publicly in the church of 
Monroe, was a young widow.  I have forgotten her name [Josette 
Godfroy-Smyth, later Mother M. Alphonsine].  The paper does not speak of her 
... has she not persevered?
<P>
Mother Theresa could tell you the story of the veil and our going to 
Toledo for the purpose of obtaining a pattern of the habit.  How great 
was their Poverty!  Even before taking the vow, they were forced to 
practice it, and to add to their miseries, not one of them knew how to 
cook!  They were afraid at night, and many a time I told them that they 
were more trouble to me than my congregation and all my missions (and I 
had ten of these).  Then they would weep!
<P>
You tell me that Mother Theresa is still living?  She was so frail, so 
delicate!  I thought she had long ago gone to Heaven.  I cannot believe 
that she is so old!  Eighty-one years!  I thought she was much younger 
than myself, and I am now in my seventy-eighth year.  Except for trouble 
in walking, I am well, with a little care.  I still go around the house 
with the aid of a cane, and I am able to assist at Divine Office in the 
choir during the day ...
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, having gone to see my mother at Louvain, I met a 
Father of the American College, who had succeeded me at Monroe [Reverend 
Edward Joos].  I asked him what had become of the newly established 
community.  To my great astonishment, he told me that it had prospered 
and spread far away.  Thinking that the new religious were all 
Americans, and did not know me, I remained in silence ...
<P>
The work of God has prospered in a marvelous manner ... I needed your 
affirmation and that of the paper to make me believe it ... Be [my] 
interpreter with the dear Sisters, members of the community of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary.  I would be glad to express to each one my 
sentiments of paternal affection, but their number is too large for my 
poor voice to reach each one:  it is to the Immaculate Heart of Mary 
that I confide them, it is to that sweet Heart that I shall tell my 
wishes for their spiritual and temporal happiness.  In the past, God has 
blessed you most generously; your existence in the Church is His work; 
your remarkable expansion, a striking miracle and your life a lasting 
Apostleship!
<P>
How many souls you have already saved!  Everything is extraordinary!  
Everything proclaims God's work!  His Power!  Who would, considering all 
that, dare to glorify himself with the title Founder of a work in which 
his own nothingness is so visible, and for which God seems to have taken 
pleasure in choosing such poor instruments on both sides! ... a young 
man without experience, without means, and some poor creatures, 
strangers in the district.
<P>
However, I love to claim that title by which I am remembered among souls 
dearly beloved by Mary!  May they think of me in their prayers!  They 
will never see me in this life; but united by the ties of charity, in 
the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, I have the hope that we shall know 
one another in Heaven!
<P>
It is in these sentiments and with this hope that I beg you, Very 
Reverend Mother, to accept the assurance of my profound respect
<P>

<h2>Historical Account</h2>
<h3>Written by Father Gillet and enclosed in his letter of 4 May, 1891.</h3>
<P>
Account of the origin of the Congregation of the Sisters, Servants of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary, founded in Monroe, State of Michigan in 1845, 
Bishop Lefevre being Bishop of the Diocese, under the original name of 
Sisters of Providence.
<P>
Very Reverend Mother Superior and dear Sisters in our Lord,
<P>
It is in answer to your legitimate request that I take the pleasure of 
sending you this account of the origin of your Congregation.  Difficult 
as it is to write at my advanced age, I do it nevertheless, all the more 
willingly because in invoking memories already very old, I am carried 
back to those happy years of my early priesthood, years of zeal and fervor.
<P>
These pages will tell you better than anyone could, the Divine action of 
your Congregation, so small in its beginnings; and in return all that 
God expects of a work which is His and destined to exercise a glorious 
apostolate among youth, as past experience has shown ...
<P>
I am not ignorant of the fact, Reverend Mother and dear Sisters, that 
the ordinary conduct of Providence is to choose the weakest to effect 
great things, in order so much the better to display His power, and in 
order that man may not attribute success either to his skill or to his 
resources.  I know also that the great works of God, such as the 
foundation of those religious orders which for centuries have been the 
ornament of the Church, have all had weak beginnings and have taken 
birth in obscurity, but on the other hand, their founders were men 
filled with the spirit of God, already Saints, although still on earth.  
I may say as much for the Congregations of persons of your sex, founded 
often by simple souls, deprived of all human advantages, but again,
 they were chosen souls, distinguished only for their humility, drawing 
after them by the power and inspiration of their virtues a multitude of 
souls desirous of putting themselves under their direction.
<P>
In all this, Reverend Mother and Sisters, let me tell you, and let these 
words remain inscribed in the annals of your Congregation; yes, in all 
this, you are an exception.  You must indeed recognize it.  Your origins 
are not illustrious, your titles to nobility are poverty and obscurity; 
it is of these elements that God has formed the great Congregation of 
the Children of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
<P>
In fact, you founder, if it pleases you to give him this name, who was 
he?  A young priest, full of zeal, it is true, but perhaps indiscreet 
zeal, without experience in the ways of God, without resources.  And 
your first Sisters?  Four poor creatures, unknown to the world and 
hiding under the religious habit their humble origin.  However, in spite 
of elements so weak, that which is your glory is to have risen by a 
continual correspondence to grace and your perseverance in the midst of 
difficulties, I shall say, daily sacrifices, to this height where you 
are today, and which has made of your Congregation one of the most 
beautiful ornaments of the Church in the United States.  Glory to God!  
Glory to Mary!  Honor to you all, privileged children of the Queen of 
Heaven! ...
<P>
I had been in Monroe but a few years following a very successful Mission 
which had revived the faith of the Canadians, and my plan was to make 
this our first French house, all the others being German.  The 
approbation of the Superiors being obtained, as well as that of the 
Right Reverend Bishop, two other Fathers were sent to me.  In addition I 
received two lay brothers in quality of novices.  We were five (fathers 
and brothers) living in two small houses.  It was not long before I 
realized that these dwellings were quite insufficient and that at any 
price, I had to think of building.  A serious obstacle presented 
itself.  The Church at Monroe and its appurtenances were the property of 
the congregation administered by trustees.  Before undertaking anything, 
I called a meeting of the congregation as well as of the trustees.  
After having explained to them my plan to establish ourselves 
permanently in their midst and to build, I asked the congregation for 
the renunciation of all properties in my favor, and the abandonment of 
all their rights.  This was granted to me unanimously, and the deed was 
drawn up and registered with the government.
<P>
A first step was taken, but in order to build, money was necessary -- a 
great deal, and I had nothing.  It was impossible to get anything from 
Baltimore, from the Bishop or from the Propagation of the Faith, which 
allowed the Bishop 50,000 francs a year with which he was building his 
Cathedral.
<P>
At that time I was officiating in ten stations, three between Monroe and 
Detroit, four beyond Detroit and three in the direction of Adrienne.  
Being the only one familiar with the three languages, I was more often 
on horseback than at home, always on the road.  The two other Fathers 
officiated in the parish, one for the Canadians, the other for the Irish 
and the Germans.  The income from my missions and the resources accruing 
from the Church at Monroe enabled me, by living frugally, to begin 
little by little to enlarge the house adjoining the Church which was 
also enlarged.  We were going very slowly, stopping work whenever money 
was lacking, and never contracting any debts.  I must add that the 
Canadians helped me greatly by their labor.  The house was going up 
slowly and I was anticipating in the near future, the day when we could 
live in it.
<P>
Relieved of this anxiety, a need of another kind remained to be filled, 
a need which concerned my conscience and the souls of the numerous 
children forced to attend the Protestant school and more often growing 
up in ignorance.  This need was greater for the girls than for the boys; 
the girls, seeking to resemble in everything the American Protestants, 
associated only with them and disdained the Canadians, spoke only 
English, went to English schools, kept by Protestants; and all this 
ended with a mixed marriage, and from that day they were Catholics only 
in name.  The music in the Protestant Churches charmed them, the singing 
pleased them and our services bored them.
<P>
Such was my plight!  But how to remedy this evil and prevent these 
dangers?  By a Catholic school kept and directed by religious women.  
But where was I to get them?  There was not a single religious in the 
vast State of Michigan.  Those who had been at Detroit had left as a 
result of differences with the Bishop (Rese).  How could I procure any 
from another State, having only privations to offer?  In a visit to my 
neighbor, Father Rappe, Pastor of Toledo and later Bishop of Cleveland, 
former Chaplain of the Ursulines in Boulogne, France, I learned that he 
was expecting three [Notre Dame de Namur Sisters] for his parish in 
Toledo.  His project pleased me, but meant nothing to me, even while 
exciting my jealousy.  One day when he was congratulating himself 
on the good fortune which he had had, I ended by saying that if I did 
not find the means of obtaining any religious, I would make some.
<P>
A short time after, having gone to Baltimore to solicit help from our 
Fathers, though I did not obtain any, I gave a retreat to the "Sisters 
of St. Charles," then entirely abandoned, living still in community, but 
whose vows had not been renewed for a long time.  Two of them expressed 
the desire to be admitted into a regular congregation.  One was 
sufficiently educated to accomplish the object which I was considering.  
I told them to wait and that probably in a short time I would try to 
associate with them some pious souls determined to second my efforts to 
take charge of the education of the children of Monroe, and that we 
could begin with a school for girls.  My intention in bringing these 
persons together was to lay the foundations of a little religious 
congregation which would perhaps, with the help of God, develop later.
<P>
Thus a year passed in waiting.  In the meantime I was seeking these 
souls of good will!  I found two.  This was sufficient considering the 
smallness of the house and the lack of resources.  I prepared a very 
short Rule, modeled on that of the Redemptorists, which would suffice 
for the moment.  Bishop Lefevre approved it, and the new Congregation 
was placed under his immediate jurisdiction with vows for one year.  All 
that was only temporary in my thoughts.  The Institute was to bear the 
name of "Sisters o f Providence," which it actually took.
<P>
When I saw the new house ready for use, (after a fashion) I sent to 
Baltimore for my two "Charlatines," and kept them for some weeks at some 
distance from Monroe at the home of Mr. Robert O'Connor, an excellent 
Catholic, where they remained in secular dress without being noticed.
<P>
There remained to be decided the habit which my future religious would 
adopt, a rather difficult matter for me.  After having uselessly 
searched my memory without being able to decide on anything definite, I 
went to Toledo to examine from head to foot the habit of the [Poor 
Clares], for I kept my plan a secret.  I succeeded in remembering the 
style of the veil and with the help of that information, I sent my 
postulants to work.  Everything being in readiness for my future 
religious, we took possession of our new house before there were doors 
or windows or a stairway, a ladder served the latter purpose.  
Immediately my four poor candidates entered the two little houses which 
we had just left.  They were Mary Maxis, Charlotte Schaaf, Therese 
Renauld and Mrs. [Godfroy-Smyth], a widow, a relative of the Mayor of 
Monroe, of a mature age, without children and who promised to make a 
good superior later, of a firm and determined character, enjoying the 
esteem of the entire population of Monroe.
<P>
Three days later, Sunday, Sister Anne and Sister Theresa, having 
received the new habit privately and renewed their three vows, appeared 
in the dress of the Professed Sisters in the Church where I was about to 
give the habit solemnly to the other.  Never had a religious been seen 
in Monroe, still less the taking of the veil.  It was quite a 
revelation.  The Church could not contain the crowd eager to gaze upon 
those creatures who seemed to come from another world.
<P>
After the usual questions and the blessing of the habit, the postulant, 
dressed in white and lead by the two professed Sisters, withdrew into 
one of the chapels, prepared for the occasion, and reappeared a short 
time later, transformed, in the habit of a novice.  The whole assembly 
gave a start, they stood on the benches in order to see better.  The 
sermon completed the instruction of my Americans and excited their 
admiration for such great devotion.
<P>
The work was founded!  On the solid rock of poverty!  Naturally it was 
necessary to provide everything and for a rather long time.  This was 
what concerned me least ...
<P>
Invited a short time after to preach a course of Lenten Sermons in New 
Orleans, I undertook this long journey in the winter with the prospect 
that I should find there perhaps some resources to help my poor 
religious.  Instead of giving a retreat, it was rather a large mission 
which produced extraordinary fruits of conversion, so that after the 
exercises I was obliged to remain nearly two months longer to hear the 
confessions.  My labors were amply rewarded.  I received $525.00, an 
offering from the ladies, $300.00 from the trustees, and having left 
with a little carpet bag, I returned to Monroe with thirteen large boxes 
containing provisions of all kinds.  I was rich then and from that time 
on the condition of the Sisters improved.
<P>
Our house finished, there remained to me only to enjoy in peace the 
realization of my plans.  That consolation was not to be mine.  I must 
have other trials.  After having been Superior for four years at Monroe 
and having founded the French house, I was recalled to Baltimore ... The 
hour of trial was about to begin for me.  Those trials were personal, I 
shall not speak of them ...
<P>
If until now I did not seek to recover any trace of the little work at 
Monroe, it is because I had already learned many years ago at the 
American Seminary at Louvain, that there were indeed religious in 
Monroe, but Sisters of the Heart of Mary.  From that time I was 
convinced that my work had died out ... From that time I did not receive 
any more news from Monroe until the day on which there arrived this 
mysterious letter from Mother Clotilde who told me that I still lived in 
the thoughts and memory of some friends beyond the sea.  Great was my 
joy as well as my surprise at seeing renewed the ties which I thought 
broken forever and which I hope in the future become closer ...
<P>
It is in these sentiments of fatherly affection that I remain, Reverend 
Sisters,
<P>

<font size=4>
We are a small NON-profit-making organisation originally based in the UK but now made up of amateur scopers, 
naturalists, microscopists, artists, writers, teachers, and software writers from different countries.
We share a common passion: we are all interested in the world around us!
More than this... we like to explore our world by understanding its construction
and maintenance from those things which remain almost secretively invisible because
they work on a tiny scale - a microscopic world! We are dedicated to promoting a fun and interesting way
to others of finding out a whole lot more about our amazing universe we live in.
<br>
<br>
It is difficult to define roles. We are a loosly knit bunch of people and we all help out on all aspects of 
running the various sites and co-ordinating non-web activities. You can contact any of us from the list below but
if you want a first point of contact, try your local Site or Site-Mirror Editor first, or pump your mail into the CENTRAL ADDRESS at the bottom of the page.
We are all amateurs. Don't let the fancy list of names and descriptions scare you off! We are just ordinary folk 
having a go at something worthwhile. Please write in and chat with us!

<h2>Introduction and characteristics</h2>
<strong>Orion 4 is designed to work in the Windows 3 environment. A 32-bits version for Windows NT is being designed and will be available soon. 
Orion grabs images in any size between 16 x 16 to 4096 x 4096 pixels, 256 gray levels, from the SEM slow scan and photo modes. Practically, the exact image size is a function of the scanning characteristics.
<p>
Orion connects to ALL existing SEMs. Every SEM has a corresponding driver on disk which holds all the information to configure the board and establish a working range of desired image sizes (max. 64 images sizes can be defined per driver).
<p>
The connection is simple (4 wires) and the board provides <em>total electrical isolation</em> between the PC and the SEM electronics. This provides optimal security and unequaled image quality because of the suppression of the induced noise. It also protects your SEM against unwanted noise induction in the SEM video circuitry. The SEM electronics do <em>not</em> need to be modified in any way. The image quality you will get can be compared with the quality you would get with active systems, but without any risk.
<p>
You also get square pixels in any mode; this is useful for image analysis and avoiding distortion when the images are passed to other packages for display, processing, etc ...
<p>
Depending on the connection, it is possible to simultaneously grab two images (the Orion board has two video inputs), so you could grab an image from the SE detector, and another one from the BSE at the same time, in only one scan.

<h2>Orion system options</h2>
<strong>
<dl>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> Macro command interpretor</h3>
<p>
<dd>This extremely powerful function enables you to redefine nearly everything in the Orion package - buttons, main menu type, grabbing process.
    It can help you save time by executing different grabbing routines and functions depending on the current user.
    It can also be used to launch external tasks like a word processor or an image analysis system for immediate image processing.
    New commands are added to the interpretor nearly every week.
<p>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> EDX mapping channels</h3>
<p>
<dd>This facility for 'grabbing' allows superimposed elemental maps with grabbed image
    This option allows simultaneous grabbing of an SE or BSE image, and up to 8 EDX mappings channels. This option requires the use of         a VEGA board. All images are displayed simultaneously on the PC screen.
<p>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> Photo resolution replay board</h3>
<p>
<dd>This allows image to be sent back to the SEM photo device
    This very high resolution board connects to the Orion board and has a max. resolution of 4096 x 4096 pixels, 256 gray levels. Any         image up to that size can be sent to the photo device; usually the result quality is at least equal to the quality of the original         photograph.
<p>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> HP Laserjet enhancement card</h3>
<p>
<dd>This produces photographic quality images on paper in 10 seconds print time.
    When it is required to print nearly photographic quality images at low cost, we propose to use the LazardPrint board. This board         prints in 150, 300 and even 600 true dpi, in 256 gray levels from a palette of 1024. The results are fast and impressive (10         seconds are usually required to print a 1100 x 1600 pixels image with a Pentium PC).

<dd>Since a lot of SEM users are using Microsoft Word 6 for printing documents with included images, we can provide you with a number of macro commands specifically designed for manipulating images safely and integrate them in a Word document.
Although designing a macro file for Word can be quite simple, it can be really time consuming to design a really safe macro.
We can provide you with macros and technical assistance.

<p>
<dd>We have more specific solutions for the Philips XL series. These SEMs can easily be upgraded with an Orion system, in order to get much more resolution in X, Y and gray levels.
Also very special macros have been designed, that process .TIF images generated by the XL microscope. The images data (accel. voltage, working distance, micron bar ...) are extracted and reproduced at the exact scale in the Word 6 document, making their use much easier.

<B>Mind over matter for sex change fish</B><BR>

<P>Dr John Godwin of North Carolina State University has carried
out experiments that show that the expression of gender specific
behaviour in the blueheaded wrasse (a species of Coral reef
fish) seems to be directly related to the amount of a hormone
called<B> arginine vasotocin </B>(AVT), which is produced in the
animal's brain. His studies seem to suggest that aggressive
behaviour in males normally thought to be controlled by sex
hormones can occur in animals that lack testes.</P>



<P>Blueheaded wrasse are ideal subjects for studies of this type as
they are <B> diandric protogynous hermaphrodites</B>, in other words
they can rapidly change sex in response to changes in
environmental conditions. This means, for example,  that a  fish
which started life as an egg producing female can transform into
a sperm producing aggressive supermale.
</P>


<P>A series of experiments has been carried out by Dr John Goodwin
with colleagues from the University of Texas, University of
California and Arizona State University West. One of studies
involved the removal of all the supermales from a colony of
wrasse on a reef in the Virgin Islands, so leaving the largest
females as the dominant fish. Within hours the dominant females
began to exhibit supermale  behaviour - i.e. defending
territories, aggressiveness and courting of the other females.
Within a week their ovaries had changed into fully functional
sperm producing testes.</P>


<P>In addition to removing the supermales, the ovaries from some of
the females were removed before returning them to the colony. It
was found that even these females exhibited full dominant
behaviour, but did not produce testes or the supermales'
distinctive coloration.
</P>


<P>It has been found that the sexes produce different amounts of
AVT, and when the wrasse changes sex, its levels of AVT seem to
change accordingly. The females were found to produce about half
the AVT of ordinary males and roughly one third to a quarter of
that produced by supermales - suggesting that the gender
specific behaviour was linked to AVT levels in the brain.When scientists investigated the levels of AVT in the females
that had changed to males they found that they had risen to
supermale levels.</P>
<P> Scientists have yet to decide whether the rise in AVT causes the
behavioural sex change or whether it is a result of it.

<strong>Deadly Virus on the loose</strong><br>

<P>The United Press International reports that the Ohio Department
of Health

are keeping a close eye on the spreading a deadly virus which
can cause

chronic breathing problems and is fatal in nearly 50% of
cases. The carriers of the disease, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, are rodents. Transmission of the disease is via dust
from  infected rodents' urine, droppings and saliva. 

</P>

<P>Although, there is no evidence that this potentially fatal agent
has infiltrated Ohio, no chances are being taken, health
officials have checked hundreds of rats and rodents in 15
counties to ensure they are not carriers. As a further measure,
the disease has been placed on the state's list of  reportable
diseases that must be reported to the health department within
24 hours.

<strong>New Breed of Optical Microscopes breakthrough!</strong><br>

<P>It is well known that the resolving power of optical microscopes is 

restricted by the wavelength of light. Obtaining images greater than

1500x magnification results in larger pictures but not better detail,

leaving exploration of the microscopic world at greater resolution, 

up to the pioneers using scanning electron microscopes. </P>



<P>But now, thanks to IBM, a new breed of optical microscopes have come

into being which out-perform <strong>all</strong> previous instruments:

<em>SIAM  (Scanning Interferometric Apertureless Microscope).</em></P>



<P>This new optical microscope is capable of seeing objects 500 times 

smaller than previously possible with conventional optical microscopes.

It provides an unprecedented 1 nanometer (nm) resolution, which is about

five times larger than an individual atom, with the potential to image

single atoms in visible light.</P>



<P>Scientists are now able to view images much smaller than the wavelength

of light and approaching the atomic level, an achievement considered 

impossible according to the basic principles of traditional optics.</P>



<P>Don't believe me..? 

<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/research/press/optical.html">Then take a 

look for yourself!</a></P>

<A NAME="seadrugs"></A> 

<strong>Prescriptions from the sea?</strong><br>

<P>Marine scientists are looking to algae, sponges and other
organisms as producers of a wide variety of potentially valuable
and useful pharmaceutical chemicals.  It has been estimated that the 10,000
marine organisms that have been identified make up only a very
small proportion of the total, so the potential for such
chemicals is enormous.</P>



<P>The combination of predators, salinity and high pressure in
the environment  has resulted in the evolution of marine
organisms that can produce a cocktail of chemicals for self
defence. Many of these compounds are thought to be unique,
produced no where else on earth.</P>



<P>Chemicals already isolated include compounds called
<I>topsentins </I>which may be effective against arthritis and
<I>discodermolide </I>that works in the treatment of breast and ovarian
cancer. Another, <I>ecteinascidia, </I>from the invertebrate animal,
the sea squirt had been found in clinical trials to kill the
most lethal form of skin cancer - melanoma.</P>

 

<P>However, for all the promise of these life saving marine
derived drugs, there is a worrying side effect. To produce one
gram of ecteinascidia requires one tonne of sea squirts. The
harvesting of marine life for pharmaceutical drug production is
going to put huge demands on the extremely delicately balanced
marine ecology. In addition, the search for new marine derived
chemicals is an expensive and chancy operation. Once found, the
drugs may be ten years in development and during this time
equally effective drugs may be produced or unwanted side effects
identified.</P>

</Strong></P>
<P>Bees and moths have confounded aerodynamic experts by their
ability to fly.  The laws of physics suggest that the wings of
moths are too frail to generate enough lift to get the animal
off the ground.</P>

<P> By using a robotic hawkmoth model, researchers
at Cambridge University have been able to elucidate that the
extra lift is generated during each downstroke by a spiral
vortex that travels across the leading edge of the wing from
base to tip. This effect had been missed previously as wind
tunnel studies of insect flight have viewed the insect from the
side.</P>

cancer. A cancer research team at Cambridge work in darkened laboratories  

using the dye to inject into human cells. It is helping them to understand 

how proteins move when the cell divides - an important mechanism because it 

is 'uncontrolled' cell divison that leads to cancer.</P>



<P>Professor Gorden McVie is reported as saying: "It is fascinating to think 

that jellyfish, which appeared in the sea 700 million years ago, are 

offering a modern-day solution to one of science's greatest mysteries. This 

is yet another example of nature lending a helping hand."

<strong>Elephant man - a new diagnosis</strong><br>

<P>New X ray studies of Joseph Merrick (the nineteenth century
"Elephant man") made by Anita Sharma and colleagues at the Royal
London hospital suggest that he did not suffer from
neurofibromatosis as once thought, but from a much rarer disease
- Proteus syndrome.</P>



<P>Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disease which causes the
uncontrolled growth of nerve cells. Such growth results in
tumours developing beneath the skin surface. In contrast,
Proteus disease results in abnormal growth of bone and soft
tissue. Sharma states that Merrick's skeleton, which is kept at
the Royal London hospital, is studded with many bony outgrowths,
apparently typical of the disease. In addition, Merrick's ribs
lack the notches and thickening common in neurofibromatosis.</P>


<P>The gene for neurofibromatosis was isolated in 1990 by American
scientists. Sharma suggests that one way of confirming her
diagnosis is to conduct DNA tests on some bone tissue to
determine whether or not the gene is present.</P>

<Strong>Hedging one's bets on the future of England's 

countryside</Strong>



<P>Never before has the rural countryside of England and the Natural Life it 

supports been under such threat. Year on year, new roads cut through 

tranquil spots and deliver the kiss of death. Slowly, like a sinister, 

creeping, plague, advertising hoardings, roadside vending ventures, and 

the ever-growing throng of urban siteseers invade the oldest monuments 

in the remotest of places.</P>

<P>And now a new threat!</P>


<P>Over 40,000 miles of English country hedgerows, which for centuries have 

been strictly protected by Parliamentary Enclosure Acts, could see 

themselves whittled away over the next few decades. Ex-teacher, Colin 

Seymour, is fighting to save 56 yards of ancient hawthorne hedge in East 

Yorkshire, which to some, may seem a trivial battle. Unfortunately, it is a 

Crown court case, which - if lost - could bring about a change in the laws 

protecting the living network of adjoining hedgerows which divide and abound

the thousands of fields seen in the country; a network which provides 

natural home and shelter to a diverse range of wild life.
</P>

<P>This small section is threatened by the desire of some local villagers of 

Flamborough, less concerned with these issues, to build a bowling green. Mr. 

Seymour has taken on the council in an effort to preserve not just 56 years 

of hedge, but the future of at least one important aspect of the English 

countryside.</P>

<strong>A tooth for an eye</strong><br>


<P>Using techniques pioneered by  Professor Giancarlo
Falcinellu, surgeons in Britain are hoping to restore a blind
man's sight, using a tooth. If successful, this operation could
offer hope to those patients who are not suitable for corneal
transplants.</P>

<P>A single-rooted tooth,  removed together with a wedge of bone,
is sanded down to a rectangular shape and drilled. A plastic
lens is then placed in the 4mm diameter hole. This section is
then grafted into the patient's cheek. At the same time, tissue
from the skin inside the cheek is grafted onto the patient's
eye. After two months the section will have sufficient tissue
growing on it to allow surgeons to remove it and stitch  it into
the cheek skin graft on the eye. Finally, a coloured contact
lens will be placed over the tooth section to disguise it.</P>

<P>The success rate of the 180 such operations carried out in Italy
has been high,  with many patients being able to read again with
glasses.</P>

and they are telling us how it is! </P> 

<P> So we thought we would try and help a little bit. We asked
our friends at  Brunel Microscopes if they could put together a
video and a set of lectures covering all aspects of human
biology and boy did they come up with a real treat. </P> 



<P> We thought it was so good, that we decided to open a
complete new section to offer real lectures on chosen themes
from our pages both here and in the states. The first of these
is available now from our main index as: THE BRUNEL LECTURES.
The lecture topic will change-out periodically and if you have a

Did you ever make your own slide? You did, huh?! Well, maybe you did or maybe you didn't
but what I want to do is tell you here right now how to make a slide using NON-VOLATILE CHEMICALS. I also
want to show you how easy it is to make a batch of slides all in one evening.
<p>
We've gotta get a few things straight right away though if we're gonna be working together: first of all - I aint
no scientist or purist. I like a beer, I like to do a lot of other things besides messing around with 
looking into small stuff... so if you would prefer to hunt around the web and find yourself a 10 year 
lesson on how to suss out this Microscopy stuff, then that's fine by me. But I'll tell you something right 
away, it just aint necessary. If you don't believe me then hang on in thru this first lesson and see how easy
it is to make a REAL specimen slide yourself. Now most of the super Amateur Microscopists spend years before they 
try this so if you stick with me, you'll slip into the fast lane and get your first slide made about 365x 
quicker than most people and without doing a degree in chemistry.
<p>
One more thing... I like to write how I speak so you might find my use and distortion of the old Brit language
a bit strange. I hope you stay with me though cos (er... that means 'because') there's lots to learn and I aint
the kinda (kind of) guy to hang around doing things slowly.

<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Why have specimen slides?<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Some things can be seen straight away under a microscope with little or no
preparation. But if you want to KEEP something for a while to see over and over
again, you have to give it a place to stay where it will keep without going rotten.
That place is on a glass slide, fixed in position, and covered with a glass slip sealed
away from the atmosphere.
<P>
A lot of very small things just have to be prepared (more on this later) and 'mounted'
onto a glass slide to even be able to study them at all: they are just too small or 
unsuitable for examination by any other means.
</strong></EM></FONT>
<p>
<br>

<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Preparation - general<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Imagine for a moment that you want to preserve a delicate thing for a period of time;
for example - an item of clothing, a boat, a car or something even bigger: a house!
As long as any of these objects are exposed to the air, wind, rain, dust, and sunlight
they will continue to be affected by interaction with these variable conditions. Let's consider the 
house. To KEEP it safe and in the same constant condition, we would need to enclose it within
something which will act a barrier to all the external things that would slowly transform it.
One way would be to put the house in a big container and take all the air out, effectively
creating a vacuum inside of it. The container would need to be made of glass or plastic though if
we still wish to look at it and enjoy its structure. We might encounter a small problem when removing
the air because as it was drawn out of the container, the windows might break due to the sudden rush of air
and the forces it creates as it leaves the box.
<p>
Another possible solution is to put the house into a glass container and replace the air with
something else - a chemical or a solution of some kind which would not react with any of the materials
that the house was made of. Some of the problems with this is that the house is made of many different 
substances: brick, cement, wood, ceramics, glass, paint, etc., Whatever solution used would have to be
chemically inert (non-reactive) with a wide range of materials. Also, structures such as bricks, are porous;
that is - they contain tiny bubbles of air. Our solution needed to fill the container would have to be
able to seep into the tiny spaces in the bricks and push the air out of them. We would have to make certain
too that the solution filled the INSIDE of the house or else the pressure from the weight of solution outside
would be greater than inside - effectively smashing the windows and possibly distorting the roof structure
through pressure and weight.
<p>
If we were unable to find a PERFECT solution or liquid to cater for all these problems, we would have to find 
one which suited best and find additional ways of preventing some of the problems from happening. For example, lets
say we had this MAGIC chemical called 'MOUNT-IT' which seemed like it would do most of the things required except
it has a peculiar trait of melting paint. Could we use it?
<p>
We could, providing we first coat the paint with something which would FIX it so that it would no longer react
with our magic 'MOUNT-IT' solution. Possibly a varnish of some kind.

<p>
What has all this to do with mounting specimens on a slide?
<p>
Well there is NO difference! A tiny, microscopic, thing is itself made of different materials and forms a structure 
much like (and often more fragile than) our example house. Similar problems exist. Some specimens need hardly any 
major preparation at all, while others need a lot of work involving various chemical treatments. It is unfortunate 
that many of these techniques involve substances which are considered likely to cause hazard to health or safety if not 
used properly. 
<p>
To make our first slide quickly and safely, I will show you now a way of mounting a wide variety of things
using safe commonly found materials which are either completely safe or not so threatening to your health and safety.
I also propose to dismiss some aspects of preparation for our first ones knowing that this will create less than perfect
specimens for some subjects. Don't worry about this because you'll still create something worthy of looking at time
and time again.

Preparation - stages<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Just for the record, these are the stages you would normally have to consider in the process of preparing
specimens for permanent mounting of PLANT material on glass slides. We will NOT be doing the majority of these
when we make our first slides together!

You need some glass slides. After all is said and done, you can't escape 
this requirement. Glass has a 'see-through' trait despite the fact that
it is considered a material that can easily cut and cause injury. You just have to
be careful how you handle it.  You also need cover slips. These wafer thin
'slips' of glass will be used to cover the specimens you place on the larger
glass slides. I'm currently using</strong></em></font><font color="00aaff" size=4><strong><em> cover slips which are 22mm square</em></strong></font><font color="000066" size=4>
<em><strong>and</em></strong></font><font color="00aaff" size=4><strong><em> glass specimen slides 76mmm long, 21mm wide, and 1mm thick (3 x 1 inch).</em></strong>
</font><font color="000066" size=4><em><strong><p>
Where do you get 'em from?
<p>
Well this is the part where you just have to contact a small company that sells them.
You can't pick them up from your local shop so you need to order some. We have
some of these small businesses in our <a href="../prodir/indexpro.html#brunel">Professional Services Section</A> so
take a look in there first.
<p>
If any of you know some place in your country where you can get glass slides and cover slips from,
<a href="mailto:larry@molcol.demon.co.uk">let me know!</A> and I'll update this page to give a more 
comprehensive list.
<p>
You need a bit more stuff to get going but I'm gonna show you now how to use things easily 
available. So as soon as you're ready <a href="sugar1.html">Let's move on</A> to the next page!

It is incredibly exciting to look at something that most people have 
never seen, to enter a world few have glimpsed. I like to think of 
myself as a <FONT COLOR="DARKRED"><I>Micronaut</I></FONT>, 
similar to an astronaut, but instead of traveling into outer space, 
looking for alien life-forms, I travel into <I>micro-space</I> 
and find all sorts of alien-looking creatures. Astronauts use giant 
spaceships to propel themselves into space. My spaceship is a microscope 
and it takes me to places just as amazing and inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
There is <I>ALWAYS</I> something new and exciting to see. What I would 
like to do now is take you with me on many 
<FONT COLOR="DARKRED"><I>Micronautic Adventures</I></FONT>. 
You'll see just how interesting and fun these can be!

Subject: Using Micscape From Windows95

I don't know how but I discovered your site tonite and downloaded the
software and all of the demo movies. I downloaded for two reasons,

(1) they sounded interesting and...
(2) the challenge existed for using Windows 95

Just in case you have not been able to get it working from this platform
as yet, I followed the following procedure.
(a) I created a directory and copied all of the program files to it
(b) I extracted all the required executables and then deleted
    the originals
(c) I double clicked on micmovie.exe and voila, no problems!
(d) I did not bother with the group file or icon.

The only problem I faced after watching all 7 movies and quitting the
program was the intense brightness of the Windows 95 screen as compared
to the Micscape screen.Well done, very interesting.  

Gord Burton (Orleans, Ontario, Canada)</pre>
<em>Thanks Gord. (The editor).</em>
<p>
And of course, if that doesn't work, you can always use the DOS option in Win95 to run Micmovie.exe so you should be okay in this respect.<p><br><br><p><br><center><h4><em><a href="#about">Sub-Index</A> / <a href="#movietop"> Button Selector</A></em></h4></center><br><p><br><br><a name="downplay"><h3>Download Micscape Movie Player</h3>I hope you took the time first to read <b><A HREF="#about">About Micscape Movies</A></b><p><ul><li><A Href="http://www.micropix.demon.co.uk/movies/micmovie.exe">HTTP Download Movie Player</A> and save it as MICMOVIE.EXE<br>File Size: 96k (This is NOT a compressed file)</ul><p><br><br><center><h4><em><a href="#about">Sub-Index</A> / <a href="#movietop"> Button Selector</A></em></h4></center><br><p><br><br><a name="downgrp"><h3>Download Micscape Group and Icon File (Windows Users).</h3>I hope you took the time first to read <b><A HREF="#about">About Micscape Movies</A></b><p><ul><li><A Href="http://www.micropix.demon.co.uk/movies/winmovie.exe">HTTP Download Micscape Windows File</A> and save it as WINMOVIE.EXE<br>File Size: a COMPRESSED file of a few hundred bytes (very small).</ul><p><br><center><h4><em><a href="#about">Sub-Index</A> / <a href="#movietop"> Button Selector</A></em></h4></center><br><br><br><P><CENTER><B>Please report any errors OR offer comment to <A HREF="mailto:mol@molcol.demon.co.uk"> <I> The Editor </I></A></B></CENTER><BR><HR>

Nothing ever happens without people! This section is dedicated to the 
human endeavour of providing something of worth, not for financial gain, but simply
because they are driven down a path of love or passion to offer something they consider 
valuable to others. Often such a road can be long and winding, and may only be travelled
by many helping each other. Sometimes a single pioneer can make the journey alone filled
with the belief that others will follow. 
<p>
Take a moment here to see where other people are spending time to follow their passion, or 
have made a positive difference to all of our lives!

<B>ABOUT MOLCOL SOFTWARE</B><BR>
Molcol Software (that's me) are the pioneers of Microscopy Software for general and educational use. Our Version 3.0
of Microscope for the PC is already in use at schools in different countries and by the general public at home. This 
'First in the world' virtual microscope package enables all people to enjoy the incredible world of the very small 
without any additional hardware except a standard PC. Four years in the making, it brings a major tool to the world's
educationalists, it's people, and existing Microscopists.
<p>
The project is run as a commercial venture only because such protocols are needed under the UK taxation system. All 
profits received by me trading as Molcol Software is used to further the promotion of Microscopy, Biology, and 
their importance and enjoyment to more people in the world. It is a personal endeavour driven by love and respect
for the study of life. Most of the funds received are now used to support this web site in the UK.

<H3>Microscope for the PC Ver. 3.0 Shareware (Download Guide)</H3>
This is a large comprehensive package which emulates using a microscope on your PC.
The software <B>will work on any IBM compatible PC</B> in DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95.
You will be able to see 'still' slidesets and video images, magnify up to 1000x in 
real resolution, move around images, re-focus them, control time-lapse sequences,
and much much more. <strong> Both parts 1 and 2 must be downloaded </strong>. The zipped files
are very large, so give yourself plenty of time to download them. After both files 
have been down-loaded to the same directory, you must use PKUNZIP to extract the 
software from the compressed files. Use Notepad or any other WINDOWS or DOS text editor to view 
the 'read.me' files once the software has been 'unzipped' onto your hard-drive.

Once you've downloaded Microscope for the PC and recovered from the stunning discovery
that you can go 'scoping' from your armchair, you might be hungry to see more slidesets.
Well now you can from these pages. If you just want to download one of them, try the last one
in the list provided. This is the most recent. When the file is safely on your disk, unzip it and 
PLEASE read the read.me file to understand how to install the slideset for use with Microscope
for the PC.<BR>

while. Just to convince you that the time is well spent, you can download a DEMO only version which will transfer to your PC
much faster. Once you have unzipped the file and had a 'taste' of 'Scoping' on your PC, you'll soon be back for the real thing.

<H1>Project Description</H1>

<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<I>The focal point of the Project:</I> to record images, observations, and other information about dustmites, their habitat, population quantities, life-cycle and any other findings regarding their existence. Dustmites were selected as the focal point of this Project because they should be readily available in most peoples' homes, in their beds, their vacuum cleaners, their carpets, etc..
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<I>The objective of the Project:</I> to use amateur microscopy skills and interactively <I>invent</I> the tools needed to record images of and information about dustmites; use participant ingenuity and interaction to find a simplistic, extremely inexpensive solution using common, ordinary household items, such as posterboard, tape, paperclips, rubberbands, etc.; generate a rich exchange of ideas between participants and groups to find the most simplistic, inexpensive method(s) to conduct the focal point activity: recording images of and information about dustmites.
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
Only inexpensive, common, household items may be utilized, so everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. Beyond the use of a microscope and a household camera, no eleborate commercial tools may be used. The Project is to be an exercise in ingenuity; an interactive collaboration between groups from different Nations to utilize amateur microscopy skills to conduct the focal point activity: recording images of and information about dustmites.
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
As participants record images and information, they should submit their information and images to the 
<A HREF="MAILTO: rmcain@pipeline.com">International Project Data Coordinator</A>, where it will be formatted and posted on the World Wide Web. If a participating group is unable to 
convert their images, for example - photos or drawings, into electronic format, then your National Project Co-Ordinator will assist you. Contact the National coordinator for details and arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Participants will maintain their copyright to any information they gather, but provide Microscopy-UK and the Internet Youth Group limited publishing rights. At Project completion, if the data and images gathered by the participants are determined to be significant, a collective scientific paper will be entered on the participants' behalf, submitting their results, recognizing the work of each individual participant, their contribution to the collective effort and their contribution to the Scientific Community in the study of dustmites. Such an achievement would make the participants very attractive to Universities, Scholarship Organizations, etc.. 
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
In order for results to be considered significant, documentation is of paramount importance. Participants must, of course, record their findings, but they must also record the methods used for discovery and the reasoning behind the methods used for that discovery. As much of the thought processes invloved, as possible, as well as the resultant findings must be recorded, to validate the discovery, for submission as a bonafide scientific document.
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
The Project has been designed to provide an excellent opportunity for participants, not only to exercise their <I>thinking muscles</I>, but to share pieces of their culture, make friends in faraway places and to better themselves and improve their world. This is NOT to be a competition between two National Groups, but an open exchange of ideas and information between participants, to find a solution to reach a common goal.

<center><h1>Feedback and Stats at Microscopy UK</h1></center>
<p>
<strong>
In a world driven by the pressure of modern commercialism, it is difficult to envisage 
any area where people motivated by nothing more than curiosity and intrigue 
for living things can have a say in what is important in their lives. Microscopy, by its
very name alone, seems to promote imagery of a pursuit fit only for the ardent 
study into searching out secrets for commercial exploitation, yet nothing could be further
from the truth. Microscopy is one of the few <em>true</em> interests that anyone 
can become involved with and enjoy for its own sake.
<p>
Here at Microscopy UK we are endeavouring not only to keep this interest alive in 
a modern environment - we are succeeding in bringing the subject out of a dusty Victorian 
cupboard and repositioning it as the lively subject it actually is. 
<p>
<em>And every reader and visitor is helping us to do it. Well done!</em>
<p>
This page enables you to get a tiny feel of the interaction going on between 
all of amateurs as well as the professionals who still remember their initial passion  - and through it -
are prepared to become involved!
<p>
All are welcome! All information exchanges are in the spirit of sharing...

Subject: Capturing Dust Mites   Re: your article:- dustmite.html
</pre>
<em>
I work at the National Physical Laboratory and use a Hitachi Field 
Emission SEM. We are having our schools open day soon and I am trying to 
find some of these "common" dust mites to put in the SEM but as yet no 
success. Have you improved your hunting methods since you wrote the 
article?

Reply from Maurice Smith of Micscape Magazine at Microscopy UK:-
<p>
<em>
Hi Mark, <br>
I've passed your email to Andrew Syred, one of my colleagues who sent 
me a small colony of Dustmites. He might be able to help you out. As I 
pointed out in the article, these little creatures are not as easy to find
as most people would have us believe. I hope Andrew can help.
</em>
<p>
<strong>Email Exchange between Andrew and Mark:-</strong>

<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Hi Mark,<br>
<p>
I might be able to help. When is your special day? I could send you
one of two if you like, although you may have problems preparing it for SEM
work if you're field is not biology? To be honest - I can't normally take the time to 
help so specifically but it just so happens I am working on a project involving
dustmites right now, so I can afford the time to help and if it helps you 
interest students and their parents then great!
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>
Thanks for the offer of the dust mites, the open days are on the 2nd
and 3rd of July so I have plenty of time. As you have surmised biological
work is not my field and we do not have a critical point dryer. I was aware
of the problem as I have previously used some of those red spider mites, which
collapse under vacuum, but I thought that the shell of the dust mite looked
more stable. 
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Dust mites have much the same exterior as spider mites; it's tough and
leathery rather than hard and rigid so will likely collapse as the
hapless beast dries out. You can sometimes reduce the effect of air
drying by controlled evaporation from a volatile liquid such as ether
but I have not tried this procedure with mites.
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>
What exactly does a critical point dryer do, perhaps we could 
simulate it with some of the vacuum equipment we have here?
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Probably not if you are not geared for it. Critical point drying is a
potentially dangerous technique that really should not be done without
purpose built equipment. At a given temperature and pressure a liquid
will pass from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase without a change in
density or latent heat of vaporisation, it exists as a dense fluid. This
point is known as the critical point and is different for different
liquids. Water should be the ideal liquid to use but god decided that
the critical temperature and pressure would be 374 deg C and 3184 psi
respectively. A fairly destructive combination!
<p>
Various liquids have
been advocated but the most commonly used is liquid carbon dioxide which
has a critical temp. and pressure of 31 deg. C and 1072 psi. Water in
the specimen is replaced with and intermediate fluid such as ethanol
(water and liquid CO2 are not miscible). In a small pressure vessel the
specimen is purged with liquid CO2 for half an hour or so to ensure
total substitution of the ethanol within the specimen. The pressure
vessel is then sealed and slowly heated. The liquid CO2 expands greatly
as the temperature rises and at the critical point all the liquid gas in
the chamber (including that infiltrated into the specimen) flips to the
dense fluid phase with no change in density and of greater importance
with no transitional menaces; the specimen is not subjected to surface
tension. Once the CP has been exceeded the gas is SLOWLY bled off until
the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure. Voila, one dried
specimen ready for sputtering.
<p>
An automatic pressure relief valve and last resort blow-out safety disc
are built into commercially available kit.
<p>
Freeze drying is an alternative method but the skin, designed to prevent
the mite from drying out whilst alive, restricts sublimation of ice
making the end result unreliable.
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>        
Incidentally where do you hunt for the dust mites, I have tried in the past to
no avail? We are led to believe that our houses are infested with these 
creatures, are they camera shy or is it a scare story by hoover salesmen :-).
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Got it in one - just a big con. trick. All those stories are put about
by people who want to sell flashy vacuum cleaners and expensive
allergenic bedding materials, like mattresses, pillows and blankets.
Even knowing where to look and what to look for they are incredibly
difficult to find, an opinion shared by all my colleagues and like-minded
contacts. Having found a few in a donated sample of under-carpet debris
(following a country-wide request for house dust, fluff etc.), I have
maintained a small culture for about 12 months or so but these are now
dwindling. I gave a large part away to Mol for filming some while ago
which was more or less the end of the culture but I'm sure to have one
or two knocking about.
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>       
Lastly thanks for the suggestions, a ball point might be interesting. One of 
the problems with my SEM is the lowest mag is around 60 times, so the eye of
a moth looks good but I cant show them the whole moth. That's why a dust mite
is attractive because I can get the whole thing on the screen at once,
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Yes I have the same problem - people wanting pictures of things that
really don't warrant the use of an SEM.
Butterfly wings then zooming in on the intricate structure of an
individual scale always captures the attention. Cabbage White
butterflies have interesting grape-like structures (@ ca. 20k) hanging
from the bars of the scale. Don't know for sure what they are but
believe them to be pigment granules. Also if you brush off a few scales
first you can additionally show their attachment site and stalks to the
wing membrane.
<p>
For a whole mount, garden ants are good especially if you can arrange
them in a confrontational position, jaws open etc. Kill them with ether
and they remain relaxed for some while enabling arrangement of legs etc.
They dry easily from air without any need for special drying techniques.
<p>
Hope this has been of some help. I'll contact you shortly when I find
some mites.
<p>
Late news update. I've found 16 mites which I have now bumped off. as
you are not set up for CPD and I will need to do a run within the next
week or so I'll do them for you. Hope you're prepared for their small
size (ca 300um). Recommend you use an eyelash attached to a cocktail
stick to handle them whilst mounting on a stub. I'll also include a
Large White (Pieris brassicae) butterfly when I send the mites.

<B>Mind over matter for sex change fish</B><BR>

<P>Dr John Godwin of North Carolina State University has carried
out experiments that show that the expression of gender specific
behaviour in the blueheaded wrasse (a species of Coral reef
fish) seems to be directly related to the amount of a hormone
called<B> arginine vasotocin </B>(AVT), which is produced in the
animal's brain. His studies seem to suggest that aggressive
behaviour in males normally thought to be controlled by sex
hormones can occur in animals that lack testes.</P>



<P>Blueheaded wrasse are ideal subjects for studies of this type as
they are <B> diandric protogynous hermaphrodites</B>, in other words
they can rapidly change sex in response to changes in
environmental conditions. This means, for example,  that a  fish
which started life as an egg producing female can transform into
a sperm producing aggressive supermale.
</P>


<P>A series of experiments has been carried out by Dr John Goodwin
with colleagues from the University of Texas, University of
California and Arizona State University West. One of studies
involved the removal of all the supermales from a colony of
wrasse on a reef in the Virgin Islands, so leaving the largest
females as the dominant fish. Within hours the dominant females
began to exhibit supermale  behaviour - i.e. defending
territories, aggressiveness and courting of the other females.
Within a week their ovaries had changed into fully functional
sperm producing testes.</P>


<P>In addition to removing the supermales, the ovaries from some of
the females were removed before returning them to the colony. It
was found that even these females exhibited full dominant
behaviour, but did not produce testes or the supermales'
distinctive coloration.
</P>


<P>It has been found that the sexes produce different amounts of
AVT, and when the wrasse changes sex, its levels of AVT seem to
change accordingly. The females were found to produce about half
the AVT of ordinary males and roughly one third to a quarter of
that produced by supermales - suggesting that the gender
specific behaviour was linked to AVT levels in the brain.When scientists investigated the levels of AVT in the females
that had changed to males they found that they had risen to
supermale levels.</P>
<P> Scientists have yet to decide whether the rise in AVT causes the
behavioural sex change or whether it is a result of it.

<strong>Deadly Virus on the loose</strong><br>

<P>The United Press International reports that the Ohio Department
of Health

are keeping a close eye on the spreading a deadly virus which
can cause

chronic breathing problems and is fatal in nearly 50% of
cases. The carriers of the disease, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, are rodents. Transmission of the disease is via dust
from  infected rodents' urine, droppings and saliva. 

</P>

<P>Although, there is no evidence that this potentially fatal agent
has infiltrated Ohio, no chances are being taken, health
officials have checked hundreds of rats and rodents in 15
counties to ensure they are not carriers. As a further measure,
the disease has been placed on the state's list of  reportable
diseases that must be reported to the health department within
24 hours.

<strong>New Breed of Optical Microscopes breakthrough!</strong><br>

<P>It is well known that the resolving power of optical microscopes is 

restricted by the wavelength of light. Obtaining images greater than

1500x magnification results in larger pictures but not better detail,

leaving exploration of the microscopic world at greater resolution, 

up to the pioneers using scanning electron microscopes. </P>



<P>But now, thanks to IBM, a new breed of optical microscopes have come

into being which out-perform <strong>all</strong> previous instruments:

<em>SIAM  (Scanning Interferometric Apertureless Microscope).</em></P>



<P>This new optical microscope is capable of seeing objects 500 times 

smaller than previously possible with conventional optical microscopes.

It provides an unprecedented 1 nanometer (nm) resolution, which is about

five times larger than an individual atom, with the potential to image

single atoms in visible light.</P>



<P>Scientists are now able to view images much smaller than the wavelength

of light and approaching the atomic level, an achievement considered 

impossible according to the basic principles of traditional optics.</P>



<P>Don't believe me..? 

<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/research/press/optical.html">Then take a 

look for yourself!</a></P>

<A NAME="seadrugs"></A> 

<strong>Prescriptions from the sea?</strong><br>

<P>Marine scientists are looking to algae, sponges and other
organisms as producers of a wide variety of potentially valuable
and useful pharmaceutical chemicals.  It has been estimated that the 10,000
marine organisms that have been identified make up only a very
small proportion of the total, so the potential for such
chemicals is enormous.</P>



<P>The combination of predators, salinity and high pressure in
the environment  has resulted in the evolution of marine
organisms that can produce a cocktail of chemicals for self
defence. Many of these compounds are thought to be unique,
produced no where else on earth.</P>



<P>Chemicals already isolated include compounds called
<I>topsentins </I>which may be effective against arthritis and
<I>discodermolide </I>that works in the treatment of breast and ovarian
cancer. Another, <I>ecteinascidia, </I>from the invertebrate animal,
the sea squirt had been found in clinical trials to kill the
most lethal form of skin cancer - melanoma.</P>

 

<P>However, for all the promise of these life saving marine
derived drugs, there is a worrying side effect. To produce one
gram of ecteinascidia requires one tonne of sea squirts. The
harvesting of marine life for pharmaceutical drug production is
going to put huge demands on the extremely delicately balanced
marine ecology. In addition, the search for new marine derived
chemicals is an expensive and chancy operation. Once found, the
drugs may be ten years in development and during this time
equally effective drugs may be produced or unwanted side effects
identified.</P>

</P> <A NAME="mothflight"></A><Strong> Moth flight  <I>does </I>obey the laws of  physics 
</Strong></P>
<P>Bees and moths have confounded aerodynamic experts by their
ability to fly.  The laws of physics suggest that the wings of
moths are too frail to generate enough lift to get the animal
off the ground.</P>

<P> By using a robotic hawkmoth model, researchers
at Cambridge University have been able to elucidate that the
extra lift is generated during each downstroke by a spiral
vortex that travels across the leading edge of the wing from
base to tip. This effect had been missed previously as wind
tunnel studies of insect flight have viewed the insect from the
side.</P>

<P>Jellyfish employing a unique fluorescent chemical to deter predators are now

being considered as a secret new weapon in humankind's battle against

cancer. A cancer research team at Cambridge work in darkened laboratories  

using the dye to inject into human cells. It is helping them to understand 

how proteins move when the cell divides - an important mechanism because it 

is 'uncontrolled' cell divison that leads to cancer.</P>



<P>Professor Gorden McVie is reported as saying: "It is fascinating to think 

that jellyfish, which appeared in the sea 700 million years ago, are 

offering a modern-day solution to one of science's greatest mysteries. This 

is yet another example of nature lending a helping hand."

<A NAME="elephantman"></A> 

<strong>Elephant man - a new diagnosis</strong><br>

<P>New X ray studies of Joseph Merrick (the nineteenth century
"Elephant man") made by Anita Sharma and colleagues at the Royal
London hospital suggest that he did not suffer from
neurofibromatosis as once thought, but from a much rarer disease
- Proteus syndrome.</P>



<P>Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disease which causes the
uncontrolled growth of nerve cells. Such growth results in
tumours developing beneath the skin surface. In contrast,
Proteus disease results in abnormal growth of bone and soft
tissue. Sharma states that Merrick's skeleton, which is kept at
the Royal London hospital, is studded with many bony outgrowths,
apparently typical of the disease. In addition, Merrick's ribs
lack the notches and thickening common in neurofibromatosis.</P>


<P>The gene for neurofibromatosis was isolated in 1990 by American
scientists. Sharma suggests that one way of confirming her
diagnosis is to conduct DNA tests on some bone tissue to
determine whether or not the gene is present.</P>

<A NAME="hedges"</A>
<Strong>Hedging one's bets on the future of England's 

countryside</Strong>



<P>Never before has the rural countryside of England and the Natural Life it 

supports been under such threat. Year on year, new roads cut through 

tranquil spots and deliver the kiss of death. Slowly, like a sinister, 

creeping, plague, advertising hoardings, roadside vending ventures, and 

the ever-growing throng of urban siteseers invade the oldest monuments 

in the remotest of places.</P>

<P>And now a new threat!</P>


<P>Over 40,000 miles of English country hedgerows, which for centuries have 

been strictly protected by Parliamentary Enclosure Acts, could see 

themselves whittled away over the next few decades. Ex-teacher, Colin 

Seymour, is fighting to save 56 yards of ancient hawthorne hedge in East 

Yorkshire, which to some, may seem a trivial battle. Unfortunately, it is a 

Crown court case, which - if lost - could bring about a change in the laws 

protecting the living network of adjoining hedgerows which divide and abound

the thousands of fields seen in the country; a network which provides 

natural home and shelter to a diverse range of wild life.
</P>

<P>This small section is threatened by the desire of some local villagers of 

Flamborough, less concerned with these issues, to build a bowling green. Mr. 

Seymour has taken on the council in an effort to preserve not just 56 years 

of hedge, but the future of at least one important aspect of the English 

countryside.</P>

<strong>A tooth for an eye</strong><br>


<P>Using techniques pioneered by  Professor Giancarlo
Falcinellu, surgeons in Britain are hoping to restore a blind
man's sight, using a tooth. If successful, this operation could
offer hope to those patients who are not suitable for corneal
transplants.</P>

<P>A single-rooted tooth,  removed together with a wedge of bone,
is sanded down to a rectangular shape and drilled. A plastic
lens is then placed in the 4mm diameter hole. This section is
then grafted into the patient's cheek. At the same time, tissue
from the skin inside the cheek is grafted onto the patient's
eye. After two months the section will have sufficient tissue
growing on it to allow surgeons to remove it and stitch  it into
the cheek skin graft on the eye. Finally, a coloured contact
lens will be placed over the tooth section to disguise it.</P>

<P>The success rate of the 180 such operations carried out in Italy
has been high,  with many patients being able to read again with
glasses.</P>

<b>Natural History Courses in Britain for 1997</b><br>

<P>The Field Studies Council (FSC) offer a wide range of weekend and week-

long residential courses throughout Britain in a relaxed and very

friendly atmosphere. These are based in Field Centres sited in some of

Britain's finest countryside.</P>



<P>The FSC's latest catalogue of courses for 1997 is now available from the

address below. Almost every branch of natural history is covered

including plants, birds, mammals, pond and stream dipping as well as

courses on art, local history, archaeology, crafts etc. Many of the

courses cater for the novice and family as well as for the more

experienced and are led by experienced tutors.</P>



<P>Even if you are not UK based but were planning a stay in the UK, a

weekend course could be an ideal way of learning about Britain's nature

as well as seeing some of its best countryside.</P>



<P>Warning: if the author's experiences are anything to go by these courses

are highly addictive!! </P>

<P> Yup, we know you teachers out there (and you students) are
under stress and duress. Some of our best friends are teachers
and they are telling us how it is! </P> 

<P> So we thought we would try and help a little bit. We asked
our friends at  Brunel Microscopes if they could put together a
video and a set of lectures covering all aspects of human
biology and boy did they come up with a real treat. </P> 



<P> We thought it was so good, that we decided to open a
complete new section to offer real lectures on chosen themes
from our pages both here and in the states. The first of these
is available now from our main index as: THE BRUNEL LECTURES.
The lecture topic will change-out periodically and if you have a
specific theme you would like us to cover then please  <A

<STRONG>MICROSCOPISTS AS WELL AS MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN  GO OUT IN THE MIDDAY
SUN</STRONG> and are often unaware that one of the most dangerous consequences is skin
cancer now affecting 40,000 new sufferers every year in the UK with a
high risk of death especially amongst the 4,000 who develop malignant
melanoma. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund has launched a campaign to
make everyone aware "When it's hot use your Block". They are marketing a

<STRONG>MAGNIFICATION...??????</STRONG> wow !!  IBM have taken the biscuit with their new
scanning interferometric apertureless microscope (SIAM) which can see
objects which are actually 500 times smaller than those previously
possible to see with a microscope. It is claimed they may be able to
see individual atoms in visible light !  With a resolution of 1nm it has
a tremendous potential in fields such as genetics, particularly the
Genome project.<P>

<STRONG>PITY THE POOR CRAYFISH</STRONG> Britain's native Crayfish (the white-clawed
crayfish) is under threat from the predatory American Signal Crayfish
which was imported for farming in the mid 70's and is now spreading
nationwide. Many areas have now been declared "NO go" for these beasts
and licences are required to keep them. Details of the Regulations from
the Fisheries Departments as well as advice on keeping the animals secure
lest they wander in the night ! Biologists can help by accurate
observation and record keeping.<P>

<STRONG>CASH FOR SSSI's </STRONG> (Sites of Special Scientific Interest) has been put up

The <EM>MEDIA</EM> comes to the World Wide Web! Science Magazines and Television Programs have come to the Web and brought with them their amazing abilities to teach science in a fascinating way. Here are a few of the <EM>MEDIA</EM> Science Web Sites I discovered.

First, there is "<A HREF="http://nyelabs.kcts.org/">Bill Nye, the Science Guy</A>." Bill Nye is a little <I>layed-back</I> in his approach to science, but is <EM>very</EM> informative. This Web Site is in no way <I>layed back</I>, however. There are experiments you can do (called "Daily Demos"), Quicktime movies you can download and just loads of other activities. The Web Site closely parallels the television science program and is definitely worth checking out, especially if you can't watch the TV show in your area. <I>("Bill Nye, the Science Guy" &copy 1996 KCTS Television)</I>

Natural History, Museum, London October 5th 1996</strong><P></B></FONT>
 
<FONT SIZE=4>a report by Maurice Smith, Microscopy UK Editor</CENTER><P>

October 5th this year of 1996 (today, at the time of writing), The Quekett 
Microscopical Club (QMC) held its Annual Exhibition at The Natural History Museum in 
S. Kensington, London, England. I went along to enjoy the day, as a club 
member, and to represent Microscopy-UK in our friendly relationship with the 
Club itself. And of course ... to see some old friends who help contribute 
towards our pages.
<p>
All the old favourites were there showing a diverse range of microscopical 
equipment, specimens, techniques, and knowhow. Eric Marson of Northern 
Biological Supplies had a good position in one corner of the exhibition room, 
and it was good to see one of his booklets (Practical Microscopy) available 
on his table. I personally think this bright yellow covered work, spanning 
years of experience and personal learning is a 'must' for any one new 
entering into Amateur Microscopy. In a hall filled with many experts, new 
technology and old historical instruments, it pleased me greatly to see a work 
of this nature which so adequately caters for the newcomer and novice, 
available at a low price. (Editor's note: available at address below).
<p>
Several commercial tables were set up offering a range of second-hand Olympus 
and Biolam Microscopes. These instruments were in good condition and I really 
fancied one of the stereo microscopes on offer for around 450.00 pounds. It 
is unfortunate though that the prices for these instruments seemed to be a 
bit dearer than their normal cost and I believe instruments of similar 
quality and make can be purchased (normally by way of another amateur selling 
 one) at much cheaper prices. A good example of over-pricing was the McArthur 
ex-Open University microscope which was, if  I remember correctly, on sale 
for around 25 pounds but can be purchased via contacts within the Club for 
about half this price. I guess the small busineses need to charge certain 
amounts to stay in business, and amateur microscopists need a source of 
supply, but when you are in a club - most items seem available from somewhere 
within the membership much cheaper just by asking around.
<p>
The cosy tea-room adjacent to the main hall was buzzing with gossip and 
activity and, as I fancied a cup of tea and a sandwich, I settled down in 
there for half-an-hour to have a break. I spent some time watching the 
excellent slideshow, and video films by Ken Jones which formed a central 
feature of interest for anyone in the tea-room not engaged in rapid 
conversation. Ken has contributed some of his fine work to our movies section 
here on Microscopy-UK and it was an ideal opportunity to discuss the 
possibility of future contributions.
<p>
Several friends of Microscopy-UK were spotted and our very own Frank Rowntree 
were all prominent and engaged in conversation.
<p>
Back in the main exhibition hall, I realised  a slight difference in the 
overall 'feel' and atmosphere of the proceedings compared to previous years'
events. It took me a moment, standing back and musing, to realise what it 
was: of course, it was the increased presence in the room of modern 
technology. Video cameras, PCs, monitors, and image-grabbers were included as 
part of the process of presentation on several tables... and yes... there, 
alone, a single PC stood with a notice before it which said: 'Live Internet 
Connection!'
<p>
Impressed and pleased, I went over to take a look. Sure enough, I was 
witnessing a first. Here, on display, in this oldest of Amateur Microscopy 
clubs in the UK was the 'new world' of information-sharing with live links 
right into our very own site here at Microscopy-UK where the QMC pages are 
maintained by our small team as part of our contribution to the Amateur World 
of Microscopy. Well done QMC for this history-making moment. And a slap on 
the back to all the crew here at Microscopy-UK for helping to make this 
happen. It's fantastic what can be achieved with friendly co-operation, 
unselfish help, and sharing of different skills.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Our aim</FONT>: it's usually the large professional sites that steal the honours for the well-known Web site awards. So the Microscopy UK amateurs thought we would redress the balance. We seek out Web sites that have been put together by individuals and groups for the sheer love of their subject, and an enthusiasm to share their interest. It could be, for example, an individual's Home Pages or students putting an educational site together in their spare time.

<BR>
We were particularly impressed with the site run by Ari Kornfeld because it seeks to encourage people to enjoy the beauty of nature as well as learn about the scientific aspects of it ... an aim we share at Microscopy UK. The site is beautifully presented and illustrated. It  describes and illustrates plant and animal groups and provides a gentle introduction to how they are grouped taxonomically. You can learn about particular species or taxonomic groups and the microscopic creatures are mentioned as well.
Well done Ari! <P>

<CENTER><H3>LINKS TO THE HOTTEST WEB SITES?<BR> The evidence that primitive life may have once existed on Mars</H3>Updated August 16th 1996</CENTER>

As a special supplement in the August Edition of Micscape magazine we provide a selection of Web sites providing reports of studies that primitive life may have once existed on Mars. This evidence is based on detailed studies of part of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica. Our <A HREF="../../mag/news.html#alien"> 'News'</A> item gives a brief synopsis of the discovery.<P>

The news broke just as the Micscape magazine was going to press, so this is just a selection of the no doubt many Web sites providing information on various aspects of this discovery.<P>

<STRONG>Images</STRONG><P>
Two images from the NASA site to whet your appetite are shown below. NASA state that 'no copyright is asserted for NASA photos', and therefore we reproduce them here with grateful thanks. Both images are significantly reduced and slightly brighter, but otherwise unretouched, images from the NASA site below. Please visit their site to view larger higher resolution images with more detailed descriptions of them. The image notes are by the Micscape Editor based on the NASA site's notes, and any inaccuracies are his!<P>

<IMG SRC="../../mag/images/mars1.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left>
This is the 4.5 billion year old rock found in Antarctica in 1984 which was once believed to be part of a meteorite dislodged from Mars. Detailed studies of this rock have provided evidence that primitive life may have existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. The black cube is 1cm across.<P>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="../../mag/images/mars2.jpg" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right>
This is an electron microscope picture of a small part of the rock showing tube-like structures. The exact nature of these structures is unknown, but a possible interpretation is that they may be microscopic fossils of primitive organisms that may have lived on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.  The largest possible fossils are less than one-hundredth the diameter of a human hair, but most are ten times smaller. Note that there were no scale bars on the original image.<P><BR><BR><BR>

<STRONG>Web sites to visit</STRONG><P>
We now provide links to these sites, but if access is difficult due to demand, we suggest that you make a note of their addresses and access them at a quiet 'Web period' for the US. The author had no problem at all accessing them and downloading large images in the UK at Saturday 10am local time when the US was asleep.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.newscientist.com"><STRONG>New Scientist: Planet Science</STRONG></A><P>




<STRONG>Not convinced?</STRONG><BR>
The conclusions of the studies above are understandably presented by the scientists in cautious tones.
A discovery of this magnitude is bound to stimulate discussion of the observations, interpretation and conclusions of the above studies on the meteorite.<BR>
Follow the debate in the Newsgroups such as sci.bio.microbiology , bionet.general , sci.astro , sci.space.science ,  sci.techniques.microscopy and others.<BR>
Micscape will endeavour to extend the Web resources listed above to include sites where the points raised in these debates and other scientific work on the meteorite is presented.<P>

As a start check out   <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.fas.org/mars/">Mars</A></STRONG>   which has links to other work on the meteorite which does not support, but neither does it contradict, that of the NASA team.<P>

<h3>The history of the microscope, a penny for your thoughts (magnification), the book 'Freshwater Algae' and seeing algae with ink!</h3></CENTER>
<hr>

<H3><STRONG>Events in the history of the microscope</STRONG></H3>
It has been known for over 2000 years that glass bends light, but 
the first accurate lenses were not made until about the year 1300. 
Around 1600, it was discovered that optical instruments could be made by 
combining lenses.

<p>

Antony van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch draper and scientist, and one of the 
pioneers of microscopy in the
late 17th century. He made his own simple microscopes which had a single 
lens and were hand-held. He
made many drawings of what he saw and is thought to have discovered 
bacteria, although he didn't know
what they were.

<p>

In the mid 17th century, Robert Hooke drew pictures of cork seen through 
his microscope. Like
Leeuwenhoek, he did not know exactly what he had seen.<p>

All the early microscopists saw quite distorted images due to the low 
quality of the glass and imperfect
shape of their lenses. Lenses improved a lot through the 19th century, 
and the microscope as we know it was
gradually developed.<p>

In 1933, the first electron microscope was built.<p>

Some dates:<p>

1608 Credit for the invention of the microscope given to Zacharias 
Jansen<p>

1611 Kepler suggests simple microsope<p>

I have been mesmerised by the beauty of the photographs in a new book 
recently. The book is called 'Freshwater Algae: their microscopic world 
explored' and is by Hilda Canter-Lund and John W G Lund, with the 
division of labours being photographs and text respectively.<P>

The standard of images throughout the whole book is superb. I choose the 
word 'images' here quite
consciously because in most cases the photographs are more than just 
well exposed records of the
specimens, but rather display fully the true beauty of the algae. One 
technique that is used extensively to
great effect is that of mounting the specimens in Indian ink to show the 
presence of mucilage which
otherwise would have remained invisible. However, I think this technique 
has more to offer than that
explanation would confer.<P> Over the last week or so I have slashed the 
ink around quite liberally (too much
on occasion!) and I would fully recommend people to try it with their 
pond water samples, it is amazing
how much algae it shows up. I find that mounting the sample as usual 
first is best, and then irrigate with ink
by using blotting paper or tissue to draw the ink across. By using this 
method it is more likely that the right
density of ink and therefore degree of opacity can be achieved. You may 
end up with messy slides but it
certainly adds another dimension. Shortly I will put some images onto 
the site showing some of the effects.<p>

follows;<p>

<CENTER><H2>REFRACTIVE  INDEX  -  A  NOTE  FOR  THE  BEGINNER</H2> 
<h3>by  Roy  
Winsby<P>
</h3></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4>I thought a note on Refractive Index (often stated as R.I.) would 
not be out of place here for the newcomer to microscopy who might not 
understand the meaning of the term, which is a measurement of the 
deflection of light leaving one medium, say air, and entering another 
medium of a different density, say water, at an angle.<P>  The simple 
example usually given in books is that of a stick put into clear water, 
the stick appearing to have entered the water at a different angle to 
the part still held in the air. It is the light illuminating the stick 
which has been bent and this always happens to light when it enters or 
leaves a different medium at an oblique angle. <P> The textbook explanation 
is that the R.I. figure is the measurement of the bending of light in a 
particular substance as against that in a vacuum which is designated as 
unity (= 1). All substances are denser than a vacuum, so all R.Is are 
greater than 1.

<p>

 Lens manufacturers have to take account of R.Is in selecting glass for 
their lenses. We
microscopists have to take account as regards the mounting medium for 
different types of specimens
because the greater the difference between the respective R.Is of the 
specimen and the mountant used to
affix it to the slide, the greater will be the contrast and thus the 
better the image when that slide is examined
under the microscope. <P>The simplest example of this is that cover glasses 
have a R.I. of around 1.518 and
Canada Balsam in Xylene a R.I. of around 1.524. These are quite close 
and if you mount some pieces of
broken cover glass in Balsam and observe it under the microscope you 
will hardly see the broken bits of
cover glass, because the light is not refracted or bent. If, however, 
the broken bits of cover glass were
mounted in a medium of low refractive index such as Glycerine Jelly, 
R.I. 1.44, then they would be clearly
visible.<P> Conversely diatoms, have a R.I. of 1.434, and would not be 
visible mounted in Glycerine Jelly and
are best seen under a high refractive index mountant such as Hyrax, R.I. 
1.71 to 1.82.  <A HREF="../../prodir/indexpro.html#otherads"> <STRONG>Northern Biological
Supplies Ltd</STRONG></A> and the stockists of their supplies sell two high 
resolution mountants for mounting diatoms,
Dirax (new; I do not know the R.I. but I guess it will be around the 
same as Hyrax) which does not contain
an inflammable solvent, and Naphrax, solvent toluene, R.I. at least 
1.74.<p>

<H2>MICSCAPE HALL OF FAME<BR>
JOHN BENJAMIN DANCER (1812-1887)<BR>
</H2>
 by Roy Winsby.
</CENTER>
<HR noshade>


<P>
J. B. Dancer, the celebrated Manchester optician and instrument maker, was
born in London, the son of Josiah Dancer, also an optician and manufacturer
of optical, philosophical and nautical instruments.  Josiah and his family
moved from London to Liverpool in 1817.  J.B. took over his father's
business in 1835 but moved to Manchester from Liverpool in 1841 when he was
aged 29 and with a Mr.Abraham set up the business of Abraham & Dancer at 13
Cross Street, Manchester. Assisted by some capable assistants he designed
and made his own instruments and optical equipment.  Abraham left the
partnership after four years and returned to his home city of Liverpool.
<p>
Dancer was an orthodox optician supplying spectacles, as well as being an
inventor and instrument maker of outstanding ability.  At a young age he had
acquired the art of grinding microscope and others types of lenses.  During
his lifetime he made substantial contributions to microscopy, photography
and science.
<p>
Achromatic lenses were greatly improved by Lister in 1824, following
which microscopes with achromatic objectives were produced by such
manufacturers as Andrew Ross, James Smith and Powell & Lealand, though they
were very expensive.  When Dancer moved to Manchester in 1841 he was
surprised to find that there were only two achromatic microscopes in the
city.  He began to produce them more cheaply and supplied achromatic
microscopes to  prominent scientists etc. like Dr.John Dalton, Dr.J.P.Joule,
Joseph Sidebotham, Dr.W.B.Carpenter, and a host of others to replace the
Culpeper and other simple type microscopes they had been using.
<p>
In 1839, when he was still at Liverpool, Dancer pioneered the making of
microphotographs mounted on slides for microscope viewing, but the system he
first used, the Daguerro process, was not satisfactory as the photographs
were on an opaque background and consequently the quality of the enlarged
microphotograph under the microscope was poor and could not be viewed with
magnifications exceeding x20.  In 1851 Frederick Scott Archer of Manchester
introduced the collodion process which involved a very fine grain image on
glass with a sensitised covering of collodion and this process, by which
images in very fine detail could be recorded, was used by Dancer to start
producing vastly improved microphotograph slides and the skill he developed
enabled him to make micrometer scales and graticules.
<p>
For his microphotographs Dancer photographed well known paintings of
landscapes, portraits, etc. down to about 1mm square, the novelty being that
a microscope should be used to see them in larger size.  After he commenced
making them the idea caught the public interest and several firms set up to
produce and market microphotograph slides in large numbers and it wasn't
long before rings and other jewellery became fashionable with the
microphotograph mounted beneath a small magnifying lens.  Pencils were also
produced with a small lens over a picture at the end.
<p>
Dancer sold some 500 microphotograph slides, many of which were of well
known paintings in art galleries.   Particularly popular were slides of
members of the Victorian Royal Family, of Emperor Napoleon, and of an 1858
20 banknote. These old slides generally bore on their label the initials of
their maker, J.B.D. for John Benjamin Dancer, J.S. or J.H.S. for Joseph
Herbert Sidebotham, and H.W. for Herbert Watkins.  Some old microphotograph
slides bear the initials E.W.H. and it is not known for certain whose name
these initials represent, though it is believed that they represent the name
of W. Hislop.  If you have an old microphoto-graph slide bearing the
initials J.B.D., J.S., H.W. or E.W.H., take care of it, as such slides are
now collector's items.
<p>
During the early 1900's microphotographs became regarded as a money making
novelty, and the public soon tired of the novelty.  Many scientific men
regarded the whole concept as frivolous.  Henry Garnett of Flatters &
Garnett is on record as having said to the Manchester Literary &
Philosophical Society in 1928 "the fashion for microphotographs had largely
died out".  This, however, was at the very time when microphotography for
business purposes was in its infancy and is in fact very much in use today
to fulfil modern day requirements.   Whole volumes of books, manuscripts and
documents all over the world have been microphotographed to save storage
space.  Old census returns, old probate records, etc. available for public
inspection at the various local Records Offices are all on microfilm.
<p>
Anyone who has visited a Records Office to inspect old records will be
familiar with putting a roll of microfilm on the viewing machine. Though
these 35mm reels are hardly "micro" compared to the work that Dancer
initiated, they are nevertheless a direct result of his work.
<p>
To quote Mr. L.L.Ardern, then Librarian of the Manchester College of
Technology, writing about Dancer in 1956, "The librarian looks to Dancer's
invention to help control the problem of library growth caused by the
immense output of recorded information."
<p>
During the Franco-Prussian war in the 1870's when Paris was besieged by
the Germans, the French sent messages on microfilm by carrier pigeon over
the German lines.  By the time of the 1939-1945 war, fine grain film had
been improved to such an extent that it enabled photographs of documents to
be reduced even further so as to be capable of being hidden under a
typewriter size full stop, and these became known as a micro-dot.
<p>
 By the mid 1800's the magic lantern had been invented but illumination was
by oil lamp, very inefficient except in small rooms.  Dancer greatly
improved the illumination but all the items depicted on the slides for the
magic lantern were hand drawn and painted and the magic lantern was looked
upon as a toy.  A few years were to pass before Dancer made the first
photographic positives as lantern slides, and the magic lantern then got
better recognition for the useful aid it proved to be.
<p>
Those who holiday in Spain may have seen the large spectacular coloured
fountain in Barcelona, or its twin on the promenade at Salou, which operate
to their main effectiveness when darkness falls.  Many jets of brightly
coloured water shoot up in the air, being replaced by other jets reaching
different heights, all lit from below by lights constantly changing colours
and controlled by an electrical keyboard which was invented by Dancer in the
1850's.
<p>
He gave many lectures and produced various scientific papers.  One of his
inventions was the stereoscopic camera, a wood camera with brass fittings
and with two lenses set with their centres approx. 3" apart, which he
invented in 1853 and perfected in 1856.  Christies sold one of these at
auction in 1977 for 21,000.  His other accomplishments were wide ranging
and, to mention only a few, included improvements in the construction of
Daniell liquid type batteries, the spring make and break contact used in
electrical apparatus, the electro magnet, electric shock machine,
experiments with ozone gas, the photographic micrometer, instruments for
measuring the accuracy of rifle barrels, astronomical, meteorological,
surveying  and other instruments for many leading scientists including his
friend Dr.J.P.Joule, whose name was given to the joule, the standard
international unit of energy.  Look on a Kelloggs' Cornflakes packet and you
will see "Energy 1650 kJ" (kilojoules).
<p>
In 1870, when he was only 58 years of age, he started to suffer from the
eye disease Glaucoma and his eyesight began to fail.  In the following few
years he had three eye operations but they did not help him very much and by
1878 he had to give up his business activities because of ill health and
poor vision.  He lived another nine years until he was aged 75 and it was a
most cruel turn of fate that decreed that so active and gifted a man as J.B.
Dancer should spend his last years blind and in comparative obscurity.
<p>
Dancer had taught his two daughters, Eleanor Elizabeth and Catherine,
the process of making microphotographs and they took over the running of the
business, trading under the name of E.E.Dancer & Co. for some 25 years until
1900 when the entire stock and the process of producing quality
microphotographs were sold to a Mr. Richard Suter, a London microscope
dealer.
<p>
About 1885 Dancer dictated his autobiography to his 16 years old
granddaughter, Elizabeth, who wrote out the dictated autobio-graphy in a
school exercise book, devoid of any punctuation and with very few headings. 
For over 70 years the manuscript was never published and whilst there was a
record of it having been made, in microscopical and photographic societies
it had been thought that it had been lost over the years.  It was only by a
very remote chance that the manuscript came to light in 1958 because of the
Manchester Microscopical Society displaying exhibits of Dancer
microphotographs, slides and instruments at one of the Society's public
exhibitions.  The exhibition was mentioned on the radio and was heard by
Miss E.C. Wilkie, the daughter of Elizabeth.  Miss Wilkie attended the
exhibition being held in honour of her great-grandfather, and she mentioned
that she had the original manuscript.  With her assistance, one of the
Society's members, Mr.W.Browning, arranged for the manuscript to be
published by the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in Vol.107 of
their Manchester Memoirs (unaltered except for the addition of punctuation
and sub-headings), together with a selection of letters written to Dancer by
some of his well known scientific correspondents and friends.
<p>
Two years later in 1960, over 70 years after Dancer's death, the National
Microfilm Association of U.S.A. presented its Dancer Pioneer Medal to Miss
Wilkie, with the undermentioned citation -
<p>
To John Benjamin Dancer, a man of strong character and immense energy;
alert and practical, a skilled craftsman and manipulator; sympathetic, ever
ready to help the youthful searcher, inventor of microphotography, the
National Microfilm Association is proud to present this posthumous Medal of
Meritorious Service to the microfilm industry.

<title>MICROSCOPY UK / MICSCAPE - THE MICROPHOTOGRAPH SLIDES OF JOHN B. DANCER AND RICHARD SUTER</title>

<CENTER><h3>THE MICROPHOTOGRAPH SLIDES OF<BR> JOHN B.DANCER AND RICHARD SUTER<BR>by Roy 
Winsby</h3></CENTER>

<p>
<CENTER><EM>An article which was first published in the Manchester Microscopical Society's Newsletter No. 26, August 1993</EM></CENTER>

<p>
<hr>
 <p>
The story of John B. Dancer, 1812-1887, Manchester optician and 
instrument maker, who pioneered the making of microphotographs mounted 
on slides for viewing through the microscope, was the subject of an article in the Society's Newsletter No. 15, January 
1990.

<p>

 Dancer sold over 500 different microphotograph slides and many 
microscopists have one or
more of these. If you have any microphotograph slides by any of the old 
mounters, take good care of them
as they are collectors items. Old microphotograph slides in good 
condition bearing a label with the name or
initials of J.B.Dancer, Richard Suter, W.Hislop,  J.H.Sidebotham, 
Herbert Watkins and others command a
price of around 20 to 25 each. Often J.H.Sidebotham used the initials 
J.S. on his labels.<p>

 Many microphotograph slides abound without a mounters name or 
initials, or even without a
label, and here identification can be difficult. Some mounters in 
Victorian days favoured covering the top
surface of the slide with decoratively bordered green paper, the centre 
circle cut out for the mount. If you
have one of these turn the slide over because mounters sometimes put 
their initials on the underside of the
green paper. Sometimes green paper was also put on the underside of the 
slide, in which case you will need
to hold the slide up to the light to see if any initials are written on 
the reverse of the top piece of green paper.<p>

 Generally Dancers slides are identifiable by the initials J.B.D. in 
the bottom right hand
corner of his labels. Mr. Arthur Barron sent me a photocopy of a slide 
with the label PHOTOGRAPH, 1st
of May 1851, The Birthday Present, unnumbered, with the usual initials 
J.B.D. On this right hand side of
this slide, however, there is an fancy label, J.B.DANCER, Optician, 
MANCHESTER, the word Optician
being in Old English type text. Mr. Barron said he can recall seeing only 
one other example of one of these
fancy labels. The date of 1st May 1851 mentioned is the date of the 
photograph, not of the slide. Dancer did
not commence making microphotograph slides in quantity until 1852 
following Scott Archer having
invented the collodion process in 1851, though he had experimented with 
them as early as 1839 using the
daguerreotype process but as this produced an opaque background 
unsuitable for microscopic viewing he
did not proceed with it at the time.<p>

 I have two microphotograph slides, one a Dancer No.16 with printed 
label The Departure,
Second Class of a painting by A. Solomon. The other, no name, 
hand-written label, 1,000 bank note. The
1,000 note dated 1867 is just like the old large white paper 5 note we 
used to know some 30 or 40 years
ago except for the 1,000. Even only 40 years ago if you took one of the 
large white 5 notes into a shop
they were likely to ask you to write your name and address on the back. 
Only the other day I saw in my
local newsagents a notice saying This shop does not change 50 notes. 
Presumably over 100 years ago
1,000 notes were used for overseas trade and currency transactions. I 
do not know what the current
inflation figure is for an 1867 1,000 but I would guess it to be well 
in excess of 50,000. Actually 1,000
notes were not rare and were in fact in use until 1943. W.Hislop 
produced a microphotograph slide of a
1858 20 note.<p>
 Dancer did not have any mass production method for turning out his 
micro-photograph slides
and though it must have been very time consuming he is reported as 
having made many thousands. The
method employed was explained by Mr.J.F.Stirling writing in Watsons 
Microscope Record No.45,
Oct.1938, p.16. A glass negative of the photograph to be reduced was 
placed in a lantern illuminated by a
flame. The image of the photograph was projected through a microscope 
objective mounted horizontally on
to the sensitised collodion film supported on a glass sheet. Dancer 
speeded up production slightly by
duplicating the contraption with two lanterns placed back to back with 
one illuminating flame in the space
between the two lanterns, the whole assembly being covered over with a 
canvas tent to keep out the light.
The exceedingly small piece of collodion film containing the positive 
microphotograph image was mounted
in balsam beneath a cover glass on a standard 3 x 1 slide.<p>

 In her recently issued booklet Scientific Instrument Making in 
Manchester, 1790-1870,
Mrs. Jenny Wetton, Curator of Science at the Museum of Science and 
Industry, Manchester, states that by
1871 Dancer was employing eight men and about four apprentices. He is 
therefore likely to have delegated
the tedious making of microphotographs to one of his employees.<p>

 There is an old wives saying that misfortune often comes in threes, 
and for Dancer it did. It
was tragic for a man so gifted and full of life to lose his sight. He 
started to suffer from Glaucoma when he
was only 58, and eight years later in 1878 because of failing sight 
coupled with business and family worries
resulting in the decline of the business due to competition from other 
microscope makers, and a
corresponding lessening demand for his products, he had to give up his 
work in the business.  He lived
another nine years until he was 75 in blindness, obscurity and near 
poverty. Yet one of the Dancer
stereoscopic cameras made around 1856 was sold at Christies for 21,000 
in 1977. However, he had taught
his two daughters, Eleanor Elizabeth and Catherine, the process of 
making microphotograph slides and they
continued the microphotograph side of the business under the name of 
E.E.Dancer &amp; Co. I do not know
what happened to Catherine but the daughters produced slides under the 
label of E.E. and A.M. Dancer, the
A.M. presumably being Dancers third daughter, Anna Marie.<p>

 Though Dancer had known such men of genius as James P.Joule, Sir David 
Brewster, Charles
Darwin, Faraday, Dr.W.B.Carpenter, Revd.Dr.W.H.Dallinger, William 
Sturgeon, James Nasmyth,
A.S.Herschel and others, few men of prominence kept in touch with him 
during his forced and lonely
retirement of privation. After his death Dancer was forgotten for some 
40 years but following Henry
Garnetts paper read before the members of the Manchester Literary &amp; 
Philosophical Society various
articles have since been written about him.<p>

 In 1896 Dancers daughters sold the entire stock of microphotograph 
slides and the negatives
from which they had been made, as well as the instruction of making 
quality microphotograph slides, to
Richard Suter, a well known London microscope dealer and slide mounter 
for the sum of 50.<p>

 The English Mechanic, in its issue of 7th July 1882, carried an 
advertisement by E.&amp;
A.Dancer &amp; Co. offering a list of 350 microphotograph slides for 
sale. This was only four years after
Dancers daughters took over the business from their father and until a 
few days ago I was not aware of
anyone who has actually seen any slides bearing their label and had 
begun to wonder if they were in fact
still selling their fathers slides rather than producing any slides 
themselves. The circulation of these
Newsletters is approaching 200 copies per issue but the note at the end 
of the previous Newsletter, No. 25,
that Dr.McCormick of Chicago is interested in purchasing or borrowing 
any such slides did not produce one
response.<p>

 Richard Suter died on the 3rd May 1959 and, like Dancer, he died in 
blindness, though he
was aged 95 when he died. After his death Suters sister, Mrs. Pierce, 
handed over to Mr.Barron the
collection of negatives from which Dancer had made his positive 
microphotograph slides. The negatives
were mostly on 4 x 5 glass plates and had been in Suters attic for 
around 60 years, with the result that
they were covered with layers of accumulated dirt and soot. Mr. Barron 
cleaned the negatives with jets of
compressed air in order not to damage the collodion coatings. In his 
article On J.B.Dancer and the<p>
discovery of his Microphotographic Negatives which appeared in The 
Microscope, 1960, Vol.12, pp
234-238, Mr.Barron states that Mrs.Pierce had told him that her brother 
had never made use of the
negatives. It appears therefore that Suter acquired a stock of finished 
slides in the purchase from Dancers
daughters and had applied his own labels to them.<p>

 Amongst the slides listed in Suters first catalogue dated 1900 are the 
following -<p>

<p>

No.406. Emperor and Empress of Russia, crowned May 27th 1883.<p>

<p>

No.455. Jubilee photograph of Her Majesty the Queen.<p>

<p>

No.462. The Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Manchester.<p>

<p>

 As 1887 was the year of Queen Victoria's Jubilee, the year that Dancer 
died, and in any case
his last 10 years were spent with failing vision, this was my first 
confirmation that Dancer's daughters had
produced any micro-photograph slides themselves.<p>

 Much information is unrecorded or, if it is recorded, is not always to 
be found very readily,
and often as people die off much information gets lost forever. It is 
surprising what some of us know to
which we attach little importance but which will be lost when we die. 
Even if such information is already
recorded it will no doubt be in a place where most of us are not aware 
of how to get at it, so if you have any
information, no matter how little, please put your pen to paper.<p>

 Member Mr.G.W.Lee of London kindly provided me with a printed copy of a 
catalogue
issued by Suter and dated 1900. Originally it had 24 pages, though the 
front cover with page 2 on the
reverse was missing. Mr.Barron kindly let me have a photocopy of the 
front cover, which states that page 2
contained testimonials, though he had not photocopied page 2 when a copy 
of the catalogue was loaned to
him many years before. However, the fact that page 2 is missing is not 
of much detriment, particularly as the
listing of slides does not commence until page 4.<p>

 The line printed at the start of the listing of the microphotograph 
slides on page 4 of the
catalogue that Mr. R. Suter is now the only preparer of Micro-
Photographs is open to question for two
reasons. The first is that he does not appear to have produced any 
microphotograph slides himself other than
affixing his own labels on to the stock of slides he had bought from 
Dancers daughters. The second is
whether J.H.Sidebotham, Herbert Watkins, W.Hislop or any of the other 
microphotograph slide mounters
were alive at the time.<p>

 Although he appears to have simply sold off the stock of Dancer slides, 
Suter did not take
over Dancers numbering altogether. Whereas my Dancer slide mentioned 
above of a painting called The
Departure, Second Class, painted by A. Solomon bears the initials 
J.B.D. and is numbered 16,
microphotograph slide No.16 in Suters list is of Fountains Abbey. 
Suters No. 58 is The Departure,
Second Class, by A. Solomon.<p>

 However, just before going to press with this Newsletter, Mr. Barron 
sent me a photocopy of a
slide he had only recently come across with the label on the right hand 
side stating MICRO-
PHOTOGRAPHS of Views, Portraits, Printing, &amp;c. Prepared by E.E.&amp; 
A.M.DANCER, 436 Stockport
Road, Manchester, which he says is the only daughter label he has 
seen. Unless many more daughter
slides are going to materialise after the publication of this 
Newsletter, because of the scarcity factor the value of this slide as a 
collectors item must be well in excess of the 20-25 I mentioned 
earlier in this
article for ordinary good condition named microphotograph slides.<p>

 What is also of interest about this particular slide is the descriptive 
label on the left hand side
- THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, Contained in the space of an eye of a needle, 
and numbered 400.
J.B.Dancer's slide labels  usually have the initials J.B.D. in the 
bottom right hand corner, though many are
not numbered. Presumably therefore Suter used his own descriptive labels 
in place of those with the initials
J.B.D. In this case, however, because the right hand label contained the 
daughters names, the left hand label
did not have any initials, so Suter would not have to remove it, but in 
this case he kept to the same listing
number, because No. 400 in Suters list is The National Anthem, 
contained in the eye of a needle.<p>

 For its age and the use it has no doubt had, this copy of the Suter 
catalogue is in reasonably
good condition, it understandably coming apart at the centre fold and 
also partly where it has been folded
horizontally. Mr.Lee says it was in this condition when it came into his 
possession in 1973. He says that
after his first perusal and checking of his slides he was almost afraid 
to handle it further. Some repair was
needed but as can be seen by the extract it has photocopied well. The 
last page shows the most wear and
some discoloration, but with the whole being folded horizontally the 
last page was in effect the outer cover.
However, the last page has still made readable photocopies.<p>

 The particular copy though dated 1900 must have been handed out some 
years after that date
because on the top of page 3 is written N.B. All prices in this List 
are cancelled, and signed R.Suter. On
page 4, at the commencement of the list of microphotograph slides, 
Discontinued has been written. The
whole of page 9 listing histological slides is crossed out and marked 
Cancelled. The top half of page 19
listing unmounted microscopic objects has been crossed out and marked 
Cancelled.<p>

 Trade catalogues issued around the turn of the century are often found 
with prices cancelled,
indicating that they survived a number of years, probably into the war 
years of 1914 to 1918 when inflation
will have taken off. Suters catalogue of 1900 probably lasted 10 years 
or longer. The 1900 catalogue was
his first and I am not aware of him having issued a later dated 
catalogue, but please let me know if you have
any information on this.<p>

 Changes in amateur microscopy over the last 70 years or more have been 
relatively minor.
Microscopes have changed from all brass to black and brass, then black 
and chrome, then in grey or light
green enamel. Now some recent Zeiss instruments look very nice in cream 
enamel. Between the two main
wars the tube length changed from 250mm to 160mm but the quality of the 
optics has not changed a great
deal. A 45 mm standard objective has been introduced in the last few 
years, but one cannot see much more
detail with many a modern instrument from that which can be seen with a 
50 years old microscope with
lenses in good condition.<p>

 This was admirably summed up by Mr.I.C.Fitch in writing the obituary on 
our member the
late Stanley Meakin in 1988 when he said that in his 84 years Mr.Meakin 
had seen many remarkable events,
including the replacement of the horse by the motor car, the coming of 
aircraft and the introduction of
electricity to our daily lives, of radio, television, plastics, men 
landing on the moon, but in microscopy he
had seen little improvement in the best that optical microscopy could 
achieve except that the best became
more readily available.<p>

 The things we look at, whether pond life, crystals, etc. have also not 
changed. Where we are
lacking is that many accessories which were made 80 to 100 years ago, 
such as the Travis stop, are no
longer available. Information on many of the old microscopists, of their 
inventions and their slides is not
always easily to be found in books. If you have knowledge of such items 
do please consider writing a note
on them for the Journal or Newsletter of any of the microscopical 
societies.<p>

<EM>As youngsters we have all probably tried to see how small we could write our name or a message to a school-mate. Maybe the quest was pushed to the limit by using the finest pen-nib we could find. But how small can we reproduce text using the techniques scientists have developed over the last century?<P>

This article illustrates the following techniques:<BR>
- 19th century microphotography to display an image of the Lord's Prayer on this sized dot '.'<BR>
- the modern use of microfiche to print the entire Holy Bible on an area little more than the size of a postage stamp<BR>
- using electron beams to 'write' on surfaces, and capable of putting a 29 volume Encyclopaedia on a pin-head<BR>
- and the ultimate in microwriting, write your name with individual atoms!<BR>
</EM>
<HR><BR><BR>
<font size=4>
The 19th century microscopists in Victorian England didn't 'miss a trick' when the new technique of photography was announced. Soon after the silver halide based photographic emulsion had been developed, these microscopists had started to use their microscopes to produce microphotographs ie tiny photographs on a microscope slide.<P>

It's a neat idea .... if you can use a microscope to magnify tiny objects so that the eye could observe them, why not use the optics of the microscope in reverse to project an image of say a painting through the microscope to create a tiny image on a microscope slide. If the slide had been pre-treated with photographic emulsion and developed like a photograph, 'hey presto' you have a permanent microphotograph of the painting which can only be viewed under a microscope. What better novelty to impress your friends with at the next meeting of amateur microscopists ... and this is exactly what many of the early microphotographic slides were used for, as microscopy was a popular past-time with Victorian 'society'.<P>
 
The Victorian microscopist's used this technique to prepare a wide variety of photomicrographs including works of art, portraits of famous people and landscapes. To ensure the final image on the slide was a 'positive' the usual technique was to take a normal photograph of the subject and shine light through the developed negative, a glass plate in those days, down the microscope to create a 'positive' image on the slide, which was typically 1mm square.<P>

The image of the Lord's prayer below is an example of microphotography to miniaturise text. The block of text is 0.38 x 0.28mm in size on the original microscope slide and therefore the entire text could comfortably fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence. A microscope at about 40x magnification is required to read the microphotograph.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/micwrt2b.jpg" align=left hspace=8 height=242   width=225>
The text on the slide is 13 - 25 microns in height, so if the original text was 2mm high, the linear reduction of the text achieved in the microphotograph is approximately 150:1. At the highest magnifications the individual silver grains which make up the image can be seen, and they are typically 0.8um across. The finer the silver grains the early microscopists were able to achieve the higher the quality of the final image.<P>

The early experiments in creating microphotographs were considered to be of little practical use, and in the words of the 'Dictionary of Photography' in 1858 to be '<EM>somewhat childish and trivial</EM>'.
Although the use of microphotography for military purposes was first used in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 when pigeons were used to fly out messages on microfilm from the besieged city of Paris. By the Second World War advances in fine grain film enabled secret information to be photo-reduced onto a piece of film the size of a full stop, the so-called 'micro-dots'  which were very easy to conceal and transport.<P>

 It was only in the twentieth century that the technique of microphotography was developed for the storage of photo-reduced text and images on microfilm and microfiche. The Eastman-Kodak Company in 1928 introduced the Recordak system of copying text onto narrow roll film (microfilm). The reproduction of printed text in a greatly reduced form on film is called microform. When the copying medium used is sheet rather than roll film it is termed microfiche and each sheet usually has a readable legend on the sheet for cataloguing. <P>

<IMG SRC="../images/micwrt3b.jpg" align=right hspace=8 height=270   width=275>
An example of the capabilities of modern microfiche is shown on the right. The block of text on the sheet of film is 33x33 mm in size and contains the entire 1,245 pages of the 'Holy Bible'! The match head shown on the left of the microfiche gives a sense of scale. The text can be read comfortably under a microscope at about 100x. Each page of double column text is about 0.5mm wide and 1mm high (shown in the first blow-up). Each text character is 8 um high (ie 8/1000ths of a millimetre). If the original text was 2mm high this is a linear reduction of about 250:1 or an area reduction of 62,500:1.<P>

To put this into perspective, if this reduction was used on the millions of books on the 270+ miles of shelving in the Library of Congress, then the library could be stored in six standard filing cabinets.<P>

Microform is still widely used. In the author's local library for example, many of the catalogues are folders of loose microfiches, and the past issues of local newspapers are accessible as microfilm cartridges which can be magnified, read on a screen and selections printed out if desired. However, the increasingly widespread use of digital information storage with it's inherent benefits may eventually supersede the use of microform.<P>

The use of photographic reduction techniques is also widely used in photolithography during the production of integrated circuits on computer 'chips'. The etching and coating stages used to build up the complex three dimensional structure of an integrated circuit is accomplished by shining light through photomasks which act as miniature stencils. Where the mask allows light to shine through, chemicals can etch the exposed area or semiconductor material can be deposited. <P>

Scientists have found that they have almost pushed the capabilities of photoreduction to the limit for  computer chip manufacture, because the ultimate linear reduction achievable, which is about 1 micron, is restricted by the wavelength of light used. Recently electron beams are being used instead of ultra-violet light to project the images through the photomask to produce the integrated circuit. This will allow much greater circuit densities to be achieved on the microchip.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/micwrt4a.jpg" align=right hspace=8 height=130   width=184>
Scientists are also experimenting with the use of an intense electron beam to write patterns directly onto inorganic surfaces. This process called SCRIBE (Sub-nanometre Cutting and Ruling with an Intense Beam of Electrons) can make lines of only 1 nanometre wide (ie one millionth of a millimetre). Using this technique it would be possible to write the entire contents of the 29 volume Encyclopaedia Britannica on a pin-head! A small section of the original text from the Encyclopaedia reproduced onto a film of aluminium fluoride is shown on the right. Each text character is approximately 0.03 micron <CHECK> high, compared with microfiche characters above which are  8 micron high.<P>

<IMG SRC="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/stm10.gif"  align=left  width=96 height=64 hspace=8 >
But the ultimate in minute text must be the manipulation of individual atoms to create text with characters tens of atoms across. A famous example of 'atomic writing' created by IBM scientists is shown on the left (via image link to an<A HREF="#ibm"> IBM Web site</A>). The letters 'IBM' were created by positioning xenon atoms on a nickel surface using a special scanning tunnelling microscope. The letters are each about 6 nanometres across, which is close to the ultimate in microwriting. <P>

<IMG SRC="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/stm11.gif" align=right width=97 height=121 hspace=8 >
IBM researchers have also created a magnificent image of Japanese characters by the manipulation of atoms. The image on the right shows the 'Kanji' characters meaning 'atom', they are formed from individual iron atoms on copper (via image link to an<A HREF="#ibm"> IBM Web site</A>).<P>

Manipulation of individual atoms may seem just a scientific curiousity but the development of such techniques may allow significant advances in the fabrication of very high density computer chips. Also the manipulation of atoms and molecules to build micro-machines is the basis of the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology. Experts predict that in the next century nanotechnology will be the basis for how we manufacture complex miniature devices, treat disease and even explore the universe  ..... the microscopic world around us and the technology we are developing to control this scale of nature gets more exciting every day! <P>

<CENTER><H2>BIRTH OF A MICROSCOPE CLUB<BR>
Postal Microscopical Club of Australia</H2>
<H3>By Mike Dingley</H3></CENTER><P>


<FONT SIZE=4><p>Clubs and societies are usually formed when one or more people with similar interests want to:

<ul>
  <li>attract others who have similar interests.</li>
  <li>promote and receive new ideas, news, articles etc. </li>
  <li>act as a forum with social interactions and/or publish in a newsletter or journal.</li>

</ul>

<p>In Australia we have the Microscopical Society of Australia (MSA) of which I am a member. After
a while I realised that my needs were not being met ie. I was interested in looking at microscopical
objects/ specimens as well as the processes involved in preparing the same objects for examination
as prepared slides under a microscope. I felt that this <u>was</u><em></em> the most important 
aspect of microscopy.
Without properly mounted specimens what is the use for a microscope? It was OK to talk about
historical instruments and the physics of light and objects but I just wanted to use the microscope
to observe microscopical objects.

<p>I had an idea to form a Club or Society but was not quite sure what guidelines it should follow. 
I
then heard about the Postal Microscopical society in the UK and wrote and asked for help in
designing a club along similar lines. I was fortunate enough to get some very good help especially
where the rules were concerned but I was unsure of how to start it going. My good friend John
Tolliday was instrumental with being a sounding board and we discussed the idea and it was he
who really gave me the impetus to get started.<P> One thing we both wanted was that it should be
called a CLUB and not a society. The word Club instils an amateur idea where members do not
have to be university graduates or academics to belong. We wanted members from all ages and
walks of life. We did not and do not want it to become too technical but have a 'hands-on'
approach. We also try to get members to interact with each other on a casual basis.

<p>How do you make it known that a new club exists and that it will serve members and not be a 'fly-
by-night' enterprise as well as not making me a millionaire! Yes I have been asked on<u> many</u>
occasions 'How much are you making from it'? (The annual accounts are printed in the fist
newsletter of each year for scrutiny).

<p>First of all I sent a note to the editor of the MSA newsletter asking for a small inclusion. This 
was
granted and was duly placed. Not long afterwards I received several applications for membership.
My first target was to reach a membership of 10 (this would give us a complete circuit) but I soon
realised that I should up this target to 20 in a very short space of time. As I had quite a large 
stock
of prepared microscope slides at hand, this became the basis for slide sets to be sent around the
circuit, and still does.<P> I also had to very quickly learn about word processing and newsletter 
design
and printing as members wanted a newsletter. One member offered to design the front cover which
is still being used today. I toyed with the idea of a couple of pages but my enthusiasm pushed me
to a first issue of 24 pages a target which I try to attain for every issue unless it is an 
anniversary
issue such as issue 15. This was to celebrate 5 years of continuous achievement. No Mean Feat!<P>
As time went by more and more members were joining up and news of our existence seemed to
travel by word of mouth. I wrote a story about the club for my local newspaper and it was
successful in adding a few more members. I then thought about getting TV involved. I mentioned
this to a friend of mine who has contacts here and there, and before I knew it a TV channel asked if I would do a short stint on their 'morning' show. This was organised and was a
success. The TV station was besieged with telephone calls after the interview although not all
became members.<P> As membership grew I noticed that it comprised nearly all of adults. So I
thought about how to get young people such as children or teenagers involved. I mentioned this
to a member who then organised a meeting with science teachers in a high school which did not
prove too successful. We tried to get teachers involved which hopefully would lead to the students
becoming interested. However, teachers told us that they were working hard teaching the current
curriculum without having to 'add' to their burden. <P>Before I knew it we had over 40 members and
still rising. My target then became 50. A mention was made in a teachers magazine which
produced a few members and still membership was rising. A notice was placed in the UK's
newsletter which resulted in an immediate response from a person who was migrating to Australia
and wanted to let me know that he would join up when he reached these shores. Not long after we
signed up a 'real' overseas member and he is still with us. 


<p>As I was the one who started the Club I was also the bunny doing all of the work. This entailed 
the
jobs of Secretary, Editor, Writer, Paster-upperer of the newsletter and Slide Circuit Manager,
which involved getting slides ready, writing a few notes in notebooks and sending them out to
members. It became serious when I did not find time to look down a microscope!!!! I then
advertised for HEELLLPPPP!! And luckily I managed to pass off the Slide circuit managers job
and this has relieved a lot of work from my shoulders. I would like to give up the job of Secretary
or Editor but at the moment I can still handle them both. Still I would not have to be asked twice.


<p>At the present moment we have about 65 members and still rising. Quite an achievement for such
humble beginnings. It has taken a lot of sweat and enthusiasm but I feel it has been worth it. I 
have
personally made new friends and acquaintances and I am sure that I will make more in the future.
I feel that if more members became involved in writing something for the newsletter it would make
for better reading. This is the area of most concern as they are in for a shock next year when I 
send
them a newsletter with only 4 pages or whatever has been submitted. 


<p>All in all it has been a fun 6 years of operation since our 'birth'  and I feel that we are now 
in our
youth after graduating from our first teething troubles. In just a few years we shall reach 
adulthood
but I hope that we do not die a premature death.<P>

<STRONG>Editor's note</STRONG>: the Microscopy UK and Micscape Editors
would like to thank Mike Dingley, who is a new contributor to Micscape 
magazine, for submitting this original article.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><p>Many microscopists have at least one microphotograph in their slide collection. I have just the 
one. However despite there being an excellent book on the greatest producer of them, J B Dancer, I 
cannot find mine listed.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../imag97/jansnip1.jpg" align=centre height=388 width=300></CENTER>


<p>
The slide itself has the usual J B Dancer label, but without his name or initials. This would 
seem to suggest it is by Richard Suter using Dancer's materials but I cannot find it amongst his 
lists. There are certainly slides of the same subject, H.R.H. Prince Albert, which is the title on 
the slide label, but they are not of this actual view.
<p>
If anyone can find a reference to this slide I would appreciate finding out its source.

<CENTER><H3>PhotoCD</H3></CENTER>
PhotoCD is an ideal way of viewing your transparencies on your computer. Once there the images can be manipulated easily, perhaps getting rid of some faults or cleaning up the background in the process. Then, when you are happy with the result you can share your work with others by putting the image on show. Why not show off your images taken down the microscope through the pages of Micscape?<BR><BR>

<BODY BGCOLOR=#80FFFF>
<U><Center><H1>Lice!!</H1></Center></U><Center><H3>the very thought of them is enough to start off the itching
and scratching!!</H3></Center>

<Center><H4><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Several of us put our heads together to compile this article</FONT></Center>
<Center><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><H4>William Ells supplied the idea and some of the resources; Anne Bruce supplied the words; <BR>Maurice Smith, Dave Walker and Mike Morgan supplied images and resources</H4></FONT></Center>


<H3><P>To set the scene ...</H3>
<IMG ALT="Head louse"  SRC="../images/lice2.jpg" width=175 height=203 align=left hspace=8>
<H4> It is a  relatively uneventful school day which  is
abruptly interrupted  by the arrival of the "nit nurse".   As
a result of the information sent home, painful parental probing
of heads follows, together with contagious and synchronised scratching.  As the fine
toothed combs are dragged through the hair of complaining and
recalcitrant children, vile smelling shampoo is put into action,
very often on a "just in case" basis.  </P><BR><BR><BR></H4>

<IMG  ALT="Pubic louse"SRC="../images/lice3.jpg" width=175 height=173 align=right hspace=8>
<H4>Like it or not our bodies are the habitat for a wide range of
organisms. Whether it is our skin or hair, teeth or intestine,
blood or nerves, our bodies provide all the resources for healthy
living for a huge variety of organisms. Lice are just one type
of parasites which thrive on the human body.</P>


<P>Lice are small wingless insects, well suited to their mode of
living. Three types affect man: the head louse (<I>Pediculus
capitas</I>, shown left above),
the body louse <I>(Pediculus corporis</I>) and the Pubic or
Crab louse (<I>Phthirius pubis</I>, shown on the right above).
</P>

<P> The
louse's body looks squashed and flattened, enabling
it to lie close to its host's skin. This is ideal for it  to obtain  the blood which makes up its diet. Human lice all 
belong to a group known as sucking lice (order Anoplura).   Meal times involve  three needle like structures
(stylets) piercing the skin which is  held back by a specially  adapted tongue. This is followed by
 a pumping action of the
throat which  causes the blood to be sucked up. When not in use the
stylets retract neatly into a pocket just behind the mouth. Meals are frequent and each takes a few minutes.</P><BR>

<IMG ALT="Claw of pubic louse"  SRC="../images/lice4.jpg"  width= 165 height=169 align=left hspace=8>
Once a louse has found a  a good blood supply there is little need for it to move, as its food resource is not going to go away. The legs of the lice are therefore,  not so much for walking,  but more for hanging in there. Their legs are inwardly curved and have well developed
"claws" for hair grasping (shown in the image left). The claws in the pubic louse, which
lives in the pubic region are very pronounced giving rise to its
alternative name of crab louse  and the more derogatory "crabs". The body louse can live in the fibres of clothing, leaving only  to feed on blood.</P><BR>


<IMG ALT="Nit attached to hair"  SRC="../images/lice1.jpg" width=250 height=163 align=right hspace=8>
Males are not essential  to the reproductive life of the louse; unfertilised eggs can result in new individuals (parthenogenesis). Eggs are laid singly or in clumps and are cemented to a hair (shown in the image right),
though the body louse will also lay its eggs in clothing next to
the skin. The hatching of the mature nymph  is wind driven!  
Air is collected through the nymph's mouth and passes through
its digestive system until the gas pressure is great enough to
eject the nymph. The hatched nymph looks more or less like a
smaller version of the adult. It undergoes three moults before
reaching adulthood. The whole life cycle can take up to five weeks.
</P></H4>



<HR>
<FONT COLOR=#FF0000><Center><H3><U>Did you know these lousy facts?</U></H3></Center>
<P>There are about 400 different species of sucking lice.
</P>

<P>Lice range in size from 0.3 mm to 11 mm</P>
<P>Lice affect nearly all mammal species, though none is known to infect whales or bats, and none has been taken from duckbilled platypus, anteaters or armadillos.</P>

<H4><P>The body louse can carry diseases like typhus, relapsing fever and trench fever. During the Russian revolution, it is thought that three million people died from louse borne typhus.</P>

Beethoven did not suffer from headlice! 582 strands of the composer's hair have been under analysis at a laboratory in Arizona, and it has been found that despite the plague of head lice in nineteenth century Europe, Beethoven's locks were nit free.<FONT SIZE=2>  (from The Times 30.5.96)</FONT SIZE=2>

<P>According to Dr John Maunder of the Medical Entomology centre in Cambridge, there is an increase in nit reports every autumn but not necessarily in nits. He suggest that the culprits are "carriers" who support colonies of nits without realising. These carriers don't  itch and so don't treat their scalps but<I> do</I> infect others during the school holidays.</P>

<P>It is estimated that head louse  infestations are probably in the region of well over <FONT SIZE=4>100,000</FONT SIZE=4> per year in the UK.</P>

The body louse can carry diseases like typhus, 
relapsing fever and trench fever. During the Russian revolution, it is 
thought that three million people died from louse borne typhus. Lenin is quoted as having said at that time "Either socialism will defeat 
the louse, or the louse will defeat socialism".<P>

Nitshill in Glasgow has no lousy connections - it is thought that the 
"nit" in Nitshill is the Scottish word for "nut" or for Oak gall.<P>

            Brief descriptions & some new figures of rare & interesting desmids from  
          North West Sutherland, Scotland, including a new record for the British 
          Isles. 
<HR>  <BR>        
         <STRONG>   INTRODUCTION</STRONG><BR>
            The author has for several years been interested in the ecology & 
          distribution of desmids, listing species from various habitats in Britain. 
          Sutherland with its wonderful 'flow country' is known to be one of the best 
          areas for desmids, not only in Britain but in the world. The paper which 
          follows provides some comments on just four of the many rare and 
          interesting desmids to be found there.  <P>
          
        <STRONG>    OBSERVATIONS</STRONG><BR>
            <EM>Penium spirostriolatum</EM> var.<EM> amplificatum </EM>Schmidt  (Fig. 1a & b). In a 
          recent paper on new or interesting British desmids, Williamson (1991) has 
          reported the occurrence of this desmid from the island of Yell, Shetland. 
          Some authorities such as Prescott <EM>et al</EM>. (1975a) and Ruzicka (1977a) 
          express doubts about the validity of the var.<EM> amplificatum</EM>, the latter 
          stating that for it to be accepted, its distinctive capitate apices must be 
          a constant feature in the entire population. Williamson found such a 
          population in Shetland where none of the nominal variety was present. It is 
          therefore worth reporting that a similar but smaller population has been 
          recorded from North-West Sutherland.   The specimens examined in 1989 were of 
          additional interest in that the comparatively broad diagonally disposed 
          striae go into and apparently curve right over the apices, (Fig. 1b), a 
          condition which does not seem to have been previously reported for the 
          British species.  The girdle bands were seen only as faint lines on the 
          surface of the cells, but clearly seen at the margins as protrusions, 
          rather than as shallow indentations as illustrated by previous authors. The 
          length of specimen illustrated (semi-cell Fig. 1a) was 296.0 um breadth at 
          the median suture 20.0 um. (Note: 'um' = micrometre).<P>
          
            <EM> Pleurotaenium tridentulum</EM> (Wolle) West var.<EM> tridentulum</EM> (Fig. 2a & b). 
          This taxon reported by  W. & G.S. West (1904, p. 209) to be "one of rarest 
          British species of the genus,"  has been found in one of the Sutherland 
          samples. The specific epithet<EM> tridentulum</EM>, is something of a misnomer since 
          there are always four apical teeth on each of the cell apices rather than 
          three. It should be pointed out, that normally only three are seen in face 
          view.  As the Wests state, the four apical teeth are not all in focus at the 
          same time, and it must be for this reason  that Wolle (1883) gave the 
          species its misleading name. It is interesting to note that 
            Prescott <EM>et al</EM>. (1975 b)  list this species as<EM> Pleurotaenium sceptrum</EM> and 
          according to them 'Roy described this as <EM>Docidium sceptrum</EM> in 1883, Wolle 
          described it as <EM>D. tridentulum</EM> in 1884, not 1882 as West & Krieger state. 
          Therefore <EM>sceptrum</EM> is the earliest name for this species with four teeth'. 
          This has not been universally accepted.    <P>



            The specimen illustrated had a length of 273.0 um breadth at  the basal 
          inflation 14.5 um and at the apices 8.0 um.   Brook (pers. comm.) and 
          Williamson (pers. comm.) have also found this species in samples from the 
          West of Scotland; the latter also from the West of Ireland. Although not 
          abundant in any sample it would seem to be less rare than the Wests 
          indicate.<EM>Haplotaenium  rectum</EM> var. <EM>rectissimum</EM> (Gronbl.). Genus <EM>novum</EM>   
            =<EM> Pleurotaenium rectum</EM> var. <EM>rectissimum</EM> (W & G S West) Gronb. 
            was abundant in the sample.     <P>
          
           <EM> Pleurotaenium nodosum</EM> var.<EM> borgei </EM>(Gronbl.) Krieg.  <EM> P. nodosum</EM> is the 
          most striking species of the genus and although said by W.&.G.S. West (1904 
          p.215) to be rare, it would probably be more correct to say that it has a 
          restricted distribution, for though never abundant, it has been found on 
          numerous occasions from various localities in Sutherland and Invernesshire 
          (Brook pers.comm.).  However none of the type variety have been found by 
          the author,  var.<EM> borgei</EM> differs from the type by the occurrence of 
          distinctive straight sections of the cell wall between each ring of nodules 
          around the cell (Fig. 3).  The variety is newly recorded for the British 
          Isles, though Ruzicka (1977b) expresses doubts about the validity of the 
          var.<EM> borgei</EM>, as noted above none of the type variety were found in the 
          samples, more specimens need to be examined to explore the range of forms 
          which exist within the species. Specimen illustrated: length 375.0 um; 
          breadth at nodules 48.6 um. <P>
            
        <EM>    Desmidium pseudostreptonema</EM> West & West (Fig. 4)  Croasdale<EM> et al</EM>. (1983) 
          state this species is of very rare occurrence. First described from Ceylon 
          (W.&.G.S. West 1906), it has previously been reported once in the British 
          Isles from the plankton of a small lake in Galway, Western Ireland 
          (W.&.G.S. West 1906) Brook & Williamson (1991) failed to include this record 
          in their Check-list of Desmids of the British Isles. Mr Alan Joyce reported 
          it as present in a sample collected in 1991, the author only found it in a 
          second sample collected in 1992, this Desmidium is extremely rare in the 
          samples, mostly in short filaments of 5-6 cells, only one long filament of 
          23 cells being found. In cells without contents pores were observed to be 
          evenly distributed over the cell wall except for a narrow band on either 
          side of the sinus.  Also in empty cells the apical attachment processes 
          were clearly visible. Dimensions of the largest cell in the filament 
          illustrated were: length 18.5 um; breadth 33.0 um; breadth of isthmus 23.0 
          um & depth of sinus 5.0 um.  Measurements of the largest cell in face 
          view: breadth 33 um;
            length 18.5 um; isthmus 23.0 um & depth of sinus 5 um.  <P>

<CENTER><h1>Images of Pond-life from Video</h1>

<p>
<h2>by Mike Samworth</h2></CENTER>

<p><FONT SIZE=4>
After reading about other people's exploits with video and the microscope I couldn't resist 
having a play myself. Though I don't have a video or camcorder of my own I am fortunate in having 
access to a video camera without lens at work. I have borrowed this on a few occasions and attached 
it to my microscope. Each time I have learnt a little more about what works best. The following 
still images are from those first sessions.<P>

<STRONG>Amoeba</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/sam5.jpg" align=left hspace=6 width=277   height=112 >These two images are both of good old <EM>Amoeba proteus</EM>.
The first is from early in the video sequence when the organism is still suffering the consequences 
of being thrown onto a slide. the second shows the creature putting out  pseudopodia as it 
moves.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/sam2.jpg" align=right  hspace=6 width=150   height=149  > Another shot of <EM>Amoeba</EM>, this time under higher magnification and 
using phase contrast.The latter shows up the highly granular nature of the cytoplasm. The video 
seems to cope well with phase images. I have found however, that most times using the video, all 
automatic circuitry should be turned off, especially that for colour balance. Not that much colour 
balance is needed for <EM>Amoeba</EM>! I have only had phase contrast available on my microscope relatively 
recently. As in many things in life, once you have something you wonder how you ever survived 
without it. Phase contrast is no exception and is especially useful for protozoa.<P>


<STRONG>Paramecium</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/sam1.jpg" align=right  hspace=6 width=100   height=148  ><IMG SRC="../images/sam6.jpg" align=left  hspace=6 width=200   height=129  > These two images are both of the 
ciliate <EM>Paramecium</EM>. They both show the organism rather flattened. This is due to the presence of 
silk fibres in the water on the slide. I find that this slows down the movement of ciliates quite 
well. Just tease out fibres from a piece of silk with tweezers under a stereo mic' and put onto the 
slide. The image on the right illustrates a common error with video, that of having your lamp turned 
down. At first you do this because of the high sensitivity of the camera, but of course it adds a 
colour cast. It is better to turn the auto-circuitry off and adjust manually. Turn your lamp up and 
use neutral density filters if necessary.<P>


<STRONG>Euplotes</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/sam4.jpg" align=right  hspace=6 width=150   height=111  ><IMG SRC="../images/sam3.jpg" align=left  hspace=6 width=151   height=134  >These are two very different views 
of a very different type of ciliate from the last one. They are both views of <EM>Euplotes</EM>, a common and widespread 
hypotrich ciliate. Hypotrichs have 'blocks' of cilia in groups or rows called cirri. They often use 
these cirri to 'walk' over the substrate. On left is a ventral view, the one normally seen when the 
organism is free-swimming. On the left is the view from the side of the ciliate.<BR> It effectively 
illustrates how the ventral cirri that characterise hypotrichs are used for movement over a 
substrate. This is one of the advantages of video, you can take a sequence and then select out the 
images that show particular behaviour. <P>


<STRONG>Rotifers</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/sam7.jpg" align=left  hspace=6 width=225   height=83  >One problem with video is that often 
the magnification is just too high. So for larger multicellular organisms such as rotifers they more 
than fill the screen.<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/sam8.jpg" align=right  hspace=6 width=161   height=72  >
 This can be avoided in two ways. Either you can use a very low power 
objective, say 2.5x, or set up your camera at such a position that you can dispense with the 
eyepiece altogether. This is not optically a good idea but nevertheless has been employed here for 
these two views of the rotifer <EM>Philodina</EM>. Of course in professional video systems a supplementary 
lens would be used instead of an eyepiece to compensate. The rotifer on the left is shown under 
phase contrast.<BR><BR>

<H2>HYDRA</H2>
by Mike Morgan 1996
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P><font size=4>
<strong>Overview</strong><br>
A widely distributed genus of solitary freshwater invertebrate animals belonging to an order (Hydroidea) within the phylum Coelenterata.  They are flexible polyps, 10-30 mm long, with the mouth at the top surrounded by 6-10 tentacles.
<p>
The New Latin name, Hydra, is derived from the monster in Greek legend with many heads who grew two more whenever one was cut off.  It was finally slain by Hercules who cauterised each neck after severing its head.  The regenerative powers of hydra are quite remarkable, a single hydra may be cut into many pieces and provided that each piece contains a portion of the two body layers, ectoderm and endoderm, 
it will develop into a complete animal.
A Hydra was first described by Leeuwenhoek in 1703.
<p>
<strong>Hydra with Bud</strong><br>
<img src="../images/hydra1.jpg" width=200    height=156   align=left hspace=8>

<p>
Various species occur in ponds and slow-flowing rivers.  The species normally studied is the green hydra, <I>Chlorohydra viridissima. </I>  Brown, orange and colourless Hydrae also occur and all have the same general structure.
The green colour of <EM>Chlorohydra viridissima</EM> is due to the presence of small alga of the genus<I> Chlorella</I> which live within the body of the hydra.  This is a symbiotic relationship in which the algae  make use of those substances that the hydra would normally excrete, such as carbon dioxide, phosphates and nitrogenous substances.  For its part, hydra benefits by receiving the oxygen produced by photosynthesis.  If there is a food shortage, hydra will digest the plant cells and later ingest more living algae which it does not digest. <P>

<img src="../images/hydra3.jpg"  width=150    height=154    align=right hspace=8>
Hydra can be found attached to water-plants, stones etc., with its cylindrical body hanging downwards, with the tentacles gently moving.  When disturbed it will rapidly contract into a blob of jelly, making it difficult to find.
Hydrae feed on small animals, such as water-fleas.  These are caught by structures called<I> nematocysts</I>.  There are different types  of nematocysts, some stinging and paralysing the prey, whilst others discharge threads which coil round the prey and hold  it.<P>
Nematocysts arise from cells known as nematoblasts.  It is interesting that no other phylum produce these cells, however, they are sometimes found in the epidermis of free-living flat-worms.  The flat-worms eat the hydra but do not digest the nematoblasts, which end up in the epidermis and form a defensive mechanism for the flat-worm.  This is a very unusual case of a natural implantation of cells from one animal into another.

Pictured above right is a high power view of part of the tentacle, showing the position of the  nematocysts.


<P>
<img src="../images/hydra2.jpg"  width=209    height=80    align=left hspace=8>
By gently pressing on the coverslip, it is possible to squash a portion of the tentacle and so cause the nematocyst to discharge.  Pictured left, is such a discharged nematocyst.  Note the barbs. 

<p>
Hydra reproduce both asexually and sexually.  Asexual reproduction takes place in the winter in the process known as budding (see picture above).  Sexual reproduction occurs in the summer, though the brown hydra (<EM>H. fusca</EM>) prefers the autumn months.
<p>
<img src="../images/hydra4.jpg"  width=203    height=112    align=right hspace=8>
Scurrying over the body surface of hydra may be seen a number of small animals.  These remove bacteria and other debris.  These animals are referred to as 'commensals' and do no harm to the hydra.
<I>Trichodina</I> is one such animal and is shown on the right in a high power view.<P>

How NOT to collect freshwater life. My wife and I were walking a farm trail at Marden, Kent. A mixed farm with hops, fruit and sheep and a plantation of <EM>Salix alba</EM> a cultivar <EM>coerulea</EM> or cricket bat willow. At one point it passes close to the river Beult. I decided I would collect some water although I had set out with no intention to collect and did not have my rod and net with me, but I usually have a tube or two in my pocket.<P>

Going down to the water edge I filled one of the little tubes, turned to come up the bank when my feet started to slip into the water, thinking I would go in up to my knees I was surprised to find myself going right under. When I came up I found the water was chest high and my straw hat was slowly floating away.  I grabbed my hat and passed it to my wife who then helped me out of the river and up the bank.<P>

I stripped off my shirt and shorts, my wife wrung out my shirt and I did the same with my shorts and put them back on. My shirt felt too clammy to put back on so we walked on a short distance to an open field where I hung my shirt on a tree branch and sat in the sun to dry out. Fortunately it was a warm day.<P>

A note or two on a better way to collect may not come amiss. Nearly every introductory book on algae and protozoa has some instructions on collecting. There is a very comprehensive account on collecting Rotifera by Eric Hollowday in Microscopy (Journal of the Quekett Microscopical Club) 1985, Vol. 35, part 3, which also applies to other forms of microscopic aquatic life.<P>

<STRONG>Collecting Net</STRONG><P>
Some years ago a friend kindly gave me a small net with a collecting tube. I bought an anglers extending landing net rod which extends to about 7 feet, made a frame of wire four inches square on which to fit the net, fitting same to the end of the rod with a screw clip of the type used to fit rubber tubes on car radiators. I have found this very useful although the mesh, screen printers 'silk', has apertures of about 100 microns, twice that recommended by Hollowday, as you may lose very small forms through the mesh.<P>

I have since been given a wooden rod and net said to have been supplied by Watsons. The rod is just under 3 feet long with a six inch diameter brass ring with a screw fitting to the end of the rod. The net, with apertures of about 90 microns was perished so I have replaced this with a net of screen printers fabric as above, using the original tube. See sketch of net and tube (Figure 2, after Hollowday).<P>
<BR>
<STRONG>Collecting</STRONG><P>

For plankton organisms, the net is immersed and 'figures of eight' described in the water, keeping the net moving all the time. When the net is removed from the water it is allowed to drain, the water and organisms which do not pass through the net will fall into the tube which is then emptied into a larger vessel (jam jar will do). Unwanted macro organisms can be removed if the tube is emptied into a coffee strainer placed across the top of the jar.<P>

B) Water draining through net<BR>
C) Plastic tube looks clear<BR>
E) Concentrated organisms falling into tube<P>
<br clear><BR>

Diatoms and Desmids can be gathered by scraping the edge of the net up some stems of water plants and passing through any growth of filamentous algae. If you are using a square net try passing it gently along the bottom of small pools, some of the submerged filamentous algae that can be reached from the bank can be collected and put into a plastic bag.<P>

In boggy areas the water from a little of the wet moss can be squeezed into a collecting tube or a little put into a plastic bag and sealed for later examination. NOTE: it is not necessary to take large quantities of water or moss, better to take a little from several sites. If you have a good collection it will take hours to examine 100ml. of water under the microscope if you make the effort to identify all the organisms you find.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5 color=darkblue><CENTER><STRONG>Synopsis of a Field Studies course on Freshwater Algae<BR> and the facilities which the Field Studies Council have to offer</STRONG></CENTER></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=4 color=darkblue>Anyone who is interested in life sciences will know that there is ALWAYS more to learn about
the world we live in and the way our every action impacts on other environments.<P>

Some years ago I embarked on a Marine Biology course as an extension to the sport of  SCUBA
diving in which I was actively engaged. The above course was an extension to knowledge
previously gained but in the area of Fresh Water.<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/schof1.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=160 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right>
Flatford Mill is one of ten Field Study Centres placed around the country which have been set up
for education in the natural environment. Each centre has facilities for teaching / lecturing and is
available to people of all ages. In addition there are facilities for accommodation from standard
single / double rooms, to family and dormitory accommodation.  <P>During my course there were
several families who under the guidance of the warden were allowed to set traps for  small rodents
as part of the FSCs animal population census. (They were of course released unharmed after
identification). Two classes of A level students were studying the local flora and fauna,
whilst our group of six were studying Fresh Water Algae under the guidance of Allan Pentecost who is
an authority and university lecturer on this subject.<P>

After a lecture describing methods for collecting and sampling, we learned basic facts of algae,
(there are main four types: Green, Yellow Green, Blue Green and Diatoms), their habitats,
identification, life cycles and methods of reproduction. Then it was a foray into the field collecting
samples from differing locations.  Some samples had to be fixed in the field to prevent aggressive
predators in the sample from eating the less motile organisms. Then it was back to the laboratory
to classify and observe our samples.<P>

Observing these minute organisms under the microscope whilst having an expert on hand to
positively identify them was intriguing and very helpful.  Amongst our finds were seen
conjugating algae and other types of cell division together with desmids,<EM> Fragilaria</EM>, beautiful
<EM>Spirogyra</EM>,<EM> Coelastrum</EM>.<P>

Whilst mainly concerned with observing algae there were many other organisms in our samples
such as; <EM>Amoeba</EM>, rotifers, nematodes and copepods, but those are another weekend course.<P>

Our thanks to the FSC for organising the course and to Allan Pentecost for guiding us through
such a fascinating weekend.<P>

During 1988, I constructed a very small pond in our garden, it is not intended as a fish pond; its main purpose is to provide a place to receive water from tarn, loch, lake, ditch etc, after I have finished examining a good proportion of it under the microscope - water from habitats all over Britain collected and sent by friends or collected myself. I realise of course, that the water in my pond will not always be chemically suited for the flora and fauna in the containers that I empty into it, but at least it has a chance to survive.<P>

Many members of the PMS will know that my main interest is in freshwater algae, particularly the desmids. However I am not averse to examining in some detail any interesting fauna I find when searching slides. I am naturally particularly interested in any invertebrates that may be feeding on desmids, (see Brook and Ells,<A HREF="../../amateurs/qmc/mainqmc.html">  'Microscopy'</A>, vol 35, part 7 1987). In 1989 a friend who has an established pond about a mile away, gave us a water iris for my little pond. He brought this along in a plastic bag of which was a couple of teaspoons of nice green water, in which I found several specimens of a sedentary rotifer, all new to me.<P>

<STRONG>SUCTORIA</STRONG><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="../imag97/ellsponx.gif" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=300 HSPACE=6 ALIGN=left border=1>
<STRONG>Notes on the image:</STRONG><BR>
Head of sucking tentacles form almost a complete ball. There are a lot of out of focus suckers coming forward and going away from the viewer.<P>

From Wrattens pond 18th Jan 1989.<P>

Suctoria Family Acinetina.<BR>
Tentacles 35 - 40 microns long.<BR>
Family Trichophryidae also in sample; irregular in shape, body no stalk, tentacles up to 450 microns.<P> <br clear><BR>

Suctoria belong to the class of ciliated animalcules, phylum Ciliophora. In the adult state they are aciliate (without cilia), attached with or without a stalk, and immobile, so they are also acineta. Multiplication is by budding and the detached buds are completely ciliated. Suctoria feed by sucking dry ciliates caught on their sticky tentacles (I did not see any caught). The specimen figured is <EM>Acineta lacustris</EM> (the word <EM>lacustris</EM> means pertaining to lakes) usually attached plants (Figure 1).<P>

Other specimens in the water were almost certainly <EM>Tricophyra epistylidis</EM>. Both species inhabit freshwater only. There are about 45 genera and many species. There are other phyla that are marine.<P>

Many modern microscopes have a base designed to be used with transmitted light. As mine was provided with incident lighting (top) only,  I made up the box shown in the drawing. Exact dimensions are not given, as the box must be made to suit the microscope or materials available. My box is about 8 inches square and 2.75 inches high. I used a 15 watt 240 volt pygmy type lamp in a medium bayonet holder and cut an opal perspex disc to replace the reversible black and white opaque disc when using the transmitted light base. A useful addition would be a switch either mounted on the box or a press table lamp type inserted in the flex.<P><BR><BR>

Paracetamol may be better at improving your mental well-being than you give it credit for. Crush a tablet and dissolve in methanol. This is best done with small amounts as methanol could well give you a headache itself, and the powder is not very soluble in it. Place a drop onto a scrupulously clean slide and let dry. Observe under crossed polars. Not all slides will look very good, and so make several at once. When you have a good one, cement a coverslip on as this will improve it.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Norbert's Ruling machine (Times 6th March 1885)</STRONG></FONT>

<p>
The other night I was reading about different compressoria and similar devices in 'The Microscope' by Jabez Hogg. As I turned the pages in this magnificent book, a small newspaper cutting from The Times fell out. The article was about Norbert's ruling machines and was dated 6/3/85. Below is an extract.<P>

 "We are informed by Mr. J. Mayall, junior, of 223, Regent St. that the ruling machine by which the late Herr. F. A. Norbert, of Barth, Prussia, produced his extraordinarily fine rulings on glass, and about the construction of which there has been much mystery ever since the rulings were first brought to public notice at the Exhibition of 1851, has recently been acquired by Mr Frank Crisp, secretary of the Royal Microscopical Society, and that it will be exhibited at the meeting of the society at King's College, Strand, on Wednesday, the 11th inst. at 8 pm.

<p>

The fine rulings produced by Herr Norbert are held in high esteem by microscopical physicists, not so much on account of their fineness or accuracy of division, but on account of the depth and strength of the lines, on which their visibility and utility so largely depend. The mystery regarding the means employed to produce the rulings has now been largely cleared up, as the diamond points and the memorandum book relating to them has  now been acquired along with the machine.

<p>

The latest achievement was the production of a series of 20 bands of lines, on a plate of glass ranging from 1/11,240th to 1/225,336th of an inch".<P>

         <CENTER><STRONG> <FONT SIZE=6 color=darkblue>  An Unusual Microscope by the name  'OTROPIC'</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 color=darkblue>by Mike Dingley,
 Australia</FONT></STRONG></CENTER><P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 color=darkblue>As a collector of portable / field type microscopes I have recently acquired an unusual microscope in
which the objectives are mounted in a row on an arc-shaped metal bar instead of being mounted on a
rotating disc as is the usual scenario. Coarse and fine focusing is operated by turning concentric
barrels on the microscope tube.  In its normal position the instrument stands 240mm high  and 290mm
when the drawtube is extended.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/mding1.gif" WIDTH=105 HEIGHT=300 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left border=1>
At the rear of the stage between the stage clips are the words; Made in Germany Otropic Nr. 826.
Hermann Wetzer Pfronten / Bayern. This company produced the Otropic microscope from late 1947 till
1952 or 1953 and produced about 2,500 - 3,000 units which were mostly sent to customers in Hong
Kong and Rio de Janeiro. It appears that this was the only microscope to be produced by the company
as they normally made other instruments.<P>

<STRONG>THE STAND</STRONG><BR>
The limb and round base are metal coated with a crinkle (wrinkle) finish black paint. The ferrous metal
base is circular, 75mm in diameter, 16mm thick and has a conical depression in the top surface
allowing full movement of the mirror. The limb is attached to the base via two slot headed bolts from
recessed holes under the base. The limb is 89mm high and has a slot 17mm wide from the top which
ends 7mm from the base and gives it the appearance of twin pillars. The limb is pivoted with trunnions
at the top of the pillar so that the tube, objectives, stage, condenser and mirror can all be tilted.<P>

<STRONG>THE MIRROR</STRONG><BR>
There is a double sided plain/concave mirror 34mm in diameter which is mounted on a swivelling yoke
which in turn is fixed to a swinging arm 40mm in length. All surfaces except the mirror are painted
black on brass.<P>
<STRONG>THE CONDENSER</STRONG><BR>
The condenser is nickel plated brass and is non-centerable. It has a thread which screws into a collar
which forms part of the underside of the stage. Movement is up and down only. There is an iris
diaphragm.<P>

<STRONG>THE STAGE</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/mding2.gif" WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=300 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right border=1>
The fixed stage is circular, 75mm in diameter, 7mm thick (not including the condenser mount) and is
finished in smooth black paint over brass. The slide holders consist of two spring metal stage clips
35mm long. Around the edge of the circumference is a V-shaped groove to allow accessory stages to
be secured with locating screws. Under the stage slightly to the front and left (as facing the instrument)
is a lever bent at the rear with a notch which acts as a stop to prevent the condenser from being raised
too high.<P>
There are two additional stages and are attached to the existing stage by first removing the stage clips
and then placing them on top of it using pins and screws to lock them in position. The first one is a
centring stage with its own stage clips fitted. It forms a   circle, 86mm across with a flat edge at the
rear. It has a rim on the underside 8mm deep in which a pin mounted at the front but inside, acts as a
locating pin when inserted into the existing stage groove. At the rear, but on either side, are two screws
with knurled heads which also fit into the existing stage groove allowing it to be centred.<P>
The other stage is a rectangular graduated mechanical stage. At the front are two screw bolts with
knurled heads angled towards each other which are screwed into the V-shaped groove of the existing
stage finally to secure it in position. The slide is held flat by means of a wide U-shaped, spring loaded
wire. The x and y stages are graduated.  The x axis is numbered 0-8 in 0.5 divisions and the y axis is
numbered from 0-16 also in 0.5 divisions. Each main division is equal to 1mm of slide movement.
Both x and y axis screws are graduated 0-50 with 1 complete turn equivalent to each AB division or
0.5mm on the stage.<P>

<STRONG>THE OBJECTIVES</STRONG><BR>
The non-standard objectives are 21mm long and 12mm in diameter. The thread is 8mm X  0,5 pitch.
When viewed from the front the objectives line up laterally (left to right) to the stage and each
objective is selected by pushing one side of the bar laterally until the suitable objective clicks in to
position above the light path. The objective bar is curved upwards (arc shaped) and when viewed from
either end there is a female dovetail cut on either side near the top which runs along its length.<P> The
objective carrier slides through the tube with a male dovetail cut in to it. A major drawback with this
type of objective mounting is that the top of each objective is open to dust and dirt particles.<P>
The four objectives are marked;               <P>
1. Rau-Optic Wetzlar  78:1 n.a. 0.90<BR>
2. Rau-Optic Wetzlar  45:1 n.a. 0.85<BR>
3. Rau-Optic Wetzlar  30:1 n.a. 0.65<BR>
4. no marking              18:1 (no n.a. marking)<P>

<STRONG>THE TUBE</STRONG><BR>
The tube has a mechanical length of 125mm and appears to made from nickel-plated brass and is fixed
to the microscope limb through a collar and set firmly with a knurled screw. Coarse and fine focusing
are not carried out by the conventional methods but are controlled by the movement of concentric
barrels forming the tube of the microscope. These barrels are threaded and focusing is achieved by
rotating the knurled areas which raises or lowers the objectives. <P>The coarse focusing tube is 40mm
long part of which (27mm) is knurled. Each revolution of the coarse tube is equal to about a 2mm rise
in the objective. The fine focusing tube is above the coarse focusing tube and is tapered at its apex
where it is marked with 100 graduations each being 0.001mm. There is a draw tube which can be
raised 50mm above its normal position.<P>

<STRONG>EYEPIECES</STRONG><BR>
There are six eyepieces present in the case marked 5X, 8X, 10X, 12X, 15X and 20X Periplan. All
eyepieces are 15mm in diameter and are therefore smaller than the standard.<P>

<STRONG>THE CASE</STRONG><BR>
The case measures 270mm X 114mm X 100mm and is hinged in the middle along the long axis so that
when open both the lid and base rest flat. It is made from wood and covered in a black cloth. On the
lid near the right hand corner is the word Otropic. There are two metal clasps to secure the lid, however,
only one is complete. The inside is covered in red felt which shows signs of wear and the microscope
and accessories are compartmentalised. There is a space where another accessory should be but is
missing. The total weight of the case containing all items is 2105g.<P>


<STRONG>OPERATION OF THE INSTRUMENT</STRONG><BR>

The microscope is quite difficult to use for several reasons: Firstly because the instrument is small,
lightweight and has a small diameter base the instrument is easily moved when the focusing tubes are
turned. This same problem occurs when the objectives are selected as the bar carrying them is a tight
fit in the corresponding dovetail. The base of the instrument has to held when focusing and selecting
the various objectives.<P>

All of the objectives are achromatic so that the image, when focused in the
centre of the field of view is out of focus towards the periphery. With higher magnifications this "out
of focus" image gets larger with a reduction in size of the "in focus" circle. However, the objectives are
still in good condition providing a clear image especially when using the 5X eyepiece. The
quality of the image deteriorates when the higher power eyepieces are used but cellular details can still
be seen with reasonable clarity especially when you consider that the instrument was not intended as
research quality.<P>

Microscopists are avid scanners of second hand and antiquarian booksellers and few will
be unaware of the ubiquitous "Half Hours with the Microscope" by Dr Edwin Lankester
which is regularly found in one or other of  its many editions and which has for nearly one
hundred and fifty years been a source of much inspiration and information to generations of
microscopists. Few however will be much aware of the man who wrote it in 1859 during his
term of office as the President of the Microscopical Society of London. <P>

This riveting
biography of Edwin Lankester, Victorian Doctor, Scientist and pioneering campaigner tells
his story from his early empoverished beginnings when as a 12 year old schoolboy he
embarked on a career as a surgeons apprentice finishing only a few years later as a
qualified practitioner on his emergence as a graduate of the New University of London. The
way was hard and full of difficulty as he fought not only his poverty but the prejudice and
snobbery of the time, two barriers that were never to be far from his everyday existence
throughout the whole of his life.<P>

 His subsequent career was varied and full of controversy
as he campaigned against the Establishment and their entrenched views as he sought to
improve the lives and health of the poor either by his own actions or by cooperation  with
other pioneers of the new Public Health movement. He was a friend and collaborator with
many distinguished figures of the day and through his membership of many of the scientific
societies, for whom he often worked with great energy and vigour using their platforms to
broadcast his ideas.<P>

He was a prolific writer and lecturer who appealed both to specialist
professional groups as well as lay audiences and through his communications as well as his
indefatigable actions had an enormous impact on Victorian Society which laid the
foundations for many of the  improvements and advantages we enjoy today. Sadly
Victorian Society failed to give him the financial reward nor the professional preferrment his
talents and endeavours merited and it is only today that we begin to recognise his real
stature and his son, Sir Edwin Ray Lankester is better known than he.<P> 

Hopefully this
absorbing and highly readable  biography which sheds so much light on the pain and
problems of Victorian England as well as the life of its great figures will  go a long way to
remedy the situation.<P><BR>

<A NAME="intro"></A>
Most Microscopists soon find that their  hobby leads them into a search for books related
to Microscopy and its techniques for use in specialist areas of microscopical research or
for the identification of specimens seen through the microscope. Over the past one
hundred and fifty years many titles have been published which still have interest and
practical value.<P>

There are too, the modern works, particularly related to the practical
aspects of Microscopy and to the examination and identification of specimens, which
merit consideration for inclusion in a personal library. The question is often asked  "which
are the best books  and where can find them"?  Whilst there is no simple answer to
this question it is possible to suggest titles  of  books worth acquiring or, where these are
not available for purchase, of  borrowing either through a local library or through
membership of one of the microscopical societies such as the Quekett or the Postal
Microscopical Society  both of which arranges book loans for members.<P>

In the coming
months reviews of recent titles as well as of older works will  appear in this section of
Micscape together with information about sources of supply which in the case of modern
titles would normally mean an academic bookseller (smaller bookshops often charge a
premium for non stock items). Small publishers often supply books direct. Older and out
of print titles can often be obtained through second-hand bookdealers who will often
search for a title for an enquirer. NB avoid those dealers who make a charge for
bookfinding,  particularly if this is a weekly charge, the costs can become astronomical. <P>

Some books which can be recommended include :-<P>
<A NAME="dallinger"></A>
<CENTER>THE MICROSCOPE AND ITS REVELATIONS<BR> by William B Carpenter. <BR> Revised by W H
Dallinger. 7th. Edition 1891. J & A Churchill 1099pp. Illustrated.</CENTER><P>

 Illustrated  in black and white and colour this is one of the great classical texts on
Microscopy.  The first six editions were produced under the hand of  W B Carpenter and
chronicled  the major developments in microscopy during the first  two thirds  of the 19th.
Century  but by the late 1880s there had been so many developments of a revolutionary
nature, particularly arising from the work of Abbe,  that an almost complete rewrite of the
book became necessary. W H  Dallinger undertook this mammoth task  doing  much of
the writing himself but bringing in as collaborators some of the great experts of the day 
such as Abbe himself  who checked the optical aspects based on his work, E M Nelson,
Van Heurck, Henry Clifton Sorby and many others. The book thus reflects  the state of
the art and science of microscopy at the end of the 19th. Century.<P>

 The first third of the volume  deals with the optical aspects of Microscopy ranging from
the Laws of Optics to Studies in Interpretation and taking in the ergonomics of Microscopy
en route. The mathematical aspects are lucidly expounded and are not beyond the
understanding of anyone with a basic grasp of algebra.  The  Preparation, Mounting and
Collection of Objects is dealt with in detail, many of the techniques described still being
relevant today. The last half of the book  is a systematic examination  of differing forms
of plant and animal life through the microscope. The text is elegantly written in the now 
archaic but still attractive style of the nineteenth century. The near 900 illustrations can
only be described as superb, this is particularly true of the 22 colour plates  whose visual
attraction easily competes for many   with modern colour reproduction. <P>

This is a volume worthy of acquisition and use. It is usually found bound in green buckram 
at a price range of  30-45 depending on condition, the leather bound copies
commanding a higher price.<P>

The two volume Eighth  Edition of 1901 whilst containing much of the content of the
Seventh brings things up to date to the present century. Its scarcity, particularly as a
complete set, is reflected in the higher price usually asked.<P>

<A NAME="contrast"></A>
<CENTER>CONTRAST TECHNIQUES IN LIGHT MICROSCOPY<BR> by Savile Bradbury and Peter J
Evennett. <BR>Bios Scientific Publishers 1996. 118pp. Illus. 16.95. ISBN 1-85996-085-5</CENTER><P>

Number 34 in the Royal Microscopical Society Microscopical Handbook Series, this book
will be one of the most useful to the amateur Microscopist although many so-called
experts and professionals  will find much in it that will improve the quality of their
microscopic image making. The authors describe the interactions of light and the
specimen in the microscope in relation to the manner in which they are used to generate
contrast in the image of the specimen. Providing both theoretical background and
practical advice they show  how the interactions are  used in practice and provide many
case studies of contrast enhancement.<P>

After an examination of "Fundamental
Considerations" which influence the contrast technique used they examine  Bright  Field
and Dark Ground techniques for both transmitted and reflected light as well as the all
important effects of the Refractive Index of the mounting medium used to surround the
specimen. Further sections of the book deal with Phase,  Modulation and Interference
Contrast, Fluorescence Microscopy and  means of Enhancement of Contrast in the
Image. An extremely lucid consideration of the Becke Line, the refractive differences
between specimen and mountant, is particularly useful.<P>

Written by two of todays outstanding teachers of Microscopy, whose courses and lectures
have done so much to improve the standards of the practice of Microscopy world wide,
their clearly written and well illustrated book provides those who have not been fortunate
enough to attend their lectures in person  with easily understandable access to Contrast
Techniques which have the potential to improve not only the quality of the of the scientific
observation possible with the microscope but also the pleasure derived from it.<P>

The examination of ready made slides purchased with a microscope soon becomes
boring especially for young beginning microscopists  who wants to reach out and see
more of the miniature world around us. This usually includes the wish to prepare mounts
at home first of a temporary kind and later those which can be kept as part of a growing
permanent collection.<P>

To meet the needs of amateur  microscopists Eric Marson, one of
the worlds most prolific microscopical mounters,  has for more than half a century
prepared slides for sale on every conceivable subject. He has as well provided a source
of  low cost microscopical stains and other reagents suitable for the use of amateurs. <P>
Also to meet their needs he began the production many years ago of what is now a series
of 18 low cost booklets only a few pages in length, which contain the basic information on
a specific microscopical topic and on the materials required, together with advice on their
use, to undertake the preparation of slides. Still available as individual booklets, useful to
lay flat  for use at the bench,  they have since 1983 been available bound as a complete
volume providing  a compendium of information for beginners and more experienced
microscopists alike.<P> 
Using a step by step approach the subjects dealt with range from 
"Looking at Everyday things" to the preparation of wax imbedded sections and taking in
the dissection of honey bees and spiders and "How to use the Microscope" en route.
Using simple language and diagrams the information in the book is both easy to
understand and follow both by non specialists and experienced amateurs both of whom
will find  a great deal of interest and help between its covers.<P>

<STRONG>Footnote</STRONG><BR>
The leaflets are still available as individual titles at 20p plus postage
The author will supply the book direct at a cost of 5.00 plus  600gm. postage. UK 1.25,
2.62 Europe and 4.99 USA. He is prepared to supply at very advantageous reduced
rates to bulk purchasers and stockists including societies and clubs. Contact him at NBS

<CENTER>WHICH ? GUIDE TO COMPUTERS <BR> by Richard Wentk. Which ? Books Revised Edition 
1996 288pp. Illus 10.99 including post and packing<P></CENTER>


This is a book that should be welcomed by any computer user and particularly those
embarking on an exploration of the Internet for which special equipment is required. This
fully  revised and updated edition reflects the new developments and the speed of the
changes which have taken place since the first edition only one year ago. The book cuts
through the technical jargon to explain the basics of computers, what they are and what
they can do the author giving warnings against the computer industries attempts to lure
novices into over spending. He shows how to choose the best  outfit to suit ones own
needs from the vast array of competing hardware and software available. The book
explains the differences between "Good" and "Bad" software suggesting ways of trying
out software for free and explaining where to find low cost alternatives  to the popular but
expensive big name productions. <P>

In addition to demystifying the industry jargon and explaining multimedia software and
hardware he takes a realistic look at the importance of Windows 95 and provides a
revised and expanded section on the uses and abuses of the Internet.<P>

Much useful Health and Safety  advice is given from how to protect both oneself  from
health hazards  and accidents as well as equipment failure and crime to the  loss of
irreplaceable information that could be worth more than the equipment. On Line services
are examined and compared and warnings are given about the pros and cons  of
extensive Internet use and the financial consequences. <P>

This is a low cost book  from a  totally independent  and highly professional world leading
consumers  organisation and could well be an investment for both novice and
experienced  computer user.<P>

The book can be obtained from most bookshops or in the UK by telephoning Freephone
0800-252100.<P>

COASTAL MARINE ZOOPLANKTON - A Practical Manual for Students<BR>

by C D Todd, M S Laverack and G A Boxshall.  <P>

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS 2nd. Edn. 1996.<BR> 106pp. illus. 15.95.   ISBN 0-521-55533-7.</FONT></CENTER><P><BR></STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Most coastal waters provide a rich source of  zoological material for microscopical study and even the briefest of trawls will usually produce enough and varied specimens to keep any naturalist occupied for many an   hour of  fascinating viewing and research. One of the problems for the tyro marine biologist is the identification of specimens which often because of damage done during collecting have little resemblance  to the complete line illustrations of text books,  many of which are composite drawings in most cases in publications inaccessible to the non professional.<P>

This fully revised Second Edition of the manual provides a photographic guide to representative forms of the major groups from medusae and comb jellies to larval fish and squid and   contains both information on taxonomy and morphology as well as black and white photographs of live specimens which are of excellent quality . These illustrations of fresh specimens are thus free of the changes in colour, form and overall transparency found in preserved material and so provide a better guide to identification. <P>

The book has an excellent introductory section giving a guide to more detailed sources of information on taxonomy and identification for those wishing to go further with their enquiries. There is no information on the collection of marine plankton but this is easily available elswhere and thus does not  detract from the excellence of the work as a practical guide for identification for use by students whether on formal courses  in academe or those amateurs and natural historians seeking only interest and enjoyment.<P><BR><BR>



<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 color=darkblue>A STUDENTS GUIDE TO THE SEASHORE <BR>

by J D Fish and S Fish<P>

 CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS.  Second  Edition 1996. 564pp. Illus.<BR>

 Paperback 19.95  (US $39.95) ISBN 0-521-46819-1 or<BR> Hardback 55.00, (US $105.00)

ISBN 0-521-46279-7 </font>
</CENTER><P><BR>


There are numerous " popular " guides to the seashore as well as detailed and highly specialised taxonomic works dealing with one group. That kind of book tends to fall between two stools and the lack of a guide such as this which describes both  the biology and identification of over 600 common and widespread animals and plants of the seashore has been felt for some time. <P>

The book is in every way a scientific text and gives no quarter or compromise in the accuracy and precision  of its content yet the clarity of language and the excellence of the illustrations is such that the content is easily accessible to amateur naturalists as well as students and academics. The book opens with a succinct description of the factors which contribute to the seashore environment followed by an excellent  twenty page illustrated identification Guide aimed at helping readers who are unable initially to  asign an organism to its correct Pylum or Class. <P>

This Guide gives the general characters  under nine main groupings which are then broken down into subdivisions which are described and illustrated with page references to detailed information, further illustrations and  easy to use  keys for identification. The book provides a means of ensuring rapid and accurate identification of organisms together with sufficient information to gain an understanding of their biology and their place in the life of the seashore.<P>

The extensive Glossary and comprehensive Bibliography are a bonus in a book that is as much a must for any Microscopist or Field Naturalist visiting the seashore as it is for those undertaking formal courses of academic study of coastal environments.<P>

<TITLE> MICROSCOPY UK / MICSCAPE REVIEW - Leeuwenhoek Legacy by Brian Ford </TITLE>

<H3>THE LEEUWENHOEK LEGACY by Brian Ford</H3> BIOPRESS 1991 185pp. Illus. 29.95. ISBN 0-
948-73710-7</CENTER><BR>

Because of Leewuenhoek's place in  history as one of sciences great names, a plethora  of books
and papers of varying quality and detail, many containing much guesswork, have been written
about him. When I first saw this title I groaned inwardly and said ' oh not another '. The
provenance of the book and the enviable track record of its author  Brian Ford tempted me to
investigate  further and my original view was quickly dispelled as on opening the volume it was
soon evident that this was not only  a major work of scientific scholarship but also a superbly
written historical detective story. <P>Brian Ford's priveleged access to the strong rooms of the Royal
Society gave him the opportunity to examine some of Leeuwenhoek's original material sent to the
Society some 300 years ago. This included correspondence to which were attached small
packets of  biological specimens including sections and serial slices. Using a carefully designed
programme of microscopical investigation these specimens were subjected to a series of
examinations using Leeuwenhoek's own microscope as well as modern methods of optical and
electron microscopy.<P>

The methodology of the investigations and the findings are described in detail by Ford, who first
sets Leeuwenhoek in a historical perspective, going on  to describe the letters and the attached
specimens. The various techniques of the investigative microscopy and their findings are
illustrated by comparative photographs which form the bulk of the book. The clarity of the
illustrations and the detail of the supporting text  demonstrate the undoubted accuracy of
Leeuwenhoek's own observations and the excellence of the instruments he used. The
development of these and descriptions of the known extant instruments form the concluding part
of the book.<P>

One envies Brian Ford his priveleged opportunity to carry out this research  which was not only
an act of scholarship but at the same time an activity which must have been fascinating and fun
to undertake. It was also a task of great responsibility which cannot have been undertaken lightly
and one in which he and his colleagues succeeded beyond measure. He makes his readers part
of the experience by sharing it with us through the clearly presented words and pictures of his
book, which will undoubtedly become one of the Great Works of  the  literature of the history of
microscopy.<P>


All Biopress titles are available from BIOPRESS Ltd. The Orchard, Clanage Road, Bristol  BS3
2JX, UK at the prices marked plus 5 per volume for postage and packing.<P>

The "Quekett" is a Scientific Society which exists for the friendly exchange of ideas
between people interested in light microscopy. It was begun well over a century ago for those
using the microscope as a recreation, but many professionals have always been members.  Some 
members are experts in their fields but are glad to share their knowledge with other members, whether
they be experts themselves, novices, or amateur microscopists. It is this friendly exchange which has
come to be the strength of the Quekett.

<HR><BR>          
            Desmids a microscopic form of freshwater algae, exude mucilage, a 
          transparent or almost transparent gelatinous substance, sometimes in 
          copious quantities that can be easily seen under a microscope using normal 
          transmitted light, for example in the desmid genus <EM>Hyalotheca</EM> which forms 
          long filaments.  In other genera it may be only faintly seen, if at all, 
          and phase contrast or some method of staining will have to be used to show 
          the extent of the mucilage.<P>
          
                 In my article (Micscape Dec.95) <EM>Some Observations on Freshwater 
          Algae</EM> I referred to using Alcian blue in my experiments on <EM>Astrococcus</EM> the 
          mucilage envelope of which did not not absorb the stain, although desmid 
          mucilage always does. I also mentioned the use of diluted Indian ink the 
          method shown here. A little diluted ink is placed on the slide next to the 
          cover glass where it may spread under by capillary attraction or can be 
          drawn under by removing water from the other side of the cover with 
          blotting paper. <P>

            Fig 1. Shows, in transmitted light without stain, recently divided cells 
          of the rare saccoderm desmid <EM>Spirotaenia alpina</EM> Schmidle (1895).  New to

<IMG SRC="../images/ellsmuc2.gif" align=left hspace=6 border=1>
 Fig 2. With Indian ink added shows the 
          mucilage envelope surrounding the cells.   Size of cells 71.5 um long; 18.5 
          um. broad. In fig.1. the distinctive red ends to the chloroplast, can just 
          be seen in the older apices, those furthest apart. These appear in both 
          apices of fully mature cells. <P><BR><BR>

human endeavour of providing something of worth, not for financial gain, but simply
because they are driven down a path of love or passion to offer something they consider 
valuable to others. Often such a road can be long and winding, and may only be travelled
by many helping each other. Sometimes a single pioneer can make the journey alone filled
with the belief that others will follow.

<HR><BR>


            The Director of a local Nature Conservation Trust asked "what are
          desmids"  when I told him I had found some in a small acid bog at Hothfield
          in Kent. Twenty years ago I was asking the same question. The majority of
          Naturalists study birds, as is evident by the great number of books on birds
          published every year. Butterflies and flowering plants are also popular
          subjects. If you study flies; millipedes; spiders; or anything most people
          find repulsive you will be thought eccentric, if you study algae your
          mental condition will be considered unstable.<P>


          <STRONG>  ALGAE</STRONG><BR>


          Desmids are an attractive and unusual group of freshwater algae. They
          are microscopic flowerless plants without roots; stems; or true leaves. In
          fact complex single cells, some are the largest single cells in the Plant
          Kingdom, the largest can just be seen with the unaided eye.<P>

 Many of the
          more complex types are divided into two semi-cells by a distinct isthmus or
          constriction, once thought to be a pair of joined cells, hence the name
          desmid derived from 'desmos' Greek for a bond or chain.


  Desmids belong to
          a group of algae; the group includes some non desmid filamentous types;
          that come together, usually when their habitat is drying out, in a process
          known as conjugation to form resting spores, from which new plants will
          grow when the right conditions prevail (Fig.1). The more common method of
          reproduction is by the impossible mathematics of multiplying by dividing,
          usually at the constriction (Fig.2).<P>



            They possess three perfect planes of symmetry and exhibit an incredible
          diversity of shapes as illustrated (Fig.3).<BR>
            In addition to their remarkable variation in shape the cellulose walls
          of many species are ornamented with granules, spines or wart like
          protuberances arranged in complex, yet orderly and symmetrical patterns.
          They are coated in a clear jelly like substance known as mucilage which can
          be shown by adding Indian ink to the water (Fig.4). Some are joined
          together to form quite long filaments (Fig.5) which the beginner could
          confuse with the more common filamentous algae that forms 'blanket weed' on
          ponds.<P>

            Do they have common names? No , because they are not commonly seen !
          but don't let the scientific names deter you from studying them. I only
          know the meaning of a few of them and cannot pronounce many of them.<P>



           <STRONG> Desmids galore</STRONG><BR>
            An amazing 1200 species and varieties have been found in the British
          Isles. World-wide some 8000 species have been described. Most seem to
          prefer nutrient poor, acidic waters, the most prolific collecting sites in
          the British Isles are the <EM>Sphagnum</EM> bogs and peat pools of Scotland, Wales,
          & Ireland.  David Bellamy (1) refers to 'sheets' of desmids occurring in
          the peaty pools Thursley Common, Surrey.<BR>
            Another good reason for not extracting the peat and destroying these
          valuable habitats.<P>



            Some do occur in other parts of the British Isles, sometimes in large
          numbers but fewer species, including my home County, Kent. Indeed some of
          the earliest British records (150 years ago) are from near Tunbridge Wells.
          I have found fifteen species in Hothfield bogs, a dozen in a spring at
          Louisa Lake in Bedgebury Park, and even in temporary water in a plough
          furrow at Staplehurst I have collected a few species. Some I have found in
          garden ponds in Maidstone, probably introduced with fish or aquatic plants,
          or maybe brought on the feet of visiting birds. In one case exceptionally
          large numbers of individuals of a single species turned the pond water
          green (2).  Any freshwater, damp moss &c., may hold a few desmid treasures,
          the desmid hunter should always be on the alert for possible sites and
          always have some collecting bottles or plastic lunch bags and closures in
          his pocket.<P>

           <STRONG> What use are desmids</STRONG><BR>
            Well ! what use are human beings ? Like all organisms they have their
          place in the complex web of life.   Like other plants that contain
          chlorophyll, desmids live by capturing the sun's energy (photosynthesis).
          From carbon dioxide dissolved in the water they manufacture sugar and
          starch as food.  They;  and the food stored in them;  are consumed by
          Amoeba (3) and various other invertebrates (4) which are in turn eaten by
          other animals. Desmids are known to absorb large quantities of barium and
          strontium (5), thus they play a part in the re-cycling of these chemical
          elements in freshwater.<P>

          <STRONG>  Desmid twitching</STRONG><BR>
             To study the fascinating world of desmids and other microscopic
          freshwater life, you will only need the simplest collecting equipment. You
          WILL require a microscope with a magnification of 100 times and 400 times,
          this need not cost you more than a decent pair of binoculars. Look out for
          a good second hand model; Do consult a microscope club or society if in any
          doubt, they may help directly or put you in touch with someone living in
          your area.  Desmid hunting will make your walks and country outings much
          more interesting, You may become like myself a desmid 'Twitcher'.  GOOD
          HUNTING.<P>

<TITLE>Microscopy UK / MICSCAPE : Podophyra</TITLE>

<H1>MICSCAPE - Article: Podophyra </H1>
<h3>by Mike Samworth</h3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
 
<h2> 
Podophyra, a remarkable ciliate.
</h2> 
I have recently come across a very interesting cilate, Podophyra. I have
been watching this for the past few days, and it is always good to spend a
bit of time on one organism, reading about it and its like in various books
and generally immersing yourself in it.
<p> 
Podophyra is a ciliate protozoan, which means it is in the same phylum as
good old Paramecium. I say phylum and I must qualify this statement.
Ciliates are single-celled organisms that until recently were classified as
a subphylum within the phylum Protozoa. Since the protozoa are now part of
the Protoctista Kingdom, protozoa as a taxanomic group does not exist and
the previous subphyla such as the Ciliates have now become full-blown Phyla.
The phylum is divided into three classes of which Podophyra belongs to the
Kinetofragminophora. Within this class there is the subclass Suctoria, and
Podophyra is a suctorian.
<p> 
At first sight the suctorians would appear to have little in common with the
rest of the Ciliates since the adult cells are without cilia! However closer
inspection reveals that they do retain the kinetosomes (basal body of the
cilia) which are scattered throughout the cytoplasm and then passed on to
the larval form during budding. These kinetosomes give rise to cilia in the
normal way in these larvae.
<p> 
<img src="../images/podo.gif" align=left><b> Podophrya fixa approx. 220x</b>
Active Individuals <b>-{1}</b>, Cyst <b>-{2}.</b>
<p>

The most obvious suctorian feature are the hollow suctorial tentacles. These
often have knobs on the end like a pin-head. These tentacles are concerned
with food capture and ingestion, particularly of other protozoa and often
other ciliates. The majority of the group are sessile, and attach themselves
to a variety of submerged objects, including other organisms, often by means
of a stalk.
<p> 
Podophyra has a spherical to ovoid body on a hollow rigid stalk. The
tentacles are capitate (like pin-heads) and there are between 30-60
distributed over the whole body surface. There is no lorica and it readily
encysts. Reproduction is by exogenous budding, that is the ciliated larva
develops outside of, and therefore separates from the adult cell. This seems
to occur soon after feeding.
<p>
The mode of feeding involves gaining a firm grip on the prey eg. the ciliate
Colpidium with a tentacle. The knob at the end contains extrusomes which are
oragnelles used to  hold the ciliate by narcotisising it. Once the food is
captured, the cytoplasm is sucked down the arms into the body. The ciliate
remains alive as cytoplasm is sucked along the arm! After feeding the
cytoplasm of Podophyra takes on a rather granular appearance. The prey may
be released alive after feeding is complete, a most polite gesture!

<CENTER><H3>Lighting Techniques for the Novice Part I - Polarised Light</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/dwpol1.gif" height=57 width=427><P></CENTER>
<STRONG><CENTER>by David Walker</CENTER></STRONG><BR>

There are a number of lighting techniques in microscopy that can easily be used by the amateur with little cost to enhance the viewing of many objects. These include dark ground illumination, Rheinberg illumination, oblique illumination and cross polarisation. This is the first in a series of articles that attempts to provide a gentle introduction for the novice on how to use these techniques.<BR> An emphasis is placed on their practical application, rather than the theory because many books describe the theory but not necessarily how the amateur can use these techniques.<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/dwpol2.jpg"  height=136 width=180 align=left hspace=6>
Part I discusses how the novice can obtain and use polarising filters with the compound microscope (not the stereo) and is illustrated with images of crystals viewed using polarised light. How these images can be obtained and the type of subjects that can benefit from polarised light will be discussed in more detail in Part II.<P><BR><BR>



<STRONG>Polarised light - the bare essentials</STRONG><BR>
Normal light from the sun or microscope lamps vibrates in all directions perpendicular to the axis in which the light travels. If this light is passed through a polaroid filter only light vibrating in one plane is transmitted...it is now polarised light. If this light is then passed through a second piece of polaroid filter which has been orientated so that the plane of polarisation is parallel to that of the first filter, the light is transmitted. However, if the second filter is then turned through ninety degrees about the axis of light travel then no light is transmitted...the filters are in a situation called cross polars.<P>

If the above is unclear, then try taking two pairs of polaroid sunglasses and view through them both as you turn one....... at the point of cross polars very little light will pass through.<P>

To use polarising filters, place one filter, the polariser in the swing out filter holder beneath the microscope condenser and the second smaller filter, the analyser on the eyepiece (see below). If you don't have a filter holder or condenser ( some student microscopes don't ) place the filter in any convenient place between the light source and the specimen eg stick with plasticine under the stage.<P>

<STRONG>Obtaining polaroid filters</STRONG><BR>
Polaroid filters can be purchased quite cheaply in the small quantities required for the amateur, and a number of sources are suggested below.<P>

<STRONG>Clip-on polaroid sunglasses <BR></STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../images/dwpol3.jpg"  height=116 width=175 align=right hspace=6>
Most larger chemists (drugstores) or opticians sell the clip-on polaroid sunglasses for prescription glasses. In the UK they are usually less than five pounds and are cut to shape by the user to fit their glasses. Although not optically flat and of the highest quality, they are ideal for the amateur microscopist wanting to try polarised light techniques.<P>

All the images on this page were taken using these type of polarising filters.<P>

 A circular filter (or polariser) is cut out to fit the swing out filter holder under the microscope condenser found on most microscopes (use a paper template or existing filter for this holder to get the size right ).

A second much smaller disc (the analyser) is cut out to fit on the microscope eyepiece. The author prefers to lightly stick the filter on the eyepiece with plasticine, 'Blu-Tak' or similar thus allowing this filter to be rotated in use by turning the eyepiece. It is preferable to use a monocular head and single eyepiece for simple polarised light studies.<P>

<STRONG>Microscopy clubs<BR></STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../images/dwpol4.jpg" height=129 width=140 align=left hspace=6>
Some microscopy clubs purchase stocks of polarising filters, and resell in smaller quantities to their members. This is a good way of obtaining the higher quality optically flat filters. The Quekett Microscopical Club for example sell the high extinction HN22 polaroid sheets in 50mm squares for less than five UK pounds which is sufficient to make a polariser and analyser.<P><BR><BR>

<STRONG>Microscope dealers<BR></STRONG>
The suppliers who cater for the amateur also usually sell small quantities of polaroid sheets at a reasonable price and should also stock the precut filters that should fit specific microscopes although these will be more expensive eg typically 25 UK pounds for a polariser and analyser.<P>

<STRONG>What can be viewed in polarised light?</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/dwpol5.jpg"  height=137 width=130 align=right hspace=6>
Try viewing the subject under the microscope using polarised light and see! Focus the subject first with the filters off, then use the filters and turn the eyepiece to pass through the cross polar position. A wide variety of subjects benefit from viewing in polarised light, these include:<P>
<BR><BR><BR>
1) crystals of organic and inorganic compounds<BR>
2) natural minerals<BR>
2) insect parts <BR>
3) fibres<BR>
4) components fabricated in some plastics<BR>
5) certain biological subjects eg those containing keratin, chitin, starch grains, wood sections.<P>

More details and illustrations of subjects that can benefit from viewing under polarised light will be discussed in part 2 of this series.<P>

<STRONG>Image details<P></STRONG>

In order of appearance in article (as described on the slide labels):<P>

1) Salicine crystals<BR>
2) Magnesium platinocyanide<BR>
3) Salicine crystals - analyser turned to create a different set of colours<BR>

<CENTER><H3>Lighting Techniques for the Novice Part 2 - <BR>Crystals under Polarised Light</H3></CENTER>
<STRONG><CENTER>by David Walker</CENTER></STRONG><BR>

The first part of this article (now in the Micscape Library) introduced the technique of using polarised light in microscopy and suggested where to obtain polarising filters. I hope the attractive images of crystals under polarised light in the last article encouraged those unfamiliar with the technique to try it.<P>

In this second article, we look at some general techniques on how to prepare temporary crystal mounts and suggest materials available to the amateur which are worth studying. An emphasis is again placed on the practical aspects, because most textbooks on optical microscopy will describe why crystals and other materials create the effects observed under this form of lighting.<P> 

<STRONG>Join a microscopy club!</STRONG><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/poldw2b.jpg"  align=left width=120 height=125 hspace=6>
A strange remark to start this article? No not at all.  I believe the best advice to a novice is to join a microscopy club. Many of the 'tricks of the trade' which are not often found in textbooks, can be picked up by talking to fellow enthusiasts, many with a lifetime's experience of amateur microscopy. If you can't attend the meetings, most clubs have informative magazines or newsletters.<P>

Looking through the past ten years of magazines from three UK clubs the author belongs to, shows many tips for how to prepare crystal mounts, what chemicals are worth trying and how to make home-made gadgets such as simple light-bulb based heaters for drying or heating slides.<P>

<STRONG>Crystals</STRONG><BR>
The crystals of chemicals are probably the most popular subject for polarised light microscopy. There are two basic techniques for preparing the slide of the chemical for study .... a melt and by preparing a solution using a suitable solvent and allowing the solvent to evaporate. (Note that the preparation of thin sections of rocks and minerals is a specialist technique and will not be discussed).<P>

Whichever technique you try, use low magnifications (ie. objectives 3X-10X) on a compound microscope with the polariser and analyser filter. Scan the slide thoroughly at a low magnification and regularly rotate the analyser filter to create the different colours. Very often there may be a small section of a slide with a particularly attractive crystal arrangement or colour pattern ... record this if possible by photography or video.<P> 

The effects created largely depend on how the chemicals recrystallise ie the thickness, orientation and size of the crystals. <P>

<STRONG>Melt</STRONG><BR>
A melt is used mainly for organic chemicals which melt at relatively low temperatures, but it can also be used for inorganic crystals which 'contain' water (so-called water of crystallisation). The essence of the technique is very simple. Choose a safe means of heating in a well ventilated area a small amount of the powdered chemical on a microscope slide until it melts (don't overheat) and allow to cool.<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/poldw2c.jpg"  align=right width=150 height=114 hspace=6>
 A lot of trial and error is required to judge how to obtain the best slides for viewing. The rate of cooling, scratching/tapping the slide, introducing impurities or mixing two chemicals can all create different effects. With experience, some of these factors you can control to some extent, but every slide you make will be different, which is part of the fun!  If you don't like the result, remelt it and try again. It's a good idea to prepare a number of slides using the same chemical, and experiment with different heating and cooling regimes  to see which combination gives the best effects under polarised light. <P>

Don't forget to view some slides while they are crystallising under the microscope. The often rapid passage of colourful crystals across the field of view is well worth watching, and can be a challenge to video if you have the facilities.<P>

<A HREF ="../../prodir/indexpro.html#otheradds">Northern Biological Supplies (NBS)</A> in the UK can supply a prepared slide of santonin, an organic chemical which can be melted and crystallised repeatedly to view under cross polars. Two images of a santonin slide from NBS is shown at the head of this article and above right.<P>

<STRONG>Evaporation</STRONG><P>
<IMG SRC="../images/poldw2a.jpg" align=left width=175 height=122 hspace=8>
This technique is often used for inorganic chemicals that dissolve in water or with organic chemicals that dissolve in a solvent available to the amateur slide maker such as  isopropanol and xylene. Essentially a small amount of the saturated or nearly saturated solution of the chemical dissolved in the solvent  is prepared. A few drops of the solution are spread with eg a glass rod on the microscope slide (or prepare solution on the slide) and the solvent allowed to evaporate, either by gently heating or at room temperature. As with the melt technique above .... experiment! The drying rate and solvent are additional parameters to vary.<P>

With both the melt and evaporation technique it is worth preparing slides with and without a coverslip in place. With a cover slip the crystals will probably grow more slowly from the edges and maintain a thinner sheet of crystals, and it is fascinating to watch this growth as it occurs under the microscope.<P>

The crystals shown left above were prepared by Mike Samworth (a Micscape contributor) by dissolving a paracetamol tablet in methanol and evaporating to dryness.<P>

<STRONG>What chemicals to try</STRONG><BR>
A number of the early Victorian microscope slides of crystals for polarised light use chemicals that are now hard for the amateur to obtain, and in many cases use toxic or harmful chemicals such as thallium, barium, mercury and lead salts. Although the old prepared slides are worth seeking out on the second-hand market, the author does not recommend that the amateur attempts to procure these chemicals to make their own slides.<P>

However, there a number of safer chemicals that are accessible eg from your local pharmacist (drugstore) or supermarket in the small quantities required and which can be tried with the appropriate care. But the watchword is, always find out the safety hazard data on an unfamiliar chemical, adopt the usual precautions of skin and if necessary eye protection, don't ingest, store away from food etc ... and if in doubt, seek advice.<P>

A few suggestions for chemicals to try are as follows. Chemical solutions prepared from tablets may require filtering before allowing to crystallise.<P>

1) Tartaric acid, citric acid - (evaporate from solution in water).<BR>
2) Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) - try health food shops for tablets and dissolve in water. Vitamin C is a particular favourite with the experts, and can give impressive results.<BR>
3) Sodium thiosulphate - photographic film/paper fixative (use melt since contains water of crystallisation or evaporate from solution in water).<BR>
4) Potassium nitrate or ammonium nitrate - in fertiliser (evaporate from solution in water)<BR>
5) Try cooking salt (sodium chloride) - do you get any colours, if not why?<BR>
6) Headache tablets - try dissolving in water, filtering if necessary and evaporate to dryness.<BR>
7) Medicinal salts such as Epsom salts (magnesium sulphate), Glaubers salt (sodium sulphate), Smelling salts (ammonium chloride) - dissolve in water and evaporate to dryness.<BR>
8) Other pharmaceutical chemicals you may be to obtain such as urea, potassium bromide, salts of citric acid, tartaric acid etc.<P>

Not all chemicals will give colourful patterns under cross polars and at least one of the above won't. Try and find out why! Most of the introductory books on optical microscopy should have a section on using polarised light and a little basic crystallography.<P>

<STRONG>But is it art .... ?</STRONG><BR>
Many of the images of crystals under polarised light can be aesthetically very pleasing. Many microscopists are so taken with the effects that can be achieved, that they use the technique to create works of art. For example, with the right choice of crystals and preparation techniques,   images of surreal landscapes can be achieved.<P>

The <A HREF ="../../amateurs/qmc/mainqmc.html">Quekett Microscopical Club</A> publications have a number of articles discussing the aesthetics and methods of this aspect of polarised light microscopy (see Further Reading).<P>

<STRONG>Next month</STRONG>, in the final part of this series of articles we will look at the types of biological and other subjects that are worth viewing under polarised light.<P>

<H2> THE QUEKETT MICROSCOPICAL CLUB</h2><BR>
<h3>Founded 1865<BR><BR>
<i>incorporating</i><BR>
THE PHOTOMICROGRAPHIC SOCIETY<BR></h3>
</center>
<hr>
<center>
 <BR>

<h2>What the club has to offer</h2>
</center>
<center>
<h3>Meetings at the Natural History Museum</h3></center>
<img src="quek4.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=8 align=left>
<FONT SIZE=4>The club arranges a full programme of meetings. Besides formal lectures,

a <b>Gossip Meeting </b> is held most months , with informal demonstrations of apparatus
and specimens and an exchange of ideas in a relaxed atmosphere. A special interest of many members is photomicrography
and more recently - the use of video cameras and microcomputers in microscopy. Help and advice on getting started is 
assured from other members who have done their path-finding.
<p>
<img src="quek3.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=6 align=right>
The Quekett has been established for over 150 years and is always willing to try new ideas and techniques, making it
one of the most forward-looking clubs whilst maintaining
the best traditions and skills of the past. The gossip meetings provide the backbone of the club, providing a regular forum for skills 
and enthusiasm to percolate between members of different age groups and backgrounds.
</center>

<p>
<h3>The Library </h3>
Our library covers most aspects of Microscopy and allied topics. Most books can be borrowed by UK members, in person
or by post. Sets of slides are similarly available for borrowing, and in addition the Club has a fine reference of slides
which can be seen by arrangement.
<p>

<h3>Young Members</h3>
<img src="quek5.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=6 align=right>
There is a special class of membership for young people who vary in age from 5th
form to advanced student of under 21 where the subscription rate is almost halved
though the benefits remain in full. Young members are very welcome and can be
put in touch with other young members. Senior members of the club are often 
accomplished experts in their own fields and can therefore provide much help 
and encouragement to the younger ones. 
<p>
<h3>The Annual Exhibition</h3>
<img src="quek6.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=0 align=left>
Our major event is the <b>Annual Exhibition of Microscopy</b> each October, where members and others show
their work and inspire visitors to try things for themselves. On other occasions <b>tutorial sessions</b> are 
held for beginners, who learn rapidly under under the personal guidance of experienced members. All these meetings
are held in the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, which is an ideal setting for our interests, enjoying
the active support of the museum authorities.
<p>
<h3>The Annual Conference</h3>
A two-day conference is held each year by rotation in different parts of the country to bring together members from
those parts to hear a wide variety of speakers and to observe laboratory demonstrations of microscopical equipment 
and methods. (In 1997 it is being held in Bristol).

<h3>Field Excursions</h3>
<img src="quek2.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=6 align=right>
Field excursions are held several times a year. The members meet at good collecting sites under the guidance of 
expert naturalists. Much material for later preparation is obtained with plenty of advice on to deal with it.
These events are ideal for helping new-comers to learn more about microscopy as a dynamic hobby where detective
work, investigation, and study is linked to the real world and different environments. They can be great fun, and
provide an ideal place for members to relax and share their interests. 
<p>
<A name="publications">
<center>
<h3>Publications</h3>

<img src="queklog2.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=4 ></center><br>
Another strength is our publications. A Bulletin (in bound form) is currently issued twice a year, giving informal
records of meetings, news of events and the future programme. All members are encouraged
to contribute to this publication, for it is a helpful source of hints and tips and inspiration.
<p>

The Club's formal journal is called the <B>Quekett Journal of Microscopy</B> and this also is issued twice a year. Its circulation is 
world-wide and enables our overseas members to remain firmly linked to other members of the club despite being 
unable to attend the regular events in the UK. It is an exceptional source of papers on all aspects of light
microscopy, present and past, and with much emphasis upon the practical. The journal is well illustrated in line
and half tone, and past issues become a unique reference of very readable articles.
<p>
The journals are respected for their unique content and therefore are in demand even by non-members. Copies may be 
purchased by non-members. It is published on 1 April and 1 October each year and is available to <b>non-members</b>
for 30.00 pounds per annum in UK and Europe, 40.00 pounds (or 60.00 US Dollars) per annum elsewhere in the world.
Orders may be placed with any bookseller or with the <A href="joinqmc.html#contact">subscription manager</A>.
<p>
<I>The Quekett Journal of Microscopy</i> in addition to distribution to members, is acquired, either by purchase or
journal exchange, by over 60 scientific societies and libraries.

<h2>Characteristics of the digitized images</h2>

<h4>
<pre>
<ul>
<li>A grabbed image is immediately available in the 
PC ram for printing processing, storage or transfer
to any other application.

<li>The images are stored in 256 gray levels per pixel
(integration modes use 16 bits per pixel during grabbing)

<li>Images can be processed, filtered, mixed, extracted
manually or automatically

<li>User can write lines, rectangles or texts of any size
in the image

<li>A line function is also available for gray level analysis

<h2>Introduction and characteristics</h2>
<strong>Orion 4 is designed to work in the Windows 3 environment. A 32-bits version for Windows NT is being designed and will be available soon. 
Orion grabs images in any size between 16 x 16 to 4096 x 4096 pixels, 256 gray levels, from the SEM slow scan and photo modes. Practically, the exact image size is a function of the scanning characteristics.
<p>
Orion connects to ALL existing SEMs. Every SEM has a corresponding driver on disk which holds all the information to configure the board and establish a working range of desired image sizes (max. 64 images sizes can be defined per driver).
<p>
The connection is simple (4 wires) and the board provides <em>total electrical isolation</em> between the PC and the SEM electronics. This provides optimal security and unequaled image quality because of the suppression of the induced noise. It also protects your SEM against unwanted noise induction in the SEM video circuitry. The SEM electronics do <em>not</em> need to be modified in any way. The image quality you will get can be compared with the quality you would get with active systems, but without any risk.
<p>
You also get square pixels in any mode; this is useful for image analysis and avoiding distortion when the images are passed to other packages for display, processing, etc ...
<p>
Depending on the connection, it is possible to simultaneously grab two images (the Orion board has two video inputs), so you could grab an image from the SE detector, and another one from the BSE at the same time, in only one scan.
</strong>
<p>
<p>
<center><strong><a href="#about">Return to about...</A></strong></center>
<p>
<p>
<a name="system">
<h2>Orion system options</h2>
<strong>
<dl>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> Macro command interpretor</h3>
<p>
<dd>This extremely powerful function enables you to redefine nearly everything in the Orion package - buttons, main menu type, grabbing process.
    It can help you save time by executing different grabbing routines and functions depending on the current user.
    It can also be used to launch external tasks like a word processor or an image analysis system for immediate image processing.
    New commands are added to the interpretor nearly every week.
<p>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> EDX mapping channels</h3>
<p>
<dd>This facility for 'grabbing' allows superimposed elemental maps with grabbed image
    This option allows simultaneous grabbing of an SE or BSE image, and up to 8 EDX mappings channels. This option requires the use of         a VEGA board. All images are displayed simultaneously on the PC screen.
<p>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> Photo resolution replay board</h3>
<p>
<dd>This allows image to be sent back to the SEM photo device
    This very high resolution board connects to the Orion board and has a max. resolution of 4096 x 4096 pixels, 256 gray levels. Any         image up to that size can be sent to the photo device; usually the result quality is at least equal to the quality of the original         photograph.
<p>
<dt><h3><img src="../bullet.gif" align=top> HP Laserjet enhancement card</h3>
<p>
<dd>This produces photographic quality images on paper in 10 seconds print time.
    When it is required to print nearly photographic quality images at low cost, we propose to use the LazardPrint board. This board         prints in 150, 300 and even 600 true dpi, in 256 gray levels from a palette of 1024. The results are fast and impressive (10         seconds are usually required to print a 1100 x 1600 pixels image with a Pentium PC).

<dd>We have more specific solutions for the Philips XL series. These SEMs can easily be upgraded with an Orion system, in order to get much more resolution in X, Y and gray levels.
Also very special macros have been designed, that process .TIF images generated by the XL microscope. The images data (accel. voltage, working distance, micron bar ...) are extracted and reproduced at the exact scale in the Word 6 document, making their use much easier.

<H4>PRACTICAL MICROSCOPY<BR>
Tutor: J. Eric Marson<br>
Subject: Insect Life Histories<br>
</H4>
</center>
An ideal summer break for the amateur scoper: come and stay in 4 star comfort and learn
all about studying, preparing, and mounting insects under the gentle guidance of a 
expert - Mr. J. Eric Marson - a renowned English Microscopist.
<P>

<p>
<b>Under Study</b><br>
The Heterometabola are those insects whose young stages, known as nymphs, closely
resemble the adult in body form and type of mouth parts.
<P>
The Holometabola have young stages known as larvae, which differ markedly
from the adult in body form and mouth parts. So great is the difference between the 
larva and the adult, that an instar known as the pupa bridges the gap between them.
<p>
In most cases both the young stages and adult males and females will be mounted, but in some cases
where the adults are too large, only the young stages will be mounted.
<p>
During the course the following aquatic and non-aquatic insects will be studied, in the following order
of difficulty.
<p>
<OL>

<LI>Water Cricket (Velia)
<LI>Pond Skater (Gerris)
<LI>Water Scorpion (Nepa)

<font size=4>
We are a small NON-profit-making organisation originally based in the UK but now made up of amateur scopers, 
naturalists, microscopists, artists, writers, teachers, and software writers from different countries.
We share a common passion: we are all interested in the world around us!
More than this... we like to explore our world by understanding its construction
and maintenance from those things which remain almost secretively invisible because
they work on a tiny scale - a microscopic world! We are dedicated to promoting a fun and interesting way
to others of finding out a whole lot more about our amazing universe we live in.
<br>
<br>
It is difficult to define roles. We are a loosly knit bunch of people and we all help out on all aspects of 
running the various sites and co-ordinating non-web activities. You can contact any of us from the list below but
if you want a first point of contact, try your local Site or Site-Mirror Editor first, or pump your mail into the CENTRAL ADDRESS at the bottom of the page.
We are all amateurs. Don't let the fancy list of names and descriptions scare you off! We are just ordinary folk 
having a go at something worthwhile. Please write in and chat with us!

microscope in this price range.
<p>
The Wedmore range is designed to give a <b>modular approach</b> to microscopy, offering
a number of specifications which can therefore be <b>matched to budgets</b> and optical
requirements.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Abbe Condenser and Iris Diaphragm</b><br>
Irrespective of model, all Wedmore SP microscopes are equipped with a full substage 
Abbe condenser (N.A. 1.2), with iris diaphragm, filter carrier and full rack and pinion 
adjustment. The full size microscope stands are of a suitable die-cast construction, finished
in grey enamel and may be inclined for convenient operation.
<p>
<b>The Price Beater!</b><br>
The economic price of the Wedmore range allows the purchase of a full sized <b>professional</b>
microscope, incorporating <b>RMS standard thread acromatic objectives</b>, with full sub-stage 
condenser, for little more than the cost of sub-standard microscopes available. Now there is no
excuse for buying toy instruments when this quality instrument with glass optics can offer high
quality study and durable service at low prices.
<p>
<i><b>Looking for a starter instrument..? Then this is the scope for you!</b></i><br>
<h3>Just look at the specification:-</h3>
Quadruple objective turret, separate coarse and fine focus controls, square specimen stage
with slide clips, which can also accomodate a mechanical specimen driver, illumination by mirror and 
gimbal, which can be replaced by a substage 240v, 12 Watt lamp unit which provides optimum illumination 
at all magnifications.
<p>
<br>
<p>
<b>The wide range of accessories</b> include: measuring equipment, photography and drawing attachments, together
with a list which enables the basic unit <b>(SP01)</b> to be fully upgraded to the <b>(SP14)</b> on a pricemeal basis.
<i>Alternatively,</i> the Wedmore can be purchased with a complete specification <b>(detailed below)</b> at a price
advantage. The additional items available with the specification of each successive model are highlighted in bold
type. Remember, all models have coarse and fine focus and fully adjustable Abbe condenser with iris diaphragm as standard,
and may be fitted with a safety stop.

<h4><i>The Wedmore SP series Microscopes are now available with a four position turret as 
an optional extra. Ideal for those proposing to use a wide magnification range. Should you
require a four position turret, mark your order clearly and 5.00 UK Pounds surcharge to the
cost of all Wedmore models.</i></h4>
<p>

<h3>Drawing Attachment (BML003) Price: 19.00 UK Pounds</h3>

<IMG SRC="brun3i3.gif" alt="" align=right hspace=12>
The traditional camera lucida, or drawing attachment, is an accessory rarely
available, and yet is of great value to those who prefer a drawing record 
system to photography. Two units are available using either a prism system
which allows the observer to see both an image of the specimen superimposed
on to paper at the base of the microscope and , at the same time, a pen or
pencil or alternatively a mirror reflection system. With either system the
subject matter can simply be traced. Adaptors are available to convert
either type for stereomicroscopes. Both units will fit directly on to the
eyetubes of all compound microscopes listed in our current catalogue as
well as most others. In general terms the prism type is best suited to
mirror illumination microscopes and the mirror system is more effective
with microscopes that have in built illumination.

<p>
<br>
<h3>WEDMORE  SX  ADVANCED  MICROSCOPE <br>
Price: 195.00 UK Pounds</h3>
<IMG SRC="brun3i2.gif" alt="" align=Left hspace=12>


The SX301 is a high build quality microscope ideal for advanced school
and university course work, as well as for the discerning enthusiast.
The instrument is based on an enlarged and improved SP stand, with a finish
and attention to detail unequalled in a microscope of this price range.
<p>
The microscope has a <b>quadruple</b> objective turret, and is complete with x5,
x10, x45 and x100 (oil immersion) achromatic objectives giving an excellent
optical performance. The x6, x10 and x15 eyepieces provide a <b>magnification
range from x30 - x1500.</b> Particularly impressive is the large <b>integral
mechanical stage</b> with low position drop down coaxial controls, permitting
a combination of controlled movements. The stage is complete with double 
vernier scales which allows exact repositioning of slide subjects for
further study. The instrument has a separate coarse and fine focus
adjustment, with the latter being graduated for depth measurement.
<p>
The substage <b>condenser</b> has a separate rack and pinion focus control and is
complete with <b>iris diaphragm and filter carrier.</b> Illumination is by a
plano/concave mirror system or alternatively by a 240v detachable <b>lamp</b> unit
which fits in place of the mirror.
<p>
The SX301 is finished in grey enamel to
a high standard and is complete with wooden carrying case. The unit weighs
approximately 4 kilograms with a maximum height of 340mm.

tube units (both <B><I>monocular</I></B> and <B><I>binocular</I></B>) are inclined and fully rotatable
through 360 degrees with high performance x10 eyepieces. The rack and pini
on coarse focus mechanism provides 50mm of vertical movement, and the fine
focus mechanism has a notably smooth action with a range of 2mm. The large
square stage can be fitted with either a <B>mechanical specimen driver</B> with 
double vernier scales or slide clips depending on the model.
<P>
Irrespective of model type all microscopes are equipped with a full 
substage which includes an <B>Abbe condenser</B> with independent focus control 
(NA 1.25) and iris diaphragm. Specimen slides may be protected by a <B>focus 
stop</B> mechanism which may be adjusted to prevent over focus and damage to 
the high power objectives.

<!-Page 9 Image 1 Westbury  SP30 ->

The four position objective turret can be equipped with a choice from 
<B>x4, x10, x40, x63 or x100 (oil) objectives</B>, that are parfocal and of
excellent quality, with rubber syling inserts.

The models with inbuilt illumination have a 15 watt system controlled by 
an on/off switch, and have a <B>field focusing lens</B>, which can be easily
removed for bulb replacement. The large heavy base gives the Westbury
SP30 particular stability for a microscope of this class, and the mirror

<h2>SPECIMEN MEASUREMENT</h2>
The <b>measurement</b> of specimen dimensions with a microscope is normally under
taken by using an <b>eyepiece micrometer.</b> This is a glass disc with a scale
etched onto its surface, usually 10mm divided into 100 parts. The disc 
(micrometer) may be inserted into the eyepiece and sits upon the eyepiece
field stop which is a small ledge approximately half way down inside most
eyepieces. The top lens unscrews to make this possible. Alternatively a
micrometer eyepiece with a permanent fitting is used.
<p>
The image of the micrometer is superimposed upon the specimen image, both 
being in focus at the same time, and the specimen features or overall size
can be compared directly with the scale. The value of each eyepiece 
micrometer scale division depends upon the magnification of the objective 
being used. For each magnification, the eyepiece scale has to be calibrated
with a <b>stage micrometer.</b> This is a glass slide on which is etched a <b>real 
scale.</b> The value of each division of the eyepiece scale is then recorded
for each magnification option of the microscope.
<p>

Compound x10 eyepiece with micrometer (complete) (BM787) - 12.00 UK Pounds
Stage micrometer                                 (BM945) - 16.00 UK Pounds
Compound eyepiece micrometer disc.               (BM183) - 12.00 UK Pounds
</pre>
<hr>
<h2>POLARISER / ANALYSER</h2>
Illuminating specimens with <b>polarised light</b> can be particularly useful
ith geological material and also biological specimens that are 
<i>birefringent</i> such as hair and crystals. To see polarising effects a 
combination of two filters made from polaroid material are used. The first
 - the <b>polariser</b> is placed in the filter carrier of the microscope, and 
the second - the <b>analyser</b>  is fitted in the form of a cap over the viewing
eyepiece. When the analyser is rotated through 180 degrees compared to the
polariser, no light passes through except that which has travelled through
substances that are said to be birefringent - i.e. having the ability to
rotate light into a different plane of vibration. Such substances will then
show as bright objects against a black background. In geology the exact 
angle of rotation of the analyser needed to obtain maximum brightness of
the object can be used for identification purposes.

<h3>BRUNEL SP-10 ADVANCED MICROSCOPE</h3>
<p>
<b>The Brunel SP-10 is an advanced research standard microscope with an 
excellent finish and impressive optical performance. This range is avaliable
exclusively from Brunel Microscopes and is recommended as a quality 
microscope in either monocular, binocular or trinocular form.
</b>
<p>
The SP-10 has a four position objective turret with a precise internal index
ng mechanism. The DIN standard objectives are parfocal achromats with a 
rubber insert styling grip, and are matched with extremely widefield x10 
compensating eyepieces. The microscope heads are rotatable through 360 
degrees and have full eyetube dioptric adjustment. The trinocular head 
allows full light to the binocular element, or an 80/20 to the trinocular 
tube.

<!- Page 15 Image 1 Brunel SP-10 Binocular->

The large mechanical stage measures 160mm x 150mm and has  well positioned 
drop down coaxial controls with a double vernier. The substage condenser
(N.A. 1.25) has a full rack and pinion control mechanism and is equipped 
with an iris diaphragm and 32mm filter carrier.
<p>

<img src="brun5i2.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=6 align=left>

The SP-10 has been elegantly
designed and is finished in grey enamel, and has a build quality equal to in
struments of far greater cost that are considered the optical market leaders.
The microscope has low position coaxial coarse and fine focus controls, with
an adjustable <b>tension control</b> and <b>auto focus.</b> In addition the SP-10 has a 
fully adjustable focus stop to protect the high power objectives. 
<p>
The integrated solid state electronics controls a 6volt 20 watt tungsten 
<b>halogen</b> light source via an integral fuse, on/off switch, rheostat 
brightness control and indicator warning light. The bulb may be accessed 
via a simple trap door mechanism in the base of the instrument. The full 
field illumination is generated by a multiple element field lens.
<p>
The SP-10 can also be supplied with <b>planchromatic</b> objectives, <b>photomicrography</b>
and CCTV equipment. The range of accessories is extensive and includes <b>phase
contrast</b> objectives with matching condenser rings that are available for 
each magnification. This allows the selection of specific objectives without
the cost of a full phase contrast set for all the magnification range. 
Simple polarisation accessories can also be fitted.
<p>

<h3>
Various methods of accessing SimTel files
Revised: Mar. 17, 1996 
</h3>
<pre>
SimTel, the Coast to Coast Software Repository (tm), is located on
SimTel.Coast.NET, a host that (for security reasons) does not allow public 
access by ftp users, however its files are available by anonymous
ftp in directories:-
		 /SimTel/msdos
		 /SimTel/win3
		 /SimTel/win95
                 /SimTel/nt 
		 /SimTel/vendors 

on SimTel's primary mirror site:-   <strong> FTP.Coast.NET </strong>

and from the secondary mirror sites below.

The Simtel directory structure includes a dedicated directory for 
Microscopy Software. The following links below should take you
straight to a Simtel Mirror Site near you and right into the
microscopy directory, where you will be able to see a list of
Molcol Software's files and download the ones you want to try out!
</pre>
<br>
<hr>
<a name="list">
<p>
<center><h3>Go get the Software</h3></center>
<h4>
If any link below fails or is too slow,  pick another one from the 
list below. Simply find the row with a location closet to where you live and
then click on the entry in the <em>Go There</em> column. If you want 
to exit your browser and try using your ftp software directly, you need
to combine the Name of the 'Simtel Mirror Site' with the 'Go There' directory-
filename to form an FTP address. For example, from the first entry in the table:-
<p>
<center><strong> ftp to: </strong> archie.au/micros/pc/SimTel/msdos/microscp/</center>
<p>
<em>There should be no need to do this:</em> just use the comprehensive <em>Live
Links</em> below to grab the software! Be patient during the connection
time as initial delays may be caused as the server searches for the correct
directory.

<B>ABOUT MOLCOL SOFTWARE</B><BR>
Molcol Software (that's me) are the pioneers of Microscopy Software for general and educational use. Our Version 3.0
of Microscope for the PC is already in use at schools in different countries and by the general public at home. This 
'First in the world' virtual microscope package enables all people to enjoy the incredible world of the very small 
without any additional hardware except a standard PC. Four years in the making, it brings a major tool to the world's
educationalists, it's people, and existing Microscopists.
<p>
The project is run as a commercial venture only because such protocols are needed under the UK taxation system. All 
profits received by me trading as Molcol Software is used to further the promotion of Microscopy, Biology, and 
their importance and enjoyment to more people in the world. It is a personal endeavour driven by love and respect
for the study of life. Most of the funds received are now used to support this web site in the UK.

This is my favourite one. It is commonly known as Bramble Brand, <em>Phragmidium bulbosum</em>.
It is a mould found on Bramble leaves and these are the spores scrapped from one such leaf. You
can often see tiny brown specks covering bramble leaves, each speck is 'raised' from the leaf 
surface. Now you know what it looks like under a microscope. If you want others to see your

The Theory
</strong></EM></FONT><br>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="000066"><EM><strong>
To make a slide, we need to create an extremely thin well or cavity on a glass
slide in which to place our specimen and our Fructose mounting solution. There are many ways 
of doing this. We could, for example, use pieces of a broken cover slip and stick these onto
the glass surface of a slide. Ultimately, the cover slip would sit-down onto these pieces - which
prevent the specimen from being crushed.
<p>

I'd like to show you a better and safer way. First of all, take a look at 
</strong></EM></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="00aa66"><EM><strong>Fig. 2</strong></em></font> 
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="000066"><EM><strong>which shows a sketch I made for you.
<img src="sugfig1.gif" width=269 height=199 align=left border=1> Does this give you an idea of how we will build a well
on the slide?
<p>
We will use PVA glue to create a thin wall that will run just inside the edges of the cover slip.
PVA glue is ideal for this. It can be painted onto glass and dries very quickly. Some specimens, like my
flea - for example, will require a higher wall to ensure the cover glass does NOT sit on the specimen
itself. We can build our well to be as deep as we like simply by adding layers of PVA glue after the previous
one has had time to dry.
<p>
<br clear>
<img src="rightway.gif" width=27 height=47 align=right>

Let's do our PVA glue wall now together. Lay your slide on top of a cover slip, ensuring
that the slip itself is centrally placed under the glass slide. By doing this, we can see 
see where the edges of the cover slip will be when - in a later stage - we fix the slip on 
top of the slide.
<p>
<img src="sugfig2.jpg" width=293 height=214 align=right vspace=8 border=1>
Take a fine paintprush and moisten it. Maybe you should put some water in an eggcup and keep it close
to hand for this purpose. Now open up your PVA glue, or lightly squeeze some out and gently dip the tip of the brush into the milky
white liquid. You only need a tiny amount of glue. Do not overload the brush. With a steady hand, 
paint a fine line onto the top of the glass slide just inside where you can see the edges of the cover slip
beneath it.
<br clear>
<p>
<img src="idea.gif" width=38 height=47 align=left>
It's important to try and maintain a continuous line of equal thickness and depth all the way round.
You can remoisten the brush and reload it with glue as you go, but remember to shake off excess water from the 
brush before loading it with glue. If you have problems holding the glass slide still and in position on top
of the slippery surface of the cover slip, try this instead:-
<p>
Put a glass slide on a sheet of paper and draw a line around it with a pen or pencil. 
Place a cover slip centrally in the rectangle drawn and trace around this with your pen.
Now you can use your drawing as a template by laying the glass slide on top of it instead
of the cover slip when painting on the PVA glue.
<p>
After you have completed the PVA line, put the slide to one side for the glue to dry. It will 
be ready quicker if you put it somewhere warm. I sit mine on top or near a central heating
radiater and they dry in a few minutes. You'll know when the glue is dry because it changes 
colour from white to nearly transparent.
<p>
You may wish to make several slides in your first batch. If so, preapare a few more and put these
aside to dry.
<p>
<img src="dontmiss.gif" width=27 height=47 align=left>
Take a look at the specimen you are going to use for your slide. Is it as big 
as a flea? In my first batch, I made slides of a flea, pollen grains, hairs from a leaf, and 
a mould found on bramble leaves. The first two required me to build up
a PVA wall in several layers to ensure the specimen would 'sit' down properly
inside the well. If you fail to put on enough layers, you won't be able to get
the cover slip to settle down on the dried glue properly!

Variations

<br>

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
There are several ways you can prepare subjects for immersion in the Fructose.
One way is to put a tiny amount of the solution into a clean small dish or egg
cup. Put your specimen into this, being careful not to introduce air bubbles,
 and leave it for a few days for some of the water to evaporate - leaving the solution much thicker! 
<img src="idea.gif" width=38 height=47 align=left>
If you wish to try this method, stand the eggcup or small dish between two pencils and rest an up-turned tumbler or
glass over the eggcup but resting on the pencils. This will allow air to flow through but
prevent dust from falling into the solution! It is a good idea to at least soak your specimen in Fructose
for a night so that the solution can seep into its structure.
<p>
<img src="secret.gif" width=23 height=43 align=left>
When you have been an amateur microscopist for a while, you will learn different ways of using 
chemicals to help clean and fix the specimen prior to mounting it in the fructose solution. I am
deliberately skipping this important step here because it involves using chemicals which are normally
highly inflammable or slightly toxic. As this is your first slide-making try, I wanted to keep the 
process as simple as possible.
<p>
Another method of preparing the specimen for the fructose is to place it into some clean water. For example, I plunged
some leaves from a New Zealand bush  into boiling water and left them in there overnight. This helps to force 
air out of the plant which, if not done,  would prevent fructose mountant from seeping into the leaf's structure.
I scraped a leaf's surface with a razor blade to remove the hairs into a saucer containing a few drops of fructose
solution diluted heavily with water. Lets use this as my example for the best way of proceeding.

</STRONG></EM></FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="0000ff"><EM><strong>
This is what you do:-
</STRONG></EM></FONT>
<p>
<p>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="000066"><EM><strong>
Using a smooth implement like a knitting needle (I use a slim glass rod),
insert the tool into your jar of Fructose solution. Remove it and bring its point
down into contact with your glass slide, ensuring the point of contact is centrally
inside the 'well'. Let the Fructose drop slip down onto the slide. 
<p>
You need to judge how big a droplet to leave on on the slide. You should be aiming to 
lay down a drop big enough that when you finally place a cover slip on top, the solution 
will spread out and fill up the PVA-glue formed well. In the long run, trial and error 
will enable you to judge this. You simply repeat the action to build up a bigger drop
of solution in the well. 
<p>
<img src="rightway.gif" width=27 height=47 align=right>Work carefully and precisely trying to 
avoid introducing air bubbles into the droplet. When you think you have enough solution in the 'well', position
your specimen on the slide by pushing it gently into the frustose droplet.
I used my glass rod to pick up a drop of watery solution (containing plant hairs) from the saucer and introduced
this to the Fructose droplet on the slide.
</STRONG></EM></FONT>
<p>



<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=6><EM><STRONG>
Lowering the lid<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Take the cover slip and, either using tweezers, or holding it gently between index finger
and thumb, breathe two or three times rapidly onto its surface.<img src="rightway.gif" width=27 height=47 align=right> This is to moisten it
which will help the Fructose to run without trapping air when we lower the slip onto the slide in a moment!
<p>
Working quickly, lower the cover slip down onto the droplet, keeping the edges aligned with 
the PVA-glue on the slide. Just before the Fructose droplet comes into contact with the underside
of the cover slip, release the slip - letting it float down onto the PVA glue walls. The Fructose should
spread out across the underside of the slip and fill the 'well' without leaving any air gaps. 
<p>
Check! If the slip is not resting squarely on the dried PVA glue walls, gently slide the cover slip sideways
until it properly position. If you find you have used too much Fructose mountant - causing it to leak out 
onto the glass slide itself - use moistened cotton buds or tissue paper to gently clean and wipe the spilled
fructose away. Ensure you leave the area around the cover glass as clean as possible.
<p>
Right, how did you do?
<p>
You may find you have air bubbles trapped under the cover glass. If these are very few and not 
all over the specimen itself, leave it be. If you have a lot of them, it might be best to recover
the slide, cover glass, and specimen by placing the whole thing in a saucer of warm water.
You can clean the glue from the slide by peeling it off. Dry and clean the glass slide and slip and reuse it again 
for another go.
<p>
This is what may be causing air bubbles to form at this stage:-
<p>
<ul>
Too small a drop of Fructose used.<br>
Cover slip was not moist enough.<br>
Cover slip was not clean enough.<br>
Fumbling around as you let the cover slip go.<br>
</ul>
<P>
Before I move on to  the next stage, here is a recap of what you need to do to get
to this point:-
<br>

<img src="sugfig3.jpg" width=129 height=319 align=right border=1>
<p>
(a) Position the cover slip under the slide.<p>
(b) Brush on layer/layers of PVA glue.<p>
(c) Place Fructose Drop and specimen in the well.<p>
(d) Lower the cover slip (after breathing on it).<p>
(e) Ensure slip rests on the 'well' walls squarely.<p>
<br clear>
<p>
If you are satisfied with your slide or slides up to this point, put them
somewhere warm for a few hours or better still, leave them somewhere dust-free (remember the pencils
and tumbler tip) for a day or two. 
<p>
However, if you are in a rush - like me - just make sure the area around the cover slip is dry, free of water and
spilled fructose, and carry on as below.

Nail Varnish
</strong></EM></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
You now need to use the nail varnish to seal the cover slip to the slide.
Nail Varnish comes with its own little brush. Use this by wiping off the excess
when taking the brush from the bottle. Dab a drop of the varnish on the very edges 
of the cover slip in each of its 4 corners. Each drop should be half on the cover slip
and half on the glass surface of the slide itself. The idea here is to fix the cover slip
to the slide so that it doesn't move around in a moment when we paint right around the
edge of the cover slip with the varnish.
<p>
Take care when applying the dabs so as not to move the cover slip or spill varnish
onto the central area of the cover slip. Put the slide to one side for 5 minutes to
let the varnish dry. Be sure to return the brush to the bottle right away so the 
varnish doesn't dry on the brush itself.
<p>
<img src="sugfig4.jpg" width=147 height=84 vspace=8 hspace=8 align=right border=1>
When the 4 spots have dried on the slide, carefully run the nail varnish brush all
around the edge of the cover slip. The edge of the cover slip and the surface of the 
glass slide up to about 1/8 inch around the slip should be covered in one continuous
line. The idea here is to completely seal the edge of the cover slip where it meets
the glass slide.
<p>
Put the slide to one side and let the varnish dry. It will take about 5 minutes in
a warm room, and then you can apply another layer on top of the first one. Work quickly
so the solvent doesn't melt the first layer as you sweep the brush over it!
<p>
<img src="sugfig5.jpg" width=318 hspace=8 height=210 align=left border=1>

Here's one I made so you can see just how wide a strip of nail varnish
to apply. Look at it carefully. Can you see all the elements we have 
spoken about so far? You should be able to see the PVA glue beneath the 
cover slip. To do a proper job, write out a tiny label and sellotape it
to the slide as I have done here in Figure 5.

Enamel Paint
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>

<img src="rightway.gif" width=27 height=47 align=left><br>
At this point, your first slide is finished but if you want to do it the right
way, you should apply a layer of enamel paint once the varnish has dried. The paint
must be painted on as you did the varnish. 

<p>
<img src="sugfig6.jpg" width=314 height=193 hspace=8 align=left border=1>
<p>
Here's one I did! Notice that I didn't apply enough Fructose Mountant in this
one which has left some air bubbles under the cover slip. They are well out
of the way of the specimens in the middle, so I decided not to recover the slide
but keep it instead. 
<p>
After all that, I guess you want to see what my slides look like under the Microscope.
Okay then... pick from these 3 I made. Alas, I can't show you the flea one cos I broke
this accidently one night while I was looking at it under the scope: my first broken
slide!

Note: The first use of Fructose as a Mountant is attributed by Langeron to Michaelis.
It does not crystalise, preserves well, and works effectively with specimens stained
with carmine or coal tar. Haematoxylin fades slightly.

Did you ever make your own slide? You did, huh?! Well, maybe you did or maybe you didn't
but what I want to do is tell you here right now how to make a slide using NON-VOLATILE CHEMICALS. I also
want to show you how easy it is to make a batch of slides all in one evening.
<p>
We've gotta get a few things straight right away though if we're gonna be working together: first of all - I aint
no scientist or purist. I like a beer, I like to do a lot of other things besides messing around with 
looking into small stuff... so if you would prefer to hunt around the web and find yourself a 10 year 
lesson on how to suss out this Microscopy stuff, then that's fine by me. But I'll tell you something right 
away, it just aint necessary. If you don't believe me then hang on in thru this first lesson and see how easy
it is to make a REAL specimen slide yourself. Now most of the super Amateur Microscopists spend years before they 
try this so if you stick with me, you'll slip into the fast lane and get your first slide made about 365x 
quicker than most people and without doing a degree in chemistry.
<p>
One more thing... I like to write how I speak so you might find my use and distortion of the old Brit language
a bit strange. I hope you stay with me though cos (er... that means 'because') there's lots to learn and I aint
the kinda (kind of) guy to hang around doing things slowly.

<BR>

<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Why have specimen slides?<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Some things can be seen straight away under a microscope with little or no
preparation. But if you want to KEEP something for a while to see over and over
again, you have to give it a place to stay where it will keep without going rotten.
That place is on a glass slide, fixed in position, and covered with a glass slip sealed
away from the atmosphere.
<P>
A lot of very small things just have to be prepared (more on this later) and 'mounted'
onto a glass slide to even be able to study them at all: they are just too small or 
unsuitable for examination by any other means.
</strong></EM></FONT>
<p>
<br>

<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Preparation - general<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Imagine for a moment that you want to preserve a delicate thing for a period of time;
for example - an item of clothing, a boat, a car or something even bigger: a house!
As long as any of these objects are exposed to the air, wind, rain, dust, and sunlight
they will continue to be affected by interaction with these variable conditions. Let's consider the 
house. To KEEP it safe and in the same constant condition, we would need to enclose it within
something which will act a barrier to all the external things that would slowly transform it.
One way would be to put the house in a big container and take all the air out, effectively
creating a vacuum inside of it. The container would need to be made of glass or plastic though if
we still wish to look at it and enjoy its structure. We might encounter a small problem when removing
the air because as it was drawn out of the container, the windows might break due to the sudden rush of air
and the forces it creates as it leaves the box.
<p>
Another possible solution is to put the house into a glass container and replace the air with
something else - a chemical or a solution of some kind which would not react with any of the materials
that the house was made of. Some of the problems with this is that the house is made of many different 
substances: brick, cement, wood, ceramics, glass, paint, etc., Whatever solution used would have to be
chemically inert (non-reactive) with a wide range of materials. Also, structures such as bricks, are porous;
that is - they contain tiny bubbles of air. Our solution needed to fill the container would have to be
able to seep into the tiny spaces in the bricks and push the air out of them. We would have to make certain
too that the solution filled the INSIDE of the house or else the pressure from the weight of solution outside
would be greater than inside - effectively smashing the windows and possibly distorting the roof structure
through pressure and weight.
<p>
If we were unable to find a PERFECT solution or liquid to cater for all these problems, we would have to find 
one which suited best and find additional ways of preventing some of the problems from happening. For example, lets
say we had this MAGIC chemical called 'MOUNT-IT' which seemed like it would do most of the things required except
it has a peculiar trait of melting paint. Could we use it?
<p>
We could, providing we first coat the paint with something which would FIX it so that it would no longer react
with our magic 'MOUNT-IT' solution. Possibly a varnish of some kind.

<p>
What has all this to do with mounting specimens on a slide?
<p>
Well there is NO difference! A tiny, microscopic, thing is itself made of different materials and forms a structure 
much like (and often more fragile than) our example house. Similar problems exist. Some specimens need hardly any 
major preparation at all, while others need a lot of work involving various chemical treatments. It is unfortunate 
that many of these techniques involve substances which are considered likely to cause hazard to health or safety if not 
used properly. 
<p>
To make our first slide quickly and safely, I will show you now a way of mounting a wide variety of things
using safe commonly found materials which are either completely safe or not so threatening to your health and safety.
I also propose to dismiss some aspects of preparation for our first ones knowing that this will create less than perfect
specimens for some subjects. Don't worry about this because you'll still create something worthy of looking at time
and time again.

Just for the record, these are the stages you would normally have to consider in the process of preparing
specimens for permanent mounting of PLANT material on glass slides. We will NOT be doing the majority of these
when we make our first slides together!

You need some glass slides. After all is said and done, you can't escape 
this requirement. Glass has a 'see-through' trait despite the fact that
it is considered a material that can easily cut and cause injury. You just have to
be careful how you handle it.  You also need cover slips. These wafer thin
'slips' of glass will be used to cover the specimens you place on the larger
glass slides. I'm currently using</strong></em></font><font color="00aaff" size=4><strong><em> cover slips which are 22mm square</em></strong></font><font color="000066" size=4>
<em><strong>and</em></strong></font><font color="00aaff" size=4><strong><em> glass specimen slides 76mmm long, 21mm wide, and 1mm thick (3 x 1 inch).</em></strong>
</font><font color="000066" size=4><em><strong><p>
Where do you get 'em from?
<p>
Well this is the part where you just have to contact a small company that sells them.
You can't pick them up from your local shop so you need to order some. We have
some of these small businesses in our <a href="../prodir/indexpro.html#brunel">Professional Services Section</A> so
take a look in there first.
<p>
If any of you know some place in your country where you can get glass slides and cover slips from,
<a href="mailto:larry@molcol.demon.co.uk">let me know!</A> and I'll update this page to give a more 
comprehensive list.
<p>
You need a bit more stuff to get going but I'm gonna show you now how to use things easily 
available. So as soon as you're ready <a href="sugar1.html">Let's move on</A> to the next page!

This is a large pollen grain from the flower called Rosebay Willow-herb. You can only see 
a tiny fraction of the pollen here because even at low magnification, it's so big! Fructose
is an ideal mountant for all pollen grains.

Using FRUCTOSE SUGAR as a mountant
</strong></EM></FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="000066"><EM><strong>
This is our magic ingredient which helps to make slide-making more accessible to 
younger people or, in fact, even to long-standing Microscopists. We are going to 
make up a stock solution ready to use for making loads of slides. Remember though 
that because we are going to make slides using a SAFE method, we are going to skip
a couple of important processes which would require the use of chemicals not 
quite as safe to use for youngsters. This will mean that some specimens will not 
be perfectly mounted for absolute clear 'viewing'- but we should end up with 
slides acceptable to the beginner, who may then wish to move on and adopt the processes
omitted here to refine his or her future slides!

<img src="sug4.jpg"  width=149 height=220 align=left border=1><br>Pour some Frutose sugar into a clean dry
glass jar. Ideally, you want to fill the jar two thirds up to the top. Pack the sugar down
so it is firmly taking up the space in the lower part of the jar. Take a pencil or felt-tipped
pen and mark the level of the sugar in the jar. You do this by drawing a small dash on the outside
of the jar exactly where the top of the sugar reaches to.

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
<p>
<img src="sug5.jpg"  width=182 height=240 align=right border=1><br>
Gently pour some de-ionised water into the jar. The sugar is very soluble and will start
to dissolve immediately causing the level to drop. You must keep adding water to maintain the level
to your original mark. When most of the sugar seems to have dissolved, you will notice the liquid is not
yet clear because it retains crystals of Fructose which still have not dissolved. Put the cap back on the jar
and leave it in a safe warm place overnight. This will allow time for all the sugar to dissolve and 
you should end up with a nice clear liquid.

Important extra step! <br clear>
</strong></EM></FONT></center>
<hr>

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
You can use the Fructose in this strength (as mixed above) but I have found it easier 
to mount the specimens I've done so far in a slightly weaker solution. Some things 
tend to 'float' on top of the thicker solution and if you end up getting air bubbles 
in the drop you use on the slide, they are more difficult to get out.
<p>
</strong></EM></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="ff0000" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>I recommend you: </strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>add more water to the solution at this stage 
to raise the level to half way betwen your mark and the top of the jar! Put the cap back on
firmly and turn the jar upside down and then right way up a few times to gently merge
the water with the syrupy solution. Leave for a few hours before using it to ensure 
the sugar stock 'thins' out throughout the jar.
<P>

When you have a ready supply of Fructose Mountant, and all the other materials ready
to hand, <a href="sugar3.html">we'll move on</A> to make the slide!

Here's a little picture of some extra things you need to make your first slide. 
There's one more thing, not shown here, that I'll explain to you in a moment... but first of all,
let me talk you through these items. Most of them are easy to obtain from around the house
or a local store so don't panic about how you're gonna get them. It's easy!

<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
WATER
</strong></EM></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="000066"><EM><strong>
This is not ordinary water! It is De-ionised water - the type used in car batteries and electric
steam irons. You can normally buy it cheaply at a garage or a motor shop or from a super-store.
It is perfectly safe in every respect and differs only from normal water by the fact that it is
very pure and clear. We're gonna use it to help make a really safe mounting solution. I hope you 
recall from page1 that this is used to support and hold the specimen in an air-free condition 
on the glass slide.

<p>
<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
GLASS BITS
</strong></EM></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="000066"><EM><strong>
Not so safe! I got my glass bits by breaking up a cover slip into smaller
pieces. These will be used to hold the cover slip in position just above
the specimen, effectively acting as 'spacers' between the glass slide and 
the cover slip. I'll show you as we progress how you can use something safer than
bits of glass to do this.

<p>


<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
A SMALL GLASS JAR<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
The jar is very small. We'll use it to make-up and hold the mounting solution we
are gonna make. When we make the solution, we will make enough to make loads of slides
and since we won't use it all at once, we need a place to keep it.
<p>
<img src="idea.gif" width=38 height=47 align=left>
You could wash out one of those small jars used to hold fish or meat paste. If 
you don't have one, what about one of those tiny jars you can buy jam in - you know -
they look like samples rather than jam jars. Take a look in the larder or fridge and
see if you can find a small container you can adapt. You must wash it out properly and make
sure it has an air-tight cap or lid.

A SPECIMEN <br>
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
What are you going to mount? I managed to find a flea on my dog and popped it in a jar
while I thought about how I would kill him without hurting him.
this is exactly how I found him (her?). 
<img src="sug3.jpg" width=208 height=202 align=right border=1>
 By luck, he just went 
naturally... honestly! I opened the little container the day after I put him in it, and
he was just laying there dead. I know you don't believe me so let me show you the evidence.
<p>
<img src="idea.gif" width=38 height=47 align=left>Some of you may not wish to kill little
animals, so why not choose something else like some pollen from a flower, hairs from a nettle,
or something else. The smaller the specimen, the easier it will be to make your slide.
I'll show you how I mounted pollen and some plant hairs too as part of this lesson so 
you can see how easy it is.

<img src="secret.gif" width=23 height=43 align=LEFT>FRUCTOSE SUGAR<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
Our first shared secret: Fructose! This is a type of sugar found naturally in foods like fruit.
Natural Health food shops sell it by the box quite cheaply as an altenative to cane sugar.
It is useful to us microscopists because it provides a clear sticky liquid, when mixed with 
the right quantity of water, which by complete coincidence is ideally suited as a mounting 
medium for a lot of microscopic specimens. It is safe, not toxic, and cheap! It will not 
enable you to make a slide that will last for ever, but it will allow you to make one which will
last at least a year and maybe much longer (a few years) with little deterioration.

<FONT COLOR="0000ff" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
SOME THINGS NOT SHOWN<br>
</strong></EM></FONT>
<FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
There are a few items not shown in the picture. The first is a bottle of nail varnish, the type used
by women to paint there nails. You can borrow some from your mum, girlfriend, wife etc., if you
don't normally use the stuff yourself. I went out and bought some CLEAR nail varnish rather than
be stuck with a coloured one. Yuu will use this to seal the edge of the cover slip to the glass 
slide.
<P>
If you do not wish to use a broken cover slip as a spacer, there is a better way if your specimen
is nice and small and flat. You need to purchase some</strong></EM></FONT><FONT COLOR="000ccaa" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG> PVA glue</strong></EM></FONT><FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG> from an ART shop. This is that milky-white
type glue which drys clear. Its normally used in COLLAGE work to stick bits of card and paper together and
is quite cheap to buy.
<p>
<img src="rightway.gif" width=27 height=47 align=right>You will need a small artists type </strong></EM></FONT><FONT COLOR="000ccaa" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>paint brush </strong></EM></FONT><FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>too. One with a fine narrow point. The one I use has written on it:
000 DALER HP 70, if that helps you at all. You will need two of these if you wish to make a better job of making
the slide by using enamel paint: see  below!<br clear>
<p>
<img src="rightway.gif" width=27 height=47 align=right>One more thing which you don't absolutely need (but it helps to make a nice job) is a small tin of</strong></EM></FONT><FONT COLOR="000ccaa" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG> ENAMEL PAINT.</strong></EM></FONT><FONT COLOR="000066" SIZE=4><EM><STRONG>
I'm using some stuff left over from building Airfix plastic models. It's made by Humbrol and comes in a very tiny 
can and in many different colours. I recommend black or very dark blue. This is used in the very final stage to 
paint over the narrow band of nail varnish, thereby providing a stronger seal and great protection  
where the cover slip edges meet and seal with the glass slide.

We had a request from a beer brewer recently, asking if we could show

<center><strong>Fractal Image 2: <em>Bryozoa</em></strong></center>

When scientists noticed what appeared to be brown golf balls floating in 
the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, they thought they were worth a closer look.
They were subsequently found to be colonies of bryozoans (moss animals),
which are normally found firmly attached to rocks.
<P>
They were found to be the first free-swimming bryozoan colonies ever recorded.<BR>
What were they doing there and were they a new species... <a href="../mag/articles/bryozoa.html">read the illustrated article</A> by Dave Walker to find out!

Wow! It looks too good to be true. A real ladybird caught in flight with perfect

our very own Team Member - Andrew Syred,  has created this stunning image, much larger and even more
detailed than this <strong>much-reduced copy</strong> shown here. Afraid we can't
give away his trade secrets. Just be thankful (as the rest of the team are here) that although 
Andrew produces images like these for a living, his passion as an amateur and his 
desire to see others follow his interest in Nature, motivate him to share his work

<center><strong>Fractal Image 5: <em>Stinging Nettle Hair</em></strong></center>
Another first from Andrew Syred. This is a single hair from a stinging nettle
as seen through a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) but with a lot of extra work
and toil by Andrew in post-processing the image. The bulb at the tip is a swelling of the
silicacious cell wall that, being a point of natural weakness, breaks to
produce a fresh, needle sharp surface capable of piercing skin. Liquid
is then forced up through the shaft into the skin akin to a hypodermic
needle. Here at Microscopy UK, we produce a non-profit making amateur magazine in paper
format and issue it to subscribers. This image was used on the front
cover of Issue Number 2. (ISSN 1365-0696)

<STRONG>What is a Bryozoan?<BR></STRONG>
Bryozoans are colonial microscopic animals that occur in both freshwater and seawater. They are often known as moss animals. Members of the group form colonies of varying size and shape and grow on other objects such as rocks, seaweed or ship hulls. Encrusting colonies usually grow over rocks forming a layer, whereas upright colonies are attached at the base and grow up as a sheet (an example of an upright form is shown left below).<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/bryof3.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=12>
The texture of a colony varies from either being soft and gelatinous, or tufted with leaf-like fronds or forming hard calcified skeletons like a coral. The colonies are formed of individual zooids, each of which is a complete organism.  Most zooids have ciliated tentacles that propel food particles to the simple mouth of the animal. The zooids are connected to the matrix of the colony and can interact with other colony members by tiny pores in their body walls.<P><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/bryof4.gif" ALIGN=right>
The  image on the right shows a group of zooids on the surface of the new bryozoan colony, and the image at the top of this article a close-up of an individual zooid. The white bar indicates the length in microns (1/1000th mm). The ring of tentacles form what is termed the lophophore which retract when the colony is disturbed.<P><BR><BR>

<A NAME="unusual"></A>
<STRONG>Why is this Bryozoan Unusual?<BR></STRONG>
When the floating golf balls were first collected in a bucket by intrigued scientists on a British Antarctic Survey supply ship, they had no idea what they were. They were brought to Lloyd Peck a BAS scientist working on South Georgia Island who had a quick look before preserving them and sending them to England.<P>

Llloyd said  "At first I did not have a clue and thought they were some sort of gelatinous sea-gooseberry-like-thing". He preserved them in an old coffee jar but it was a year later before he had a chance to study them under a microscope at the BAS headquarters in Cambridge, England.<P>

The light brown spheres are up to 3cm across and close study of them soon revealed that<STRONG> they were not only the first free-swimming bryozoan colonies ever recorded but also the first hollow colony for the Bryozoa phylum.</STRONG><P>

The site where they were found is 400m deep and some distance from the normal bryozoan habitats. So why were they there and what do they feed on?<P>

The area where they were found remains free of sea ice for most of the year (a so-called polynya) and would have  more plankton present than under the surrounding ice because the light levels are higher. This may therefore provide a richer food supply for the bryozoan.<P>

Another possibility is that the colonies may feed on the microscopic algae that grows on the under-layer of sea-ice in this area. It is suspected that the colonies may have been released from under the sea ice  because of ice break-up. Thus free bryozoan colonies have two potential  advantages over bottom-dwelling species in terms of food acquisition.<P>

A further advantage is that mobile species are able to exploit patchy food resources which are some distance apart. This is important because the plankton levels in the Weddell Sea are very seasonal. At some times of the year the absence of plankton gives this area the world's clearest sea water.<P>

<CENTER><A HREF="#index">Go back to top of page</A><P></CENTER>
<A NAME="quest"></A>
<STRONG>Is the Bryozoan a New Species?<BR></STRONG>
Scientists currently speculate that the new bryozoan may be a juvenile bryozoan of the genus<EM> Alcyonidium</EM>. The species of this genus are difficult to characterise, hence the uncertainty and reluctance to assign the brozoan as a new species. Thus as the young colony increases in size the colony sinks to the bottom and becomes attached to a substrate.<P>


<STRONG>Questions unanswered</STRONG><BR>
Although some aspects of the organisms existence are now probably understood. A number of questions below remain unanswered.<P>

Is it a new species or a mobile juvenile form of a bottom-dwelling species?<BR>
When did the free-floating lifestyle arise, and was it more common in fossil species?<BR>
Why is this type of bryozoan only found under Antarctic sea ice?<BR>
Why have these type of bryozoan not been found before?<P>

A possible answer to the last question, is that if the new bryozoan is a juvenile form of a bottom-dweller that feeds under the sea-ice, it may be difficult to spot, especially if they only occur for short periods and are sparsely distributed.<P>

<STRONG>This article illustrates that there is still a lot we do not know about the world around us, especially in the icy wastes and seas of Antarctica!</STRONG><P>

<H2>Micscape Article: Plant adaptations</H2>
<H3>Text and Images by Anne Bruce. </H3>

<HR><BR><BR>

Photosynthesis is the biological pathway whereby green
plants make energy available to all living things. Plants
exhibit a wide range of leaf form, however, typically a leaf
comprises a thin lamella and large surface area. This enables
effective photosynthesis by minimising the distance between the
photosynthesis factory (palisade cells) and the supply of raw
materials (carbon dioxide and water). At the same time the large
surface area maximises light capture. To ensure that sufficient
carbon dioxide can enter the plant when light energy is
available, the stomata must be open, but this in turn allows
water to evaporate from the large leaf surface during
transpiration. In order to prevent the rate of transpiration
exceeding water uptake but without compromising the needs for
effective photosynthesis, plants have evolved a variety of
adaptations to keep water loss by evaporation to a minimum.<P>

 In most dicotyledonous plants - the number of stomata is
greater on the lower surface than on the upper. This 
arrangement ensures that carbon dioxide can enter the leaf while
at the same time cutting down on transpiration rate (the lower
surface being cooler than the upper). In addition, the stomatal
mechanism of closing at night also reduces water loss by
evaporation. Plants living in water deficient habitats have
evolved further adaptations in order that water loss does not
become critical. It is not just hot desert conditions and
rapidly draining soils that can exert such pressures. In the
tundra,  soil water is frozen for long periods and so is
unavailable to plants. Plants living at high altitudes and in
exposed sites will be subjected to the drying effects of strong
winds.<P>

Plants growing in these conditions are termed xerophytes.
Such plants need to minimise water loss by evaporation.<P>

Many xerophytes have extensive root systems in order to
trap available water. In addition there are other morphological
adaptations to reduce the rate of transpiration.<P>

<H3><EM><U>Methods of reducing  transpiration rate</U></EM></H3>

Xerophytic plants may exhibit one or more of the following
features.<P>

<H4>Thick  waxy cuticle </H4>
Found in many evergreen leaves, the cuticle cuts down water loss
in two ways: it acts as a barrier to evaporation and also the
shiny surface reflects heat and so lowers temperature.<P>

<H4>Sunken stomata</H4>
<IMG SRC="../images/anne1d.jpg"  width=150 height=173  align=left hspace=6>
Stomata may be sunk in pits in the epidermis; moist air trapped here lengthens
the diffusion pathway and reduces evaporation rate.<P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<H4>Leaf rolled with stomata inside</H4>
<IMG SRC="../images/anne1e.jpg"  width=200 height=126 align=left hspace=6>
This adaptation is found in Marram grass (<EM>Ammophila</EM>). As can be seen from
the image left,  the inner surface is covered in hairs. The rolled
leaf and hairs  both serve to trap moist air so reducing
transpiration. In addition, a smaller surface area of leaf is
exposed to the drying effects of the wind.<P><BR><BR><BR>

<H4>Small leaves</H4>
<IMG SRC="../images/anne1a.jpg"  width=200 height=134 align=left hspace=6>
<IMG SRC="../images/anne1f.jpg"   width=200 height=124 align=right hspace=6>

Left-hand image heather (<EM>Erica</EM>),  right-hand image pine (<EM>Pinus</EM>).<P><BR><BR><BR><BR>

Many xerophytic plants such as pine and heather, have small,
needle shaped  leaves which are often circular in cross section.
This reduces the surface area and hence the evaporating surface. <P>

Hydrophytic plants, in contrast to xerophytes are
adapted to living in freshwater or very wet habitats. Water
availability is therefore no problem. In fact hydrophytes often
have  reduced roots and water conducting tissue (xylem). The
greatest problem faced by hydrophytes is how to obtain
sufficient oxygen. Water logged soils have few, if any, air
spaces, and what little oxygen there is, may be  used in
bacterial decay.   In addition, oxygen has low solubility in
water. <P>

<IMG SRC="../images/anne1b.jpg"  width=200 height=131 align=left hspace=6>
Plants such as the water lily (<EM>Nymphaea</EM>) and pondweed (<EM>Potamogeton</EM>) are characterised
by having large air spaces (lacunae) within their tissue. These
air filled spaces give the plant buoyancy, allowing the leaf to
float on or near the surface and so maximise light capture.
Oxygen produced by  photosynthesis during the day is trapped in
the spaces and can diffuse to other parts of the plant, enabling
respiration.<P>

In contrast to the leaves of many terrestrial plants, the
stomata on floating leaves are found on the upper surface. This
can be seen in the image of the section (shown left above) through the water lily
leaf. In submerged leaves, stomata may not be present at all.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/anne1c.jpg"  width=200 height=127 align=left hspace=6> The vascular tissue (phloem and xylem) of aquatic stems is
centrally arranged, (unlike terrestrial plants where vascular
tissue is cylindrically arranged towards the outside of the
stem). This central arrangement which can be seen in the image (shown left)
of the pondweed, allows the stem to withstand the forces of
water currents.<P><BR>

<CENTER><h2>Obituary: Francis St. D. Rowntree. OBE. 1928-1996.</h2></CENTER>



<p>
<FONT SIZE=4>Frank, by which name he was well-known, suffered a severe heart attack and died in hospital on the 25th October 1996.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../imag97/frank1.jpg" align=left width=278 height=190 hspace=8>

<p>
His working background was in public health and for which work he was awarded the OBE in 1986. In 1987 he was appointed Vice President of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and also Vice President of the Institute of Health.
<p>
His interest in microscopy began at an early age. He joined the Manchester Microscopical Society as a novice at age 15 in 1943. In later years he became a member of the Royal, the Quekett, the Postal, the Sorby and the Leeds Microscopical Societies. He attended as many meetings as he could and always had something to say.

<p>
He had immense enthusiasm and energy for microscopy, which he loved, and his main concern was that people interested in amateur microscopy were nowadays mainly of the older age groups, and that efforts should be made to attract younger converts to this fascinating hobby. As such, Frank soon noticed the efforts of Micscape and pledged his full support for what we are trying to achieve. He gave freely of his time and vast experience and his vision was such that he saw what an opportunity communication via computers around the globe could give the hobby of microscopy.

<p>
Frank organised an annual meeting in Sheffield for all those interested in microscopy and these were always well attended (Editors note: see below). In addition he published  thrice-yearly Sales and Wants and Fact-file lists which were a boon to amateur microscopists as well as making it possible for many a widow to dispose of their former husband's microscopes, books and equipment. His kindly nature and particularly the skill he showed in encouraging youngsters was self-evident to all those who met him. I will certainly always remember him as a very much larger than life character that immediately instigated a conversation with me at my first ever Midland Quekett meeting some years ago.

<p>
His death has left a large void in contacts for amateur microscopy and he will undoubtedly be missed by many members of the various societies. Though Frank's involvement with Micscape was only for a few months his vigorous and enthusiastic input will be sorely missed. People like Frank with such knowledge, ability and willingness to help are far too few.


<p>The above is based upon a longer obituary written by Roy Winsby and published in the newsletter of the Manchester Microscopical and Natural History Society, January 1997. Many thanks to Roy for his permission to use it.<P>

<CENTER><h2>The Future of the National Microscopical Meeting</h2></CENTER>

<p>
For well over a decade the National Microscopical Meetings held in Sheffield by Frank Rowntree have been a resounding success. Frank's energy, enthusiasm and organisational ability have ensured that many of us have enjoyed meetings of great interest. The range and quality of speakers have been second to none, as has been the sheer number of people attending.

<p>
Now that Frank is sadly no longer with us, it would be a shame to abandon these meetings. With this in mind, the Leeds Microscopical Society is organising a National Microscopical Meeting on Saturday 7th June 1997. The meeting will take place at St Mary's Church Hall, Morley near Leeds.

<p>
Morley is to the South of Leeds and conveniently near the motorway network.

<strong>
<h3>Amateurs launch paper magazine</h3>
<em>Well, if we don't blow our own trumpets - who else will?</em>
<p>
We got so frustrated about the fact that many of the thousands of amateur
microscopists in the UK are not on the web, we decided to find a way for 
them to share in the excitement. We put the best bits of Micscape (our 
electronic mag.) together and printed out 84 pages complete with a colour 
cover and offered it out to the amateurs here at cost price. Okay, we admit
the quality is fairly basic with each copy consisting of a photocopy of the 
master copy, although every one has its own freshly printed colour printed 
cover.
<p>
We asked for 3.00 UK pounds per copy and run out of the first print right 
away. The amount of work involved was considerable and we actually lose a bit
of money on every issue posted out due to high costs of photocopying and
postage, but at least now some of the amateurs here get to share the 
amateur microscopy WEB experience. 
<p>
You never know but if we could get enough interest from around the world
maybe, just maybe, we could get something similar more widely circulated 
to all those people not on the web?!
<p>
The magazine is produced twice a year for the time being but don't worry 
that you won't probaly ever see an issue: <em>you have the real thing here
on the web</em>. Why not take a look at this month's issue of <a href="../mag/indexmag.html">Micscape

<strong>
In a world driven by the pressure of modern commercialism, it is difficult to envisage 
any area where people motivated by nothing more than curiosity and intrigue 
for living things can have a say in what is important in their lives. Microscopy, by its
very name alone, seems to promote imagery of a pursuit fit only for the ardent 
study into searching out secrets for commercial exploitation, yet nothing could be further
from the truth. Microscopy is one of the few <em>true</em> interests that anyone 
can become involved with and enjoy for its own sake.
<p>
Here at Microscopy UK we are endeavouring not only to keep this interest alive in 
a modern environment - we are succeeding in bringing the subject out of a dusty Victorian 
cupboard and repositioning it as the lively subject it actually is. 
<p>
<em>And every reader and visitor is helping us to do it. Well done!</em>
<p>
This page enables you to get a tiny feel of the interaction going on between 
all of amateurs as well as the professionals who still remember their initial passion  - and through it -
are prepared to become involved!
<p>
All are welcome! All information exchanges are in the spirit of sharing...

Emission SEM. We are having our schools open day soon and I am trying to 
find some of these "common" dust mites to put in the SEM but as yet no 
success. Have you improved your hunting methods since you wrote the 
article?

Hi Mark, <br>
I've passed your email to Andrew Syred, one of my colleagues who sent 
me a small colony of Dustmites. He might be able to help you out. As I 
pointed out in the article, these little creatures are not as easy to find
as most people would have us believe. I hope Andrew can help.

<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Hi Mark,<br>
<p>
I might be able to help. When is your special day? I could send you
one of two if you like, although you may have problems preparing it for SEM
work if you're field is not biology? To be honest - I can't normally take the time to 
help so specifically but it just so happens I am working on a project involving
dustmites right now, so I can afford the time to help and if it helps you 
interest students and their parents then great!
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>
Thanks for the offer of the dust mites, the open days are on the 2nd
and 3rd of July so I have plenty of time. As you have surmised biological
work is not my field and we do not have a critical point dryer. I was aware
of the problem as I have previously used some of those red spider mites, which
collapse under vacuum, but I thought that the shell of the dust mite looked
more stable. 
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Dust mites have much the same exterior as spider mites; it's tough and
leathery rather than hard and rigid so will likely collapse as the
hapless beast dries out. You can sometimes reduce the effect of air
drying by controlled evaporation from a volatile liquid such as ether
but I have not tried this procedure with mites.
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>
What exactly does a critical point dryer do, perhaps we could 
simulate it with some of the vacuum equipment we have here?
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Probably not if you are not geared for it. Critical point drying is a
potentially dangerous technique that really should not be done without
purpose built equipment. At a given temperature and pressure a liquid
will pass from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase without a change in
density or latent heat of vaporisation, it exists as a dense fluid. This
point is known as the critical point and is different for different
liquids. Water should be the ideal liquid to use but god decided that
the critical temperature and pressure would be 374 deg C and 3184 psi
respectively. A fairly destructive combination!
<p>
Various liquids have
been advocated but the most commonly used is liquid carbon dioxide which
has a critical temp. and pressure of 31 deg. C and 1072 psi. Water in
the specimen is replaced with and intermediate fluid such as ethanol
(water and liquid CO2 are not miscible). In a small pressure vessel the
specimen is purged with liquid CO2 for half an hour or so to ensure
total substitution of the ethanol within the specimen. The pressure
vessel is then sealed and slowly heated. The liquid CO2 expands greatly
as the temperature rises and at the critical point all the liquid gas in
the chamber (including that infiltrated into the specimen) flips to the
dense fluid phase with no change in density and of greater importance
with no transitional menaces; the specimen is not subjected to surface
tension. Once the CP has been exceeded the gas is SLOWLY bled off until
the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure. Voila, one dried
specimen ready for sputtering.
<p>
An automatic pressure relief valve and last resort blow-out safety disc
are built into commercially available kit.
<p>
Freeze drying is an alternative method but the skin, designed to prevent
the mite from drying out whilst alive, restricts sublimation of ice
making the end result unreliable.
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>        
Incidentally where do you hunt for the dust mites, I have tried in the past to
no avail? We are led to believe that our houses are infested with these 
creatures, are they camera shy or is it a scare story by hoover salesmen :-).
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Got it in one - just a big con. trick. All those stories are put about
by people who want to sell flashy vacuum cleaners and expensive
allergenic bedding materials, like mattresses, pillows and blankets.
Even knowing where to look and what to look for they are incredibly
difficult to find, an opinion shared by all my colleagues and like-minded
contacts. Having found a few in a donated sample of under-carpet debris
(following a country-wide request for house dust, fluff etc.), I have
maintained a small culture for about 12 months or so but these are now
dwindling. I gave a large part away to Mol for filming some while ago
which was more or less the end of the culture but I'm sure to have one
or two knocking about.
<p>
<em>Mark:-</em><br>       
Lastly thanks for the suggestions, a ball point might be interesting. One of 
the problems with my SEM is the lowest mag is around 60 times, so the eye of
a moth looks good but I cant show them the whole moth. That's why a dust mite
is attractive because I can get the whole thing on the screen at once,
<p>
<em>Andrew:-</em><br>
Yes I have the same problem - people wanting pictures of things that
really don't warrant the use of an SEM.
Butterfly wings then zooming in on the intricate structure of an
individual scale always captures the attention. Cabbage White
butterflies have interesting grape-like structures (@ ca. 20k) hanging
from the bars of the scale. Don't know for sure what they are but
believe them to be pigment granules. Also if you brush off a few scales
first you can additionally show their attachment site and stalks to the
wing membrane.
<p>
For a whole mount, garden ants are good especially if you can arrange
them in a confrontational position, jaws open etc. Kill them with ether
and they remain relaxed for some while enabling arrangement of legs etc.
They dry easily from air without any need for special drying techniques.
<p>
Hope this has been of some help. I'll contact you shortly when I find
some mites.
<p>
Late news update. I've found 16 mites which I have now bumped off. as
you are not set up for CPD and I will need to do a run within the next
week or so I'll do them for you. Hope you're prepared for their small
size (ca 300um). Recommend you use an eyelash attached to a cocktail
stick to handle them whilst mounting on a stub. I'll also include a
Large White (Pieris brassicae) butterfly when I send the mites.

<I>The focal point of the Project:</I> to record images, observations, and other information about dustmites, their habitat, population quantities, life-cycle and any other findings regarding their existence. Dustmites were selected as the focal point of this Project because they should be readily available in most peoples' homes, in their beds, their vacuum cleaners, their carpets, etc..
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<I>The objective of the Project:</I> to use amateur microscopy skills and interactively <I>invent</I> the tools needed to record images of and information about dustmites; use participant ingenuity and interaction to find a simplistic, extremely inexpensive solution using common, ordinary household items, such as posterboard, tape, paperclips, rubberbands, etc.; generate a rich exchange of ideas between participants and groups to find the most simplistic, inexpensive method(s) to conduct the focal point activity: recording images of and information about dustmites.
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
Only inexpensive, common, household items may be utilized, so everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. Beyond the use of a microscope and a household camera, no eleborate commercial tools may be used. The Project is to be an exercise in ingenuity; an interactive collaboration between groups from different Nations to utilize amateur microscopy skills to conduct the focal point activity: recording images of and information about dustmites.
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
As participants record images and information, they should submit their information and images to the 
<A HREF="MAILTO: rmcain@pipeline.com">International Project Data Coordinator</A>, where it will be formatted and posted on the World Wide Web. If a participating group is unable to 
convert their images, for example - photos or drawings, into electronic format, then your National Project Co-Ordinator will assist you. Contact the National coordinator for details and arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Participants will maintain their copyright to any information they gather, but provide Microscopy-UK and the Internet Youth Group limited publishing rights. At Project completion, if the data and images gathered by the participants are determined to be significant, a collective scientific paper will be entered on the participants' behalf, submitting their results, recognizing the work of each individual participant, their contribution to the collective effort and their contribution to the Scientific Community in the study of dustmites. Such an achievement would make the participants very attractive to Universities, Scholarship Organizations, etc.. 
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
In order for results to be considered significant, documentation is of paramount importance. Participants must, of course, record their findings, but they must also record the methods used for discovery and the reasoning behind the methods used for that discovery. As much of the thought processes invloved, as possible, as well as the resultant findings must be recorded, to validate the discovery, for submission as a bonafide scientific document.
</FONT></STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
The Project has been designed to provide an excellent opportunity for participants, not only to exercise their <I>thinking muscles</I>, but to share pieces of their culture, make friends in faraway places and to better themselves and improve their world. This is NOT to be a competition between two National Groups, but an open exchange of ideas and information between participants, to find a solution to reach a common goal.

<p>A most interesting place to visit in order to examine freshwater is inside your own lavatory.
Remove the lid from the cistern and peer inside. Around the water level will be a brown ring of
'gunge' adhering to the cistern wall. Flush the toilet and this drains the water from the cistern 
and
leaves the brown ring easily accessible. Using a scalpel, section lifter (see there really is a use 
for
this) or some other flat instrument, scrape a tiny amount of this 'gunge' and place on to the centre
of a clean microscope slide. Transfer a drop of water to this and if the 'gunge' is not too thick
cover with a cover glass. If it is too thick tease the fibres etc apart before placing the cover 
glass
on top.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Lets go and have a look!


<p>In the first example that I examined from my home I was surprised to see large numbers of living
organisms that had taken up rent-free lodgings. I also thought about the cleanliness of our water
supply but didn't dwell on it for too long. The majority of specimens were diatoms of various
types. Now I'm not too cluey on diatoms but I was able to name a few. Most were centric diatoms
which when seen side-on gave the appearance of thick tablets one on top of the other forming
chains 3-8 cells long. Other diatoms included Navicula sp., Caloneis sp., Tabellaria sp., Cymbella
sp., Rhoicosphania sp., Melosira sp. and Gomphonema sp. There were others too small for me
to attempt an identification. 

<p>There were many small ciliates swimming around making it hard to keep following them and
keeping them in focus (I must try and use a smaller drop of water). Something that allowed ample
time for observation because they were stationary were dark orange circles or discs (great
description eh?). No they were not shells from Arcella but I am unable to identify them. I
wondered if they were cysts of some sort or another. I saw a rotifer, Anuraea sp., as well as 
several
amoebae of what appeared to be of the same species. A few Oscillatoria, (blue-green algae or
Cyanobacteria),  and I also saw the colonial desmid alga, Desmidium sp., which was 18 cells long.
There were some very active but un-identified nematodes present.

<p>Swimming around quite nonchalantly were a few colonies of Gonium sp., a colonial alga where
each cell has a conspicuous flagellum. These look quite nice when viewed using dark ground
illumination. Another colonial alga seen was the non-motile alga Dictyosphaerium which are loose
colonies of green cells in clear mucilage. A most interesting ciliate observed was a large specimen
similar to Paramecium which swam past and through the field of view searching for food. The
slow moving rotifer, Philodina was moving in its leach-like or caterpillar action. Another 
fascinating creature was busy walking over, under and on top of the fibrous matter. It seemed to
be searching for food and was similar in shape to the shell noodles that we have sometimes for
dinner. They had cirri which  appeared like they were walking on legs. It was either Euplotes or
Aspidisca but I will have to try and identify them at a later time.<p>
<IMG SRC="../imag97/dunny2a.jpg" width=167 height=379 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left>
A huge and interesting creature which came across my field of view was an annelid worm being
an Oligochaete of the family Aeolosomatidae. It measured about 1mm in length, had a mouth in
its head region (a good place for it to have one!), and inside a cavity full of cilia which passed 
food
particles into its digestive tract. I observed food passing through its transparent body and being
ejected at the other end. Although the animal was transparent it was nevertheless easy to observe
as just under its skin were many bright orange oil-like droplets, the purpose of which was unclear
to me. It also had spines radiating out from its skin along its length. I could also see four 
diatoms
within its intestine.<br clear><P>
<IMG SRC="../imag97/dunny1a.jpg" width=263 height=341 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right>
The most beautiful creature that I came across and which has given me a hard time identifying was
a rotifer called Colotheca. It was trumpet shaped and held to the substrate by a tapered foot which
was, alas, hidden behind some 'gunge'. It did not have a tube along its body but at its widest point
(the head) it had stunningly beautiful thin glass-like spines. These were bundled onto four
projections. They did not seem to do anything except make the creature look beautiful, almost
majestic. A tiny ciliate swam into the funnel-shaped end and appeared to hit a barrier about  of
the way inside the animal whereupon the animal closed its funnel-like rim like a fist to prevent the
ciliates escape. As quick as lightning the ciliate disappeared in to the lower  of the animal and
was lost into the rotifers more opaque looking body. Once this happened, the fist unfolded and its
long glassy spines gradually and gracefully protruded out into the watery environment.

<p>I have wondered whether you would get the same types of animals and plants inside toilet cisterns
from other areas of the country or from older houses with old, antiquated pipes. It might be a good
project for someone to do. I have collected a few samples from motels that I have stayed in but
have had to preserve the contents of my collection and have not had time to look at them. I also
feel that it would be better to examine samples when the contents are still alive. I did visit a 
motel
once in Victoria (Australia) where I could not remove the lid of the cistern. It was a  white 
plastic
one but upon prising, twisting and banging I could not remove the it so had to leave this area for
another visit. So, have a look in your cistern, go on don't be shy and you will be surprised.<P>

This is a closeup view of the centre of the balance wheel inside a pocket watch with a mechanical movement.  The wheel
pivots on a small red ruby jewel visible in the centre of the arm. A
dimpled, gold-coloured pressure spring secures the arm in position without
impeding the to-and-fro motion of the arm. The hairspring and the tension adjustment for the hairspring  which adjusts the timekeeping of the watch is also visible.<P>

The picture was taken using the Leitz Ultropak epillumination system on an
Ortholux.  Illumination in this case was provided by a Canon ring flash
(Macro Ring Lite ML-2) connected to my T-90 camera.  I hand-held the flash in
position around the Ultropak 6.5x objective.  The eyepiece was a Periplan
10x, which together with the objective, generated a colour negative image
about 20x actual size.<P>

<STRONG>Editors note</STRONG>: The <A HREF="http://www.diwalk.demon.co.uk/home/janhome.htm"><STRONG>Microscopy around the Home</STRONG></A> article this month looks inside a quartz watch, so readers may be interested to compare the two and read how a quartz watch is capable of keeping time more accurately than a mechanical watch.<P>

<A NAME="overview">
<B>The Reading Microscopical Society</B><BR>
The present Society was founded in 1945 and was formed to provide an
opportunity for enthusiastic microscope users and collectors to meet 
regularly and talk 'shop' as well as learning about the wider applications
of microscopy through talks and visits. It has always been a small, 
informal and friendly society whose membership spans a wide range of ages, 
experience and interests. It is affiliated to the Royal Microscopical 
Society.
<P>
Although the Society aims to foster the use of light microscopes by its 
membership, its meetings and visits encompass the whole range of microscopy
from the hand-lens to the latest optical and electron technology.
<P>

<br>
<p>

<A NAME="activities">
<B>Activities</B><BR>
Evening meetings of the society are held on the first Wednesday of every 
month from October to May. These may be lectures on techniques and 
applications or visits to laboratories to see applied microscopy in action.
At the end of each season an afternoon of pond dipping combines practical 
microscopy, natural history and a social occasion. In addition to the 
regular meetings occasional workshop sessions or extra visits may be 
arranged according to demand and opportunity.
<P>

<br>
<p>
<A NAME="member">
</A><B>Membership and Fees</B><BR>
Membership of the Society gives admission to all meetings and workshops 
together with two or three newsletters per season. The society has a small 
library of books, a collection of mounted slides, a compound microscope 
and other items for loan to members. Consumables for slide and specimen 
preparation are available for purchase and occasionally microscopes are 
acquired for sale to members.
<P>
Visitors are always most welcome to attend individual meetings.
<P>
<B>Membership Fees: 5 per person or 6 per couple.</B>

Subjects are filmed either through a microscope or with a special camera directly, and then digitised for 'play-back' on IBM compatible PCs.Each movie is very short but, through the way the images are organised, will 'run' continuously on your monitor. This keeps the files small enough for trouble-free and speedy downloading from the Micscape Magazine Web Site.<p>Each one or more microscopy movies will be made available from these pages. Movie files are stored on Micscapeas compressed (self-extracting) executable files - that is: you need to <b>Run</b> them first after downloadingthem to extract the real movie file or files.<p>The Movie Player expects a movie file to be a <b>M{number}.QPL</b> file. All movie filenames start with the letter 'M' and havea suffix of '.QPL'. The rest of the filename consists of a sequence of numbers. The filename must not be altered in any way!!

Subject: Using Micscape From Windows95

I don't know how but I discovered your site tonite and downloaded the
software and all of the demo movies. I downloaded for two reasons,

(1) they sounded interesting and...
(2) the challenge existed for using Windows 95

Just in case you have not been able to get it working from this platform
as yet, I followed the following procedure.
(a) I created a directory and copied all of the program files to it
(b) I extracted all the required executables and then deleted
    the originals
(c) I double clicked on micmovie.exe and voila, no problems!
(d) I did not bother with the group file or icon.

The only problem I faced after watching all 7 movies and quitting the
program was the intense brightness of the Windows 95 screen as compared
to the Micscape screen.Well done, very interesting.

And of course, if that doesn't work, you can always use the DOS option in Win95 to run Micmovie.exe so you should be okay in this respect.<p><br><br><p><br><center><h4><em><a href="#about">Sub-Index</A> / <a href="#movietop"> Button Selector</A></em></h4></center><br><p><br><br><a name="downplay"><h3>Download Micscape Movie Player</h3>I hope you took the time first to read <b><A HREF="#about">About Micscape Movies</A></b><p><ul><li><A Href="http://www.micropix.demon.co.uk/movies/micmovie.exe">HTTP Download Movie Player</A> and save it as MICMOVIE.EXE<br>File Size: 96k (This is NOT a compressed file)</ul><p><br><br><center><h4><em><a href="#about">Sub-Index</A> / <a href="#movietop"> Button Selector</A></em></h4></center><br><p><br><br><a name="downgrp"><h3>Download Micscape Group and Icon File (Windows Users).</h3>I hope you took the time first to read <b><A HREF="#about">About Micscape Movies</A></b><p><ul><li><A Href="http://www.micropix.demon.co.uk/movies/winmovie.exe">HTTP Download Micscape Windows File</A> and save it as WINMOVIE.EXE<br>File Size: a COMPRESSED file of a few hundred bytes (very small).</ul><p><br><center><h4><em><a href="#about">Sub-Index</A> / <a href="#movietop"> Button Selector</A></em></h4></center><br><br><br><P><CENTER><B>Please report any errors OR offer comment to <A HREF="mailto:mol@molcol.demon.co.uk"> <I> The Editor </I></A></B></CENTER><BR><HR>

<h2>Snowflake Ice Crystals</h2>
<h3>by<br>
Andrew Syred Dec.95</h3>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</center>
<h3>A seasonal thing</h3>
<i>Snow</i>: you either love the stuff or hate it. In the UK we mostly hate
it since, despite weather forecasts warning us of its imminent arrival, we 
are never prepared for it and the slightest dusting brings the entire 
country to a standstill. I personally think we see far too little snow and 
eagerly await the first falls of Winter with childish anticipation. It's an 
annual sport of mine to try and photograph snowflake ice crystals.
<p>
<h3>Working outside</h3>
The first requirement is an outside laboratory where the microscope can be 
used safely in a moderately protected environment whilst still subject to 
the low prevailing temperatures. A garden shed with the windows and door 
open is ideal but in the past I have utilised an old Volkswagen Van, a 
polytunnel or just a sheet of polythene to make a windbreak and roof 
attached to the outside of an out-building. So long as the environment 
remains cold and protected from direct wind or further falls of snow any 
temporary shelter is acceptable. 
<p>
The microscope and all utensils have to be chilled to the outside ambient 
temperature and to achieve this they should be placed in the outside 
`laboratory' several hours before attempting to look at any snowflake 
crystals. The other items required are a couple of needles mounted in wooden 
handles and a selection of clean microscope slides.
<p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
The microscope requirements are simple. Since many of the crystals 
encountered will be quite large it is only necessary to fit a single low 
power objective lens, (e.g. x4 mag.); the others being removed and left 
indoors. An Abbe condenser is more than adequate for the purpose especially 
if the top lens can be removed. This arrangement will provide an even spread 
of light with the attendant property of not warming the microscope slide so 
quickly.
<p>
<h3>In the dead of night</h3>
Depending upon weather conditions and temperature I find it best to work at 
night but if the daytime temperature remains a few degrees below freezing 
then there should be no problems though you should work in shadow as the sun 
has a powerful warming effect. Using a wooden spatula a sample of snow is 
taken to the microscope where it is examined by eye. By altering its 
attitude to a remote light source or shining a torch over it, a few 
well-defined crystals lying on the surface will be seen. With the aide of 
one of the mounted needles, transfer a selected ice crystal to a chilled 
microscope slide and place on the microscope stage. With luck you will have 
a perfect six sided crystal to draw, photograph or just admire.  Care must 
be taken not to breath on the microscope or slides as the merest warming 
will melt the sample. If a gentle cold draft can be maintained through the 
area so much the better.
<p>
Remember to wrap yourself up well. This not only prevents you from getting 
cold but also helps to protect your microscope and snow samples from your 
radiant heat. Its not as daunting as you might imagine; have a go and 
perhaps we shall be able to see some of your results on these pages. The 
pictures here are examples of snowflakes I prepared earlier.
<p>
Once you have finished outside bring the microscope (and camera equipment) 
indoors and allow it to return to room temperature slowly before using it. 
<p>
Good luck! <i>Andrew Syred</i>

<P>
<h3>Hair: a good subject to begin 'scoping' on.</h3>

<IMG SRC="../images/hairhum.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 vspace=4 ALIGN=right>
When a microscope is procured for the first time, one of the first objects 
usually looked at is  hair extricated from the nearest willing scalp but
once the novelty has worn off and the hair discarded, few budding 
microscopists consciously return to such a humble specimen. However, 
the study of hair, whether as a separate interest or as an aspect of a much
larger project, can provide hours of fun and serious study. 
<p>
Completely unambiguous identification of an unknown hair sample is not 
always possible but if one is able to compare hair of unknown origin against
that of a reference sample from an authenticated source much of the 
guess-work can be removed and a more confident identification provided.
Combined with additional local knowledge of where the hair was found a short
list or two or three possible candidates may be reduced to just one.
<p>
<h3>Building a Reference Library</h3>
A reference library of correctly identified hairs is therefore essential 
and creating a collection of permanently mounted hair for oneself provides
valuable knowledge gained through experience. With so many sources of hair
available, a collection will increase rapidly. Family pets and dead wild 
animals are the most obvious starting points for a reference collection 
but zoos or an obliging veterinary surgeon are excellent sources for exotic
or more difficult samples; even hair taken from an old fur coat will be 
useful if its identification can be guaranteed.
<p>

<h3>The Structure of Hair</h3>
<IMG SRC="../images/hairfig1.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 vspace=4 ALIGN=left>

The structure of hair may be divided into three distinct parts, the medulla,
cortex and epidermis (fig.1). The medulla or inner-most region comprises of
shrunken cell aggregates and air spaces and may vary considerably from being
almost absent to constituting the greatest component. Its morphology is an 
important diagnostic feature. When filled with air the medulla appears dark 
often to the point of being almost opaque but when infiltrated with a 
suitable medium such as canada balsam becomes transparent allowing more 
detailed examination. The cortex is a layer of dead cells packed into a 
homogeneous mass so that little, if any, cellular detail can be seen.
It too varies considerably in width and the medulla-to-cortex ratio is used 
for identification purposes. Both layers may contain pigment granules, the 
form and distribution of which should be noted. The thinnest outer-most 
epidermal layer comprises of overlapping scales akin to tiles on a roof 
where the leading edge of one scale obscures the base of the one ahead. 
The organisation and nature of the scales form a distinctive pattern along
the shaft of hair and is a key identification feature. 
<P>
<h3>Preparing a Sample</h3>
Prior to making permanent whole mounts, the sample of hair should be 
thoroughly washed and cleaned in an organic solvent, such as 
ethanol/diethyl ether (1:1) mixture, and allowed to dry flat between two 
pieces of  absorbent filter paper. To avoid an untidy jumble of hair a thin 
coating of very dilute gum tragacanth or acacia is smeared along the 
length of a clean microscope slide. Before it is allowed to dry short 
lengths of hair are positioned on the gummed area and gently pressed into
placed to secure them. Once thoroughly dry the hairs should be mounted in
euparal or canada balsam then covered with a suitable cover slip. 
Providing it was completely dry the gum adhesive should not be detectable
by routine illumination techniques. 
<p>
The cut ends of hair will allow some
infiltration of mounting medium to occur enabling the characteristics of 
both infiltrated and non-infiltrated hair to be examined. Long hairs should
be cut into short, manageable lengths and mounted in sequence so that the 
full length may be scrutinised. This is important since the characteristics
of a single hair changes along its length as it grows and ages.
<p>
<h3>Making a Cast</h3>
It will frequently be found that the epidermal scales if not totally 
obscured by the opacity of the medulla matrix or strong pigmentation, 
will be very difficult to observe by direct examination. To circumvent this
problem a method of producing a surface replica is employed. Various 
replica media are used for the purpose and include solutions of `Gloy' 
paper gum, thick polyvinyl alcohol, formvar, cellulose nitrate (model 
makers clear dope) or thinned nail varnish. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="../images/haircast.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 vspace=4 ALIGN=left>
To make a replica a thin, even
coating of the preferred replica casting medium is smeared along the full
length of a clean microscope slide. The thickness of the smear and 
concentration of the medium has to be judged by experience since hairs of 
differing coarseness and age behave differently. Lengths of hair are then 
laid onto the medium by lowering from one end, to prevent entrapment of air,
and gently pressed into place. Several hairs may be laid side by side on the
same slide without touching each other. It is also convenient if the hairs 
overhang the end of the slide by a few millimetres to facilitate easy 
removal later.
<p>
Place the slides in a warm dust-free environment for a 
sufficient period of time to allow complete drying of the casting medium 
after which the hair is carefully peeled away by lifting from one end with 
a pair of fine forceps.  The resultant replica is then examined dry using 
bright field illumination to reveal the full scale architecture without 
difficulty.
<p>
<h3>Cutting Cross-Sections</h3>
Determining the shape of the hair shaft and medulla in cross-section are
essential elements for a correct identification. If very thin sections are 
required, such as when dealing with very heavily pigmented hair, then an 
expensive, purpose designed fibre microtome is needed that will cut sections 10-15um thick but as such thin sections are rarely necessary in all but exceptional cases a considerably cheaper alternative is available. Widely known as the `plate method' of Ford and Simmens, it employs a thin stainless steel plate with its length and width dimensions approximately the same as those of a standard microscope slide but less than 0.5mm thick. In the UK pieces of steel or brass of suitable thickness, known as shim stock, are available from ironmongers or model maker suppliers.  A 0.8mm diameter hole is drilled centrally through the plate and contoured slightly on both sides using a fine abrasive to remove any burrs or sharp edges. The general principle is to fill the hole with a small bundle of hair and cut off the excess on either side to leave a wad of hair in the hole for microscopical examination. It will now be appreciated that the thickness of the plate determines the final length of hair section and the thinner the plate the shorter the section. A plate thickness of 0.2mm with a 0.8mm 
diameter hole appears to be optimum for most hair samples since a thinner 
plate is no longer sufficiently rigid. Additionally the diameter of hole 
has to be reduced as the retained hair wad has a tendency to breakup and 
fall out during cutting. From experience the minimum limits imposed by 
this method are a plate thickness of 0.1mm with a hole diameter of 0.6mm, 
though one should be prepared for a degree of frustration if working to 
these dimensions.
<p>
<br>
<IMG SRC="../images/hairfig2.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 vspace=4 ALIGN=right>

In practice it is not necessary of even desirable to completely fill the
hole with sample hair and a packing yarn is normally used. This may be any 
thin, easily cut thread such as silk or perhaps cotton but beyond doubt the
most suitable is 330 decitex cellulose acetate. It is very soft, cuts
cleanly, grips the hair sample well and is soluble in acetone which will
be seen later to be an advantage. To introduce the packing yarn into the 
hole two ends of a strong cotton or nylon thread are passed through the
plate to leave a loop on one side (fig.2) into which a bundle of packing 
yarn will be placed.
<p>
A convenient way to produce a bundle of packing yarn 
is to wind a length a dozen times around a strip of cardboard 50mm wide 
then cut through one end giving 100mm lengths of yarn folded in the middle. 
Depending upon the diameter of hole drilled in the plate and the quantity of
hair being sectioned about 8 to 12 lengths of packing yarn will be 
sufficient for the purpose. 
<p>

The full length of packing yarn is passed 
through the loop of the pull-through thread as far as the fold and by
pulling the thread from the opposite face of the plate the bundle is 
pulled a few millimetres through the hole. The packing yarn is then 
fanned out as uniformly as possible in all directions. The sample of hair 
is then introduced into the centre of the fanned yarn which is then pulled 
through about half way so forming an inverted cone in which the sample hair
is trapped. 
<p>
The whole bundle should feel tightly secured in the hole with 
no tendency to move unless pulled very firmly. If the bundle is too loose 
pull it all the way through and repeat the process adding a few more 
lengths of packing yarn. Using a de-greased, single edged razor blade 
cut the bundle flush with both sides of the plate. Permanent mounts may 
be made by applying a suitable mountant, (e.g. canada balsam), and cover
slip directly to the plate and examined as a conventional microscope 
slide; a separate plate being supplied for each sample. However, if  
cellulose acetate is used as the packing yarn, a small amount of acetone 
applied to both surfaces of the wad will cause it to partially dissolve 
and adhere to itself as a solid mass. 
<p>
Once the acetone has evaporated and
the sample wad hardened it may be carefully punched out of the plate using 
a blunt-cut wooden cocktail stick. If cotton or silk has been used as the 
packing yarn a small quantity of model makers shrinking dope can be applied
to one side of the sample wad which will hold it together whilst being punch
ed from the plate. In both cases, the wad can be subsequently mounted in 
canada balsam as a standard specimen on a glass slide.
<P>
<br>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<IMG SRC="../images/hairrab.gif"  ALT="" vspace=4 hspace=8 ALIGN=right>
Possessing a knowledge of the locality from where the hair sample was found 
together with its colour, physical attributes and the information acquired
through detailed microscopical examination, the investigator should be 
able to narrow the list of possible suspect mammals to just two or three. 
Once a library of reference hair has been compiled enabling comparison
against accurately identified samples it will often be possible to 
positively identify the sample to a single species.

<H2>Micscape Article:  Earthworm Dissection</H2>
<H3>by Mike Morgan 1996</H3>

<P><img src="../images/worm1.gif" alt=""hspace=12 align=left border=1>
<P>
<strong>Introduction</strong><BR>

Dissection of the earthworm involves fine dissection and requires steadiness of hand and precision.
For a general dissection, the worm is immersed in 50% alcohol when, after 10 -15 minutes it will die in  an extended condition with muscles relaxed, enabling an easier dissection to be performed.
For the preparation of the contents of the seminal vesicles, the worm should be killed with chloroform and the specimen should not be covered with water.
Dissection of the worm is performed in a wax-bottomed dish and small pins are used to display the dissection.
<P><BR>
<strong>Technique</strong><BR>
The original incision should be made with a pair of fine scissors.  The body wall is pierced with the lower blade of the scissors, well behind the clitellum, in the mid-dorsal line.  A pin is placed throught the first segment and another through the tail of the worm, so that the worm is fully extended.  The pins are inserted at a sloping angle, to ease the strain, along the length of the dissection.  When pinned the dissection should be covered completely with water.
The dissection will show the alimentary canal, the position of the seminal vesicles, and pseudohearts.
The alimentary canal may be lifted with forceps and careful cutting of the septa will enable this to be pinned aside.  This will reveal the ventral nerve cord and the circum-pharyngeal ring.

The ovaries will be found in segment 13 of the worm.  Using fine forceps the ovary and septum, to which it is attached, is removed (see figure on left above).
<P><img src="../images/worm2.gif" alt=""hspace=12 align=right border=1>
Using a needle, the nerve ring can be loosened from the pharynx, which is  then pulled through the ring and cut off.  The pharynx should go back through the nerve ring.  The nerve cord (shown in the figure on the right) is then cut off, about one inch behind the nerve ring, and removed. 
Both the ovary and nerve cord can be stained with borax carmine and mounted in Canada Balsam.
<P>
A preparation of the seminal vesicles is made by cutting them off and teasing them,in a watch glass, with physiological saline.  A small drop of the milky fluid is placed on a cover slip and dried in warm air (eg. above a spirit-lamp).  The smear is fixed in absolute alcohol, dried and stained in Ehrlich's haematoxylin, before  mounting in Canada balsam.
<P><img src="../images/worm3.gif"alt=""hspace=12 align = left border=1>
This will show the stages of developing spermatozoa and, in most preparations, the protozoan parasite of the earthworm,<EM> Monocystis sp.</EM>, will be seen in various stages of its life-history. The image on the left shows the trophozoite of<EM> Monocystis</EM>.

<h2>Microscopy Scales: measurement in the micro-small world.</h2>
<h3>Text by Alan Maude, Images by Maurice Smith 1996</h3>

<h3>How big?</h3>

The Universe is so big that it appears infinite in size. Our earthly measurements
dwindle into insignificance when applied to it. Miles or kilometres 
just run into too many zeros when recording distances between galaxies. To make things
easier, new measures on a scale equal to these vast distances are required: light-years and parsecs!
A light year is the distance that light would travel in the time it takes the 
earth to orbit the sun for one complete revolution: the distance light travels in space in one
earth year.
<P>
<br>
<h3>How small?</h3>
At the microscopic level, a similar problem exists. Creatures, invisible to the
eye, are often less than a single millimetre in length. Take a look at a ruler
to see just how small this is! 
<p>
<h3>Measurement: a scientific tool.</h3>
Measuring things is an important aspect in all scientific disciplines. It gives us
the capacity to relate and model the things we observe. For example, how would you 
like a five minute wrestling bout with another person who was 3 metres tall and 1 metre
across? Probably, you wouldn't! Knowing the size of something helps us to assess cause
and effect.
<p>
Many people may scoff at such a simple device as a ruler. Yet it is probably the first
thing we will use in our formal education as a way to understand and help us record 
details about the things we observe. At Micscape, we are mainly involved with observing
and discussing things which are not easily seen with the naked eye. We need a
way to measure very small things and we need to understand the scale of the things we 
observe to consider part of their relationship with other things in a similar environment. 
<p>
<h3>The metre</h3>
Our measurement of distance at the human scale of existence revolves around the root 
distance called the metre. This is the Internationally accepted unit of length and is one of
the seven agreed International System of Units (SI).
<p>
Most people can retain a mental model of what a metre is (a long stride by an adult), and 
can judge distances based on its root. A 'mental-model' is important. It gives us a 'feel'
for size which enables rapid judgements to be made in the absence of accurate data. 
How high can you jump: 1 metre, 3 metres or  9 metres? As soon as the question is
asked, you start imagining a 'height' and your capacity to leap it. 
<p>
<h3>The kilometre</h3>
Distances on our planet can normally be described in 1000 metre
sections: the kilometre. If you had a journey to make, you would 
probably wish to know how far you were going (in kilometres) because it would
help you to assess the time it would take to get to where you were going to, the 
cost in transport terms, and if far enough - climatic changes you can expect.
<p>
The scientific world needs to be certain of the size of things and this requirement is equally
important to the microscopist. Measurements taken of subjects smaller than our ability to see
with the unaided eye still need to be relative to our standard root measure of 1 metre. 
<p>
A microscopist's units are as follow:-<br>
<p>
<center><h4>1 centimetre (cm) = 0.01 metres (m) or 1 x (10 to the power of -2) metres.</h4></center>
<p>
The single unit of 1 centimetre is visible. Take a look at a ruler to see how easy
this length is to see. You will notice a centimetre has tiny divisions, in 
fact - 10 to each centimetre. Each division represents 1 tenth of a centimetre and 
is called a millimetre. 
<p>
<center><h4>1 millimetre (mm) = 0.001 metres (m) or 1 x (10 to the power of -3) metres.</h4></center>
<p>
Notice just how small <i>but still visible</i> a millimetre is on a ruler. 
A millimetre is about the size of objects that we humans can still manage to 
manipulate with our hands without using devices and tools to help us.
<p>
<b>It is the sub-division of this tiny unit which is used to begin measuring forms normally invisible,
or nearly invisible, to the naked eye:  <i>a micron</i></b>
<p>
<h3>The micron (um) </h3>
<i>
Note: The 'u' would normally have a long tail in the left vertical bar, but for the 
sake of showing this character on all web browsers, we have used the character 'u' instead!
The picture below shows the correct shorthand for the micron.
</i>
<p>
<center><h4>1 micron = 0.000001 metres (m) or 1 x (10 to the power of -6) metres.</h4></center>
<p>
The name <i>'micron'</i> is actually derived from <i>micrometre.</i>
<B>It is very important to remember that there are <i>1000 microns</i> to a millimetre!</b> When you
see the size of a microscopic subject quoted as, say - 800 microns in length and 500 microns in width,
you can mentally realise this is nearly a millimetre long and half a millimetre across; if you look 
again at what a millimetre looks like on your ruler, you will see that a subject (or object) is 
still visible to the naked eye. However, something which is 10 microns x 10 microns could not be seen 
without a microscope!
<p>
<h3>Scale at the microscopic level</h3>
To put things in perspective, we need to consider some microscopic subjects and their size.
Most people will have heard of an Amoeba. The typical size of this microscopic animal is
0.8 mm ( 8/10 of a millimetre) long by 0.4mm (4/10 of a millimetre) wide: just about visible
to the naked eye! Measured in microns, the creature is quite large - 800 microns by 400 microns.
It is a good reference size to consider smaller life-forms and objects against.
<p>
Euglena, a protozoan, is typically 130 x 50 microns - much smaller than our large amoeba. It uses a 
whip like tail called a flagellum to propel itself through water at the rate of 
20 to 200 microns per second. Compare this speed to its own body-length and than consider this 
to the speed of a Paramecium, another protozoan "weighing-in" at 240 x 80 microns; the latter uses
cilia (tiny hairs) to move through the water at 400 to 2000 microns per second.
<p>
The Paramecium moves 10 times faster than the Euglena in real terms! Is it still faster in 
relative terms, eg.  speed relative to the length of each creature's body?
<p>
As a rough guide, cells typical to plants and animals are called eukaryotic cells and range in
size from 10 to 150 microns.
<p>
<h3>Smaller and smaller</h3>
Bacteria, which are much smaller than any of the other forms and cells discussed so far, are 
typically beween 1 micron to 10 microns in length; the latter being the length of the rod-shaped
bacteria. If you look at the millimetre scale on your ruler, you can try and visualize 1000 bacteria lined up
in a chain beween the two marks indicating a millimetre width... or maybe just 8 Euglena "nose-to-tail".
<p>
<img src="../images/size2.gif" hspace=24 align=left>

<h3>An interesting point to note is that a single human sperm is only 2.5 microns across its widest part!
Around 400 of them could line up across the 1mm notch of a ruler.</h3><p>
<br>
<h3>Beyond light</h3>
The optical microscope can resolve images of microscopic forms up to around 1600x magnification. Some 
subjects (object?) are just too small to be made visible using this type of instrument.  A top quality optical light microscope can resolve two points
that are 0.5 microns apart.
<p>
A lower level of the microscopical world exists which is still populated with living forms called <i>viruses.</i> These 
are so tiny - typically around 0.01 microns - that they defy measurement when using the micron as a standard. 
Instead of the micron, we need to switch to using another unit called the <b>nanometre (nm).</b>
<p>
<center><h4>1 nanometre (nm) = 0.000000001 metres (m) or 1 x (10 to the power of -9) metres.</h4></center>
<i>There are 1000 nanometres to a micron!</i> Therefore, our virus of .01 microns is actually 100 nanometres (nm)
long. To see a virus, you would need to use an <i>electron microscope,</i> which utilizes a fine beam of electrons
to probe the subject and resolve an image up to 50,000x that of an optical light microscope.

<h3>Specimen Preparation for the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)</h3>
<h3>by Andrew Syred. Nov 27th 1995</h3>
</center>
<hr>

<b>Editor's Introduction:</b><br>
<em>Most amateur 'scopers' are limited to light microscopy and may well envy the ownership of a Scanning Electron Microscope, an expensive instrument with incredible resolution. As most light microscopists will
realise, preparing specimens for viewing under a light microscope
can be a detailed and pain-staking procedure. I thought it might be 
interesting to compare this process with that of preparing specimens for 
SEM study and asked Andrew Syred of Microscopix if he would write a short article for us. I am sure you will appreciate some of the problems and limitations involved.</em>
<p>
Andrew is a keen microscopist and provides images from both SEM and Light Microscopy sources to publishers, educationalists, and advertisers throughout the world. You may well have seen some samples of his work in newspapers and magazines, all of which, have helped gain further public awareness of the incredible beauty and sophistication of our microscopic world.
<p>
<b>Overview</b><br>
As with all aspects of microscopy good sample preparation is critical; poor preparation leads inextricably to poor results - the SEM being no <img src="../images/semart.gif" alt="" align=left hspace=12>
exception. Though a vast and complex subject, for the purposes of these notes it will be kept basic and confined to the SEM. In preparing specimens for <i>light microscopy</i>, the process would involve the following (although not necessarily in this order): fixation, preservation, dehydration, clearing, staining, dissecting, softening, and mounting. Similar stages are involved preparing specimens for SEM study, although much of the process in concerned with ensuring the specimen will remain intact when placed in the dynamic environment of the SEM. For example, you can see here an image showing the papilla cells on a Snapdragon petal (Antirrhinum majus) x1000 which, if not fixed and dried properly, totally collapses when studied by a Scanning Electron Microscope.
<p>
<b>The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)</b><br>
Whilst a complicated piece of electrical equipment the scanning electron microscope compares simply (if one substitutes monocular for binocular) to a low-power stereoscopic light microscope where the specimen is placed on the stage, illuminated from the side at and angle of about 45 and viewed directly from above. In the SEM the effective result is the same except that in practice the specimen is 'illuminated' by a beam of electrons perpendicular to the stage and 'viewed' from the side. An accurately focussed beam of electrons is projected onto the sample which it scans, line by line, in a similar manner to an operating television cathode ray tube. On striking the sample secondary electrons are dislodged and widely scattered many of which are subsequently captured by a sensitive collector and converted, by a little electronic wizardry, into an image on a small TV-like monitor.
<p>
Since electrons do not travel very far in air and the tungsten electron source has also to be heated to around 3,000 C without melting or oxidising, the entire system operates in a high vacuum of which the specimen becomes an integral part. The hapless specimen is subjected to a very hostile environment of low pressure (a barometer reading of about 0.0001mm or 0.0000039 inches of Hg) and bombardment by high energy electrons - points to be noted.
<p>
<b>Cleaning</b><br>
Any material destined for examination in the microscope has ideally to be fully dehydrated, scrupulously clean, mechanically rigid, stable in a vacuum and electrically conductive. A demanding set of criteria rarely complied with in any sample, least of all biological samples.
<p>
Since scanning electron microscopy is a surface technique it follows that any surface impurity  will obscure detail of the specimen itself. Oil and grease even from the fingers will be sufficient to ruin an otherwise well prepared sample as in the electron beam it will cause it to char and blacken whilst being examined rendering it useless. Careful surface preparation is vital but depends greatly upon what the sample will tolerate and may range from a judicious application of an organic solvent through to prolonged immersion in strong mineral acids. Once clean the specimen should only be handled with forceps.
<p>
<b>Mechanical rigidity</b><br>
Vacuum instability or lack of mechanical rigidity, if an inherent feature of the specimen, are not easily overcome and their effects may only be reduced by accepting short exposures and/or employing low electron beam accelerating voltages. In severe cases it is often possible to make a stable plastic replica of the specimen and treat it as if it were the actual sample. Beam damage can be a problem especially at high voltages and magnifications where a small area is being bombarded by high energy electrons. The area heats up causing movement, cracking and even melting creating obvious difficulties during photography. Faster scan speeds or lower accelerating voltages then have to be resorted to and the subsequent loss of image quality accepted.
<p>
<b>Dehydration</b><br>
Hydrated specimens present special problems as water is neither rigid or stable and when placed in the low pressure environment of the microscope rapidly evaporates. In biological samples it is generally the greatest constituent and often the main structural component that maintains the specimen's shape and form. If allowed to dry naturally most biological samples shrivel and distort leaving behind a dried relic bearing little resemblance to the live and fully turgid structure. Removing the 'structural water' whilst retaining the near-natural state of the specimen is difficult and never perfect since the main problem to overcome is the crushing force of surface tension that develops during evaporation. This may be reduced by substituting water for an extremely volatile organic solvent such as diethyl ether though the results are rarely satisfactory. 
<p>
<b>Freeze-drying and Critical Point Drying</b><br>
Two methods usually employed for removing water are freeze drying and critical point drying (CPD). In freeze-drying the sample, previously fixed in an aqueous fixative, is washed thoroughly in water prior to being quickly frozen by quenching in liquid nitrogen. Such rapid freezing prevents the formation of large ice crystals that would otherwise damage the specimens micro-structure. 
<p>
The sample is then transferred to a vacuum chamber housing a cold stage maintained at a temperature of between -70C and -90C. The air in the chamber is then pumped out and over a period of time the ice sublimes, i.e. it converts directly to the gaseous phase without passing through the liquid state, so avoiding the destructive forces of surface tension. Some distortion does occur but it is a tolerable artifact if maintained within acceptable limits. More commonly used is the process of critical point drying.
<p>
CPD makes use of the fact that all liquids and gases when taken above a certain pressure and temperature, the critical point, no longer exist as distinct phases but merge into a single fluid phase. At this point there is no density change or heat of vaporisation. The simplest method would be to utilise water itself but with a critical temperature of 374C and critical pressure of 3184 psi few samples would survive the treatment. Carbon dioxide however has a critical pressure of 1072 psi and critical temperature of only 31C. Liquid carbon dioxide is not miscible with water and a transition fluid, commonly ethanol, is used to replace the water. The appropriately fixed sample is dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol baths terminating in absolute ethanol from where it is transferred to a pressure vessel containing fresh absolute ethanol in which it is sealed. The pressure vessel, previously connected to a supply of liquid carbon dioxide, is cooled to about -5C at which point the liquid gas is introduced. Once completely filled with a carbon dioxide/ethanol mixture the vessel is purged with liquid carbon dioxide for about 30 mins. so to completely displace the alcohol that is allowed to run to waste. 
<p>
The vessel temperature is maintained throughout at below 0C. Once full displacement of the alcohol from the sample and chamber has been achieved, the ports to and from the pressure vessel are closed off and the chamber itself slowly heated to a final temperature of about +40C. As the temperature rises from below 0C the liquid carbon dioxide contained within the sealed pressure vessel expands and the pressure within the vessel increases rapidly exceeding the critical pressure of 1072 psi. The temperature is allowed to rise to beyond the critical temperature after which point a fine bleed valve is opened and the carbon dioxide SLOWLY vented. Once the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure the dried sample is then removed and almost ready for the SEM.
<p>
<b>Surface preparation</b><br>
As mentioned the sample has to become an integral part of the microscope, it must be earthed and electrically conductive to allow charge build-up produced in the electron beam to dissipate. To achieve this the sample is coated with a very thin layer of metal that must be thin enough not to obscure detail but thick enough to survive the electron beam. It must be a continuous, electrically conductive layer that will not oxidise in addition to having such a fine grain structure that it is not itself visualised at user magnifications. Various metals and alloys are used for this purpose with gold being perhaps the most common. 
<p>
Samples securely attached to metal stubs are placed on a plinth (electrically at ground potential) in a vacuum chamber. The lid of the chamber houses a gold disc to which a high voltage supply is attached that forms an anode during use. When sealed the air in the chamber is pumped out and thoroughly purged with argon after which time low pressure is maintained by slowly bleeding in a small volume of argon to balance that being removed by the vacuum pump. A high voltage DC current applied to the lid of the chamber causes the rarefied argon in the chamber to ionise and strike the gold target. Atoms of gold become dislodged by the continual bombardment of ionised argon molecules and become deposited on the sample. To ensure uniform deposition of gold, including on the underside of the sample, the stub is rotated at different angles during the sputtering process. A layer of between 15 to 30 nm (1nm = 1/1,000,000mm) is usually sufficiently thick for most purposes. The specimen is then ready to be placed into the SEM for examination. 
<p>
<b>Miscellaneous</b><br>
The end result of using a SEM is to obtain a recorded image of the 
<img src="../images/dustmite.gif" alt="" hspace=12 align=right>
specimen. Much work is often required to ensure the final image has an
attractive composition, for example when producing images for book publishing or for general public viewing. As much time arranging a 'scene' can be spend as for preparing the specimen itself; for example - when taking an image of a dustmite, a more attractive result is obtained by carefully positioning the dustmite into a background of fine fibres and debris from its natural environment. The example image reproduced here from the microscopix showcase on micscape demonstrates this point.

<p>
SEM images are always orginally captured in black and white (greyscale) and are turned into colour images only through the use of computer software tools.

Andrew Syred of Microscopix is one of the keenest 'scopers' I've met and thank
God he's part our small crew here working our spare time to show you the astonishing
world of Amateur Microscopy. Andrew has donated many SEM images to our site so 
we can all share their incredible detail... and now he has outdone anyything 
done before by producing stunning 3D SEM images. This one is of a Heathland Ant. It's just
a pity we had to reduce the quality and size to make it more accessible on the web.
<p>
Try moving your head slowly left to right and back again whilst focusing on the 
Ant's head. Relax and take a bit of time looking at the center of the Ant's head 
until it pushes out in front of your monitor. Pass your finger through the 
projected head and touch the screen. Mind it doesn't jump out and grab you though!

The next time you put on your wellies and creep out in the middle of the 
night to keep a lonely sheep company, you mind like to consider the sort 
of company some sheep keep... like this female <em>Ixodes ricinus</em>,
a common ectoparasitic tick of sheep and deer (the long word indicates the parasite 
lives externally on the sheep). This parasite is a vector of Lyme disease although
this is not a common problem in this country (the UK).
<p>
This incredible 3D SEM image was captured by Andrew Syred on our our small 
crew of enthusiasts here.

<h4>
<em>An explanation from Andrew:-</em><br>
I was asked to produce a 'dramatic' image of a burned-out light bulb
filament but from experience, filaments rarely do anything other than
melt cleanly in a very localised area and retain a high polish. So I
tried a different approach. A 60W domestic light bulb was deliberately
cracked to allow air into the envelope whilst maintaining the integrity
of the filament. The bulb was inserted into a light holder, power
supplied and within seconds the filament burned-out. Upon disassembling
the bulb the filament had turned the characteristic tungsten blue, had
welded itself to the wire supports and burned-out in one place. In the
SEM the filament was observed to have become covered with needle-like
crystals but at the point of weld on the supports a forest of pyramidal
crystals had developed. That's the history, know any chemists? 
Magnification of the xtals was x5000.

<p>
This is a moth, Nemophora degeerella to be precise, a member of the Incurvariidae
or longhorn moth family. Sometimes known as fairy moths because of their dainty
appearance and flight they are members of the group Microlepidoptera, meaning small
moths. 
<p>
The one shown is a male, which has the longest antennae of all British moths.
Along with their prominent eyes, these antennae are believed to enable them to detect
the females hiding in the vegetation of the damp woodlands they are found
in. They fly in woodland clearings on sunny days in May and June, but tend
to be most numerous towards dusk. The caterpillars live and pupate in a
leafy case in the leaf litter.
<p> 
<strong>Original mono-photo and text by Mike Samworth (UK)</strong>
<br>
<br>
This image was created from a single photograph. It was
'sampled' into a PC and converted into a hologram using <A href="3dads.html#dv">Double Vision</A> software.
The effect of having the moth in at different levels into the picture was achieved by cutting,
pasting, and producing varying degrees of hologram projections on the 'cut' parts prior
to reassembling them into a final image.

<h4>
This is a section through part of a mammalian ovary. The tiny rows
of cells are <em>primary follicles.</em> Some of these will ultimately
mature to form <strong>Graafian follicles</strong>.
<p>
The image was created by 'sampling' the source slide into a computer
from an optical microscope by using a camcorder. An image was 'taken', and
then the glass specimen slide was moved left before a second image
was shot. Boths images were then used with <A href="3dads.html#dv">Double Vision</A> software to form the 3D representation
you see here.
<p>
The depth of the specimen is very shallow so the 3D effect is slight.

<h4>
You should have no problems seeing the effect on this image of an Ant drinking
a tiny drop of honey. I put down the drop to tempt the ant to pose long enough for me to 
film it. The image was 'sampled' from the resulting video film and then turned into
a hologram using <a href="3dAds.html"> <STRONG>DOUBLE VISION</STRONG></A> software.

<h4>
Lean back away from your monitor and stare at the Ant head. You will 
need your red/blue glasses on. Give yourself around 20 seconds or so
and you should start to see the ant's head projected in front on the 
surface of the screen. It's slightly blurred and this defect
will probably create a slight strain on your eyes if you look  
for too long, but stay with it to get the effect!
<P>
<strong>For best effect:-</strong><br>
Look at the ant's jaws for a bit then
switch your gaze to the upper left antenna, and then to
the <em>Micscape</em> legend. Spend a few seconds on each and repeat 
the sequence, progressively staring longer at the antenna, and the ant's jaws.
Finally hold your gaze on the ant jaws and the front of the head!
