<center><IMG SRC="3ddoli.jpg"></center>
<p>
<h4>
This is a very good hologram - subtle, and easy on the eyes. Stare at the 
fly and gently move your attention between the tiny writing at the bottom
of the image and the center of the fly's face.  Scan up from the writing to
the face very slowly to increase the effect. You will come to see that the fly is progressively
pushed out in front of the monitor. Don't believe me..? Then after a minute, put your
finger slowly out to touch the center of the fly's face. <em>You'll need 
your RED/BLUE glasses on.</em>
<p>
<h3>A Tip</h3>
Use your mouse to point at the bottom of the stem in the first letter 'P' 
you see in the title. Leave your mouse cursor in this position and stare just below
it at the top of the fly's head!
<p>
This image was created from a single frame of a video film. It was
'sampled' into a PC and converted into a hologram using <A href="3dads.html#dv">Double Vision</A> software.

This is a <em>true</em> 3D image of a flea. The depth of the subject
into the physical slide is very thin causing only a very slight presence
of depth in the sampled image here.
<p>
It was obtained by moving a  specimen slide under a microscope
along the X-axis and taking a video 'still' of the subject twice. Both images were
used as left and right views, and then combined using <A href="3dads.html#dv">Double Vision</A> software.

<h4>


Andrew Syred of Microscopix, one of our crew here working their spare time to show you the astonishing
world of Amateur Microscopy, has produced yet another remarkable image. Did you ever see a flash of silver
darting around the bathroom, and just as you looked, whatever you saw - was gone?
<p>
Chances are that it was a silverfish, <em>Lepisma saccharina</em> to be really precise and scientific. These 
beautiful insects are Bristletails (Order Thysanura). Tiny insects fairly abundant in our houses which 
mostly come out at night. They like to feed on starch-based materials: flour, paper, which really amazes me
because you don't find much of these things to eat in the bathroom?!
<p>
They like a moist environment so I guess that's what attracts them to the small room. I wonder is the spillage
from our nightly tooth-brushing, or possibly the chemicals we use in the bath gives them something suitable
to eat. Does anyone out there know the answer?
<p>
Now don't go drowning these life-forms or squishing them. In their own way they are quite beautiful creatures,
well designed, and in most cases - they stay out of your way. Your house is home to many other life forms which, in
most cases, do little harm; and since we are taking up a lot of the planet surface, we can afford to give other creatures
a bit of rent-free space even if you initially find them a bit repulsive. Such feelings are caused by your own fear
of the things you don't fully understand. Learn a bit about other creatures and such feelings rapidly disappear.

This is a good old sturdy Vickers Microscope, or at least the part of it
where the specimen slides are placed for study. You can see the turret is 
holding four objective lenses of different powers of magnification. Also,
note that the stage is a circular one - commonly used on a <em>petrological</em>
microscope designed to study rocks and minerals. 
<p>
A more common sliding x-y stage can however be attached to this one for 
easier study of other subjects.
<p>
A lot of the material seen on micscape will have been <em>sourced</em> via a 
camera attached to this 'scope'.

<h4>You are looking through the window of an old EPROM integrated

with the micro-small circuit board, which itself - is only 5mm square.
<p>
The image was created by filming through the window with a special
camera which magnifies up to 120x. The camera was moved slightly
to take a second shot: <em>a left view and a right view</em>; these
were then combined using <A href="3dads.html#dv">Double Vision</A> software.
</h4>
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="3dchipb.jpg"></center>
<p>
This second image of the chip was produced using a different technique.
You can see a small needle I have placed on top of the window in the 
chip. No software was used to create this image. A filter was constructed
from acetate and a 'corn-plaster' and fitted to a video camera which 
allows 120x magnification. Note the bacteria and dust on the needle, which
accumulated over a few weeks by the needle being exposed to a normal
household environment.

This is not a microscopic life form but what the heck, it looked good, is related to what
our site is about (looking more closely at life on our planet), so we decided to include it
anyway. Another 3D image from Andrew Syred of a Sea Urchin, <em>Echinus Esculentus</em> to be precise.
In fact, what you are looking at is not the complete animal, but its shell - called a <em>teste</em>.
<p>
I looked around my bookshelf to see if I can write something up to interest you about this 
creature but could not find anything. So it's over to you! Anyone like to send us a few lines

<center><h3>3D Software</h3></center>
<p>

<h3>Double Vision Software</h3>
This software package is available on CDROM for around 25.00 pounds in 
the UK. It is excellent! Available for Microsoft Windows, its main 
function is to convert two images <em> a left</em> and <em> a right</em> view into a single picture which appears in true 3-D when viewed with RED/BLUE glasses; <em> these are supplied with the software.</em>
<p>
Holograms, which produce an image either in front or behind the surface of
the computer monitor are produced by using the software to work on a <strong>single</strong> image. This is used to <em> falsely</em> represent 
a left and a right view of the subject. A typical example is the <a href="3dant1.html"> Ant Head</A> which can be seen in this area of Micscape.
<p>
I strongly recommend the use of this package. It is sold in Europe, the UK,
and the United States.

<CENTER><H3>Thoughts from the front-line<BR>
What's happening to biology teaching?</H3><H4>by Anne Bruce</H4>
</CENTER>


The biology teacher's role seems to have become one of
interminable form filler and fact provider. Deadlines and
curricular demands have to be met, at the expense of children
receiving an understanding of the subject and its enormous
importance and potential in their lives.<P>

Biology is of such intrinsic significance that is disappointing
that the courses that are offered in schools at the moment are
only touching on its importance. Some time ago I came across a
newspaper article which stated that what is going on in a
biological cell is more complex than the science of the
universe. A statement perhaps open to contention, (not least
from astronomers!), nevertheless I feel that the article put
biology's importance into some sort of perspective. I'm not sure
this is always reflected in the science and biology courses that
are offered to pupils.<P>


Curricular and exam demands place high work loads on staff and
pupils alike. As a result, the potential for an involved
interest has deteriorated. This is not so much through lack of
enthusiasm on the teacher's part, more on the pressures of
completing a course that at best can only give a taste of what
the subject is all about and at worst merely provides a means to
an exam result end.<P>

What chance is there for a pupil to develop an interest in a
subject that demands a practical approach, when time and
financial constraints  prevent many of the practical activities?
It seems to be the norm now for practical work to be
demonstrated, or even worse, read about in a book. Hardly
conducive to the development of an enquiring mind!<P>

The demise of many of the practicals in biology either through
health and safety or ethical reasons has also contributed. The
financial climate is such that adequate substitutes for these
practicals have not been properly researched and developed. So
we are left with pupils carrying out mechanical tasks under the
"practical" umbrella. Often the pupil is more concerned with the
necessary tick in the checkbox that indicates another step
completed on the exam treadmill than an understanding of the
relevance of the task.<P>

We need to be able to inspire children so they<B> enjoy</B> biology.
This will not be achieved by courses that comprise long lists of
facts to be learnt. Facts in isolation without a means of
fitting them into a broader picture result in an incomplete
understanding. A more rewarding and meaningful course should
encourage an interest in and an awareness of the world round
about and provide opportunities to discover the importance of
current issues involving biology. <P>

<STRONG>Editor's note: </STRONG>
Do you have any thoughts on biology teaching, and what can be done to address Anne's concerns above? Anne or the Micscape Editor (Email below) would be particularly delighted to hear from people outside the UK on how biology and science teaching fares in their country. Micscape Magazine is an ideal forum for a constructive debate on these important issues. <P>

<strong>Creating a home for Amateur Microscopy</strong><BR>
<img src="../../amateurs/qmc/rms2.gif" width=142 height=141 border=1 align=left vspace=4>Many <a href="HTTP://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/amateurs/mainpeop.html">clubs</A> exist in different countries which cater for the needs of amateur
microscopists. Yet alone and divided, they are able to do very little to promote
public awareness and help others get started. Microscopy UK is here to help form a common
focal point for everyone interested in amateur microscopy and related study areas. 
<br clear>
<P>
We maintain a monthly online magazine and also publish an amateur paper magazine, called &reg <a href="../indexmag.html">Micscape</A>, which contains articles 
published on our web site to help inform people with no internet services.
We are a small team made up of individuals from different countries. We are still funded poorly. But what we lack in size and wealth, we make up 
for in our enthusiasm and desire to help others. 
<P>
<strong>More formal help</strong><BR>
<img src="../../schools/images/marram.gif" width=257 height=244 border=1 align=right>It is a sad 
indictment of the educational system in many countries today, that focus on biology and the use of 
a microscope in this area, has diminished - especially in the pre-college institutions. 
We do have an <a href="../../schools/mainscol.html">educational section</A> but - at this time - it is still somewhat limited in design and content. We would like to help
students and teachers by offering more support in this area. Let us know what you need us to supply on our site 
to help and we will attempt to expand the educational section to suit.
<P>
Many people who become interested in amateur microscopy when young, may move on into professional microscopy. We welcome these people
to help, to drop by and comment, and hopefully give a nod of approval at our relaxed and open approach.
<P>
<a href="../../amateurs/qmc/mainqmc.html">Some clubs</A> have semi-professional status and much expertise exists amongst their members. We would advise early
contact and membership to one of these clubs for anyone seriously interested in following a career related to
microscopical study and research. 
<P>
<strong>Big site: big heart!</strong><BR>
Our place on the web spans several locations across different servers. And its getting bigger all 
the time as we add more information. The best access point is through our front page where branches
to the various sections can be accessed. Several software tools are available from other parties to
help you pull down our pages for off-line reading. As we investigate their usefulness, we will try
and advise you of where to get these from to help you enjoy our site more.
<P>
We answer all email. Our pages are littered with contact points. You can write to any of the people
involved with the work here and expect to receive a human, helpful reply. We aim to make friends with you and 
invite you to become friends of ours. We lack arrogance. We are humble and ordinary folk, so please contact us
without intimidation or worry. We don't care if you are 6 years old or 106 years old, we appreciate all
contact with others and invite you to offer help, contributions, tips, hints, images, articles to us for sharing
with others around the world. Our names are published on our front screen.
<P>
<strong>Amateur help</strong><BR>
In the coming months, we aim to produce more and more articles and information designed to take
<img src="../images/ellpon1b.gif" width=300 height=182 border=1 align=right>someone who has never encountered microscopy and show them how to get up and running. Step by step,
we will cover every aspect of purchasing a microscope, preparing specimen slides, and the use of 
various techniques to enhance amateur study. We are delighted to swap information between other amateurs,
to include details and contact points of clubs around the world so new people can find more support
locally.
<P>
<strong>Armchair amateurs</strong><BR>
You are welcome and invited to do no more than explore the microscopical world from the comfort
of your chair via our pages. But to enjoy this area of interest most, it is far better to actually look
at things first hand with a <a href="eightx.html">magnifying glass</A> or by <a href="../../prodir/brunel/bruncat.html">using a microscope</A> yourself. We see our site as a means to support
real 'hands-on' amateur microscopy and hope to encourage you to give it a go. If you wish to get started and 
want further advice on how to begin, contact one of us directly by email by clicking on any contact link
in our pages.

<strong>Cheap & Easy Microscopy</strong><br>
Not quite certain if Microscopy is for you? Don't want to lash out a hundred pounds
for a starter microscope to find out? Well here's a way to become a 'scoper' for less
than a tenner (10 pounds UK).
<p>
A range of high-quality compound pocket magnifiers are available, from 2x to 15x, which can be used 
in a variety of ways. I recently purchased the 8x magnifier shown above for approx. 10 UK pounds
and if I had looked around, I could probably have paid less for it.
<p>
<strong>Magnifiers: the good and the bad</strong><br>
I'm sure everyone has seen the cheap magnifiers, often plastic instead of glass, and virtually
useless for any real close-up study. Avoid these at all costs. You should be looking to pay between
6.00 to 18.00 pounds for the type of magnifier you need to see things without distortion and blurred
detail. I have provided a few places at the end of this article where you will be able to purchase
good magnifiers at a reasonable price.
<p>
Some magnifiers come with 2 or even 3 different magnification glasses. Most of them can be folded so that 
the glass optic is slid into a case or housing to protect it from getting scratched in your pocket.
I would recommend, as a first purchase, a simple 8x single compound magnifier like the one shown above.
<p>
<strong>What to look at</strong><br>
You will be surprised by how much greater detail becomes visible when viewing almost anything under the 
8x magnifier. Take your kids along for a walk on the local common or just step out into you garden. 
Find any tiny flower, blossom, slow-moving insect, lichen, leaf, nettle, grass, and take a look at it through
your magnifier. Most 'scopers' wouldn't go for a walk without one. 
<p>
<img src="../images/8x1c.jpg" border=1 width=200 height=175 align=left hspace=8>
I picked this tiny wax-like flower from one of our house plants. It measures only 17mm across at its
widest part (tip of petal to tip of petal). It may appear bigger than this on your monitor but you 
can see a film container, or at least, its cover to the left. This will enable you to gauge relative size.
The container is the little plastic 'can' you get 35mm photographic film in.<P>
<BR><BR><BR>
I cannot remember the name of the plant but it is a tropical one with an extraordinary appearance: 
<em>the whole plant, including the stem, leaves, and flowers, look as though they are made of wax.</em>
<p>
<img src="../images/8x1b.jpg" border=1 width=175 height=171 align=right hspace=8>
This is what it looks like through my 8x magnifier. It is very beautiful and more detail becomes 
visible. This flower is probably a bad choice because even magnified it still looks fairly featureless
compared to most other types of small flowers.<p>
I have reduced the detail of the image slightly in the process of making it ready for the web. This was
due to the need to keep file sizes small, otherwise you will be waiting forever to see these pages.<P><BR>

Here is another tiny flower from another house plant. The yellow centre is just 6mm across.<P>
<img src="../images/8x1e.jpg" border=1 width=190 height=176 align=left hspace=8>
<img src="../images/8x1f.jpg" border=1 width=187 height=182 align=right hspace=8>
<br><center><h3>Left image is without magnifier. <p> Right image is with 8x magnifier.</h3></center>
<br clear>
<br>
<strong>Turning the magnifier into a low power microscope</strong><br>

Most families today have a home video camera (a camcorder) and nearly every camera comes equipped with 
zoom capability. My camera zooms at up to 11x. By using your camcorder on zoom and filming through the 8x magnifier
lens, you can effectively make video films of microscopic subjects. Powers close to 80x magnification
are achievable although the quality will be less than what you would get with a real microscope.<P>

<img src="../images/8x1g.jpg" border=1 width=180 height=186 align=left hspace=8>
This is a sample taken from a video film I recorded using this method. I stuck the 
flower onto the side of a film can with sticky-tape and used a 'helping-hand' to 
hold the magnifier; this is a small tool, widely available for a few pounds, which has 
a clip mounted on a multi-jointed arm. I'll show you one in a moment.
<p>
The camera is mounted on a tripod and everything is lined up so the camera and lens
are in a line, with the lens of the magnifier parallel to the lens of the camera.
By zooming and focusing the camera, and moving the target subject slightly forwards and backwards
behind the magnifier, a focused image is soon obtained.
<p>
This arrangement 'models' the action of a real microscope with your camera substituting
for an eyepiece lens and the magnifier acting as an objective.
<p>
<strong>A trip to the sea-side</strong><br>
The next time you go to the coast for the day, take your 8x magnifier along. The 
beaches are littered with tiny shells left behind by the creatures that once lived 
in them. You will be able to examine the fine structure and detail of these 
beautiful constructions. I'm sure if you invest a few pounds in purchasing your own
compound magnifier, you will get a life-time's use and pleasure from it.
<p>
<strong>Props?</strong><br>
The image below shows the things used on my work bench to take these images. From left to right:
<em>my cup of tea (its shadow), a tiny flower stuck to a film can, the 8x magnifier, the 'helping hand' (holding the 
magnifier.</em> You might also notice my own reflection caught in the shiny metal surface of the 
magnifier case.<p>

<center><img src="../images/8x1i.jpg" border=1 width=300 height=168></center><BR>

Next month I'll try and show you some other things to study with your own 8x magnifier.
So you have a few weeks to go out and purchase one. Here are a few places you can try 
to get a good one from at a reasonable price in the UK. If any of you know similar sources
in your own country, let me know by <a href="mailto:mol@molcol.demon.co.uk">email</A>

<strong>The fast lane into 'Scoping'</strong><br>
Last month I spoke about how an inexpensive <a href="eightx.html">8x magnifier</A> can help you 
see more about the things in our world. Once you own one yourself, you
will be surprised at how useful it can be both at home and outdoors.
I promised to show you a few more things you can take a look at with
the magnifier so here we are. I have also included a couple of practical
applications for using your new found tool. <em>Have you been out 
to purchase your magnifier yet?</em> You should be able to purchase one for less
than 10.00 UK pounds.
<p>
<strong>Sit back and relax</strong><br>
<img src="../images/8xbag_n.jpg" width=175 height=178 border=1 align=left hspace=8>
Now don't be in an all-fired rush to flick down these pages. Sit back and relax
with a nice cup of tea. And while you're 'brewing-up', take a look at those
perforations in the tea bags.
<p>
This is how you see them normally, albeit slightly bigger here according to the 
size of your monitor. Under a simple microscope you can see tiny droplets of 
plastic used to strengthen the paper fibres but even with an 8x magnifier,
these are not visible.
<br clear>
<p>
<img src="../images/8xbag_8.jpg" width=175 height=168 border=1 align=right hspace=8>
Now here's the tea bag under the 8x magnifier. You can see how fluffy the fibres
are around the perforations. This is a main brand-name tea bag. Try looking at 
a similar bag and compare it with one from a very cheap brand. I did this. I found
the cheaper tea bag had no real perforations, just very tightly woven fibres. 
This suggested something to me about the nature of the tea within the bag. I opened
a cheap bag and compared its contents with those of a quality bag. Sure enough, the cheap brand
tea was basically fine dust whereas the quality tea bag contained tea leaves.
<br clear>
<p>
<strong>Drill your own perforations</strong><br>
<img src="../images/8xdrl_n.jpg" width=94 height=140 border=1 align=left hspace=8>
If you will insist on buying cheap tea bags then you could of course drill your own
perforations, but not with this drill bit because the business end of it has broken 
off. This is a 5mm wood drill bit. By measuring it with a ruler on your monitor,
you can check to see how much bigger it appears on your screen. Here on my monitor,
a 14 inch <em>measured diagonally</em>, it is 15 mm across the shaft; approx. 3x bigger
than its real 5mm width.
<br clear>
<p>
<img src="../images/8xdrl_8.jpg" width=150 height=165 border=1 align=right hspace=8>
Seen under the 8x magnifier, the broken shaft is easily seen. If you are a DIY
expert then maybe you sharpen your own drills. What better way to check a blunt
drill and your 'sharpening' progress than by using your magnifier: saves having to
keep putting the bit into the drill and boring lumps of wood to see if its ready!
<P>
And if, like me, you are always getting wood splinters in your hands when doing your
DIY, you can use the magnifier to help extract the splinter without ripping up half
of your hand with a needle.
<br clear>
<p>
<strong>Need a hand?</strong><br>
<img src="../images/8xclaw_n.jpg" width=200 height=148 border=1 align=left hspace=8>
I suppose if you still haven't purchased a magnifier, if you do rip your hand to bits 
trying to get that nasty splinter out, you can always get out to the beach and 
find a crab's claw to sew onto the end of your arm: quite useful for picking up and
holding drill bits. I found this one when strolling on a beach at Little Hampton 
on the Southern Coast of England. 
<p>
The 8x magnifier is small enough to put into your pocket or attach to a key ring,
so whenever you're out for the day, you can always take it with you.

A stroll along the beach takes on a new dimension when you can examine debris
in the sand. Under the 8x magnifier you can see the fine detail of the claw
here, and there are many shells, and other tiny subjects you can get to see
a whole lot better at the beach. Try it, you won't be disappointed. If you have
kids, why not encourage them to take a break from burying Aunt so-and-so under 2 feet
of sand, and go on a 10 minute expedition up along the beach with you. 
<p>
It's like playing 'detectives'!
<br clear>
<p>
<strong>What else do I need?</strong><br>
<img src="../images/8xeye_n.jpg" width=175 height=157 border=1 align=left hspace=8>
Unlike almost everything else you buy these days to amuse yourself or the kids,
you don't need batteries, refills, or anything else to enjoy the 8x magnifier.
You just need one of these: <em>an eye!</em>
<p>
It helps of course if you also have a curious mind and the spirit
to try new things. Many people just prefer to carry on with their existing habits
and lose out on getting more from their day-to-day experiences. 
<br clear>
<p>
<img src="../images/8xeye_8.jpg" width=175 height=180 border=1 align=right hspace=8>
The magnifier can even prove useful in a reverse sense too. How many times have
you or your kids been irritated by getting something in the eye. A bit of sand, 
a speck of dust caught in the old eyeball or under the lid can feel like a mountain!
<p>
Just whip out the trusty 8x magnifier to help you locate the offending particle. A gentle
hand and a clean tissue will soon sort it out. Can you see my the tiny blood vessels
in my eye here under the magnifier?
<br clear>
<p>
<strong>Specks of dust or something else?</strong><br>
<img src="../images/8xgrn_n.jpg" width=138 height=227 border=1 align=left hspace=8>
Talking of dust, here's some. Not easy to tell what these grains are is it?
Believe it or not there are 3 different substances here, two of which are 
common in all of our households. The problem with own eyes is that when things
are this small, all we see is fine dust. One of the substances is brown pepper 
which is what it should be when it comes out your pepper pot. But there are a 
lot of things some stupid practical jokers could substitute this with for a laugh.
The 8x magnifier is a proper tool which can help to identify or provide better clues 
about the nature of small particles.
<p>

<br clear>
<p>
<img src="../images/8xgrn_8.jpg" width=198 height=210 border=1 align=right hspace=8>
Here you can see the same dust under the extraordinary 8x magnifier. The left-most
line of grains (running top to bottom) is pepper. The line of dust to the 
right is made up of small almost spherical particles, distinctively different to
the irregular shaped pepper dust. That is because the tiny globes are in fact 
Brine Shrimp Eggs. Not really the sort of thing you want to eat unless you are a goldfish!
Can you also see the 2 or three grains of salt I dropped onto the rest of the dust? 
They are almost white in colour and much larger than the other grains.
<br clear>
<p>
Well that's it for this month. I hope I have now convinced you to rush out and buy
a compound, good quality, 8x (or 10x) magnifier. Here are a couple of businesses 
which I know can provide one but there are many other places where such
a lens can be purchased. If you go out and buy one, why not <a href="mailto:mol@molcol.demon.co.uk">drop me a line</A>
and tell me how you get on with yours.

What is loosely known as pond life, (freshwater life is a better term),
especially the microscopic flora & fauna, can provide enough interest to
last a lifetime.  My main interest is in the algae, particularly the
desmids. The best way to study algae, with the exception of the diatoms,   is to examine living material. Algae fixed and made into fluid mounts can  be useful for reference purposes, but unlike the diatoms which can be   cleaned and mounted in a resin mountant, fluid mounts are rarely 100%   permanent.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/ells2a.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8>

Although I study desmids,  now and again another alga of   special interest is found. In 1980 one of my samples had a coenobium (a   colony of unicellular organisms) of <I>Sorastrum americanum</I> [Bohlin] Smidle, a member of the Chlorophyta (green algae) which I identified from Prescott (1954). My Fig.1. is re-drawn from his figure.  I thought little of this until another coenobium turned up in a sample from Sutherland, N.W.Scotland in 1992. Realising this was only the second colony I had seen in twelve years, I looked it up in West & Fritsch (1904-1927) not available to me in 1980 when the first specimen was seen.  They state 'it occurs in the Outer Hebrides' no figure of this species is shown and no mention of it being found in mainland Britain.   Lund (personal communication)  informs me he has no records of <I>S.americanum</I>  for England or Wales since West & West (1905), although it is known from Africa, America & Europe. It is more common in the tropics than in the temperate zone where it is very rare.   This is where an amateur like myself can make a useful contribution to the knowledge of
algae by recording the occurrence and distribution of rare species at The
Freshwater Biological Association, Windermere, England.<P>

<I>Sorastrum americanum</I> is quite distinctive although it bears a superficial resemblance to some <I>Pediastrum</I> species i.e. the colony is only loosely attached, not compact, and it is globose not flat like <I>Pediastrum</I>. There are commonly 16-64 heart shaped cells; there are out of focus cells coming forward and away from the focal plane in the figure (Fig.1.). The only other British species <I>S.spinulosum</I> Naeg. has bean shaped cells with small processes, described by West & West as a rare species found in boggy pools etc. Lund however states '<I>S.spinulosum</I> is cosmopolitan, somewhat common here since it is recorded from several places in England, Ireland & Scotland though not, apparently, recently.'<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/ells2b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8>

Another alga I found interesting, very common in Britain frequently found in boggy pools where desmids are abundant, is <I>Asterococcus superbus</I> [Cienk] Scherffel (1908) =(<I>Pleurococcus superbus</I> Cienk; <I>Glococytis
infusionum</I> W.& G.S.West) The only British species, it has large cells, single or in groups up to 8,  25-30 microns in diameter, and a striking lamellated mucilage envelope often reaching 180 microns in diameter the
concentric rings of which first attracted me to the species. (It has a nice
species name I can actually pronounce, I am still looking for another, the
desmid <I>Cosmarium superbum</I> so far only recorded from a few sites in North
America, Prescott et.al.[1981]).  The rings can often be seen under the
microscope in normal transmitted light, but not as clearly defined as shown in Fig.2. drawn from life the rings have been over emphasised for reproduction in this article.  With some specimens you may find the only way the rings can be seen is by staining or using phase contrast. With my phase 'DM' type the rings appear white on a grey background.<P>

I experimented by adding diluted black Indian ink to a sample on a slide, the mucilage does not take up the ink, thus showing up white on a
dark grey background.  To a specimen on another slide I added Alcian blue.
The mucilage, invisible or almost so, that surrounds or is extruded by most
desmids will absorb this stain and be revealed.  The <I>Astrococcus</I> mucilage
must be different or it has a skin or pellicle preventing the stain being
absorbed, only the outer ring stained and became easier to see.<P>

To yet another slide I added Lugols iodine diluted to the colour of pale
sherry, (sometimes used as an algae preservative). This must have
penetrated the mucilage envelope, because the chloroplast of the cell turned almost black, deep purple usually indicates the presence of starch, the mucilage was not coloured by the iodine.  NOTE the iodine, stains etc. were added by placing a few drops around the cover glass, these spread through the sample by capillary attraction.<P>

Finally I tried to see the starch grains using polarised light and a
100:1 oil immersion objective. This failed, probably because the lamp a 6
volt 15 watt; ordinary tungsten not halogen on my microscope, a Nikon Skt.
is not powerful enough to cope with crossed polars at this high magnification.<P>

West & Fritsch state this organism has an eye spot and a motile phase although neither was seen during my observation.<P>

<CENTER><H3>"....and I thought the Easter weekend was going to be dull"</H3>
by Mike Samworth, UK</CENTER>
<BR>
<HR>



<p>
The Easter weekend turned out to be quite a good one. I went up to 
Sheffield to stay with my mother for a few days and apart from the usual 
jobs she wanted doing (which included planing a couple of bedroom doors 
after having new carpets fitted) we visited my sister on the Sunday. She 
works in the pharmacy at the main Boots' chemist in Sheffield city 
centre and was working that day until 2 pm. We were to pick her up at 
that time, a feat easier said than done for me as Sheffield has changed 
so much since I last lived there (1980 ! ) and there is the super tram 
to stay out of the way of. When we arrived at her house, Mick, her 
husband was out walking the dogs. As I entered the living room I spotted 
what looked like a microscope case. I queried this and she said that 
Mick wanted me to have a look at it; a friend had given it to him. 
<p>
Much to the annoyance of my sister and mother we spent the whole 
afternoon playing with this box of tricks. Right from the outset I knew 
it was something special, the case was huge, and it had a plate with the 
words <b><i>"Carl Zeiss Jena"</i></b> on. When the door was opened it 
looked as if the instrument was in a folded position in the case. 
Eventually I got it out and realised my mistake, it was an inverted 
microscope.
<p>
<i>
Main instrument: serial No. 240301<p>

Small box of objectives:  <p>

                 <pre></i>        N.A.</pre>  <p>

 x 90   1.30  <p>

 x 60   0.90   <p>

 x 30   0.65  <p>

 x 15   0.30  <p>

These are all very small lenses on small holders with no RMS thread. 
They are all Apochromatic and are
marked 'Tubus' with an infinity sign next to it (infinity corrected?)<p>
<i>
Two more objectives:<p>
 40 mm  2,9    Apo<p>

 24 mm  0.20  Apo <p>

Both with RMS thread.<p>

Eyepieces:<p>

  Homal I    f=20 mm<p>

  Homal II   f= 20 mm<p>

  Homal III  f= 20 mm<p>

  Homal II   f= -70 mm<p>

  Photo 1   4.5x<p>

  K.m          x5<p>

  Winkel   unknown!<p>

  Winkel    K 15x  Mobimi<p>

All optics are Winkel-Zeiss, Gottingen.</i><p>

There are also stage clips, two measuring devices, a lighting unit and 
two dove-
tailed 'slides' that fit where the light from the lamp intersects with 
the image forming
rays. One has a 45 degree mirror, the other a prism arrangement.<p>

The monocular tube is inclined near the base of the instrument and there 
is also a
photo tube that takes the Homal photo eyepieces. A lever underneath 
directs light to
one or the other.<p>

My brother-in-law has no interest in microscopes at all. I have been in 
conversation
with Steve Gill. He has two catalogues that he is bringing to 
Lutterworth, one with a
'Neophot' in, and the other a 'Metalliput' . I do not have the 
instrument down here
with me, but have some of the optics, which I have cleaned up. I am 
enjoying the
'sleuthing' though there will come a point where I either have to have 
it myself, or he
wants to know how much it is worth. A tricky situation!<p>

Any additional information that anyone can add to the above would be 
most
welcome.<p>

<HR><BR>          
            In my last article in Micscape (April 1996) I showed photomicrographs 
          of desmids, comparing those taken using ordinary transmitted light with 
          others to which Indian ink was added to the water to show up the mucilage.<P>
            
            This article shows the effect of using polarised light. A polarising 
          microscope; (Petrological microscope) is not essential.  A small piece of 
          polarising sheet, one lens of a pair of polaroid sun glasses will do, is 
          placed in the light path beneath the stage, another piece is put above the 
          specimen, a piece cut from the other sun glass lens will do.  If you have a 
          binocular microscope it can be put beneath the binocular head, if using a 
          monocular a piece can be put in or above the eyepiece, either the upper or 
          lower piece must be turned to the extinction point- X-polars.<P>
          
            Desmids will sometimes exhibit intense activity within the cell, the 
          whole protoplasm becoming a mass of swarming vibrating granules, when in 
          this state I have found the cell contents will show up when viewed with X-
          polars. First view with normal transmitted light then when the polarisers 
          are put into place other desmids in the field of view not showing the 
          vibrating granules will disappear, only the vibrant desmids react to the 
          polarised light.<P>

<IMG ALT ="Rose hip" SRC="../images/berry1.jpg"width=184 height=143 align=right hspace=8>
<P>The colours of Christmas are reflected in the red berries and
evergreen leaves in the countryside round about us. Hips,
haws and holly are among the most familiar of the berries
providing the bright flashes of colour in our hedges.</P><br clear><BR>

<IMG ALT ="fibres" SRC="../images/berry2.jpg" width=182 height=140 align=left hspace=10>
<P>Hips, the fruit of the Dog Rose (<I>Rosa canina</I>) are pitcher
shaped and about 10-20 mm long (see image  right). Inside are a number of seeds enclosed in a white fibrous material. (see image left). These fibres are
highly irritant and from the image below left, it can be seen how the
colloquial names of "Buckie lice", "Cow Itches" and "Tickling
tommies" arose from the childhood practice of putting the hip
contents down each others necks! The more usual method of seed
dispersal is by birds. The fleshy fruit is highly attractive to
birds and the prickly seeds are either discarded or pass
unharmed through the bird's digestive system. </P>

<IMG ALT ="fibres" SRC="../images/berry3.jpg"width=184 height=137 align=left hspace=10>



<P>Vitamin C content of the wild rose hip is higher than any
other common fruit or vegetable. A cup of rose hip pulp provides
more vitamin C than 40 fresh oranges! Rose hip syrup is produced
commercially using farmed "wild" roses.  Hips harvested in the summer, when vitamin C content is at its highest, can be made into syrup by mincing, stewing and then <B>(VERY IMPORTANTLY!)</B> straining them through a jellybag,  to remove the highly irritant seeds and fibres. The final stage involves boiling with sugar and reducing to a syrup.</P>

<IMG ALT ="Haw" SRC="../images/berry4.jpg"width=178 height=137 align=right hspace=10>

<P> Often found alongside the wild rose is the hawthorn <I>(Crataegus monogyna).</I> Another 
hedgerow plant,  (in fact its name derives from the Anglo Saxon word for hedge, "haga"),  its  
fruit, the haw, is a more crimson colour than the hip and more spherical in shape  (see  left). Instead of four seeds, it only contains one. Haws too, are rich in Vitamin C.</P>


<P>The hawthorn has long been considered as having supernatural powers against
all types of evil spirits. A variety of hawthorn, the "Glastonbury thorn", which flowers
both in winter and again in May has a legend associated with Christmas. The story is that Joseph of Arimathea stuck his dry hawthorn stick into a hill at Glastonbury whereupon it grew and flowered on Christmas day.</P>

<IMG ALT ="Holly berry" SRC="../images/berry5.jpg"width=174 height=139 align=left hspace=10>

<P>Superstitions also abound about probably one of the most popular
and familiar of the Christmas plants - holly (<I>Ilex aquifolium</I>).
Cutting a holly tree down was considered to be unlucky, which could 
explain the presence of many holly trees in hedgerows in certain
parts of the country today.With its evergreen leaves and long lasting berries,  people
associated the holly tree with eternity and the power to ward off
danger.</P>



<P>Holly's red berries, together with its shiny green spiked
foliage are familiar to us all in Christmas decorations and cards.
Holly plants are dioecious (either male or female) and it is the
female tree which has the berries  (as shown left). Each of the spherical
berries contains four seeds which are poisonous to humans, but
not to birds which eat them and disperse the seeds.</P></FONT>

<A NAME="Cary"></A>
Charles Darwin's well known works were concerned primarily with organisms that were far from microscopic, therefore it may come as some surprise that some of his lesser known works were largely based on microscopical observations. These works include studies and publications on Cirripedes (barnacles), insectivorous plants and the fertilisation of orchids.<P>

<B>The Cary Microscope</B><BR>

Exhibited in the old study at Darwin's House in Downe, Kent is a microscope of the Cary type, and is signed CARY, LONDON. Evidence suggests that it was possibly bought in 1831, before the <I>Beagle</I> voyage. It is designed as a pocket microscope, because it can be dismantled and neatly packed in a velvet-lined box (6.25x3.75x3 inches).<P>

The rectangular stage uses small slides ca 2.5 x 0.5 inch and predate the 3 x 1 inch standard slides used today which were introduced about 1840.<P>

The stage is mounted on a sleeve which can be manually slid up and down the pillar to give coarse focussing. Fine focussing is achieved by  rotating a knurled collar at the top of the pillar. The body of the microscope can also be moved at right angles to the long axis of the stage by a rack and pinion movement on the microscope arm.<P>

The microscope is designed to take either a compound body or to be used with a single lens. A compound microscope of this era would typically have a two-lens eyepiece, an intermediate field lens (although not present in Darwin's microscope) and a single lens objective.<P>

The focussing mechanism of this microscope was apparently awkward to use, and Darwin may have had this instrument in mind when he stated in a letter written in 1848<P>

<I>'the fiddling instrument sold in shops'</I>.<P>

<A NAME="Beagle"></A>
<B>The <I>Beagle</I> Microscope</B><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/darwf2.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=RIGHT>

Before Darwin set out on the now famous <I>Beagle</I> voyage in December 1831, he sought the advice of Robert Brown regarding a suitable microscope to take with him. Robert Brown was a pioneering botanist and microscopist who is perhaps best remembered for first describing the random motion of colloidal particles now named after him - Brownian motion. Brown had sailed as a naturalist aboard the <I>Investigator</I> which surveyed the northern and southern coasts of Australia in 1801.<P>

On the advice of Brown, Darwin only took with him a simple microscope on the <I>Beagle</I>, which presumably he acquired during his final stay in London. This microscope is shown on the stamp on the right. It is signed<P>

<I>BANCKS & SON 119 New Bond Stst. Instrt Makers to His Majesty.</I><P>

Robert Bancks (or Banks) was an instrument maker to George IV, and had also made instruments for scientists such as Robert Brown and Sir William Hooker. It should be remembered that the description 'simple microscope' refers to the single lens construction, but does not infer they were not capable of serious research work. The single lens microscope was a good general purpose microscope and gave as high a resolution and magnification as were attainable at the time. However, most of their use would have been for low power dissection.<P>

The construction of the microscope differs in a number of respects to the Cary microscope. The main pillar was fixed rather than having a ball and socket joint and the stage was circular, allowing a watch glass or flat glass disc to be attached. This was much more practical for the examination and dissection of specimens than the narrow slide holder of the Cary.<P>

Darwin would have used the microscope extensively during his voyage, although he may have been unfamiliar with it's use. This, together with the profusion of unfamiliar marine organisms he would have encountered, may have prompted his son Francis to remark:<P>

'<I>His zoological notes of that period give an impression of vigorous work, hampered by ignorance and lack of appliances: and his untiring industry in the dissection of marine animals, especially of Crustacea, must have been of value to him as training for his Cirripede work</I>.'<P>

<CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to Top of Page</A></CENTER><P>

<A NAME="Simple"></A>
<B>Darwin's simple microscope built to his own design</B><BR>

Ten years after his return from the <I>Beagle</I> voyage, Darwin began a major systematic work on living and fossil Cirripedes (barnacles). Darwin had a simple microscope built to his own design, which was intended to be more practical. It did not possess fine focussing and had a larger stage than the Beagle microscope to take shallow dishes for aqueous dissections.<P>

Judging from Darwin's letters to his friends and colleagues, he was very pleased with this microscope. For instance, in a letter to Henslow (the Professor of Botany at Cambridge when Darwin studied there), he remarked<P>

it is <I>'wonderfully superior for coarse and fine definitions than any I ever before worked with. If I had had it sooner, it would have saved me many an hour.'</I> <P>

<CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to Top of Page</A></CENTER><P>

<A NAME="Compound"></A>
<B>Darwin's Compound Microscope</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/darwf3.gif" ALIGN=LEFT hspace=12>By the middle of the nineteenth century, the achromatic compound microscope had been developed to a stage where the optics were superior to that of a simple microscope.<P>

In 1846 Darwin bought a compound microscope because of his need for higher magnifications (shown left). (A larger 24 bit image of Darwin's compound microscope <b>was</b> available in jpeg format as the monthly image download in Issue 1 of Micscape).<P>

It is signed on the foot of the microscope 'Jas SMITH LONDON'. This microscope has many of the features typical of a compound microscope of the time, and which are recognisable in today's models ie coarse and fine focussing, mechanical stage and provision for substage condenser. The fine focussing was achieved by turning the milled screw in front of the nosepiece. It used the English ten-inch tube with an additional graduated draw tube which could be further extended by six inches primarily to increase magnification.<P>

There is some uncertainty as to the objectives Darwin used with the microscope, but from his writings he is known to have had objectives ranging from about 5x to 80x giving magnifications of at least up to 800x with the appropiate eyepieces.<P>

<CENTER><A HREF="#top">Back to Top of Page</A></CENTER><P>

<A NAME="Comments"></A>
<B>Comments on Darwin's microscopical work</B><BR>

Darwin was often helped by his sons in his microscopical work, and especially by his third son Francis. The illustrations for his published work were also carried out by Francis, and for his Cirripede volumes by George Brettingham Sowerby, a professional illustrator.<P>

Darwin learnt to be proficient at dissection, but when he required sections, these were carried out by Francis. It was not until the last year of Darwin's life that he learnt to section using a hand-held razor.<P>

Although histological staining techniques were introduced in about 1850, he did not adopt these techniques. This was despite the fact that his son Francis would have been familiar with such techniques through his medical training.<P>

Most of Darwin's work would have been routine eg counting seeds using the simple microscope or examining pollen grains with the higher powered compound microscope. His patience in such tasks is evident from a remark in his <I>'..Forms of Flowers..'</I>.<P>

<I>'..the observations are extremely troublesome, and will not soon be repeated - thus I was compelled to count under the microscope above 20,000 seeds of Lythrum salicaria'.</I><P>

The simple dissecting microscope built to his own design would have been used for his work on Cirripedes, and also his work on the fertilisation of orchids. For the latter work, Darwin preferred to dissect the flowers rather than use serial sectioning and staining - techniques with which he was less familiar.<P>

He also used the compound microscope with low power eyepiece and stage removed for examining potted plants <I>in situ</I>.<P>

Darwin carried out studies on insectivorous plants, and he is thought to have made some of the illustrations in his book on this subject. He was particularly interested in the cellular changes observed in the tentacles of <I>Drosera</I> (Sundew) and other plants as a result of feeding. The last two papers that Darwin presented to the Linnean Society, London in 1882, just before his death, were related to this topic.<P>

<A NAME="Micro"></A>
<B>Darwin the Microscopist?</B><BR>
In conclusion, can we say that Darwin was a microscopist? From his work we are left with the impression that Darwin regarded microscopy as a means to an end ie to further his studies of nature, rather than becoming deeply involved in the technical aspects of microscopy. It is probably more accurate to state that Darwin was a naturalist who used a microscope.<P>

Perhaps we can end with another of his son Francis' remarks about his father.<P>

<I>'He was a Naturalist in the old sense of the word, that is a man who works at many branches of science, not merely a specialist in one.'</I><P><BR>

presents  the  content of the work selected
displaying images,  text  and tools  for  navigating  the  text.<P>  The

are also provided.<P> The hybrid disk works on both Macintosh and IBM  
compatible  PCs. It is both easy to
install and  as  well  as  being intellectually  stimulating is fun to 
use. The hardware requirements  are
comparatively modest recommendations being System 7 68030-33MHz  and  
486SX-25MHz   respectively with
Double Speed CD-ROM Drive, sound and 8  Mb  RAM.<P> The  project will be a 
boon not only to those
formally studying Histology for  examination purposes but also to the 
very large number  of   amateur
microscopists  who find fascination in cellular microstructures  in  
both normal  and pathological
manifestations. It will save all users hours  of research  time and the 
clarity and comprehensiveness of the
content  will deepen  their  understanding and  consequently  their  
enjoyment  of  the subject.<P> If this is an
example of the success of the marriage of the  two technologies  of 
Microscopy and Computer Science  we
can look  forward  to great things in the future.<p>

Varroa Jacobsoni is a serious parasite of bees. In the last few years it has
spread through the South Western regions of England, damaging honey output through
its growing presence in bee hives. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="../images/varroa2.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=right>
It is a very tiny parasite - as can be seen in this image where an 
ordinary fine sewing needle is being used to move a dead one into a better position
for photographing. The parasite feeds from the bees blood after attaching itself firmly
to the body. A large shield-like hard casing protects the Varroa's vulnerable underside. Once
attached, the parasite is virtually untouchable within the bee hive environment.
<p>
Once inside the hive, other bees are quickly affected. Blood loss leads to lethargy, and with a decline
in worker bees collecting pollen, the honey output declines. The hive itself can be completely wiped out
in some cases within a few months. <p>
<IMG SRC="../images/varroa3.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=left>
This sem image taken by Andrew Syred of Microscopix Picture Library in the UK, gives a clear
impression of this extremely serious pest to the bee-keeping community. Further references for those

<h4> Part 1: Healthy Human Blood </h4>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Perhaps one of the most evocative signs of sudden ill health or damage to the human body is the 
sight of red streams flowing from a fresh skin cut. Yet this very action, as we shall learn in a moment 
is just part of the body's many defence mechanisms. In this article, we shall look at key aspects of normal
healthy human blood, and with the aid of small images, learn how to identify a few of the more serious 
diseases of the blood system.
<p>
Although a serious topic of study, this short article is intended for both students of Biology and general
public interest. It is designed to be fairly light and easy to read without the reader requiring 
previous in-depth knowledge of Biology.
<br>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Red Blood Cells (erythrocytes)</h3>
Blood consists mostly of red blood cells with a smaller number of white blood cells. Several different<br>
<IMG SRC="../images/bldnrm0.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=left>
staining methods are used to make the cells more readily seen under an optical microscope. 
In <b>Fig.1x</B> you can see a sample of human blood cells. These have been stained to make red blood cells appear 
as pink or red, and white blood cells appear as dark blue or purple. A quick glance at Fig.1x should demonstrate that all the cells
visible are in fact red blood cells. It should be remembered that these colours have been produced artificially.
<p>
A red blood cell has no nucleus. In healthy blood, cells will appear as regular shaped biconcave disks. However, at
<IMG SRC="../images/blood1y.gif"  ALT=""  ALIGN=right>
lower powers of magnification they will appear as small red discs with most cells a lighter colour towards there centres; an area
where each cell is less dense due its biconcave structure. It is difficult to see their solid shapes even at high powers in an 
optical microscope. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) can greatly increase magnification and show the true structure of 
individual red blood cells <b>(Fig. 1Y)</B> At 5000x magnification, they look like small round cushions or pillows - the sort that
you may have on your chairs or sofa at home. Red blood cells are called <b>erythrocytes</b>.
<p>
<b>Size, functionality, and other properties</b><br>
An average red blood cell is typically 7-8 microns in diameter, which interestingly - is about the size of the internal diameter of human
blood capillaries. Fortunately, the red cell membrane (thin outer skin of a cell) is very pliable allowing each cell to squeeze through blood capillaries with 
smaller diameters than the cell itself. In a healthy adult each red blood cell has a life span of about 12 weeks after which time it
is destroyed either by the spleen or the liver where some of the constituent parts are recovered and recycled while useless parts are ultimately 
excreted. The rate of destruction is quite incredible with between 2-10 million individual cells being destroyed and replaced every 
second. The reason why this range is so wide (2 - 10 million) is due to the variable conditions where humans breathe: the lower amount of 
oxygen in the atmosphere, the greater the rate of red cell production. By the same process, if oxygen content in the atmosphere is high,
then the production of cells is reduced.
<p>
There are approximately 5 million red cells per cubic millimetre of blood in an average adult. 
Red blood cells are responsible for the transportation of oxygen to areas in the body with low concentration of this life-giving
gas.  This is accomplished by the presence of haemoglobin in the cell which combines with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin when passing 
through oxygen-concentrated regions. This reversible process results with oxygen being released when the cell is in an area with low 
oxygen concentration.
<p>
<b>Carbon monoxide poisoning</B><br>
The red cell haemogoblin can combine with oxygen as we have seen above. However, the ferrous irons in haemoglobin are attracted, and 
more readily combine with,  gas molecules of carbon monoxide (by several hundred times) than with those of oxygen. Should this occur, 
the red blood cell is incapable of transporting oxygen, effectively disabling the oxygen transport mechanism if sufficient cells come into 
contact with carbon-monoxide rich regions. Needless to say - the lungs represent the major site where red blood cells will be exposed 
to gases which they may combine with. When a person is in a carbon monoxide enriched environment, the human lungs will inhale a higher content of
this gas; which will be subsequently taken-up by the red blood cells. 
<p>
Carbon monoxide is one of the gases discharged from the exhaust system of petrol-fuelled motor cars!
<br>
<p>
<i>Note: In the following images 1a to 1d, red blood cells may appear as coloured white or light grey if you are using a web-browser in 256 colour mode only.
This article has been so formatted as to appear colour-correct when the images are viewed as 24bit files (64000 colour mode in Windows).</I>
<p>
<h3>Platelets</h3>
In between the red cells are small irregularly shaped cell fragments enclosed within their own membrane. These are called 
<IMG SRC="../images/bldnrm2.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=left>
platelets (stained purple in <B>Fig.1b)</B>. They are fragments of cytoplasm derived from larger cells (megakaryocytes) found in bone marrow. There are approx.
250,000 platelets per cubic millimetre of blood. Their function is involved with initiating the blood-clotting mechanism - a highly
sophisticated and complex process involving at least 12 clotting factors. Such a complex mechanism which proves so effective in preventing
blood loss, and reducing infection, is also involved in <i>preventing</i> clotting in undamaged blood vessels. The blood-clotting process is 
too complex to cover within the scope of this article.
<br>
<p>
<p>
<h3>White Blood Cells (leucocytes)</h3>
Several different types of <b>white</b> blood cells can be found between the red cells and platelets. In the following images these have all
been stained artificially dark blue or purple. They are larger than erythrocytes (red blood cells) but populate the blood system in much less denser quantities,
typically 7000 cells per cubic millimetre of blood. Their function is to help protect the body from disease and infection. Unlike red cells, they are all 
nucleated (contain nuclei), yet despite this, live for only a few days in the bloodstream. White cells can be classified as belonging to 2 main 
groups - agranulocytes and the granulocytes. Several types from these two groups are described below.
<p>
<b>Granulocytes: Polymorphonuclear leucocytes</b><br>
These cells appear as twisted-shaped purple masses (artificially stained) and are aptly named Polymorphonuclear cells, which
<IMG SRC="../images/bldnrm1.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=left>
literally means 'many-shaped nucleus'. Each cell contains granular cytoplasm and a lobed nucleus; although basophils may not all have lobed nuclei!
Granulocytes <b>(Fig.1a)</b> are capable of amoeboid movement. They make up around 72% of of the total white cell count and consist of 3 main types:
neutrophils - constituting 70% of white cell count, eosinophils - 1.5%, and basophils - 0.5% of white cells.
<b>Neutrophils</b> move to infected parts of the body to engulf and consume invading bacteria. <b>Eosinophils</b> are thought to 
have anti-histamine properties and their population in the bloodstream is governed by hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. They 
also are able to ingest bacteria but normally do so at a lesser extent than neutrophils.
<b>Basophils</b> contain heparin, histamine and serotinin. Where they have not been discharged from the cell, small granules are usually 
visible around the nucleus.
<p>
<b>Agranulocytes: mononuclear leucocytes</b><br>
Two main types exist: monocytes and lymphocytes. They constitute 28% of the total white cell count in proportions of 4% and 24% respectively.
<IMG SRC="../images/bldnrm4.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=left>
The cells are mononuclear with either a kidney bean-shaped nucleus as in monocytes <b>(Fig.1d)</b>, or a round nucleus - lymphocytes.
<IMG SRC="../images/bldnrm3.gif"  ALT="" hspace=12 ALIGN=right>
<b>Monocytes</b> <b>Fig.1c</b> often behave in a similar way to neutrophils by travelling to inflamed areas 
of the body to ingest bacteria and larger foreign particles. Lymphocytes are of special significance as they are involved with the body's 
immune defence mechanism and either help mediate  or initiate antibody production. They are also part of the body's own tumour-cell killing system; they can be 
very long-lived - surviving up to 10 years in humans. Both types of agranulocytes have <b>non-granular</b> cytoplasm.
<p>

<h3>Blood Cell Manufacture</h3>
Both red blood cells (erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leucocytes) are manufactured in bone marrow. <b>Fig.2</b> shows a tiny section from a human rib. The hard bone is stained blue and
<IMG SRC="../images/bldnrm5.gif"  ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=RIGHT>
the bone marrow, consisting of blood cells, is stained reddish orange. Although difficult to identify at this low level of magnification, both red and
while blood cells are being created along with platelets, and are in various stages of development. It should be noted that lymphocytes, the white 
cells involved with antibody production, may be manufactured in lymphoid tissue and the spleen as well as in bone marrow, whereas all the other red 
cells, white cells, and platelets are made in the bone marrow only.

<p>
<h3>Blood Disorders and Diseases</h3>
Blood obviously plays a vital role in maintaining good health and life itself in humans. When such a system malfunctions or is invaded by disease, serious
consequences will ensue. Next month in <b>Part 2</b> of this mini-series, we will begin to examine a few of the things that can affect the human bloodstream
and damage healthy blood cells: blood cancer, sleeping sickness, and malaria.

<TITLE>Microscopy UK / MICSCAPE : Pond Life: Paramecium  </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<center>
<H2>Micscape Article: Paramecium</h2>
<h3>Text by Mike Samworth,  Images by Mike Morgan. Dec. 95</h3>
</center>


<b>Overview</b><br>
Paramecium is a small unicellular organism that is plentiful in freshwater
ponds. It swims, rotating slowly, and often changing its direction.
Under suitable conditions it may reproduce by dividing two or three times a
day and so large numbers may build up.It belongs to the group of organisms called Protozoa.
Most of these are microscopic with over 80,000 different species identified.
<p>
<b>Protozoa</b><br>
The cells of fossil protozoa are often found in enormous numbers. 
They can help in tracing oil-bearing rocks and sediments. 
Many are also of considerable importance as they are responsible for various diseases and infections.
 <p>
<b>Paramecium Structure</b><br>
Although just visible to the naked eye, to see Paramecium properly, a
microscope is needed. You should be able to recognise most of the processes
from the diagram below when observing them for real.
<p>
<br>
<img src="../images/paradiag.gif" alt="" hspace=12 align=left>
 <p>
 
<h3>Studying Paramecium</h3>
 
Although Paramecium is a small organism it has a complex structure and a
microscope, stains and a degree of skill are needed to reveal all the
details.
 
 It is usually best to suspend a drop of water upside down on a cover-slip,
using blobs of vaseline to support the cover-slip.Remember this is a diagram
that has been drawn from a living specimen under a powerful microscope by an
expert. You are more likely to see less features than this, but look
carefully for each of the structures shown. I have labelled some of the more
important ones: (A)=gullet    (B)=oral groove    (C)=micronucleus      (D)=macronucleus
   (E)=food vacuoles    (F)=contractile vacuoles ; and the small dots are plasmasol.
The function of each of these should become clear as we consider the organism in more detail.
<p>
Being unicellular, this one cell must contain everything needed for survival.
<p>
<br>
 <img src="../images/param1.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=6 align=left>
<b>Here is a photograph of  Paramecium.</b>
 <p>
<b>Movement</b><br>
 
The outer surface of the cell is covered with many hundreds of tiny
hair-like structures called cilia. These act like microscopic oars to push
through the water, enabling the organism to swim. The speed of motion is
about four times its own length per second. It moves so quickly that
microscopists have to add a thickening agent to the water to slow it down to
study it.
<p>
As it moves through the water it rotates on its axis and small particles of
debris and food are collected and swept into the gullet. If Paramecium comes
across an obstacle, it stops, reverses the beating of the cilia, swims
backwards, turns through  an angle and moves forward again on a slightly
different course.
<p> 
<b>Feeding</b><br>
 
Paramecium has a permanent feeding mechanism, consisting of a funnel-shape
gullet into which food is drawn by the combined action of cilia which cover
the body and other cilia lining the gullet. They feed on small organisms
such as bacteria and even other smaller protozoa.
 <p>
<b>Reproduction</b><br>
 Paramecium has two means of reproduction, simple division and conjugation.
 
<i>A. Division.</I>     In favourable conditions the cell divides in two by a
process called binary fission. this forms two new cells, each of which
rapidly grows any new structures required and increases in size. This whole
process make take two or three times a day if conditions were right. 
 
 
<i>B. Conjugation.</i>    This is a more complicated method. It involves two cells
coming together to exchange nuclear material. the two cells then separate
and continue to reproduce by simple division. It is similar in some ways to
sexual reproduction in more complex animals.
<p> 
<b>More observations</b><br>
Here are a few things to think of when studying Paramecium under a microscope. 
Observe the way in which Paramecium moves.  Can you see the cilia beating?
 
 
Notice the reaction of the animal when it hits an obstacle. Can it swim
backwards?
 
 
Are all the Paramecia the same size?
 
 
Estimate the speed of movement. 
 
 
Slow down the motion of the organisms with something. Can you now see the
cilia beating with a wave-like motion?
 
 
Place a drop of neutral red underneath a cover-slip. the food vacuoles
become pink and the route taken by the vacuoles as they travel through the
cell may be seen.
 
 
There vacuoles in Paramecium that do not contain food, usually one at each
end. These are used to remove excess water. You may see these fill up and
then empty.
 
 
Add a drop of yeast culture stained with congo red stain. this will allow
you to see food particles  being swept into the gullet.
 
 
Can you see any Paramecia dividing on your slide?

<h3>SCIENTIFIC  PHOTOMACROGRAPHY  </h3>
<h3>by Brian Bracegirdle. </h3>
<h4>Royal  Microscopical Society Handbook Number 31.  <BR>BIOS Publishers 
1994 105pp. Illus. 14.00.  ISBN 1 872748 49 X.</h4><HR>

<EM><STRONG>The  RMS  Handbook series provides  state of the art reviews  of  a  
wide range   of    aspects  of  microscopical  science. </STRONG> </EM></CENTER><P>

None  are for the intellectually   fainthearted  but  none the less  provide a
   useful introduction and  an  overview   for  both   
amateur   and   experienced microscopists alike. This volume is one of 
the more complex and assumes a fair amount of knowledge on the part of 
the reader no quarter being given by  way  of platitude or partially 
effective short cut.<P>

 The author writes as  he is, plain and straight 
spoken and uncompromisingly scientific.  He first  defines  terms  and 
concepts going on to  consider  equipment  and setups,  work  with 
transmitted and reflected light and the exposure  and recording of the 
image. He includes the whole spectrum of recording  from drawing  to 
electronic imagery.<P> There is an enormous amount of  useful advice on the 
equipment of photomacrography written with the authority of one  highly  
experienced  in  the field.

Sources  of  equipment  and  its adaptation 
are also dealt with in a useful way making this a very helpful book for 
anyone thinking of establishing  a photomacrographic facility. <P>For  
existing  users  this is a very interesting book   which  will  well 
justify itself for the number of hints, tips and tricks included. It is 
a must too for any microscopist or photographer who seeks to work in  
the macrographic dimension.

<h3>FUNDAMENTALS  OF  THE FUNGI  </h3>
<h4>by Elizabeth Moore-Landecker <P>
Prentice  Hall 4th. Edition 1996 688 pp. Illus. 22.95. </h4></CENTER><HR>

<EM>Mycology, the study of the Fungi has  been  a  popular  interest   
with microscopists  since  it  had  its beginnings  in  the  eighteenth 
century  and  users  of  the  then  quite primitive   viewing  devices  
became  fascinated  with  the  variety of structures revealed with the 
magnifying lens. This fascination  continues today as the techniques and 
facilities for examination have improved over the  years and as the 
importance of fungi to human and animal health  and to  industry  and  
commerce has been recognised. </EM><P>

The  beginner  is  often overwhelmed by the plethora of literature 
available which ranges  between the
minimally useful popular text to the complex and advanced scientific 
treatise.  This very readable book
strikes the happy medium and  using  a biological approach provides a 
broad introduction to mycology
from  both the  macro and microscopical viewpoint exploring the more 
dynamic aspects of  the  subject  in
an interesting way taking  in morphology,  taxonomy, evolution, 
physiology and ecology.<P>

The text is clear
and accessible  and superbly illustrated  by  an  enormous number  of  
diagrams,  drawings, photographs  and
electron micrographs. Their usefulness and relevance  to the 
microscopist as   well  as  the  field
mycologist   cannot be overemphasised. There is too an extensive range 
of  references  in  the book  which
will facilitate further study or enquiry. <P>

Economically priced this  is  
an excellent  comprehensive text for
biologist or microscopist alike.<p>

<h2>MICSCAPE BOOK REVIEW</H2>
<H3>
Title: Exploring with the Microscope <br>
Author: Werner Nachtigall.<br>
Sterling Publishing Co. 1995.<br>
ISBN 0-8069-0866-1 (hardback)<br>
Price: Around UK15.00 Pounds</H3>
<BR>
<H4>Reviewed by Mike Samworth. Nov. 95</H4>
</center>
<hr>
<p> 
<b>Theme and Overview</b><br>
The sub-title of this book is "A book of discovery and learning" and it is
in this context that the aim of the book is to be judged. After the usual
Preface page, where the author states his love of microscopy and gives some
general advice, the chapters are as follows;
<p>
<ol> 
<li>The Microscope
<li>Optics
<li>Illumination
<li>Photomicrography
<li>Drawing and Measuring
<li>The World of Plants
<li>The Animal Kingdom
<li>Inorganic Structures
<li>Aquatic Microorganisms
<li>Appendixes
</ol>
<p> 
<b>Structure</b><br>
The first few chapters deal admirably with the types of microscopes and
their function. Over-complication is avoided and in general there is great
clarity. This is helped by the excellent quality of reproduction, good
glossy paper with clean text and clear diagrams. 
<p>
Another good feature is the illustration of a wide range of modern 
microscopes, from the cheapest types to those of less modest outlay.
This shows what is available and though it could be argued that such 
can easily be obtained from manufacturers it is, I feel, helpful for
beginners to have these to look at whilst reading the book.
The author is careful not to denigrate cheaper instruments whilst at the
same time advocating how important the optics and their correct use is.
<p>
<b>Photomicrography</b><br> 
The chapters on illumination and photomicrography contain much common sense
and advice of a practical nature. This includes various means of using flash
for avoiding vibration and movement for example. Both areas are given quite
a thorough treatment for such a type of book and many illumination variants
are discussed. Being translated from the German original some terms are a
little unfamiliar but this does not usually distract.
<p> 
The chapter on drawing and measuring makes interesting reading and there are
some fine examples of the art of drawing shown. 
<p> 
<b>Subject preparation</b><br>
The remaining chapters of the book deal with subject material to use the
microscope for looking at. This covers subject preparation where appropriate
and indeed much practical advice is given for this and projects that readers
may like to carry out. The appendixes (the spelling in the book) consist of
a short discussion on microscopy with children and adolescents and a list of
suppliers throughout Europe.
<p>
<b>Images and Artwork</b><br> 
The whole book is profusely illustrated with many colour photographs,
diagrams, drawings and a few black and white photographs. Photomicrographs
of specimens are nearly all by the author. Some are very good indeed, some
are quite awful. However, this does not really distract from what is a
beautifully written and presented book, and I think quite worthy of its
sub-title, a book of discovery and learning. So, well recommended for
children and adults alike and definitely the sort of book that may inspire
its readers into a lifelong interest.

<CENTER><b>Overview</b><br></CENTER>
<EM>This book provides notes on microscope manufacturers from 1850 to the present, with a particular emphasis on 20th century makers. The author has consulted original documentary evidence to ensure that the information is accurate. Serial number history is provided for the larger manufacturers to allow the accurate dating of microscopes.<P>
The book covers UK manufacturers in particular although other makers are also well represented. The book includes a select annotated bibliography on the history, manufacture and cataloguing of microscopes.<P>

This slim sturdy hardback is good value and provides valuable information on the history of modern optical microscopes and their dating. </EM>
<HR>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>The author</STRONG><BR>
The author of this book has previously written on various aspects of microscopy including it's history, photomicrography and biological microtechnique. The book has been compiled from the author's own notes collated over the last thirty five years. During this time he has catalogued the large collections of the Science Museum in London.<P>

<STRONG>The scope and structure of the book<BR></STRONG>
The author describes the scope of the book in the Preface and places it in the context of the previously published works on the history of the microscope. Although the early catalogues of many of the larger manufacturers are available, access to them can be difficult. The author does not claim to give complete listings for each manufacturer but does provide information which is difficult to find elsewhere.<P>
  
The book is intended to complement the recently published SIMON Index (reference below) which is a monumental work describing British makers of scientific instruments from 1550-1851. The author stresses the accuracy of the material he has included, in contrast to the apparently inaccurate dating that has been prevalent in the study of microscopes.<P>

The book is simply structured with thirteen pages that include a Preface, Introduction and a seven page Select Annotated Bibliography. The main body of the book (88 pages) is a simple alphabetical listing of the manufacturers. There are no illustrations.<P>

The book is a fully sewn hardback (25 x 17cm) designed for extensive use and has a simple sky-blue cover characteristic of the Quekett Microscopical Club's occasional monographs.<P>

<STRONG>Contents</STRONG><BR>
The Select Annotated Bibliography provides a useful summary of the important publications available on the history, manufacture and cataloguing of microscopes.<P>

In the main body of the book, the structure of an entry for one of the larger manufacturers is typically as follows.<P>

- manufacturers known address or addresses including dates at each location<BR>
- a short description of the founders, history and development of the company<BR>
- a chronological listing of microscope serial numbers with known dates of  issue<BR>
- additional historical information eg instrument details and prices<BR>
- references to manufacturer's catalogues and other published information<P>

It should be stressed that the length of an entry varies considerably. Many mainly smaller manufacturers have entries of only a few lines with many more manufacturers having entries up to a page in length. The reviewer, an owner of a Russian microscope, was disappointed not to see any history of LOMO the large Russian manufacturer. <P>

The reviewer was puzzled that Biolam microscopes are listed as being manufactured by Mashpriborintorg in Moscow, whereas the reviewer's Biolam microscope (and documentation) states it was manufactured by LOMO in Leningrad. The entry in the book for LOMO makes no mention that they make Biolam microscopes. A US correspondent who has visited the LOMO factory informs me that the Mashpriborintorg factory only makes a single Biolam stereo microscope (the MBS-10) under license from LOMO.<P>

The book unsurprisingly has  the most comprehensive entries for the larger manufacturers viz:<P>

C. Baker, Bausch and Lomb (4 pages each), R & J Beck, Boston Optical Works, Cooke Troughton and Simms, E Leitz, Olympus, Powell and Lealand, Reichert (ca 2 pages each), Smith & Beck, Spencer, Swift, W Watson (3 pages each), C Zeiss (4 pages).<P>

US manufacturers are well represented and include American Optical, WH Bulloch, C Fasoldt, E Gundlach, EH Griffith, RB Tolles and G Wale in addition to those in the list above.<P>   

The reviewer found the book interesting to browse through and contains some fascinating facts. For instance:<BR>

Zeiss had manufactured over 1.4 million microscopes by 1994. <BR>
Leitz presented their millionth microscope (an Orthoplan) to Justus Liebig University, Geissen in 1982.<BR>
Olympus introduced their first microscope, the Asahi, in 1920.<BR>
Bausch and Lomb was founded by two immigrants to the USA,  Jacob Bausch and Henry Lomb, and they made their first compound microscope in 1874.<P>

<STRONG>In conclusion, this slim sturdy hardback is good value and provides valuable information on the history and dating of modern optical microscopes  in addition to a useful annotated bibliography.<P>

The book should prove of value to both the professional and amateur with an interest in the history of the microscope.</STRONG><P>

</center>
<center><h1>Striated Muscle</h1></center>
<img src="mus1.gif" align=left border=1>
Striated (striped or voluntary) muscle is one of 3 classifications of muscle in mammals:
<em>smooth muscle</em> sometimes called <strong>involuntary muscle</strong>, <em>
cardiac muscle</em> (of the heart), and <em>striated muscle</em> - explored here!
<p>
In simple terms, <strong>striated muscle</strong> in humans (and in other animals) is under direct control 
from the central nervous system: it is 'willingly' controlled! In this low power 
slide, nuclei can be seen running along the length of invidual nerve fibres - and 
are visible here as the dark oval patches running up and down the muscles fibres.
The actual muscle striations are not yet visible. Scroll down to see the striation
effect in a high power magnified image.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="mus2.gif" align=left border=1>
See the stripes? Well you should be able to! They run horizontally across the 'teased' muscle
specimen and are visible as dark lines; lots of them! The stripes are a result of light and 
dark bands within individual <strong>sarcomeres</strong>. You will need to consult your text book
diagrams for sarcomere structure and explanations.
<p>
The striated muscle fibres are made up of actin and myosin (contactile proteins) filaments which meet like two sets of
combed teeth. A muscle contracts (shortens) when the mysosin and actin elements are pulled together along their length.

<h2>Using your Camcorder as a Microscope</h2>
<h3>Article 1 : by Maurice Smith - June 1996</H3></center>
<hr size=2>
<p>
<strong>Microscopy</strong><br>
At an amateur level, microscopy is really just about taking a look at 
our world a bit closer than normal. Probably the best way of doing this
is by purchasing a proper microscope and using it as an aid to observation.
However, many people may not be inclined to purchase an instrument for one reason or another,
yet still find the idea of observing living forms close-up an attractive pursuit. One way
of doing this without purchasing anything new - perhaps a lazy way into 
the field of amateur study - is to use the family video camera!
<p>
<strong>The Camcorder</strong><br>
Most camcorders (popular term for video cameras) are now sophisticated enough to contain Zoom capability of
10x to 16x magnification and many are (or can be) fitted with macro lenses 
for enhanced close-up work. An additional advantage is that many homes already 
possess such a camera, which is only dragged out of the closet once every summer,
so here's a few ideas on making more of quite an expensive and under-used resource.
<p>
<strong>No fancy stuff</strong><br>
My own camera has special capabilities allowing me to convert it into 
a powerful 100x microscope - which then enables live filming of all those 
little creatures in the garden where their habits and behaviour can be studied
in their preferred environment. Let's assume though that your camcorder is not 
fitted with anything like this but has 3 basic features: <em>a zoom, a shutter speed
adjustment, and hopefully - a manual over-ride of the autofocus system.</em>
<p>
<strong>The Zoom</strong><br>
When you were taking your home-movies you probably over-used this feature most of
all so you don't really need me to tell you how it works. You merely hit 
the button to move in closer without actually having to walk towards the subject.
This is a key feature if you want to use the camera for looking at tiny creatures 
especially flies and other 'nervous' insects. Did you ever try to sneak up on a fly?
They really see you coming, don't they? Armed with your 'Zooming' camcorder, you can 
get really close and the little darlings just don't see you coming!<p>

<img src="../images/vidmic1.jpg" align=left border=1 width=178 height=193>
For example, take this image of a hover fly taking off from a leaf. I was 
standing quite a way off when filming this, so far in fact, that I had to wait 
for it to decide to take flight rather than get 'spooked' by my presence. I might
just advise you that the original image is a great deal sharper than what you are 
seeing here but to keep the file size down, and thus reduce the download time 
for you to see it now, I reduced the image resolution quite extensively!
<p>
You should also realise that I have also captured the frames just before and after 
this precise moment which provide me with a lot of first-hand detail about how
this tiny insect prepares and launches itself into flight. What is being achieved 
here can, of course, be done for a variety of study subjects just as simply
and inexpensively! Want to know more..? Then read on!
<p>
<strong>The Shutter Speed</strong><br>
Mmm..? This is a bit more complicated to explain. I bet if you used your
camera for home movies only, you never even got to use this feature. Why
not dig out your camera's manual and take a good look at this feature 
and how to use it: <em>it is something extremely useful when filming
anything that moves?</em>
<p>
In simple terms you simply increase the shutter speed to film fast-moving 
objects (or subjects). The faster the 'thing' moves - the greater the shutter speed 
should be set to if you want to film it. When you increase the shutter speed, two things happen:
everything in the picture goes darker and the resulting film footage looks 
kind of jerky when you play it back.
<p>
The trick here is to make sure the 'thing' filmed is in really bright light 
so that when the shutter speed is set high (typically 1000x or 4000x per sec),
the light level is still sufficient to record a good image. When filming insects 
in my garden, I take out a couple of mirrors with me. This way, if they are 
messing around in a shady spot, I can prop the mirrors up to reflect some 
sunlight into the area - permitting me to continue filming at high shutter speeds. If your 
camera has a feature for manually controlling the light-level, it can be employed 
to increase the amount of light received through the lens; thereby compensating for 
the darkening effect of using high shutter speeds.
<p>
<strong>Why use high shutter speeds?</strong><br>
Let me show you what happens when you use a <em>normal</em> shutter speed (typically 50x) when
filming a fly taking-off from a leaf...
<center><img src="../images/vidmic2.jpg" border=1 width=162 height=165> <img src="../images/vidmic3.jpg" border=1 width=162 height=165></center>
<p>
<strong>Now you see it, now you don't!</strong><br>
The left hand image shows the fly just before taking flight. The right hand one shows what happens a 
split second later. In both pictures, the arrow marks the position of the fly.
Not a lot to see in the second picture, is there? Without increasing the shutter speed,
all you will film is a 'blur' of motion, when what you need to do is <strong>
<em>freeze</em></strong> the action; your camera's shutter speed is designed 
to allow you to get sharp frames of rapidly moving subjects!
<p>
<strong>Manual over-ride of the auto-focus</strong><br>
Unfortunately, many new camcorders have auto-focus only. You will need a type
which allows you to over-ride this feature so that you can manually set the focus
level. My camera for example has a button which  toggles the camera
between auto-focus and manual operation. You will see why manual focus is required 
in a moment when I explain one way of using a camcorder for real microscopical
study.
<p>
<strong>Studying Insect movement</strong>
Studying insects under an optical microscope normally requires the specimen
to be killed, broken up into its various parts, cleaned, stained, and then 
preserved in a solution before ending up sandwiched between a glass cover slip
and the glass slide itself; most insects are too big to be seen 'whole' in 
a compound microscope.
<p>
I always think it defeats the objective of <em>studying life</em> to kill something
first before examining it. Surely, a lot can be learned by studying life while it
is is still actually <em>alive!</em>A good example of what I mean is in the area of
insect movement and habits. We can use the camcorder to good effect in studying these
attributes. Perhaps the best way of demonstrating this is by example, so I have an image 
here that I wish to show you.... 
<p>
<img src="../images/vidmic4.jpg" border=1 align=right width=146 height=123>
This hoverfly was filmed in full flight from about 1.5 metres away (4.5 feet). I managed to obtain quite 
a long sequence with the camcorder set to a very fast shutter speed. I can play the video
back to study the wing movements and body posture frame-by-frame - extremely useful
in understanding how the hoverfly manages to maintain a stationary position in the air.
Other interesting subjects to study are wasps, bees, flies, beetles, butterflies, moths,
and dragonflies. I'm sure you can think of a few more.
<p>
<strong>How it was done</strong><br>
The trick is to find a nice bright spot for filming. The hoverfly sequence
was taken in a small sunlit spot amongst some trees on a local common. The 
darker background of the out-of-focus foliage in shadow helps to provide contrast.
I found several hoverflies 'sunning' themselves and carefully moved up as close 
as possible without disturbing them.
<p>
It is better not to use a tripod to steady the camera because one needs complete
flexibility to control the camera quickly to keep up with the moving subject.
The camera should be set to a fast shutter speed and then aimed at a brightly 
lit object, preferably the area which you are going to film. If the light level
is too low, you will need to reduce the shutter speed to obtain an acceptable 
quality of image but this will also limit your capability of 'freezing' fast
moving subjects.
<p>
To get a tiny subject like the hoverfly in focus, you start by having your zoom 
set to zero,  that is - no zoom! Aim the camcorder at the area where the fly is
hovering and turn off the auto-focus (manual focus on). Look carefully through
the view-finder and hod the camera as steady as possible. The hoverfly is probably
too small to see initially against the background. Zoom in a little closer and manually 
reset the focus as you go. It is best to keep your fingers on the focus ring because
you are going to be twiddling this a lot in a moment. 
<p>
Each time you zoom in a little closer, you need to wind the focus ring back and forth 
to try and locate the moving hoverfly. Start by focusing on the main background
objects and then turn the focus ring until the background blurs out. Keep an eye
out for the sudden appearance of a blurred moving speck - this is your hoverfly!
You repeat this process (zooming a bit, focusing in and out) until you detect
the moving subject. If you end up on full zoom without actually focused on the 
hoverfly (or other specimen) then pull the zoom back to zero and start the hunt again.
<p>
With a bit of practice, you will soon learn how to focus the camcorder onto the 
flying insect. As soon as you locate it, zoom closer to it but just before it moves 
completely out of focus due to the zooming motion, manually adjust the focus ring
to keep the hoverfly sharp. Keep repeating this process (zoom a bit, refocus, zoom a bit more etc.) will 
until you have the camera at maximum zoom and sharply focused on 
the hoverfly. Now hit the record button and film it.
<p>
Keep the camera as steady as possible (hold your breath?), and to keep the moving
fly central in the frame. You can either sway back and forth a bit to maintain focus
as the insect moves closer or further from the plane of focus, or alternatively -
you can gently twitch the focus ring of the camera.
<p>
You should not expect to get very long sequences containing sharp images. The 
hoverfly will be moving around a lot and 90% of your film will have a blurred
image of it. But the 10% sequences when edited onto another tape will be more
than enough to show great detail and will provide serious study footage for showing colleagues,
friends, and students.
<p>
If you are fortunate enough to own a video-grabbing board, you will be able to
sample some frames from your film and process them further on your computer. You can
even use various image-processing software packages to produce some dramatic effects.
For example, you could 'cut' the hoverfly (or other subject) out from a set of frames
and 'paste' them into a single image to show the various wing positions 
during flight.
<p>
<img src="../images/vidmic5.jpg" border=1 align=left width=137 height=119>
Better still - you can use software to assemble a few frames into a mini-movie
that can be played back on your PC. I have created my own small movie of the hoverfly
sequence so you can see the effect. My little effort can be greatly out-done if 
you have more a powerful computer and more expensive software. <a href="../../amateurs/mainmovi.html">Take a look at the 
hoverfly movie?</A> <br clear>
<p>
<strong>A few tips </strong><br>
Higher quality sequences can be obtained by planning and setting up a filming
session. For example, you can select a flower in your garden which looks
like it might be a good candidate for a visit by a pollen-hunting bee, and set your
camera on a tripod focused onto the pollen area. All you need now is a bit of patience
as you wait for the bee to come to you. I cheat: <em>I place a few drops of a suitable
essential oil (perfume) into the flower</em>. On a hot sunny day the fragrance can be 
detected from far away, and it doesn't take long before a willing subject dances
before the camera to become an unwitting star!
<p>
If your camera has 'macro' features, these can be used to obtain even closer 
film sequences of your chosen subject. 
<p>
If you have a go at video-filming insects or other subjects of interest to the 
amateur microscopist, why not send us a copy of your film and let us show some
of your frames and images to the world. Email the editor below to find out where
to send your films to.

<center><h1>Book Review by Frank Rowntree</h1>
</head>
<body>
<h2>BIOLOGICAL MICROTECHNIQUE <br>
 Author: Jeremy Sanderson</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>Tradition</strong><br>
The most widely read parts of the  journals and newsletters produced for 
microscopists are the 'How to do it' and technical hints and tips sections because of the wide
interest in  new  or adapted methodologies  and because of the paucity of easily available text sources.
There has been a tradition for over a century that general microscopical texts devoted to the optical
aspects of microscopy and the use of instruments contain some information on the techniques of
microtomy and most  include brief mentions of specimen preparation but these are perforce invariably
totally inadequate for the serious worker whether amateur or professional.
<p>
<strong>Classical texts becoming rare</strong><br>
One of the most common  and regular requests from the former group is for
books on microtechnique which are consulted for practical  aid and guidance as well as for general
pleasure and interest. Sadly the 
great classic texts of the past on microtechnique like Bolles Lee are hard
to come by, costly and becoming 
rapidly dated. The more up to date and immensely useful Peacock in its
various editions is now so rare as 
to be collectible and other more modern titles like Gray are priced beyond
the reach of most amateurs. 
Much information on individual techniques appears in the columns of the
scientific research journals but 
access to these is restricted to the professional specialists who subscribe
or to those who have the time and 
opportunity to cull the literature of academe.
<p>
<strong>A need for a modern reference on microtechniques</strong><br>
There has then been a longfelt need for a handbook that would provide a
guide to the wide range of  
biological microtechniques available and which drew on the vast store of
experience of the past and at the 
same time took into account the enormous strides and developments of the
last few decades and which 
would be accessible not only to professional researchers but to amateurs
seeking to aquire and develop skills 
in the production of plant and animal  preparations for microscopical
examination. This was a daunting task 
for any one worker to enbark upon  and many felt that because of the vast
field to be covered the likelihood 
of one individual succeeding in the undertaking  was a remote one. The
sceptics have however been 
confounded by the publication of Sandersons magnum opus.
<p>
<strong>A book to satisfy the needs of the amateur and the professional</strong><br> 
His comparatively short but information packed volume satisfies most of the
demands of the practicing 
professional researcher and virtually every every need that the amateur
microscopist is  likely to experience. 
<p>
The brief ten page Introduction sets the style and standard maintained
throughout the work providing a 
historical introduction and sections on the methodology and rationale of the
collection of material, choice of 
preparation technique and examination of preparations. The author presents
information in a crisp readable 
format in language which is unpretentious and accessible. The main body of
the work consists of six 
sections devoted to Fixation, Tissue Processing, Microtomy, Other
Preparative Methods, Staining and Dying 
and 'Finishing the Preparation'.
<p>
<strong>Layout and structure</strong><br>
Each main section is divided into headed subsections on specialist subsidiary 
topics making easy the finding of information on particular methods or the
preparation of specific types of material. The text is supported by illustrations and figures including
photographs, line drawings and flowcharts all of which are clear and relevant. The line drawings are worthy
of special comment for their precision and clarity. There is no example of of an illustration being added
for decoration including that concerned with the sinister use of the ringing table.  Tables providing the
formulae and protocols of the various methodologies  and techniques of preparation are clearly laid out
and easy to follow and the advantages and disadvantages attached to each are clearly discussed in the
text.
<p>
<strong>'Hands-on' experience</strong><br>
The author has consulted and tested the microtechniques in the vast
literature of the past and more recent present in the preparation of 
his critique and throughout the text he acknowledges the work of others,
both professional and amateur, providing extensive reference lists at the end of each chapter which enable
more detailed follow up by interested workers.
<p>
<strong>Duality of usefulness maintained</strong><br>
Whilst primarily intended for the use and reference of  professional workers
with access to advanced and complex equipment the book also meets the needs of amateurs working alone
with few resources whose concerns were obviously well to the fore in the authors mind throughout his
preparation of the text. There is no doubt that the ingenuity shown by amateurs over the years in attempting
to develop technical aids comparable to those available to the professional will be aided by the
illustrations and lucid descriptions he provides.
<p>
<strong>A milestone achieved!</strong><br> 
This economically priced and overall visually attractive publication though
a paperback is substantially produced to withstand hard wear and provide long service. <strong>The author, quite
rightfully, has in one fell swoop achieved a place in the halls of fame of microtomy.</strong> His book should be
in the hands of all microscopists who seek to widen their knowledge and improve their skills.
Hopefully it will remain in print for some time only to be replaced by the next updated edition.<p>

<CENTER><H3>VIDEOGRAPHY THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE - GETTING STARTED WITH BLACK AND WHITE</H3>
by
Ron Neumeyer</CENTER><P><HR><BR><BR>


I have been playing around with "videography" through the microscope for
several years with relatively good success.  This first article summarizes
some of my early experiences.  <P>

Like many families we have a full size (i.e large) consumer model VHS camera
with a permanent lens. Needless to say I started with this unit mounted
precariously on a tripod over the eyepiece.  No luck! The best I could
get was a tiny image in the centre of the screen with the macro setting.
Conclusion -  forget the home video camera.<P>

Video systems for use on the microscope are solid by various dealers, so I
called around and asked for some brochures.  The cameras described therein
did not have permanently attached lens, but like the SLR 35 mm still cameras
were threaded to accept a wide variety of attachable lens systems a
so-called  "C-mount".  Mechanical coupler devices of various forms are
offered by microscope to fit the C-mount threading.<P>

When I received the original literature the image capture device within the
camera was either a tube or a  "CCD" light sensitive electronic chip (the
smallest being 1/3 of inch).  The tube type cameras have now gone the way of
the dinosaur, not only because of the much large size and weight, but also
due to superior performance of the chip (no "flaring" and no decay with age,
common to most tube cameras).  I quickly decided that the solid state chip
camera was the one for me!<P>

The next question, black & white, or colour?  As a beginner the b&w camera
was attractive from a price perspective, $400 versus $1100!  (In addition
the b&w chips are more light sensitive then colour, a factor I thought was
important at that time.)  In addition the colour camera needs a colour
monitor, again costing big bucks.  I selected b&w.  <P>

The final consideration was image quality, in the case of b&w this meant
"horizontal resolution" and is expressed by the term "lines".  Although the
image is captured by the camera it is made visible by the  monitor TV.
Furthermore, it is common to tape the image using a VCR.  As with audio
systems the final resolution is limited by the weakest link in the chain. <P> 

Normal consumer VCRs record and play back at around 240 lines, while high
band machines ("super VHS and HI-8) produce at least 400 lines, almost a 50%
increase.   However, if a high band player or camera is connected to a
normal TV,  this resolution may not be realized as most sets less then 27
inches still produce only 250 to 300 lines (normal broadcast range of
commercial TV networks).  Large screen TV's on the other hand come can
handle at least 600 lines.  (The difference between viewing a normal and
high resolution picture on such a TV is remarkable.)<P>

At any rate after shopping around and comparing what was then on the market
I selected a b&w system made by Panasonic, namely a WV-BP100 camera and
basic 9 inch monitor.  Both the camera and monitor produced 400 lines.  The
total cost for the hardware was around $650.  This is sold as a security
system and is widely used in Canada.  Most major electronic companies offer
similar systems although I liked the Panasonic best because the CCD can be
moved about 15 mm to provide some very useful internal focusing.  (Stay away
from the package units solid in various department stores as these have
permanent lens and much inferior electronics.)<P>

I attached the camera to the microscope WITHOUT AN EYEPIECE.  Why?  As the
chip is only 1/3 of an inch square it captures only a very, very small
portion of the image projected by an eyepiece which in turn is
electronically reproduced on a screen with a 9 inch diagonal dimension,
effectively increasing the actual magnification by a considerable amount
(e.g. 10x objective and 10x eyepiece could produce a screen magnification of
more than a 1000x).  This can result in bad case of empty magnification,
especially when the image is taped and played on a 27 inch TV (although
surprisingly enough not as bad as would be expected).  Attaching a camera to
a microscope with the eyepiece in place becomes something of a challenge and
tends to produce rather ungainly configurations.  Any dust, scratches,
blemishes, etc. on the top element of the eyepiece stands out dramatically
in the TV image. An additional Finally because of the extreme magnification
following a small ciliate around while watching the monitor becomes a test
of ones dexterity and patience.  Ergo -  forget the eyepiece!<P>

I had a machinist cut C-mount threading into the end of a spare eyepiece
tube, screwed it to the camera and slipped the complete assembly into tube
of the microscope.  This arrangement, while simple to execute has one
relatively minor flaw, the CCD is not in the "ideal" location, namely at the
level of the primary image formed by the objective.  However, with the
BP-100 this was only 25 mm, not a big deal and only minor adjustment from
visual focus was needed.<P>

When I first set up and turned on the system I was disappointed in the
contrast of the image which appeared somewhat washed out.  However after
playing around with filters (in a sense b&w is much like photography in
respect to filters) I found that a dark green filter vastly improved
contrast.  The security monitor also allows for more adjustment of contrast
and brightness then a conventional TV.<P>

<P>  
  Desmids  are an attractive unicellular microscopic form of  green  algae 
(Chlorophyta)   found  only  in  freshwater.  They  belong  to  the   class 
Zygnemaphyceae  which  is unique among the freshwater algae  in  that  each 
plant  can  join  with another of the same species in a  process  known  as 
conjugation  to form  zygospores. Although zygospores have not  been  found 
for all species.
<P>  
<b>Method: </b><br>
  Samples are collected from boggy areas or the margins of Lochs in  North 
West  Scotland.  Part of the sample is preserved in about 5%  formalin  the 
remainder is examined in the living state over a period of several days.  I 
prefer  to  examine  live,  not only is  the  bright  often  vibrant  green 
attractive,  it  makes them easier to pick out,  particularly  the  smaller 
species,  from  amongst  any   debris.  Also they  can  often  be  observed 
multiplying  asexually  by division. and more rarely  conjugating  to  form 
zygospores,  they normally do this in adverse conditions usually  when  the 
habitat  is  drying out, forming new plants when  climatic  conditions  are 
right. Attack by fungi or fauna can also be observed, Brook & Ells  (1987).  
The  drawback of examining live material is that drawing or photography  is 
much  more difficult owing to movement in the water caused by the fauna  or 
the temporary mount drying out.
<P>
  All observations were made with a Nikon Skt. trinocular microscope using  
20:1 plan achromatic and  40:1 plan fluorite objectives, eyepiece HKW 10:1.
  Photographs  were  taken with A Praktica SLR. using a  Zeiss  projection 
eyepiece 4:1. Drawings were made using a Biolam camera lucida.
<P>
<b>Observations:</b><br>
  A  sample  was received from Loch Chealamy, Strathnaver,  Sutherland  on 
28.9.94  and  examined  the same day, this was found  to  contain  some  50 
species  of desmid including <I>Closterium nematodes</I> Josh.  var.  <I>proboscideum</I> 
W.B.Turner  1892.  This is the first time the species had been found  in  a 
living  sample from the British Isles, the type <I>C.nematodes</I> var. <I>nematodes</I> 
has  not been seen. Brook (personal communication) also examined  a  sample 
and confirmed the species and variety. 
<P>  
<IMG SRC="../images/a1f1and2.gif"  ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=RIGHT>
  The cells <B>(Fig.1.)</B> are 8-12 times longer than Broad, moderately  curved. 
The  walls  have a thickened ring just behind the apices  which  make  this 
species distinctive and gives rise to the name <I>nematodes</I>, 5-9 broad  ridges 
known as costae  can be seen across the breadth of the cell these run  from 
apice  to  apice, when the two edges of the costae are brought  into  focus 
where they meet the cell wall they are seen as pairs  of lines,  the  cells 
are  circular in the centre with the coastae spaced evenly around the  cell 
wall.  There are 5-7 pyrenoids in each semi-cell.  
<P>  
  Tell & Cout&eacute 1993, showed the shape of the costae of <I>Closterium costatum</I> 
Corda  ex  Ralfs  1848. in Scanning  Electron   photomicrographs.  <B>Fig.2.</B>
showing  how the centre of a cell in cross section should look is based  on 
these micrographs. 
<P>
   <I>Cosmarium praegrande</I> Lundell (1871). Several specimens were found  in a 
sample  from  Rhiconich, Portle Vorchy, Sutherland in  October  1993,  This 
large species of <I>Cosmarium</I> is  exceedingly rare in Britain. The  dimensions 
of the Rhiconich specimens;  Length 120 microns. Breadth 71 microns isthmus 26.5 microns;  
are  larger than those described by W.&.G.S.West (1908).  Also larger  than 
those described and figured by Prescott et.al.(1981). 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/a1f3.gif"  ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=LEFT>
  The  semi-cells  are  spheroid, end view circular, the  cell  walls  are 
densely  covered with prominent conical granules (or warts)  except  for  a 
small area at the apex and finely punctate between the granules. The   size 
of the granules are as those figured by W.&.G.S.West. (after Lundell)  those 
figured by Prescott et al. are smaller.
<BR>
<p>
  The specimen in the photomicrographs has had a neat hole cut in the wall 
of one semi-cell, the piece removed can be seen nearby, the hyphae  of  a 
microscopic  fungi  can also be seen, the cell is devoid of  any  vegetable 
matter.

<HR>
<BR><BR>
Glycerine jelly mounts can be somewhat difficult to seal, in warm weather I have found the
jelly in some of my pollen mounts oozing out. I understand a drop of formalin on the jelly
before the cover glass is put on will cause the jelly to harden, I have not tried this myself.
<P>

Some years ago I read of a method of using two cover glasses to make a mount, I am sorry
I cannot give the original reference. I was reminded of this when it was referred to by David
Cuffe in the newsletter of The Postal Microscopical Society, Balsam Post no. 10 Nov. 1988,
again the original reference was not given.<P>

Mounts I made in this way in 1988 show no signs of leakage.<P>

<STRONG>Introduction<BR></STRONG>
Garden ponds are becoming more and more popular and they can provide many fascinating subjects for the amateur microscopist. They are a 'world within a world' and contain a surprising variety of single-celled and multi-celled organisms.<P>

One of the best ways to learn about the structure of an organism is to draw it. The sketches below are of microscopic organisms that may be found in a pond, and have been drawn by Bill Ells, Maidstone, UK.<P>

<STRONG>Multi-cellular or uni-cellular?</STRONG><BR>

There are twelve organisms shown in the accompanying diagrams, four are multi-cellular and the remainder uni-cellular. The name in italics below is the genus to which each organism belongs. The text in quotes are remarks by the illustrator, Bill Ells.<P>

One of the fascinations of studying pond-life is the incredible variety of shapes, sizes  and behaviour of these microscopic organisms. Here are a few you might find.<P> 

<IMG SRC="../images/ellpon1b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALIGN=texttop HSPACE=6>

<STRONG>Rotifers</STRONG><BR>
Rotifers are muti-cellular organisms and have discrete organs such as a heart and eye.<BR>
A:<EM> Squatinella</EM>. This rotifer has a conspicuous transparent shield over the head, and the eyes have lenses.<BR>

B:<EM> Colurella</EM>. This is a sessile rotifer ie it attaches itself to an object by means of it's foot.<BR><BR><BR>

<EM> Colurella</EM> features in a Micscape article where a female's egg is attacked by protozoa. See<A HREF="rotifer.html"> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly </A>.<BR>

C:<EM> Collotheca</EM>. "The cilia of these species do not wave about they are withdrawn into the body of the rotifer, taking food in. In the withdrawn position they look like shaving brushes."<BR>

D: <EM>Philodina</EM>. "The cilia of these species really look like wheels". This is <EM>P. roseola</EM> a species of rotifer often found in bird-baths.  See <A HREF="http://www.diwalk.demon.co.uk/walk/janwalk.htm#pond"> The 'wheel-animal in a bird-bath' </A>.<BR><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/ellpon2b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=6>
<STRONG>Protozoa</STRONG><BR>
E: <EM>Coleps</EM> These are the armoured tanks of the protozoa world and also feature in the <A HREF="rotifer.html"> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly </A>. Bill remarks "when I first had a microscope in 1976 my wife and I spent several hours watching these dividing, the 'barrel' comes apart in the middle but the two halves remain joined by two transparent hemispheres, one on each half, they eventually break apart and the hemisphere grows to complete the new <EM>Coleps</EM>".<BR>

J: Amoeba (<EM>Vexillifera?</EM>) This amoeba has spiny pseudopodia.<BR><BR><BR>

<STRONG>Algae (Microscopic plants) </STRONG><BR>
The first two algae below are desmids which are a fascinating group. Typically each cell is  divided symmetrically into semicells which are mirror images of each other.<BR>

H: <EM>Closterium</EM>. "These were abundant in the sample, 41 cells being found in two drops of water, one seen dividing."<BR>

I: <EM>Cosmarium</EM>. "A variable species".<BR>

F: <EM>Scenedesmus</EM>. Two different species are shown.<BR>

G: <EM>Gonium</EM>. Consists of colonies of cells.<BR>

K: <EM>Gomphonema</EM> growing on the branched filamentous alga <EM>Cladophora</EM>. <EM>Gomphonema</EM> is a diatom, another fascinating group of algae which have silica cell walls, the two halves of which fit together like the old pill boxes. Resolving the fine details on the shells of many species is a popular challenge for amateur microscopists.<P>

<I>Life is every bit as tough on the microscopic scale as on the plains of Africa. There are the hunters, the hunted and the scavengers all playing their role in the microscopic world of a freshwater pond.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>The following real life story is a summary of an extraordinary piece of video footage captured by Ken Jones, a well known UK amateur microscopist specialising in video microscopy. This article, illustrated by stills from the video, tells a no-holds barred story of birth, life and death of a female rotifer (shown right) and her offspring.</I><P>

<A HREF="#unusual">Why this video sequence is so unusual</A><P><P>
<A NAME="contents">

<B>The Characters</B><P>

<B>The Good</B><BR>
The innocent party of this story is a female rotifer of the genus <I>Colurella</I> (shown above) carrying an egg. Rotifers are multicellular microscopic organisms which are typically 0.1 to 1mm long and are found in a variety of aquatic habitats. They are a popular subject for the amateur microscopist because of their wonderful variety of form, habits and life cycle.<P>

<B>The Bad</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/gbu3.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="../images/gbu4.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>There are two villains in this story, both of them protozoa. The protozoa are aquatic single-celled organisms which are usually much less than a millimetre long.<P>

The first is a member of the genus <I>Coleps</I> and is typically 80 microns in length (shown on the left). It is the armoured tank of the protozoa world because it's body is protected by many small plates which often bear spines.<P>

The second and real villain of the story is a diminutive protozoan thought to be a member of the genus <I>Urotricha</I> (shown on the right). It is almost spherical in shape and this individual is barely 15 microns in length.<P><BR><BR>

<B>The Ugly</B><BR>
The ugly member of this story is a fungus called <I>Zoophagus insidians</I>. The fruiting bodies of the larger terrestial fungi such as mushrooms are familiar to all. However, <I>Zoophagus</I> is an aquatic fungi which predates on other organisms such as rotifers, protozoa and nematodes (roundworms). The organisms are trapped on hyphae which are coated with a highly effective adhesive substance. Hyphae are a characteristic of fungi, and are tubular filaments which branch repeatedly to form a network called the mycelium, which extracts nourishment from the surrounding medium. The mycelium normally obtains it's food from dead and decaying organic matter, but in this case the hyphae actually captures food.<P>

<B>The Tragedy Unfolds</B><BR>
The following stills from the video are complemented by captions, which illustrate and relate the story as it really happened. The black bar on the first image represents 50 microns or 1/20th of a millimetre.<P>

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu5.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><B>Female rotifer trapped by the fungus</B><BR>
The rotifer is being viewed from 'above' and her tail is pointing into the screen. The fungal hypha is the vertical out of focus band on the right of the image.<BR>
The rotifer has been trapped by the sticky fungal hypha for some time and has been struggling to free herself without success. Death is inevitable after the fungus captures it's prey. A penetration tube grows out of the hypha and enters the rotifer's soft body. Enzymes are secreted which quickly kill the animal, and the rotifer's cytoplasm is devoured by the fungus.<P><P><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu6.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><B>Out of death comes life</B><BR>
The female rotifer in it's death throes releases an amictic egg, which was probably due to be laid irregardless of whether she had been trapped by the fungus. Amictic eggs are eggs which have not been fertilised by a male, and will develop into another female.<P><BR><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu7.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><B>The tiny attacker</B><BR>
Shortly after egg laying commences, the tiny protozoan (possibly <I>Urotricha</I> genus) attacks the egg. Despite it's size, the protozoan apppears to attach itself quite firmly and pushes and pulls on the egg membrane. The image left showing the distorted egg illustrates the force that the tiny attacker is exerting.<P><BR><BR><BR>  

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu8.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><B>The egg is destroyed</B><BR>
The protozoan does not succeed in the first two attacks on the egg, but in the third attempt the egg is ruptured and disgorges it's contents into the surrounding water. The protozoan can be seen moving away out of the plane of focus of the video still.<P><BR><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu9.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><B>The scavengers move in</B><BR>
Like hyenas on an African plain, there are scavengers in the freshwater world eager to feed on the dead and dying. Barely thirty seconds after the egg is first ruptured, two larger protozoa of the genus <I>Coleps</I> eagerly dive onto the granular contents of the egg.<P><BR><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/gbu10.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><B>The end of a mother and her young</B><BR>
Less than seventeen seconds after the <I>Coleps'</I> first arrived, the egg had been completely consumed. The image shows one of the <I>Coleps</I> eating the last vestiges of the egg yolk, with it's partner in crime leaving the plane of focus on the right having had a tasty meal.<P><BR><BR>

The mother, having failed in an attempt to give birth to her potential offspring, is still left in the clutches of the fungus, which will make a meal of her. Life is tough in the microscopic world!<P><BR>

<A NAME="unusual">
<B>Why this video sequence is so unusual</B><BR>
The video sequence recorded by Ken Jones was studied by Dr Alan Warren of the Natural History Museum, Microbiology Group. Dr Warren remarked that he and his colleagues have not previously observed ciliated protozoa thought to be of the <I>Urotricha</I> genus attacking and rupturing rotifer eggs. He was also not aware of similar instances reported in the literature.<P>

<B>This article shows that it is possible for the amateur microscopist to make a valuable scientific contribution to our knowledge of the behaviour of freshwater organisms.</B><P>

<p>
<B>Postscript</B><BR>
After Ken Jones and Eric Hollowday originally published their article on this video sequence, they found out that a microscopist in 1859 or earlier had made a similar observation! In his classic book 'Evenings at the Microscope' P. H. Gosse described how a group of <I>Coleps</I> attacked and killed a rotifer hatching from it's egg. This was later followed by an attack by a group of ciliated protozoa.<P>
 
This postscript illustrates an interesting point which Jones and Hollowday eloquently state in their letter to 'Microscopy' ie that Gosse's observations 'are not only of great interest for their relevance to our paper over a century later, but also serve to demonstrate the scientifically valuable information pertinent to modern studies which one can so often find in old works which might otherwise be thought obsolete and unwisely discarded.' <P>

<I>Stentor</I> are one of the largest protozoa found in water, and is therefore one of the easiest for the microscopist to study. This article describes where you can find the <I>Stentor</I> and how different types of illumination under the microscope can be used to show the characteristic features of a protozoan.<p><br clear><B>What are protozoa and where to find the <I>Stentor</I></B><BR>Protozoa are single-celled organisms and are one of the simplest forms of life. In the modern classification of organisms, the protozoa belong to the kingdom Protista along with the algae and lower fungi.The Protozoa are unique in that the single cell performs all the functions of feeding, digestion, excretion, respiration and reproduction.<P>Although most protozoans are microscopic, the <I>Stentor</I> is the exception to this rule and can be up to 2mm long! It is therefore larger than many of the multi-cellular organisms found in freshwater such as rotifers and water-fleas, and has been known to eat the smaller members of these groups.<P><I>Stentor</I> are usually present in most freshwater ponds. Take a few pieces of the stem of any floating plant eg Potamogeton, which has spear-shaped leaves. Place the stems in some water in a shallow dish and allow a few minutes for the water to settle. Examine the stems with a 10x hand lens - any <I>Stentor</I> present on the stem will be visible as long trumpet-shaped organisms. <I>Stentor</I> may also be swimming freely, when they become more oval in shape with a narrowing at their posterior.<P>Autumn (the Fall) is a good time of year to find <I>Stentor</I> because leaves falling into a pond increase the bacteria population feeding on the decaying vegetation. This leads in turn to an increase in the population of protozoa such as <I>Stentor</I> which feed on the bacteria.<P>Colonies of Stentor often occur, in which the lower parts of the animals are covered with a mucilaginous substance which they secrete.<P><I>Stentor</I> is remarkable for it's regenerative powers; a small fragment one-hundredth the volume of an adult can grow back to a complete organism. This capability has made <I>Stentor</I> a favourite subject amongst biologists for studies of regeneration in protozoans.<P><B>General features of the <I>Stentor</I></B><BR><IMG SRC="../images/stenbf.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=LEFT>The image at the top of this page shows a typical view of a <I>Stentor</I> using bright field illumination. When attached to a substrate, the <I>Stentor</I> has a trumpet shape. Any disturbance makes the whole body contract to become a blob of protoplasm. The image to the left shows <I>Stentor</I> when swimming where it adopts an oval or pear shape.<P><BR>The rim of the trumpet is surrounded by a crown of cilia (vibrating hairs) which beat to produce a current that draws particles of food down into the gullet.To find new feeding grounds, the animal swims by means of cilia that cover the body.<P><IMG SRC="../images/stendff.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=LEFT><I>Stentor</I> can be very colourful - there are green, blue and amethyst coloured species. The figure on the left shows a green form using dark field illumination. The green colour is a result of the microscopic green algae which <I>Stentor</I> ingests. The algae live in symbiosis with the Stentor, ie the algae and Stentor mutually benefit from the close association. The algae uses photosynthesis to convert <I>Stentor's</I> waste products to useful nutrients.<P><BR><BR><B>Observing features using phase contrast</B><BR>To observe the cilia of Stentor, a special type of illumination called phase contrast can be very useful. The figure on the right below shows the cilia, which are not sharply focussed because they are in constant motion.<P>Although not clearly seen in the photographs, <I>Stentor</I> has a macronucleus in the form of a string of beads along the body length.<P><IMG SRC="../images/stenpcv1.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=RIGHT>A second feature of Stentor as a typical protozoan is the contractile vacuole, which is also seen in the right hand figure. The concentration of salts in the bodies of freshwater protozoans is higher than in the surrounding water, so the water continually enters the animal through its' external membrane by osmosis. The excess water collects in the contractile vacuole, which at intervals discharges it to the outside. A few minutes studying <I>Stentor</I> should show one of them with a collapsing vacuole.<P>When examining microscopic subjects, particularly the Protozoa, it is worth trying the various forms of illumination available to you. Bright field is the standard method of illumination, but dark field, oblique and Rheinberg illumination are worth trying and well within the scope of the amateur. Phase contrast illumination is a more specialised form of microscopy which requires special objectives and condensers. Phase contrast is particularly valuable for highlighting structures such as cilia and flagella of Protozoa.<P><B>Equipment used</B><BR>All images captured from still frames of VHS videos using a Creative Video Spigot capture card.<P>Videos originate from Maurice Smith (first image) and David Walker (other images).<P>Primary microscope magnifications in the range 200-400x before projection into a CCD video camera.<P>Phase contrast images taken using Cooke, Troughton and Simms phase contrast microscope.Other microscope images taken using Russian Biolam nicroscope.<P>Image manipulation using Photostyler software.<P><BR><B>References and sources of information:-</B><BR>1) A Beginners Guide to the Collection, Isolation, Cultivation and Identification of Freshwater Protozoa by B J Finlay, A Rogerson and A J Cowling.

<center><h1>Sebaceous Gland in human skin</h1></center>
<img src="sgbig.gif" align=left >

Sebaceous glands are found throughout human skin where they assist the hair follicle in 
maintaining the healthy condition of skin hair. You are observing a vertical section
of human skin taken from just below the surface. 
<p>
Sebaceous glands produce an oil called <strong>sebum</strong>, whick keeps the skin hair
supple and waterproof. The duct of the gland is shown <strong>-{3}</strong>. Below this,
it is possible to see cells breaking down and releasing the sebum <strong>-{1}.</strong>
<p>
At the base of the gland, complete cells can be seen with their nuclei 
intact <strong>-{2}.</strong> These glands are most numerous on the head,
face, chest and back of humans.

My friend, Terry Silk, recently lent me three boxes of slides, apparently 
of considerable age. Terry bought these from a market stall about twenty years 
ago in either Tiverton or Taunton in England.
<P>
I thought it would be interesting to try and find out the origin of the slides -
and where better to try then on the world-wide web.
<p>Maybe <strong><em>you</em></strong> can help track down their source?
<br clear>
<p>

<img src="../images/x_strg3.jpg" border=1 width=201 height=223 align=right>
The boxes are roughly cubical, about 90mm x 95mm and around 65mm in height. They
are dark grey in colour. Here is a closer look at one of the boxes I photographed
in Black & White. <p><em>Not a lot to go on, I know.</em>

<br clear>
<p>

<img src="../images/x_strg2.jpg" border=1 width=238 height=126 align=left>

Inside any of the boxes, the slides are neatly contained with many of the slides
being 50mm wide x 75mm long and 2mm thick. The boxes also contain slides of the standard
size.
<br clear>
<p>

<img src="../images/x_strg4.jpg" border=1 width=240 height=180 align=right hspace=8 vspace=12>
All the slides are of rock sections. Making allowance for age, they
are well made and contain igneous rock sections - essentially granite - from Australia
and South Africa. There seems nothing unusual about the rocks concerned. Most are labelled as per this
example.
<br clear>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<em>"Now, the interesting questions are: who was this widely travelled geologist, and 
why was he so interested in igneous rock?"</em>

<h2><I>Welcome to the <b>dark side</b> of Micscape and microscopy. Hold on tight to
the arms of your seat, get the smelling salts (or better still - a glass of brandy) ready,
for we are about to experience...  A Nightmare on Mic Street</I></h2>
<h4><i>Part 3: Parlour Talk</i><br>
by Maurice Smith.</h4>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>What fills us with fear?</h3>
For some it is the thought of going to the dentist, for others it is spiders, injections,
or the fear of madness or going blind. The microscope in its various disguises can help us
examine these nightmares close-up. In this mini series, I will take you month by month, through
some of our common nightmares. <i>Did you think Microscopy was about quiet, studious, safe things?</i>
I hope not. 'Scoping' can take us nearer to beauty or closer to the savage truth of reality. For this 
month, let us consider our tiny house guest:-
<center><h1> The Spider ! </h1></center>
<p>

<p>
<h3>Arachnophobia</h3>
Many people have an irrational fear of spiders. I used to suffer from arachnophobia - 'a fear of spiders', myself and I fully 
understand the terror of knowing that a tiny spider is in the same room as me. There was a time in my life when I could 
not go to bed at night without making a complete survey of my bedroom and frantically 'stamping' out the life of any 
spiders found. That was a long time ago and today I can normally pick up most house spiders with my hand and even let them
run over my face and body! I taught myself to beat the fear over a period of years. Maybe I can help you ovecome your fear
the same way?
<p>
The first step to beating the fear of something is to learn more about the actual thing which frightens you. Although it is the 
middle of winter (as I write), I'll go and have a good look around my house to see if I can find a spider to show you.
Hold on while I go and look... 
<p>
<i>Creak... rustle...  patter... patter... clunk!!</i>
<p>
<b>Yup, got one!</b> Found it in the bathroom. I'm afraid it's only a tiny little one about 4-5 mm long but once I put it in a 
glass and turn my camera on, you should see it clear enough. Right, I'll just coax it around the glass to the light... there
we go - one little spider as seen from beneath:-
<center><img src="../images/spidhous.gif" alt=""></center>
<br>
<p>
A bit fuzzy, but never mind. I'll show you some clearer images in a moment after I tell you a bit more about spiders in general.
Don't go running out of the room yet. Stay with me, grit your teeth, and in a few minutes you might find these tiny creatures 
are a lot more attractive then you originally thought.
<p>
<h3>Arachnids</h3>
Spiders belong to a group of animals called <i>arachnids</i>. This family also contains mites, scorpions, ticks, and harvestmen. All 
of them have eight legs and are arthropods. There are over 32000 different known species of spiders, and most of them are able to inject 
poison into their prey, although extremely few of them
are able to kill a human being. Even this little spider I just found in the bathroom has a bite which carries a powerful venom. Most 
spiders would not bite you anyway, simply because you are not food; athough if you aggravated one long enough it might take a nip as a 
defensive move. Most of our household spiders in the UK are incapable of penetrating our tough skin so you have nothing <i>real</i> to
fear from them. If you live in a tropical climate, I would be a bit more cautious: some of smallest spiders in warmer countries have the most poisonous 
bite!
<p>
<h3>Can they see you?</h3>
Most spiders have eight eyes although some have none at all. Even the ones that can see do not get a very clear view of the world around them.
It is almost certain that they are unable to see you. Of course, if one was walking on your skin, it would be able to see the surface it
ran on. <i>Sorry, didn't mean to make you cringe!</i> Spiders rely more on their sense of smell and the their refined ability to detect
vibrations. In fact some spiders are so poor at seeing, they are equipped with a special comb which they can rub to make a noise and signal
their presence to a prospective mate. Often two 'love-birds' may only be a few centimetres from each other but would be unable to find each
other without this sound-making and detection capability. Spiders also use chemical signals to identify themselves to each other during, or 
before, the mating ritual.
<p>

At the front of their bodies, spiders have a pair of pedipalps. These often look like short legs. These are used in much the same way as insects
use antennae (or feelers) to help the spider find its way around. Male spiders also store their sperm in the pedipalps for use during mating rituals.
You can see the pedipalps (out-of-focus) in our little spider here. Also note some of the eight eyes at 
the top of the head.
<P>
<img src="../images/spidweb.gif" alt="" align=left hspace=8 vspace=8>
Spiders can spin different types of silk using special glands inside their bodies at the rear of the
abdomen. They use 'dry' silk as safety threads when climbing or when spinning cocoons to protect their eggs. When they
need to spin a web to trap flies and other insects, has other glands to deposite a sticky substance along the thread 
as fine droplets. The spider is aware of these points when traversing its own web, and thereby avoids becoming trapped in its
own 'fishing net'. You can see my little spider in the glass has spun some silk <i>(A)</i>. It is interesting to note that this single fine thread is stronger than
a steel one of the same diameter, and can be stretched to one and a third times its length without breaking!
<p>
Young garden spiders can often be seen in the summer garden 'ballooning' : they attach a fine strand of silk 
to a plant leaf or stem and let the wind catch the thread to lift them up and carry them far away from their birth place. This technique
has enabled the spider to populate many islands close to mainland, literally by ballooning across the sea.
<p>
One such island is Hawai. If you are a student or an amateur microscopist or naturalist in this area of the world, you can help someone 
who is researching spiders in the area. <a href="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/JASON/HTMS/SPIDERS_HOME.HTML">Like to know more about this?</A>

<h3>Man's best friend!</h3>
The spider is really man's best friend. Imagine a world over-run with flies. Life would be intolerable! Without our friend the spider eating other insects
like the fly, many serious pests would rise in number and present humankind with an incredible problem - one which would seriously affect our chances 
of survival. Even the good old household spider, like the little one I have here, does his part. Imagine how much it would cost to develop tiny little robots
to roam over your house and clean up the maggots, eggs, flies, larva and other living things hidden away in every crack and cranny throughout your home. The spider
does it all for you, and all for nothing. Most times he even has the sense to stay out of the way when you are around.
So if you wan't to keep the real pests down, tolerate the spider a bit more in your home. If you really cannot bear to have one in the room with you, go and fetch 
a glass, pop it over the spider before he runs for it, and slip a postcard or stiff bit of paper under the glass to temporarily seal it in. You can then turn the glass upright
and with the card or paper still held on top, take it out into the garden and let it go. One deft flick of the glass low to the ground should do it. 
<p>
<br>
<h3>Spiders in the bath</h3>
It's happened to you too, eh? You have a long day at the office or at home with the kids, and decide to have a nice warm bath or shower to relax. But when you 
get to the bathroom, our little friend the spider has beaten you to it! Well it's no good keeping the plug in the bath. Contary to popular myth, they don't come up
the plug hole. The spider is unable to swim through the water trapped in the pipe. If you find a spider in the bath, it fell in there, probably from the ceiling, or while 
skirting around the edge. Please do not drown it - go and get the glass, and put it outside.
<p>
<img src="../images/spid1.gif" alt="" align=right hspace=8 vspace=8>
I mentioned earlier that most spiders have very poor eyesight. I thought before we leave this month's nightmare, you might like to see one that has very good 
eyesight, namely - the jumping spider. This one has a neat trick. It creeps up on its prey until it can <i>see</i> it quite clearly, then leaps onto it in spectacular
fashion before making a meal of it.
<p>
<br>
That's it for this month. I'll go put the little spider back where I found it. Perhaps by the summer he may be big enough for me to rescue him from the bath and put out into
the garden. Mind you, he'll only be big enough if he manages to find a few other pests hanging around the house.
<p>
<h3>You can see two neat movies of spiders, one of the little fellow I caught today, and one really big wooden-looking one eating a fly in my garden. How? Simply take the fee-paying option
for registering your <a href="../../amateurs/mainmovi.html>Micscape Movie Player</A> and get them both as part of a whole disk full of microscopy movies sent with your registered, enhanced, movie player.</h3>

Stomata are microscopic pores found on the under-surface of leaves and on stems.  They occur in the epidermal tissue.  Each stomatal pore is bounded by two crescent shaped guard cells.  The guard cell wall closest to the pore is thicker than the remaining walls and therefore less flexible. <P> Each guard cell contains chloroplasts, unlike the adjacent epidermal cells. The glucose concentration of the the cells changes with the photosynthetic activity and therefore it is the guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stoma.


This is a low power view of a stoma.<P><BR><BR>

<img src ="../images/stom.jpg" alt=""hspace=12 align=right border=1>
When there is an increase in the osmotic potential, there is a decrease in the water concentration and therefore water moves into the guard cells by osmosis in response to the concentration gradient.  As a result the thin-cell wall bulges into the epidermal cell pulling the thick wall with it and therefore opening the pore.  The cells are then turgid.  Conversely when guard cells become less turgid the pore closes. 

<BR>




This is a high power view, clearly showing the chloroplasts in the guard cells.

<P>
The alteration in the size of the stomata occur in response to a variety of the external stimuli such as light, carbon dioxide concentration and water.<P>

The stomata are important for the exchange of gases by diffusion between the outside air and intercellular spaces for respiration and also for the evaporation of water by transpiration.

 Deep-field Amateur Microscopy</H1>
<h3>by Maurice Smith. April 1996</h3><P>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Image Enhancement</h3>
A lot of software abounds these days to help the amateur and professional
scoper get the best out of computer images 'sourced' from their microscopes.
There is a particular aspect though that - to my knowledge - has not been 
considered by software writers, which could prove a massive advantage to the 
amateur microscopist and educationalists. This aspect is concerned with <em>deep-field</em>
microscopy.
<P>
<h3>Deep-field?</h3>
Yup! When I first heard this term, I found it confusing too. <em>Deep-field...</em> sounds more
like a rural or farming expression rather than anything to do with 'scoping'. What does it mean? Well,
here's the important bit: it relates to the property of lenses. If you have done a lot with your camera
in ordinary photography, you will probably understand that all lenses have a 'built-in' distance at which
things seen through them  will be in focus. In the optical microscope, these distances are very fine indeed.
Often you will only to be able to focus on a specific detail of a specimen on a slide, it's top surface for example, 
and everything below this <em>depth</em> will be out of focus and will appear blurred. To examine most specimens, 
you need to view the object or subject at varying <em>depths</em> (different focus levels) to interpret true 
structure and form.
<p>
This limitation of any lens/focusing system is known as its 'depth of field'. It is possible to extend 
the working focus minimum and maximum distance of a lens, but you eventually reach a point where you need 
extremely bright illumination to maintain an image. Again, photographers will know that you can achieve
a crisper image over a better 'field of distance' by stopping the aperture of the camera down to a smaller
and smaller setting, where only a tiny hole is left to let the light - carrying the image information - through
and onto the film. You need nice bright lighting or very sunny days for this.
<p>

<h3>Photomicrography</h3>
With a stereo microscope, it is possible to obtain slightly better visual interpretation
of a specimen. One set of lenses can be focused on a specific plane in the subject while
the other lens can be set to view a slightly deeper level. Two such images taken this way are 
below: F1 is focused on the nearer surface of the diatom frustule and F2 on the furthest surface.
<center><img src="../images/deep2_f2.gif" border=1 > Diatom F1
<img src="../images/deep2_f1.gif" border=1 > Diatom F2</center>
<p>
The problem comes when you 
wish to record the specimen to camera, either by normal photographic methods ('still' shots)
or by using video recording. The second method can be used to record different focus levels 
of the subject: you simply keep altering the focus of the microscope when 'filming'.
This at least enables the viewer to get a clearer understanding of the structure and processes
of the specimen.
<p>
No such solution exists for 'still' photography. The only answer is to take several photos at 
varying levels of focus (slices) and then present the complete set of pictures to anyone who
may wish to see them. It would be great if the amateur had a way of recording a single image
where all crisp detail from both slices (images) were combined to form a focused composite image!

<h3>Intrigue</h3>
A year or so ago I became quite intrigued by this limitation of an optical scopes. 
As an amateur microscopist I was aware that these problems have been beaten for the 
professionals since they can use Scanning Electron Microscopes or Confocal Microscopes to
obtain images where all the structures in the specimen are clearly focused. But what about
us amateurs? We can not afford the extraordinary costs of this technology.
I thought a solution might be found by using software and the old home PC, and being a programmer -
decided to 'play' with the problem and see if I could build something which might help.

<h3>Fuzzy Logic</H3>
Where to begin? I'm not that good at maths (surprise, surprise) so I had to find a method which
allowed me to understand things a different way than by mathematical concepts. The simplest way would be to
sit at the microscope with a suitable subject on the stage, and then keep refocusing the scope and
try to observe what happens to the image itself as the focus control is altered. I could also 'sample'
some slices by rigging my video camera up to the PC and 'grabbing' some images.
After several long hours I decided that a set of fuzzy rules could be considered as workable. These 
could then be used as a basis for a set of software algorithms which could work at a pixel level
on the sampled images.

<h3>The Quest</h3>
The trick is get the computer to work out which pixel in any slice is 'most' focused relative to its
neighbours (pixels) in any given slice. These pixels (or at least, their colour values) could then be used 
to rebuild a final composite image where only the sharpest elements from the source images would be present.
Here are some of the thoughts and observations which became rules for selecting the correct pixels:-
<ul>
<li>A pixel of high contrast to its neighbours has 'sharpness' priority.
<p>
<li>A pixel remaining the same value or within a variable tolerance threshold
as its relative pixel in other slices will have sharpness priority.
<p>
<li>Pixels within a 3x3 block which have a high rate of change in their comparative
colours and contrast will be given a higher 'sharpness' priority than a relative 3x3 
block in any other slice. ('Busy' areas take precedence over common tone ones).
<p>
<li>A smoothing algorithm will be applied to the final image, the composite one, 
to minimise spurious errors. This should take out any isolated one-pixel dots: a pixel
that is in stark contrast to adjacent pixels which themselves, have the same or similar colour
colour value. The isolated dot will be replaced with a randomly selected neighbour.

</ul>
I built the software to work with 256 colour images to a maximum size of
640x480 pixels. I included several switches to allow selectable tolerance 
levels to be applied during the image analysis: <em>it became apparent in a couple
of quick experiments that this would be necessary to help the software work on
different subjects. For example, transparent or semi-opaque subjects present a different
set of problems from solid subjects. </em> 
<p>
<p>
<h3>Did it work?</h3>
It worked far better than I thought it would. To simplify the task, I set a limitation
that it will only work with 2 slices (images) for now. I'll show you an example in a moment 
but don't get too excited because the software is not for sale. It was just an experimental 
piece of work which, without more development, is not very user-friendly; the main difficulty
being what switch parameters (numbers) should be included in the command line to get 
the best result on a particular image. With all my other commitments right now, I doubt if I will
get much time this year to develop the program but you never know.
<p>
<h3>Another solution</h3>
By sheer luck, another possibility for solving the depth-of-field problems
has come to light. I purchased a very low priced bundle of software called <strong>
Double Vision</strong> (around 18.00 pounds). The software turns computer images into
3-D images, you know the sort you look at with those cardboard (red/blue) glasses.
Normally you would use the software to combine a left image and a right image from a stereo
pair and turn it into a composite 3-D anaglyph. In microscopy use, you can take a photo of
a specimen (or video still), move the specimen slide slightly to the left or right
a bit, and then take another shot. Once the two images are in the computer, the Double Vision
software will soon change it into a true 3D image which can be viewed on the monitor or after
printing out in colour, using the red/blue glasses supplied with the product.
<p>
I was fooling around with the software - taking images through the scope and then turning 
them into 3D, when I had a mini-brainwave: instead of moving the slide to take the second 
shot, why not just refocus the scope and capture a deeper slice of the specimen. The software
can then use the two separately 'focused' images to construct a deep-field image.
I tried it out and hey presto <em><strong>it works!</strong></em> More than this, you can 
move the slide, refocus, and then take the second shot to get a deep-field 'true' 3D image!
<p>
I'm not here to promote the software but if, like me, you are an amateur scoper and a computer
user, you should really rush out and buy this cheap bundle. I reckon its great! See our 
<a href="http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/amateurs/mic3d/3dfront.html">3-D section</A> to find out more.
<p>
And remember, if you go out and get the software, when you get a result, send one or
two of your 3D Microscopy or Nature Images into here and we will publish them on
our site for you. This way other amateurs and students can enjoy them too.
<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
I promised you an example, so here it is. The row of images below are of two
Diatom frustules (cases) which I shot under the old scope at about 400x mag. (ish).
Working from left to right: the first image is taken at one level of focus and the next
image along at a another level - <em>deeper into the slide.</em><strong> Note how details in one 
image are missing from the other!</strong> The third image is the result of <em>my</em> software
attempting to combine them into a true all-detail-focused image. The forth and final image to the
right (slightly shorter) is what <strong>Double Vision</strong> software made of them when combining
them into a type of 3-D image. <strong><em>You will need red/blue 3-D glasses to see this properly!</strong></em>
I have reduced the images by about 50% from their original size and converted them into 256 colour from
24 bit (64000 colours), resulting in  a loss of detail. Watch out in our 3D section and our Image library
for them, because I might load the larger versions of these images into these two sections.

this problem with a view to building some user-friendly software for the amateur

<B>Why the excitement about the discovery of a new animal species and phylum?</B><BR>
It is not that difficult to find a new species. Place an experienced botanist and zoologist in a poorly investigated area of the world such as virgin rainforest and leave them there for a while to study the fauna and flora. It is quite likely that a tiny beetle, fly or plant such as a moss may be found which is unidentifiable and is declared a new species. In fact it is believed that millions of species remain undiscovered. <A HREF="#other">What other marine life forms remain undiscovered?</A><P>

So why did the discovery of <I>S.pandora</I> excite not just the scientific community but attract media attention world-wide? For two main reasons.<P>

Firstly, the organism was not discovered in the depths of a rain forest or an oceanic trench, but on the bristles surrounding the mouth of the Norway lobster <I>Nephrops norvegicus</I> which can be caught in the Kattegat Straits, a busy shipping lane between Sweden and Denmark. You've probably eaten the Norway lobster - as scampi and chips!<P>

Secondly, when a new animal species is discovered, no matter how unusual, it can normally be classified into a known group of creatures with the same body plan or phylum. Although there are 1.5 million plus known species in the world, they can all be classified into 35 or so phyla. These include the chordates (eg the vertebrates such as man), molluscs (snails) and arthropods (jointed limbed eg insects).<P>

However, <I>S.pandora</I> was so unusual that it could not be classified into any of the existing phyla, and a new one was suggested called Cycliophora. <A HREF="#name">How was it's name derived?</A><P>

<A name="life">
<B>The structure and life cycle of <I>Symbion pandora</I></B><BR>
The organism has a very complex life cycle, with a number of well-defined sessile and free swimming stages with different morphologies. The largest and most illustrated phase is the feeding stage. The key features of this stage are as follows.<P>

- typically 350um long<BR>
- attached by an adhesive disc to the lips of the lobster<BR>
- feeds using a mouth surrounded by a ring of cilia<BR>
- excretes via an anus next to the mouth ring<BR>
- the feeding stage continually produces inner buds which replace the   feeding structures<BR>
- both asexual and sexual reproduction can occur<P>

<A HREF="pandadd.html">View a beautiful annotated diagram</A> of Pandora's feeding stage showing it's cellular structure.<BR><P>

Pandora's sex life is so peculiar that scientists at the Natural History Museum, UK were left puzzled! A museum scientist was quoted as saying <I>'it is unlike anything we have seen before'</I>. There was a debate whether Pandora had one penis or two, a fact eagerly announced by the popular press!<P>

Pandora's sexual and asexual reproductive cycle is explained and illustrated in <A HREF="#read">Reference 1</A>.  The essential features of the sexual cycles are as follows.<P>

As well as sessile (stationary) stages there are three free-swimming stages ie.<BR>
- a larva containing a new feeding stage<BR>
- dwarf males (size typically 84um) which settle on feeding stages<BR>
- females which attach to the lobster, and subsequently degenerate producing larva which disperse.<P>

All the free-swimming stages do not feed and are short-lived. <P>

Sexual reproduction is initiated when the lobster is near the end of its moult cycle. At this stage sexually mature feeding stages are found attached to the lobster's lips.<P>

The asexual aspect of the life cycle explains why large populations of feeding stages with no mature sexual stages have been found on lobsters.<P>

Cycliophora, in which <I>S.pandora</I> has been placed, is thought to have affinities to the phyla Entoprocta and Ectoprocta. The Ectoprocta are also known as the bryozoans or moss animals. Bryozoans are microscopic invertebrates that can form beautiful colonies which are often attached to rocks and plants in both fresh and seawater. The bryozoans reproduce asexually by a budding process similar to that of Pandora.<P>

<A NAME="name">
<B>Why was it called <I>Symbion pandora</I>?</B><BR>
The observation of a feeding stage which contains both an inner bud and a Pandora larva with a miniature feeding stage inside, gave rise to the pandora species name ie a reference to Pandora's box of Greek mythology.<P>

Symbion is derived from the Greek <I>syn</I> '(together) with' and <I>bios</I> 'living', which refers to the close association the organism has with it's host. The phylum name Cycliophora is a Greek derivative  referring to the circular mouth ring.<P>

<A NAME="other"></A>
<B>What other marine life remains undiscovered?</B><BR>
Reinhardt Kristensen, one of the co-discoverers of Pandora, has stated that the minutiae of marine life have been overlooked for too long. <I>'This is only the beginning. When we have finished, the zoological system will be turned upside down'.</I> He can speak with authority, the last phylum to be discovered, the Loricifera, was discovered in Brittany in 1983.... by Kristensen! The Loricifera are minute organisms which live between sand grains.<P>

<TITLE>Microscopy UK / MICSCAPE : Review of the McArthur Microscope  </TITLE>

<h3>MY FAVOURITE MICROSCOPE<br>
(A review of the McArthur Microscope)</h3>
<b>Text by Don Bruce, Images by William Ells</b><br>

</center>
<hr>
<p>

I suppose everyone interested in microscopy has a favourite microscope, 
I have always been attracted to miniaturisation and when it is combined 
<img src="../images/mac3.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=4 align=left>
with superb engineering mine has to be the McArthur microscope. (see 
photograph/s)  This gem of a portable microscope is solid in construction 
all components being mounted in a aluminium block with a very firm mounting 
for the slide. The instrument measures only 4" x 2.5" x 2" (102 x 63 x 51 
mm.) yet it is capable of all that can be accomplished with a bench 
microscope of similar optical specification, it will even accept a 
binocular head.
<p>
To keep within the limits of the small body Dr.John McArthur designed a 
<img src="../images/mac2.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=4 align=right>
folded optical prismatic system mounted in a detachable tube which 
approximated the 160mm. tube length of the standard microscope. This tube 
forms the base of the microscope. Light enters the instrument from above, 
either by means of the stainless steel mirror or from a built in electric 
lamp and passes downwards through the iris and condenser to the specimen. 
The objectives are below the specimen and the light forming image is 
reflected by the prismatic system to the eyepiece, the image is the right 
way up, not inverted as in a conventional microscope.
<p>
The microscope slide on which the specimen is mounted is placed 
coverglass down on the stage the upper surface of the cover glass being 
level with the upper surface of the stage. Thus the specimen is always in 
focus irrespective of the thickness of the slide. A fine focus control is 
provided to allow for specimen thickness, coarse focussing is unnecessary. 
<p>
The three objectives are optically standard but mechanically shortened 
and mounted on a sliding plate, they are interchangeable, with a 
comprehensive range of objectives, including 4:1 and a 100:1 oil immersion,  
a phase contrast set for example could be mounted on a spare sliding plate, 
although I have only one plate fitted with 10:1, 20:1, & 40:1. dry 
objectives. Because the objectives are always in focus the Abbe condenser 
is also in permanent focus and likewise interchangeable. The eyepiece is a 
RMS size push fit and also interchangeable, mine is a 10:1.
<p>
The latest models are fitted with a tapping in the base which will 
accept a camera tripod. A short tripod greatly facilitates bench use of the 
microscope. Mine was an earlier model so I have manufactured a cradle to 
take the microscope and this can be fitted to a tripod.  The weight of the 
microscope without its case is only 18 ounces (510 gms.). The one inconve-
nience I have found is the standard 3" x 1" (76 x 25 mm.) microscope slide 
projects over the edges of the stage and can be easily caught by the 
fingers when the instrument is hand held and the objective plate is being 
manipulated.
<p>
The McArthur microscope has been manufactured by several companies since 
its inception.  Today it is marketed by Prior Scientific Instruments, 
London Road, Bishops Stortford, Herts, CM23 5NB. Tel: 0127 506414. I do not 
know the current price, their 1980 price list quotes L407 plus VAT for the 
standard outfit for Bright field work, with mirror, Abbe condenser, 
Huygenian 10:1 eyepiece, 10:1, 40:1 & 100:1 o.i. objectives, lamp, simple 
light tube and vinyl case. At one stage Dr.McArthur manufactured the 
instrument himself and it is one from his production line which I own. I 
bought it second hand in mint condition in 1968 from Dr.Raymond Greene, 
brother of author Graham Greene, for L30.  If you like the McArthur 
microscope but do not like its price it is sometimes available on the 
second hand market at around 250.00 pounds. 
<p>
There is a very cheap alternative, and that is the McArthur microscope 
designed for the Open University,  It employs the same system as the 
original microscope but is larger in length 
& height 5" x 3" (127 x 76 mm.) but at 1" (25 mm.) only half the thickness. 
It is made almost entirely of plastic with a total weight of 7.5 ounces 
(198.5 grams). The standard Open University microscope has a fixed 10:1 
eyepiece with a sliding objective plate with fixed 8:1 & 20:1 objectives. 
It has an internal light source or it can be used with an external lamp or 
daylight. There is a tripod adapter in the base. The specimen slide is held 
longitudinally and is therefore more easily controlled and is not likely to 
be moved by the fingers when handling the instrument.
<p>

<img src="../images/mac1.gif" alt="" hspace=12 vspace=4 align=left>
<h3>The Swift Microscope</h3>
I have added a photograph of the Swift Field Microscope which I also 
own, it is similar in concept to the MacArthur but not so compact, for 
example the mirror and condensor is not built in. Note the objectives are 
on revolving holder not in line on a slider as on the MacArthur.

<center><h1>Onion Root</h1></center>
<img src="root1.gif" align=left >

This first image is a low power longitudinal section through an onion 
<em>Allium cepa</em> root tip. We are showing it upside down: the thimble
shaped region at the top would normally be the deepest point into the earth
in its natural environment. The cap detects gravity and controls the direction of root
growth.
<p>
<br>
<br>

<img src="root2.gif" align=left >
You can see the root cap in better detail here. Notice the dense region 
of cells behind it called the <em>apical meristem.</em> This is the site of 
major cell division where the cells <em>differentiate</em> (change) into
specialised cells to form the central cylinder; the cylinder contains xylem and phloem.
<p>
Around the central cylinder is the cortex. The zone behind the apical meristem is known
as the <em>zone of elongation.</em> It is a region which has xylem cells making up
annular rings, or spiral secondary cell walls, so they can elongate as well as transport water.
<p>
<br>
<img src="root3.gif" align=left >
This last high power image of the <em>apical meristem</em> shows the cells very clearly. They are
very active as can be seen by the large size of their nuclei relative to the size of the cells.
Two of the cells in the central region can be seen dividing by <em>mitosis</em>; the chromosomes
are very visible since the two cells are in their early <em>telophase</em> of the cell cycle.

<TITLE>Microscopy UK / MICSCAPE - Microscopy Article: Pond Dipping  </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<CENTER>
<H2>Pond Dipping<br>
 by Roy Winsby </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

 

<strong>A favourite subject</strong><br>
One of the most interesting subjects for study is pond life, and here the
word pond is meant to include all types of freshwater habitat whether lake,
reservoir, pool, ditch or puddle.  Dipping an empty jar in the pond will
give you plenty of water to study but the results can be disappointing
because the catch is not concentrated enough bearing in mind that you only
use a drop on a slide.
<p>
<strong>Using a special net</strong><br>
So how to concentrate a catch.  This needs a pond net, about 6" diameter
tapering to a little over an inch, with removable plastic jar or tube
attached at the narrow end in which  the catch is caught, but pond and
plankton nets obtainable from biological supply houses are expensive, from
20 up to over 50. In the previous article, Douglas Laycock explains how to
construct a simple handle and frame to hold a pond net.
<p>
There are many fascinating specimens to find in pond etc. water but a fine
net is required, around 50 to 70 microns square mesh.  Nets supplied by many
biological supply houses have a mesh of around 100 microns (0.1 mm), with a
filter net over the jar.  A 100 microns mesh net will be fine for collecting
daphnia but you will lose a lot of your catch of smaller creatures through
the side of the net.  The filter net over the small tube needs to have a
mesh larger than the creatures you are trying to catch, but sufficiently
fine to keep out those you do not want.  Nets used for winemaking, which
have a mesh of around 400 micron, are of no use whatsoever for pond nets,
the mesh being far too wide.
<p>
Very fine net can be purchased but it is expensive.  If you know anyone at
a silk screen printers any of their offcuts or even used cast away pieces of
silk would be ideal, these having an extremely fine mesh of around 60 to 70
microns. With a pond net you can walk along a canal bank dragging the net in
the water, or you can stay in one spot and sweep the net back and forth
provided you change the depth of the sweep.  You must always keep the net
moving forwards, and if you are sweeping at one spot, then in a figure of
eight. Once put in the water you must keep the net moving, otherwise your
catch in the net may well escape.
<p>
<strong>Technique</strong><br>
The jar will of course fill as soon as you put the net in the water and now
matter how dense the water is with creatures you hope to catch or for how
long you sweep with the net the same water with its catch will remain in the
attached jar and you will get few extra specimens in it.  So what is the
purpose of all this sweeping?  The net will build up a good quantity of
specimens which are not in the jar because it filled with the first
immersion in the water, but they cannot escape because of the force of the
water through the net so long as you keep it moving.
<p>
What is wanted of course is to get a concentration of the catch in the jar
and this is accom-plished by lifting the net out of the water.  As the water
drains through the net the creatures in it can only drop as the water level
recedes until those which are not too large to do so, i.e,, those you want,
drop through the lower filter net and you will have a rich concentration in
the jar.  It is important, therefore, as recommended by Mr. E. D. Hollowday
in his excellent article "Some Hints and Tips on the Collecting and Handling
of Monogonontid Rotifera" in the Quekett Journal "Microscopy" 35,
January-June 1985, pages 208-220, to maintain the full extension of the net
cone until the very moment it is lifted out of the water.  This is because
the pressure of the water passing through the net forces the creatures
against the side of the net. Again to quote Mr. Hollowday, protozoa and
small algae etc. only enter the tube with the loss of the last 50 to 100 ml
of water.
<p>
When the water has fully drained from the net remove the jar and rinse the
inside of the net in the water to let the concentration of unwanted
creatures clinging to the inside of the net swim to freedom.  It is the rule
that we do not take more than we need and that we do not destroy life, no
matter how small, any more than is necessary.
<p>

<center><H3>Warming on river, canal, reservoir danger zones</h3></center>

Two warnings were given by River and Health Authorities during the summer
of 1994.  The first is of the rat bug danger, causing Weils Disease, which
is spread by harmful bacteria in rat urine, found not only in sewers but
also in many still waters.  It can enter the body through open cuts and
abrasions and, a warning to young people who take a dip in rivers and mill
ponds during hot weather, through the eyes, ears, nose and mouth.  Symptoms
are said to be like a dose of mild 'flu which usually clears up after two or
three weeks, but the disease is dangerous and in extreme cases can cause
kidney or liver failure leading to death.  So when fishing or pond dipping
cover any cuts or abrasions on the hands with a waterproof plaster and wash
your hands before handling food.  Do not forget, of course, that these same
precautions also apply when handling the pond water back home.
<p>
The second warning is against touching or brushing against the dangerous
giant hogweed plant often found growing up to nine feet tall on river and
canal banks.  It is a beautiful plant brought over from Russia to London's
Kew Gardens a hundred years ago but which has since spread around the
country.  Touching it with bare hands or even through thin clothing such as
a shirt or blouse can cause severe dermatitis, skin inflammation which
usually develops within 24 hours, and sometimes painful blisters.  The
condition is made worse if the affected part is exposed to sunlight.  In
severe causes a condition like a chemical burn may arise which will leave
permanent brown patches after healing.  The National Rivers Authority is
carrying out a five year spraying programme in an endeavour to eradicate the
dangerous plant.  Eating any of the plant can result in severe damage to the
lips and mouth.

<center>
<H3>A Review of the Baker Series IV BQ  Microscope </H3>
<h4>by <br>
Mike Samworth Nov. 95</h4>
</center>
<p>
As a Biology teacher I have used microscopes for many years, possibly nearly
every week. However, as many members will no doubt be only too aware of,
teaching of the basics of microscopy and how to use the instrument properly
is a rare thing in any basic or advanced Biology course. Certainly I never
had any training myself, at Advanced, Degree or Postgraduate level. I
suppose therefore, that all I was taught was how to use the instrument when
I was about 12! Some six years ago this changed. In an attempt to service
the microscopes we had at school I started reading up on the subject,
learning a great deal as I went. The "bug" soon bit and now microscopy is my
main hobby.
<p> 
After borrowing instruments from work I decided this was to stop; my right
arm was getting longer. I had joined the PMS and saw instruments for sale
second-hand but was confused by all the names and detailed descriptions.
Older members please forgive me but you have an advantage of years, I am too
young to remember the enamelled instruments of the past. I sent for the
Comrie and Mitchell catalogue and arranged to visit the home of Authur
Mitchell in Nottingham. Arthur was most helpful and showed me old and new
microscopes. Finally I bought a Biolam R21. This has given good service and
has proved to be an excellent buy. Later on, I decided I would like an older
British microscope and started to look around. I was tempted to buy a
binocular head for the Biolam but was alarmed at the cost of this in
relation to the microscope. A mechanical stage was also on my wants list. At
this springs' Midland Quekett Meeting all these things came together as
someone had a Baker IV BQ for sale. I looked it over. It had a binocular
head and a mechanical stage, both features I was after, but best of all it
was a lovely grey enamelled British microscope. Bound to be too pricey I
thought to myself, but nevertheless I sought the vendor. He kindly
demonstrated it and talked me around the features. He explained the sale, a
recent Leitz acquisition, and also where he got it from. The price was very
reasonable and my offer accepted, along with my cheque. I now owned a Baker
IV BQ.
<p> 
The microscope is in the original Baker case, though the handle has been
replaced. Considering the weight of the instrument I am not surprised. The
case contained a vertical tube suitable for photography, which is adjustable
for tube-length. There are padded holes for additional condensers (not
present) and clips to hold eyepieces and objectives. On the subject of
optics, the objectives comprise Baker x10 and x40, interestingly also marked
with the older style 2/3" and 1/6" in addition. The eyepieces were a little
disappointing, being rather old and dirty beck high power. However. the
previous owner sent me another pair of un-named lower power ones. I have
since acquired a pair of x8 baker eyepieces from elsewhere, which are much
better. The nosepiece is a triple type and I have placed a Russian x20 in
the vacant position.
<p> 
The microscope was also equipped with a small lamp and transformer unit with
brightness control. This is a Baker lamp, called the Lamplux, which has a
collector lens, diffuser and field iris. There is also a recess for colour
filters in the top of the housing. This has been modified, a conclusion I
have only been able to come to by looking in Baker catalogues of the late
fifties. I should thank three people here in providing these. Firstly, Roy
Winsby who I initially asked about the Baker IV, and Don Bruce who provided
a catalogue for Roy to copy for me. Also, Barry Ellam for taking the trouble
to copy his catalogue and price list. Back to the lamp, the original came
with a 6 volt, 18 watt bulb, which seems to have been replaced with a small
halogen bulb. Also, the rheostat unit is home-made. The lamp fits in place
of the mirror (which I don't have anyway) on a small bracket. It provides
even illumination and with the halogen bulb in place is quite powerful.
 In fact, I now use my excellent Prior (I think) lamp for Kohler
illumination, the lamp is actually under my work bench which has a square
hole cut in it. Don't worry, nobody was in when i cut the hole in the
bench!in when I cut the hole in the bench!
<p> 
The Baker is described in the old catalogue as a modern research microscope
with coarse and fine adjustments below stage level. The control knobs are
conveniently placed in close proximity to each other, and the controls are
all silky smooth. especially the mechanical stage which is a joy to use.
Like many things in life, once tried you wonder how you ever did without it.
the limb and foot are massive, or in the words of the catalogue "especially
robust". Quite. The focus adjustments both act on the stage bracket, the
body tube being clamped into dovetails on the limb. the body can also be
moved upwards and fixed in a position allowing greater clearance between the
nosepiece and the stage. The body itself is wider than most.
<p> 
I spent much time studying the catalogues to learn of the Baker coding
system, ie. what the BQ meant. The first letter of the code refers to the
stage, not the binocular head as I first thought. There were two types of
mechanical stage, stage 'A' which was a rotating stage, and stage 'B', a
4.2" square stage. There were also nonmechanical stages, 'C' and 'E',
rotating and square respectively. The second letter refers to the type of
substage. Mine is the 'Q', which is a swing out type with centring screws.
Later models had the 'W', which was the modified Akehurst type. In this each
condenser was mounted on its own separate plate, allowing it to slide into
position easily.
<p>
The catalogue shows quite an array of accessories for the Series IV. This
includes dark-field condensers, phase contrast kit, lamps, and numerous
objectives and eyepieces. Worthy of mention is the Projectolux illuminating
base which provides Kohler illumination. It was designed to allow
micro-projection, drawing attachments and a specially designed camera. There
was also a special condenser, the Trilux, which provides light-field,
dark-field and phase-contrast. Unfortunately for me, even if I did come
across this item it is of the type 'W' substage only.
<p>
I also have a price list, dated 1956, and this makes interesting reading. I
reckon that my instrument would have cost about 175. I shudder to think
what that is equivalent to today! I only know that it brings me much
pleasure and is a joy to use. I recently visited someone with a similar
model but with many more additional items so there is always the hope of
adding such items to mine. Certainly if any readers out there have any Baker
series IV items surplus to requirements then I should be most grateful to
hear from them. Equally, if you would like to write something about your 'scope'
to be included under <b>Microscope Reviews <A HREF="mailto: Mike Samworth &ltsambo@mail.zynet.co.uk&gt">then why not drop me a note?</A></b>

<h2>Why use video?</h2>

<h4>by Mike Samworth</h4>
</CENTER>
<p>
<EM><STRONG>I am interested in Protozoa. There are none more beautiful or more 
generally attractive to observers than the Stentors, well known to many 
microscopists so far as their more obvious characters are concerned, but 
which present considerable difficulty when it is desired to make out 
their details of structure.</STRONG></EM><P>

It is only by the frequent examination of a great number of individuals, 
and making the most of fortunate
opportunities, that the various organelles can be distinctly seen. Often 
there is disappointment felt as many
efforts have to be made before success is achieved.<p>

<IMG SRC="../images/julsnip1.gif" align=left width=146 height=118 hspace=8 border=1>
Drawings in texts exhibiting anatomical details are almost invariably 
the result of combining in one view
parts that cannot be simultaneously seen in the living organism. One 
<EM>Stentor</EM> shown left, for example, may at one time
show the mouth or gullet well, while the nucleus is scarcely visible, 
and some other details cannot be seen at
all. Another time the nucleus may be prominent throughout more or less 
of its length, and a complete
delineation can only be made by putting together the information 
contained in a long series of observations.
As microscopists if we are not fully aware of this fact we are not only 
puzzled, but are discouraged by the
wide difference between what we see and what we find drawn by others. <P>
Previously, the only remedy
against this disappointment was patience, and a knowledge of how to use 
the published figures. I believe
there is another solution open to the microscopist of the nineties, 
namely video. Recording the organisms on
tape allows future study and the option of slow-motion or even still-
frame images. This makes it far easier
to piece together detailed structure of the organism in question. 
Indeed, moving images often appear to
show greater detail to the human eye.<p>

I have borrowed a video camera for mounting on my microscope a couple of 
times now and am considering
purchasing one for myself eventually. Though not able to get to see any 
of the very few texts published on
the subject, it is interesting that much of that I have seen is written 
by amateurs. Certainly it is a rapidly
developing area of microscopy. If anyone has any particular advice or 
tips from their experience with the
medium, then do not hesitate to forward this to the Editor <A HREF="mail
to:dave@diwalk.demon.co.uk"<p> <STRONG>Dave Walker</STRONG></A>

<CENTER><h3>OLD  CATALOGUES AND MANUALS <BR>by  Roy Winsby</h3>
<h4>From Manchester Microscopical Society's Newsletter No. 34</h4></CENTER>

<p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4>
Many of us engaged in amateur microscopy are in the older age group 
and during our many years in amateur microscopy we collect items of 
microscopical importance. We accumulate microscope manuals, leaflets, 
catalogues, and  the such like.

<p>

 Many of us have an old microscope manual or catalogue. Equally, if in 
fact many more,
people are in need of such a manual or publication regarding their 
microscope. Unfortunately the makers of
the particular instrument are likely to have long out of business and 
the manuals etc are no longer available.<p>

 So, if you sell a microscope and have the relevant manual, include it 
in the sale.  Even if you
are not selling, and you have the manual, give a thought to keeping it 
in the box with the microscope
because our heirs and executors just have no idea of how valuable these 
manuals are. Microscopes,
microtomes and other equipment they know can be sold, but who wants old 
manuals, catalogues etc.? and
only too often this important documentation is consigned to the rubbish 
sack. You will all know what I mean
when I say that those of you who have bought a second-hand microscope 
will indeed be fortunate if the
manual was handed over with it.<p>

 Catalogues can often give useful information when one is unable to 
trace other information
about an instrument, and they are worth preserving too. An old catalogue 
can provide much information,
including telling us what variations of the instrument and other 
accessories were made, as well as giving us
an idea as to what it cost when it was new. It is surprising how many 
people like to know what their old
microscope cost when new and how much that cost would be in today's 
money values.<p>

 I am often asked if I can supply a manual for a particular microscope, 
and sometimes I can;
if not I take a note to supply a copy if and when I can obtain it. So 
firstly, when you sell a microscope
ensure that the manual gets passed on.  Secondly, if you have any 
surplus manuals and catalogues you no
longer require, pass them on while you have the opportunity to where 
they will do some good, such as to
any Microscopical Society for their library.<p>

<TITLE>Microscopy UK / MICSCAPE - Microscopy Article : Cyclops  </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<CENTER>
<H1>CYCLOPS</H1>
by Mike Morgan 1996
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<strong>Overview</strong><br>
Cyclops is a fresh water Arthropod and a member of the Crustacea group, belonging to the sub-group Cyclopoida and the sub-class Copepoda.  There are forty-six free-living species, of which forty-four belong to the  genus Cyclops. 
<p>
The fused head and thorax is clearly marked off from the abdomen. Typically the head has five pairs of limbs and the mid-body region seven pairs.  Their length is -3 mm. There is a single median eye near the upper surface of the head.
<p>
<strong>Origin of name</strong><br>
Cyclops: from Greek mythology 1. Any of the three one-eyed Titans who forged thunderbolts for Zeus. 2. Any of a race of one-eyed giants, reputedly descended from these Titans, inhabiting the island of Sicily.
<p>
<strong>Lifestyle</strong><br>
Cyclops can swim slowly by means of two pairs of antennae or faster with jerks by using other limbs on the thorax.  It seizes food particles with the limbs round the mouth and can apparently live on the dead bodies of other animals, but very little is known about its method of feeding.  Widely distributed and found in any type of still water all over Britain.  They may also be very common in slow rivers and canals, particularly among weeds.  If you collect a large number of Cyclops and keep them in a small jar of water in which they were found, and then you examine samples of the water carefully, you will very likely find all stages in the life-history.
<p>
<strong>Young cyclops</strong><br>
When the eggs hatch the animals emerging do not resemble the parents very closely, being smaller, broader in proportion, have only a few pairs of limbs and possess no 'tail-end' to their body. 
<p>
<img src="../images/cyc1.gif" align=right>
Infants are the Nauplius larvae. The nauplii go through a series of moults, up to six in number.  At each stage the skin is shed, the animals increase in size and they show more of the adult characters.  After these moults they reach the first 'copepodid' stage and after about five further moults they become exactly like their parents.  The time taken for a Nauplius to develop into an adult varies with the temperature of the water; in some it is from twenty-two to twenty-six days.
<p>
<strong>The male</strong><br>
<img src="../images/cyc2.gif" align=left>
Male copepods are, as a rule, smaller than the females.  Their first pair of antennae, or at least one of the antennae, is curiously jointed so that they can catch hold of the female by curling one antenna round the end of her abdomen. 
<br>
<p>
<strong>The female</strong><img src="../images/cyc3.gif" align=left><br>
The female carries two egg-sacs and is easily recognised with the naked eye if egg- sacs are present. The sacs resemble 'paddles' as can be seen here in this typical image of a female.

<H2>A Christmas Mystery Microscopy Tour</H2>
<H3>A seasonal look back at some Micscape articles<BR> and two microscopical discoveries that hit the headlines<P>
compiled by Dave Walker<BR>
with thanks to all the Micscape contributors
</H3></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4>Why not join me for a brief end of the year tour of the Micscape site, where we try to show you the fascinating fun things you and your kids can do to examine the world in close up over the Christmas break.<STRONG> Click on the image</STRONG> if you wish to read about any topic.<P>
<A HREF="snow.html"><IMG SRC="../images/snw1.gif" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left width=136  height=136  ></A>
Is it snowing outside? If so, have you ever wondered how you can look at snow crystals under the microscope? Andrew's article describes how you can look at these elusive subjects. Every crystal is different and they can assume many wonderful variants on the six-sided symmetry. If you don't fancy using your microscope outside, why not try the 10X hand lens instead using the guidelines in the article.<P><br clear>

<A HREF="http://www.diwalk.demon.co.uk/home/novhome.htm"> <IMG SRC="../images/mictour2.jpg" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right width=127  height=138  ></A>
Many people will be watching the TV during the Christmas holidays, although hopefully not as close as the image on the right. Why not have a closer look at your TV screen with a hand lens and compare it with the computer monitor screen. The article shows how you can study a variety of objects around your home in close-up.<P><br clear>

<CENTER><STRONG> Click on the image</STRONG> if you wish to read about any topic.<P></CENTER><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.molcol.demon.co.uk/marly/marlyadv.htm#ADVENTURE3"> <IMG SRC="../images/mictour1.jpg" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left width=123  height=123  ></A>
If you get fed up with the programmes offered on the TV you may instead watch a videotape. But look after those videotapes and video cassette recorder (VCR), because they are pretty unforgiving if you treat them badly. Don't believe me, then read Marly's Micronaut adventure, who as an electronics technician shows how sand or dirt can be a VCR's worst enemy. The use of a microscope proved a valuable way of identifying problems. The image left shows one of the record / playback heads on the video drum inside the VCR.<P> <br clear>

<A HREF="nitemare.html"> <IMG SRC="../images/nitemar3.gif" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right width=108  height=107  ></A>
If you eat too many of the 'nice but naughty' foods over Christmas you may need a trip to the man / woman  you may dread to visit .... the dentist. The image right shows a dental X-ray of teeth. Read Maurice's Nightmare Article on how he got on with his dentist and learn a bit more about the teeth and their care.<P> <br clear>

<A HREF="kombucha.html"> <IMG SRC="../images/kombucha.jpg" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left width=271  height=202  ></A>
After all the Christmas food and drink we may need to take a course of healthy Kombucha tea to invigorate the system. Perhaps you haven't heard of the health drink that's caught the attention of people worldwide throughout the centuries. So why not read Andrew and Polly's article about Kombucha and learn how easy it is to make and what it looks like under the microscope. An SEM of the bacteria and yeast colony which is used to prepare the drink is shown on the left.<P> <br clear><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.diwalk.demon.co.uk/walk/janwalk.htm"> <IMG SRC="../images/mictour3.gif" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right width=230  height=159  ></A>
An invigorating walk in the country can be very pleasant in Winter especially as there's a surprising amount of things to study in close up with a hand lens or low power stereo microscope at this time of year. Have a browse through the winter month topics in the Virtual Nature Walk Index to see what to lookout for. The image right shows a rotifer, a microscopic organism that can be found in a bird-bath or roof gutter.<P> <br clear>

<A HREF="eightx.html"> <IMG SRC="../images/8x1b.jpg" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left width=175  height=171  ></A>
We encourage people to use a 8-10X hand lens as much as a microscope on Micscape, because even this low magnification can reveal wonderful detail ... and they are so easy to carry with you and for the kids to use at well. Read two articles on what you can do with a hand lens, and how you can even take photographs through them.<P> <br clear><BR>

<A HREF="pandora.html"> <IMG SRC="../images/panartf1.gif" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right width=160  height=215  ></A>
Do you recognise the pair of microscopic creatures on the right? They're about one third of a millimetre long and live on the lips of the Norwegian Lobster which is used to make scampi. This time last year as a result of an article published in the Journal 'Nature', this organism called <EM>Symbion pandora</EM> attracted the attention of the media all over the world. With the generous help of the authors of this paper and the Journal 'Nature', Micscape were able to publish one of the few illustrated articles on the Web describing why this organism was so important.<P> <br clear><BR>

<A HREF="../../amateurs/amlink/marsites.html"> <IMG SRC="../images/mars1.jpg" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=left width=200  height=159  ></A>
One of the most controversial but exciting announcements of the year if not the decade was the reporting of the fossil evidence for microscopic life formerly existing on Mars, which was found in the meteorite shown. Visit the supplement to the Hotsites page which gives some links to see the images with a link to the original article that sparked the controversy.<P> <br clear><BR>

<A HREF="micfiche.html"> <IMG SRC="../images/micwrt3b.jpg" HSPACE=8 ALIGN=right width=275  height=270  ></A>
If like many people this Christmas you enjoy re-reading the story of Jesus' birth in the Bible, you may be interested in the attempts over the years to condense the text of the Bible into the smallest possible area, so small in fact that a microscope is required to read it. The image shows a microfiche of the entire Bible with a match head to indicate scale. The article also shows a microphotograph of the Lord's Prayer that could fit on a full stop.<br clear><BR>

So, that's just a brief look at the many articles you may find of interest in our Articles Library and on the Microscopy UK satellite sites. The library is divided into topics so you can choose a topic of interest. <A HREF="../libindex.html"><STRONG> Visit the Library now</STRONG></A>.<P>

<h2><I>Welcome to the <b>dark side</b> of Micscape and microscopy. Hold on tight to
the arms of your seat, get the smelling salts (or better still - a glass of brandy) ready,
for we are about to experience...  A Nightmare on Mic Street</I></h2>
<h4><i>Part 1: The root of the problem.</i><br>

<h3>What fills us with fear?</h3>
For some it is the thought of going to the dentist, for others it is spiders, injections,
or the fear of madness or going blind. The microscope in its various disguises can help us
examine these nightmares close-up. In this mini series, I will take you month by month, through
some of our common nightmares. <i>Did you think Microscopy was about quiet, studious, safe things?</i>
I hope not. 'Scoping' can take us nearer to beauty or closer to the savage truth of reality. For our 
first example, let us consider that good old torturer we've come to know and <i>love</i> - the dentist... 
<p>
<b>The Phantom</b><br>
Day by day we hack, chop, and grind away at our food. When we are young it is more a case of sweet things which invisibly 
contribute to the damage of
<img src="../images/nitemar2.gif" alt="" hspace=12 align=right>
our teeth. Gradual decay inevitably leads us to the dentist to get things patched up.
As we grow older our teeth become more brittle. We may peek in the bathroom mirror and pride ourselves on having clean straight teeth,
but things look quite different when seen at 50x to 100x magnification, as <b>(Fig.1)</b>
shows. You can see the hair-line crack in the enamel of the tooth above the reference point <b>(A)</b> and the chipped edge
to the right - <b>B</b>. In fact, this image was taken of my front teeth just after I had finished having a complete
overhaul of my teeth and gums.
<p>
Most of us can face an occasional bit of 'drilling' and 'filling' but there is a single phrase 
which is guaranteed to strike terror into the hearts of the bravest... <i>a root filling</i>.
<p>
<b>The final solution</b><br>
There comes a time when there is little left to fill. The advance of decay attacks the living heart of the tooth and it is doomed.
Or is it? After all - it's only the nerve screaming at us that the rot has gone too far. Why not just take it out? The nightmare begins!
We stare at the ceiling waiting... searching for that invading drill to hit the soft spot and <i> touch the nerve </i>.
<p>
<b>Fortunately, modern methods practised by a good dentist, should result in little discomfort and no real pain at all.</b> I have often wondered
what was actually involved in this 'seemingly' final solution. Last time I went down the dentist, I took the time to find out. I bet you 
would love to know too. No..? Too late. I am about to show you!
<p>
<b>A Microscope in disguise</b><br>
Perhaps it's cheating a bit to call the dentist's x-ray camera a disguised microscope but through combining digital sampling techniques
with computers, it is possible to do much more with the tiny x-ray pictures. The next time your dentist sticks a mini x-ray plate in your
mouth and asks you to hold still while he puts on his lead-lined apron, you may well remember the following images. 

<img src="../images/nitemar3.gif" alt="" hspace=12 align=left>

To understand what a root-filling is, we first need to study the nerve cavity (pulp) and root of a comparatively healthy tooth. In <b>(Fig.2)</b>
you can see an x-ray image of several teeth. Most of them have been capped with man-made material. Observe the pulp indicated by <b>(A)</b> deep inside
the healthy tooth. The dark patch along with the fine dark lines running up into the root and jaw represents the lifeline to the tooth. Here, the blood
vessels and nerve endings serve the whole tooth. It is when decay penetrates this region beneath the outer enamel and dentine, that real pain begins.
To perform a root filling, the dentist must evacuate this area of decayed tooth <i>and</i> the living nerves and vessels, then fill the cavity with alloy, resin,
or pure metal such as gold.
<p>
<b>Getting to the point</b><br>
<img src="../images/nitemar4.gif" alt="" hspace=12 align=right>
The dentist's drill should have little difficulty removing the decay and entering the soft cavity (pulp) but how are the fine canals
containing the vessels and nerves to be emptied of their contents without leaving debris behind that could lead to problems?
Easy - <b>rake them out</b> - or said more accurately: put fine metal wire rasps down the nerve canals and <i>scrape</i> them out.
You can see in <b>(Fig.3)</b> two such tiny tools inserted through the exposed pulp and up into the two nerve canals. Although this image
has been reduced in size you can just see the zig-zagged edge of the tool indicated by <b>(A)</b>.
<p>
What's that you say? A bit too small to see properly. Okay, here's another one then <b>(Fig.4).</b> The tooth here is a different one. It has only
<img src="../images/nitemar5.gif" alt="" hspace=12 align=left>
a single root and nerve/blood vessel canal. The slender rasp, pushed deep into the tooth, is indicated by <b>(B)</b>. Above this you can see 
another tooth which has been filled; evident by the bright white chunk of alloy embedded in its crown <b>(A)</b>. Below the filling, a dark
line runs centrally down to the root of the tooth. This is a normal nerve/blood vessel canal still alive and serving the tooth. As a final point to
mention: once the pulp, nerve (and the blood vessels) are destroyed or removed, the tooth itself effectively dies but remains usable. In some cases
it may turn black; this discolouration is due to any remaining pulp tissue (blood cells etc.) left in the tooth system. If this is totally removed then
discolouration should not ensue - (enamel itself having no life of its own).

<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
An overview of an ancient  'homebrew' activity which has been carried out in peasant households throughout the Eastern World for many centuries. As a kind of health insurance/cure-all medicine, its consumption has been spreading across the planet,  hitting America where it was immediately embraced, hyped and revered by millions, and it now seems to be gaining popularity in Britain. As written by a <strong>VERY newly</strong> enlightened enthusiast with only limited experience of brewing the beverage and  the information she has gleaned from the internet and a publication called <strong>'KOMBUCHA - The Miracle Fungus' by Harald W. Tietze.</strong> The views expressed at the end of the article are personal, and any inaccuracies in the 'science' must be forgiven! </em>
<p>
<strong>The Legend</strong><br>
Tea drinking originated in China and Japan more than 2000 years ago. The legend of Bodhidharma tells of how during seven years of meditation he dozed off. When he awoke he was so ashamed of himself that he cut off his eyelids and tossed them to the ground. Where they fell two beautiful shrubs sprouted - the first tea plants. This begs the question: if two shrubs sprouted where the eyelids fell, what bodily part would you need to toss to the ground to give rise to something as slimy and (frankly) unattractive as a KOMBUCHA culture!?
<p>

<center><H3>Well, what is it and what does it actually look like?</h3></center>

 <strong>"Let's see if I can show you. It's in here... somewhere!"</strong>
<p><img src="../images/kompota.jpg" border=1 width=200 height=162 align=left hspace=8>
It is a colony of bacteria and yeast living together symbiotically in a matrix of mycelium-like threads. The overall appearance is that of a mushroom (hence its misnomer popularly adopted by most people) covering the entire surface of its life-giving medium and taking on the boundary shape of the container it is living in. Its mature thickness is 8 - 10mm or so, and  the colour varies, according to what type of tea it is brewed on, from pure white when grown on green tea to a caramel brown when grown on black tea. 
<p>
The important components are apparently the tropical yeasts <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomycodes ludwigii</em> and <em>Pichia fermentans</em>, but the most important of all is the slimy vinegar bacteria <em>Acetobacter xylinium</em>, which creates a slippery mass out of cellulose in the symbiotic process, holding the whole colony together in a mat. The three images below show (at 400x), from left to right,
<strong>the bacteria cells (isolated), the yeast cells (isolated), and a yeast colony.</strong>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/kombact.jpg" border=1 width=117 height=161> <img src="../images/komyeast.jpg" border=1 width=117 height=161> <img src="../images/komycol.jpg" border=1 width=117 height=161></center><BR><BR>
This tough zooglea cannot readily be torn with the fingers when handling, so if it needs to be re-shaped for any reason (ie to be cultured in a smaller container, for example) scissors are needed to cut it with. Its upper surface is smoother than the underside which has a more slimy, loose texture, often with dark thread-like 'veins' and streamers hanging down. Sometimes gas pockets form as on bladder wrack seaweed which help it to stay afloat, although it seems to be able to function perfectly well if it sinks to the bottom of the liquid as no light is needed.
<p>
<strong>Where does the name come from?</strong><br>

It is known by many names; from many of them it can be seen that the origins lie in the East - China, Japan, Manchuria, Russia and India. It is known as Combucha (Japanese word for tea sponge or tea fungus), Kombucha (Germanized form of the Japanese name and used internationally), Tea Kvass (Russian), Olinka (Bohemian and Moravian monasteries), Kargasok tea (the Japanese brought the culture from Kargasok, Russia), Manchurian Mushroom (Manchuria) as well as many other names. According to some literature it was introduced to Japan by the Korean doctor Kombu in 414BC, and became known then as 'Kombu's cha'.
<p>

<strong>What is its purpose in life?</strong><br>

Well, it appears to have been put on this planet to serve mankind (isn't everything!?), producing by a lactic acid fermentation process a delicious beverage rich in beneficial acids, vitamins, amino acids, enzymes, antibiotic, antiseptic and detoxifying substances and a small amount of alcohol (0 - 1%).
<p>
When utilised by the human body this ferment has an <strong>immune system boosting and detoxifying effect</strong>; it does not target specific body organs but influences the entire organism positively through metabolic stabilisation and pH balancing. It enables any toxins present (built up over many years of absorbing contaminants such as preservatives, fungicides, pesticides and insecticides in our foods, air pollution and stress-related toxins) to become water-soluble and kidney-manageable through their conjugation with one of the constituents in particular, glucuronic acid. 
<p>
This acid binds the toxins in the liver which in turn sends them to the kidneys for elimination. Toxins bound in this way are not able to be reabsorbed by the intestines or the urinary system but are instead safely eliminated with the urine (they would otherwise be stored 'locked-up' out of harms way giving rise to excess fatty tissues and cellulite). In a healthy body large amounts of glucuronic acid are naturally produced by the liver for the purpose of carrying out this detoxifying task anyway, but if the liver is not 100% happy with its lot and perhaps suffering the effects of contaminated nourishment, (drugs, booze, junk foods) and the by-products of twentieth century stress, it may be necessary to obtain a top-up in the glucuronic acid department by way of drinking Kombucha tea.
<p>

<strong>"Ah, got it at last!"</strong>

<strong>What happens when I drink it?</strong><P>
<img src="../images/komlifta.jpg" border=1 width=200 height=162 align=left hspace=8> 
Firstly, you will probably enjoy the taste which ranges from a sweetish, rather fragrant, lightly tea-flavoured drink when immature, through to a less-sweet, slightly tart sparkling apple wine flavour when more fully brewed. This is the stage at which most people consume and enjoy the tea. Eventually it takes on  a more acid, fizzy, cider vinegar nature the longer it is brewed, finally reaching a strong vinegar stage at which it can apparently be used as such. As the overall effect on the consumer is primarily one of bodily 'flushing' and detoxification, the benefits can manifest themselves in a thousand different ways according to your particular bodily imbalances. This leads to a myriad of claims made by consumers, from preventing/curing cancer to eliminating wrinkles and restoring grey hair to its original colour! 
<p>
Don't be put off by these apparently unlikely claims, reflect instead on the possibility that a strengthened immune system might be more able to fight off or combat diseases more readily than a body weakened and burdened with pollutants. If the internal environment is non-welcoming to diseases like cancer, then perhaps they will not be able to invade and flourish. <em>(As for the wrinkle and grey hair claims, I am still desperately evaluating..!)</em>
<p>

<strong>How do I brew my own?</strong><br>
<dl>
<dt>Firstly, a few tips:-
<p>
<dd>a)	It is a simple process requiring little or no special equipment, although I have found that one particular (fairly expensive) item does help in my case. The temperature of the medium ideally needs to be kept constant somewhere between 23 and 28 degrees C, and as my house is devoid of an airing cupboard which usually satisfies this requirement, I use an aquarium heater actually in the fermentation vessel itself.
<p>
<dd>b)	The ratio between the surface area exposed to the air and the volume of the liquid effects the nature of the resulting tea to some extent, ie the greater the surface area of a small amount of liquid the more acid the tea and the more quickly it matures. If you want a milder Kombucha I recommend you use a vessel such as a bread crock which holds around  5 - 7 litres (10 - 12 pints) with a diameter of about 22mm (8").
<P>
<dd>c)	No metal should come into contact with the colony or its medium, therefore it should be brewed in glass if possible and no metal spoons or utensils used for measuring any of the ingredients. 
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Ingredients:-</strong><br>
(multiply up to fit your particular vessel)<br>
<ul>
<li>2 litres (3 to 4 pints) water, preferably filtered
<li>160 grams (5oz) white granulated sugar*
<li>2-4 teaspoons (or teabags) tea**
<li>1 healthy Kombucha culture
<li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar 
(only necessary for the very first brew if no mature tea is<br>
available. If it is then add 200 mls [1/3 pint] in order to
acidify the medium slightly)<br>

</ul>
<em><strong>*White granulated sugar</strong> really is the type Kombucha prefers even though you may be loathe to use it. By the time you consume the tea the sugar should have been completely utilised and therefore you won't actually be consuming it yourself anyway, so for the wellbeing of the colony  it is better to use it at this stage. As you get more experienced with the brewing process you can experiment with other types including honey if you want to, keeping a spare Kombucha in reserve in case the original doesn't thrive.
</em>
<p>
<em><strong>**The type of tea</strong> used can be black or green, although I have found that when using green the flavour is rather bland. The colony is apparently happier on black as it provides a more nutritious solution, but again experimentation can be interesting with all sorts of teas including herbal as long as they are relatively low in oils which may interfere with the microbial growth. The terms 'black' and 'green' teas relate to the method of drying after picking, black tea being 'fermented' (a rather misleading term simply meaning that the tea is spread out in a layer 10cm thick in a damp room with a low ventilation rate and a controlled temperature, and oxidation allowed to convert the juices in the leaf enzymically). This produces the characteristic blackening effect and stronger flavour, whereas green tea is briefly steamed after the 18 hour wilting process to destroy the remaining enzymes and then dried slowly at a lower temperature; in this way it retains the green colour and has a milder and more delicate flavour.
</em>
<P>

<strong>Method:-</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Boil the water and pour onto the tea and sugar, stir and leave to brew for 15 minutes. 
<li>Strain into the brewing vessel and allow to cool to room temperature.
<li>Add the vinegar or Kombucha tea, stir thoroughly
<li>Lay the colony onto the surface <strong>smooth side up.</strong>
<li>Cover with muslin or a loosely-woven cloth and place the vessel in place that can maintain a steady temperature of somewhere between 23 and 28 degrees C.
<li>Leave undisturbed if curiosity will allow, and after 6-9 days of fermentation taste the liquid to see if it has reached the required acidity. 
</ul>
Experience will enable you to determine the time needed with your particular set of conditions and flavour requirements, but remember that <strong>the more 'zingy' and acidic it is, the more beneficial acids there are present. </strong>Strain (do not overstrain or you will remove the yeast which is rich in the B vitamins) and bottle and store in the fridge.  Be sure to leave a good headspace in the bottles as the fermentation activity will continue at a reduced rate giving the sparkling quality to the drink. Check for and release excess pressure periodically.
<p>
 The colony can immediately be used to brew another batch, or stored in the fridge in some of its tea until required. It will be found to have replicated itself in the form of another layer ABOVE the original; this can be separated and used for another brew, stored in the fridge in reserve or passed on to someone else. 

<p>
Eventually you will be overrun by these offspring and may have to resort to throwing them out, but before you do please consider registering with the Kombucha Network at the address at the end of this piece if you are prepared to supply other potential K-brewers with colonies through the post. The recommended daily dose appears to vary widely, but a wineglassful three times a day would seem to be a sensible starting point. The first is best on an empty stomach before breakfast and the other two as an aperitif before lunch and dinner. 
<p>

<strong>Here is a good look at the 'daughter' of my first culture. It might look a bit alien and repulsive to some of you,  but just remember what your intestines or heart looks like, and of course - as ugly as these are - they do a pretty good job, eh?</strong>
<p>
<br>
<center><h3>A few personal thoughts:-</h3></center>
<em>
In addition to any health benefits derived from Kombucha tea drinking itself I believe the whole process of brewing the beverage is a therapeutic one. The paraphernalia of obtaining your first culture, preparing its medium,  making sure it lives happily in a pollution-free environment, checking its temperature periodically, waiting for exactly the right moment to harvest the tea,  (and if you are an American, singing to it or playing classical music to it!) etc, probably gives the 'owner' a feeling of well-being and achievement which adds to the stress-relief and subsequent benefits gained. The added bonus at the end of the process is that it rewards you not only with a quantity of the delicious elixir but also produces a 'baby' ( - ahhhhhhhhhh, how sweeeeet!) to keep or give away, so there is also a sharing element which gives rise to even MORE feel-good factor!
<p>
Who cares how it works - there are testimonials from around the world describing how 'miracle cures' have been effected as a result of  friendships with Kombucha.  Perhaps the placebo effect is coming into play, or possibly other health-improving offshoots such as the fact that you shouldn't smoke in the vicinity of the colony as it inhibits its growth - possibly encouraging you to give up smoking - what could be better for the human body than removing this particular form of pollution whether it be by abstinence or glucuronic acid absorption?!
<P>
The clean semi-tartness of the flavour possibly sharpens the taste buds so that you might steer away from over sweetened drinks and foods over time - that can only be beneficial too. Drinking it on an empty stomach with up to 1% alcohol and in the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide probably does as much good as anything in the light of the current trend for copying the red wine drinking habits of the French to try to achieve their nationally low heart disease rates! However it does whatever it does I just know that I enjoy brewing and drinking it and that I shall continue to do so. Is it taking over the kitchens of the world, has it already penetrated my brain and judgement..?!
<P>
<img src="../images/kombucha.jpg" border=1 width=271 height=202 align=left>

What else now... Oh! Yes: one of the lads here (Andrew) at Microscopy-UK 
stuck a sample into the SEM! This is what it looks like really close-up. You can see the yeast and the bacteria cells in this terrific image. That's it for now. I'll see if I can talk one of the boys into doing a bit more research into the microscopic 
composition of the Kombucha fungus, and follow up with another article on it next month. Bye, till then... <strong>Polly.</strong>

Also, try entering a key-word search on one of the web engines like Lycos!
For example, enter: <em>kombucha</em> and see how much is available!
<p>
 <strong>
One last word: as with any home brewing or food-making, cleanliness is important.
Ensure everything is washed properly, including your hands. If during the fermenting period,
the tea does not smell vinegary but instead smells foul, it is probably best to chuck it away.
It is unlikely for the tea to become infected by foreign bacteria or protozoa simply because
the kombucha creates an acid environment which makes it very difficult for other living things,
microscopic in nature, to survive for very long. </strong>

<h2><I>Welcome to the <b>dark side</b> of Micscape and microscopy. Hold on tight to
the arms of your seat, get the smelling salts (or better still - a glass of brandy) ready,
for we are about to experience...  A Nightmare on Mic Street</I></h2>
<h4><i>Part 2: A Flexible Friend.</i><br>
by Maurice Smith.</h4>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>What fills us with fear?</h3>
For some it is the thought of going to the dentist, for others it is spiders, injections,
or the fear of madness or going blind. The microscope in its various disguises can help us
examine these nightmares close-up. In this mini series, I will take you month by month, through
some of our common nightmares. <i>Did you think Microscopy was about quiet, studious, safe things?</i>
I hope not. 'Scoping' can take us nearer to beauty or closer to the savage truth of reality. For this 
month, let us consider a tiny friend (or is it <i>fiend</i>) that sometimes enjoys our food 
as much as us....
<p>
<center><img src="../images/nite2i3.gif" alt=""></center>
<p>
<h3>Realisation of invasion.</h3>
You wake during the night gasping for a glass of water. Still numb from sleep, you stumble downstairs
to the kitchen and turn on the light... and freeze: the tiled floor is moving! The cold tingle of fear 
consumes the residue of sleep and you are alert - staring at the hundreds of black bugs scurrying rapidly
across the tiles to escape the light. With revulsion you realise what they are: <b>cockroaches</b>. 
<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>A tropical invader.</h3>
These insects belong to the order <b>Dictyoptera</b>, sub-order Blattodea. Cockroaches are naturally found
in countries with warm climates and those found in Europe and other colder habitats all over the world
are actually living under artifical conditions - namely in our warmer homes and buildings. Man's commercial 
activities have inadvertantly introduced these insects to non-tropical countries through his commercial
trading and activities. They need food and warmth to survive. Where better for them to find these ideal
conditions than in the artifical environment of our homes and buildings. Some common species are: 'black beetle' <i>(Blatta orientalis)</i>,
the American Cockroach <i>(Periplaneta americana)</i>, and the German Cockroack <i>(Blatella germanica)</i>.
The world's most common cockroach is the American Cockroach which was taken to the United States inadvertantly
on slave ships from Africa. In fact, all cockroaches originated in this continent but were spread far and wide
by the early trading ships.
<p>

<img src="../images/nite2i2.gif" alt="" align=left hspace=12>
<h3>Eating habits.</h3>
These insects are <i>omnivorous</i>. They will not attack or kill each other for food but readily consume any
dead brothers and sisters or any other dead insect material found in the wild. In our homes, they have a wide
range of tastes. They eat paper and scraps of food found in our cupboards or on our tables - illustrated in 
the picture to the left! Their sense of taste is so advanced that they can detect the difference between food
and poison by sampling a single molecule of a substance.
<p>
<h3>Danger.</h3>
They have filthy habits - excreting where they run - and thereby contaminating our food. The possibility exists
that they may spread several diseases: tubercolsis, cholera, leprosy, dysentery, and typhoid. Any contaminated
food products must be thrown away and affected areas should be disinfected. The presence of cockroach infestation
can also be detected by the strong foul odour left behind on the material they run across.
<p>
<h3>Mistaken identity.</h3>
A quick word of warning. Before you go stamping on the next beetle you find crawling across your floor, take a moment
to determine if it is indeed a cockroach. The majority of beetles are helpful to humankind, ridding us of unwanted pests in
our gardens and crops. Some beetles may look like cockroaches to the casual and uninformed observer but few of them have
the incredible flexible and long whip-like antennae of the latter. It is also well to remember that <b>cockroaches are not
actually beetles.</b> 
<p>
You might find putting the old boot down on one harder than you think. Their reflex actions are in the order of 1/50th second
and therefore faster than human reflexes by about 5 times; <i>and they know when you are coming:</i> projecting from the back of
a cockroach is the <i>cerci</i>, a finger-like organ covered with fine hairs which shimmer in the slightest air current - <i>like
the sound waves coming from your footsteps as you approach them</i>. The sensory hairs are so finely tuned that that they can 
detect the 'sound' of other cockroaches walking nearby.
<p>

<h3>A flexible friend.</h3>
As the title of this nightmare suggests, the 'flexible friend' does not refer to our relationship with the cockroach but
to the flexible antennae of the insect itself, and its usefulness as a sensing device. In this picture you can see the antennae
thrashing about like whips as the cockroach searches the space at the edge of the table's precipice in an attempt to locate firm ground!
The flexible properties of the cockroach antennae are derived from their construction. If you go back to the opening image at the
top of this page, you can observe part of an antenna (feeler) greatly magnified. It is made up of many segmented parts much like a string
of tiny cotton reels. This over-segmented arrangement allows incredible flexibility.
<p>
<h3>Worse still - they fly!</h3>
Cockroaches possess two pairs of wings although these are often reduced in some females. Fortunately, most of these insects seem reluctant 
to fly even though they are capable of doing so. Their legs are short and slender which makes them excellent runners - <i> as anyone who 
has tried to chase them will have found out.</i> Fresh generations develop from eggs which are carried in a 'purse' (<i>oothecae</i>, plural)
which is (in most species) deposited on the ground shortly after it is formed. Each 'purse' may contain between 12 to 50 eggs, depending on species.
The hatched insects resemble tiny worms but quickly shed their skins to emerge as miniature cockroaches. Further moults (between 5 to 12) over a period
of 2 to 18 months will see them develop into adults; <i>the period depends on species.</i>
<p>
<h3>The hoards.</h3>
Various treatments can be used to eradicate cockroaches from affected houses and buildings. Fumigation with hydrogen cyanide is used in some 
countries to clear-out heavily infested properties but cleaned premises may not stay cockroach-free for long. These insects will migrate from
house to house, or flat to flat in multi-dwelling buidings, and cleansed areas may become reinfested from neighbouring houses if these remain
untreated. Most of the materials used to treat cochroach infestation is highly poisonous. Proper professional help and methods must be employed 
to prevent harm to ourselves when attempting to eradicate this pest.
<p>
<h3>Who rules the planet?</h3>
Although, we consider ourselves the most successful creatures on planet Earth, it is wise to remember that insects out-number us in every respect. They
have spent far longer than our few million years adapting to a variety of habitats, can survive in extreme conditions where we would find it difficult,
and are more likely to survive any planetary catastrophy which may lay waiting unknown in the future. It can only help humankind's survival prospects to 
study and learn as much as possible about all life-forms irrespective of our relationship with them; friends or foes, we share the planet with them!

<center><h1>Spongy Bone</h1></center>
<img src="sbone.gif" align=left >
Spongy bone is found towards the head of a long bone, under the compact
bone. If you consider that real sponge is made of sponge and air spaces,
then the sponge is made of bone or <b>Trabeculae -{1}</b> and the air is made
of <b>red bone marrow -{3}</b>; the marrow produces red blood cells. <p>

The trabeculae is interspersed with cancellous cavities which 
contain <b>Osteoblasts -{2}</b>. The osteoblasts produce Osteocytes which are 
embedded in the trabeculae. <p>
<i>If you look at the trabeculae just at the end
of the indication line marked as {1}, you can see a single osteocyte as a very
tiny circle.</i> These produce the inorganic calcium phosphate that the 
trabeculae are made of. In this slide, the  trabeculae are surrounded by a layer of protective connective tisue called the 
<b>Periosteum -{4}</b>.

"The total number of diatoms is more than 450, and they are grouped in 
four series. With dark-ground
illumination, and a low objective, the whole are brought simultaneously 
before the eye in a singularly
beautiful way, and it is exceedingly interesting to contrast the varied 
forms presented by this remarkable
family of silex-secreting plants. Each of the four series will be found 
composed of diatoms arranged in six
lines, one under the other, like the pages of a book. Fine specimens of 
<i>Eupodiscus argus</i> mark the beginning
and the end of the series, and the "Systematic catalogue", issued with 
the slide, admits of easy reference.<p>

The richness of this slide is astounding. they are grouped in families, 
and it is thus easy to compare the
different families together, and note what characteristics their species 
bear  in common, and how they differ
from other groups. We cannot imagine that any large number of slides, 
requiring such a remarkable
combination of patience and skill, will be issued. Ours is numbered 
thirty, and we do not envy the preparer
his laborious job. We used to think a good deal of a half a dozen or a 
dozen diatoms elegantly arranged; but
to persuade hundreds of these minute objects to stand in order, with 
military precision, was what we never
expected to see.<p>

Of course there will be many who will desire to possess this slide, 
simply on account of its rarity and
beauty; but its scientific value will also be appreciated, and we 
trust microscopists will not underrate the
value of a systematic collection because they have it on a single piece 
of glass, instead of scattered through
a cabinet full of drawers."<p>

<CENTER>
<H2>DRAWING  THROUGH  THE  MICROSCOPE<br>
 by Roy Winsby </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

 

<b>A desire to draw.</b><br>
Occasionally we may want to draw something we see through the microscope
and there are two ways of doing this, the <b>Camera Lucida</b> and the <b>Squared
Graticule</b>, which are explained as follows:-
<p>
<center><b>The Camera lucida.</b></center>
<p>
The Camera lucida does not have anything to do with a camera, but that is
what it has always been known as, and it is an apparatus very popular in
Victorian times before the development of a photographic camera which could
be affixed to a microscope. I doubt if any Camera lucidas have been made for
many years, though there must still be a good number of the older ones about
as they were made by such well known makers as Zeiss Abbe, Leitz, Watson,
Beck, that I know of, and no doubt many other makers made them too.
I have never seen a Camera lucida advertised in dealers' catalogues issued
in recent years, nor can I recall having seen one offered for sale, or even
as an item wanted, in Sales & Wants lists until the recent issue of the
Quekett Bulletin, Summer 1995 issue, which contained on page 30 a Wants ad
for an original pattern Zeiss-Abbe camera lucida without filters.
<p>

Books on microscopy from around 1855 mention the use of photography as an
alternative to the use of the Camera lucida, but with the later improvements
in the photographic camera with its ease of an instant picture the purpose
of the Camera lucida was superseded and brought about its demise. However,
no matter how good and labour saving that modern appliances are, there is
sometimes some aspect that is not quite as good as the old thing, and this
is to some extent true in this instance.  Whilst photographs are so much
easier and quicker in their taking, the Camera lucida has one important
advantage over the photographic camera, i.e., drawings can be made in depth.
<p>
We all know about the depth of focus, or, as some may prefer to call it, the
depth of field, but whichever way you wish to call it, it is a fact that the
higher the numerical aperture of the objective the more shallow will be the
depth of focus.  This means that, when using a high power objective, even
small items have to be viewed at different levels of focus, and this is the
drawback of the camera as it can only take a picture of any one focal plane.
The Camera lucida does not have this problem, as drawings can be done in
depth, the different focal planes being brought into view by a slight change
of the microscope focus as the drawing proceeds.
<p>
<b>A  typical  Camera  lucida.</b><br>
Camera lucidas have a lift-up or slide-sideways top lens unit which at
first glance looks like the eyelens of an eyepiece, but it is more complex
than that, for below it is a small prism with a half silvered surface which
(as explained by Conrad Beck in a book entitled "The Microscope" published
in 1938) transmits half the light upwards to the eye from the microscope and
reflects by means of an adjustable mirror on an arm, about 6" to one side,
the light from a sheet of drawing paper placed on the table at one side of
the microscope immediately below the mirror.
<p>
The mirror reflects the image of the sheet of drawing paper through a small
hole in the side of the Camera lucida eyepiece cap to the small prism,
whereupon the eye sees the two images (the specimen and the drawing paper
with the pencil) superimposed one on the other.
<p>
Camera lucidas appear to have been made for right handed people.  In past
years before we were more enlightened, right handed writing and drawing were
the rule in schools, and left handed people had a difficult time. If you are
left handed and not ambidextrous, then a Camera lucida is not for you, in
which case go to Part 2 of this article dealing with drawing through the
microscope using an eyepiece graticule.
<p>
<b>How to use a Camera lucida.</b><br>
How the Camera lucida is used is that looking through the microscope you
see the tip of the pencil superimposed over the image of the specimen and
you draw over the outline of the image. This, however, is not anything like
as easy as it sounds, and can in fact be difficult and frustrating; some
people are able to make perfect drawings of all kinds of specimens, whilst
others find it difficult to use and never master it. Some Victorians must
have mastered its use because many of the drawings of specimens through the
microscope seen in old books were drawn using a Camera lucida.
<p>
Very few readers of this Newsletter will have a Camera lucida, and indeed
not many will have actually even seen one, but as it forms an important part
of microscopical history you may like to know a little more about it and how
it works. You may, you never know your luck, possibly pick one up sometime,
and you can always keep this article in mind should the occasion arise when
you might unexpectedly obtain a Camera lucida. The microscope to be used
need not necessarily be monocular but it should preferably have an upright
eyetube or eyetubes, though only one eyetube is used. However, I understand
there is another, rarer, form of Camera lucida made for use with the
microscope in a horizontal position, which has a somewhat similar prism and
does not require a mirror. I have never seen this latter type and doubt if
many of you will ever see one anyway.
<p>
So, as regards using the conventional Camera lucida, set up the microscope
in the normal way with a correctly illuminated and focused specimen using
say a x10 objective.  Temporarily remove the eyepiece and clamp the Camera
lucida to the top of the eyetube, then replace the eyepiece. At this stage
the Camera lucida top lens is lifted or swung sideways out of the way
depending on its type.
<p>
At the side of the microscope place a sheet of white drawing paper with a
pencil on, lying beneath the mirror.  Temporarily place a small piece of
paper on the stage covering the specimen, so as to block out the image, and
bring the Camera lucida top lens into position and look through. The paper
at the side of the microscope with the pencil resting on should be seen
clearly.  If not, adjust the swivel mirror at the end of the arm until the
pencil can be seen central on the paper. Remove the paper off the top of the
slide and look through what will be seen as a small bright centre part of
the Camera lucida top lens - it is in this bright centre part that the image
appears. There is no need to refocus the microscope unless you change the
magnification. Looking through the Camera lucida top lens you should see the
image superimposed on the drawing paper and, in theory, you simply pick up
the pencil and draw round the image - if you can at first see both image and
pencil clearly then you are indeed lucky.
<P>
<b>Getting the contrast right.</b><br>
Usually beneath the Camera lucida top lens is a wheel with a few small
supplementary glasses which are neutral density filters varying in density,
the purpose of which is to vary the relative brilliance as between the
specimen and the drawing paper. Looking through the Camera lucida top lens
turn the supplementary filters wheel to each of these small filters in turn,
which may bring up the image of the specimen nice and clear, but not showing
the pencil, or it may show the pencil and paper but no image of the specimen
- you have to find the happy in-between contrast which will show both image
and pencil, though both image and pencil will not now be at their brightest
since you are obtaining the best of both working together. Some Camera
lucidas have a further one or perhaps two supplementary filters fastened to
the side of the eyecap which can be swung up into position to give a little
more contrast.
<p>
<b>Balancing the light.</b><br>
Having gone through all that procedure, some people still cannot find the
necessary happy in-between contrast, and here is the secret ingredient - you
have to balance the light intensity as between the illumination of the
specimen seen through the microscope and the light from the table lamp
shining on the paper. The microscope illumination is the prerequisite and is
set as standard, it is the light from the table lamp shining on the paper
which has to be controlled and the most simple thing for this is a
Woolworths' standard light dimmer switch fixed between the power point and
the lamp.
<p>
<b>A few tips!</b><br>
So, having got set up, looking through the microscope you draw the pencil
over the image seen, but of course the actual drawing you are doing is the
size of the magnified image, i.e., using a x5 eyepiece and a x10 objective,
the drawn image will be about 50 times the size of the image on the slide
depending on the position of the drawing paper.  When holding the top lens,
particularly when turning the filters wheel, keep your fingers out of the
way of the small hole immediately below and to one side of the Camera lucida
top lens which faces the mirror - this is the opening to the tiny reflecting
prism in the Camera lucida head.
<p>
The Camera lucida can be used with a microscope having an inclined eyetube,
but two difficulties arise. One is that unless the clamp is securely fixed
to the eyetube, the mirror at the end of the arm swings down with gravity
and you have to hold it up. The other is that the sheet of drawing paper
needs to be on a board sloping at the same angle as the mirror and whilst it
is more comfortable to use an inclined eyetube I think it simpler to use a
vertical eyetube microscope. If you have a modern made microscope where
accessories are still available for it such as the Russian Biolam range, you
should find that vertical monocular eyetubes are available for purchase.

<p>
<p>
<center><b>The Graticule.</b></center>
<p>
The graticule, also known an an eyepiece micrometer, is a small glass disk
etched with a squared grid for area measurement, or a scale for linear
measurement, which can be fitted in practically any eyepiece.
<p>
In the case
of the conventional biological microscope, the top of the eyepiece is
unscrewed and the graticule is placed on the field stop, the aperture about
one-third to one-half way down inside the eyepiece which governs the field
of view. The field stop is where the image of the specimen as magnified by
the objective comes to rest, and it is the image at this point which is
magnified by the eyelens to give the final image you see through the
microscope.  Anything placed at the field stop will also always be in focus.
However, note that there is a vast difference between the eyepiece
micrometer, the graticule - the glass slip-in disk just mentioned, and a
micrometer eyepiece. 
<p>
<b>Using with a stage micrometer.</b><br>
When used for the measurement of a specimen, graticules
normally need to be used in conjunction with a stage micrometer, this being
a standard size 3" x 1" glass slide engraved with a scale which is placed on
the microscope stage. Graticules and stage micrometers are generally
available from microscope dealers, but they are fairly expensive; graticules
cost up to 10 and stage micrometer slides about 20 to 25. Graticules can
usually be purchased in 19 and 21mm diameter sizes with cross-lines, scales
or square grid to fit conventional eyepieces on biological microscopes, and
25mm diameter for stereo microscopes.

<p>
Incidentally, for our beginner members, note the distinction between
micrometer, the scale etched on a glass disk or on a slide for  measuring
purposes, and a micrometre. The latter is an actual unit of measurement.
Owners of the Russian MBS-9 and MBS-10 stereo microscopes are fortunate in
that supplied as standard equipment with these microscopes is a special x8
eyepiece with dioptric focusing eyelens and with both scale and grid
eyepiece graticules supplied for measurement purposes.
<p>
These two particular Russian stereo microscopes, when used with their
eyepiece graticule, do not need a stage micrometer slide since the manual
gives conversion tables to show the value of the specimen which corresponds
to one division of the eyepiece scale or grid at different objective
magnifications. In the MBS stereo microscope eyepieces, the graticule is
inserted in the bottom of the eyepiece; this means that because this
position is not a normal field stop, the graticule will not be in focus when
looking through the eyepiece.  This is why this is a focusing dioptric
eyepiece; with it you first use the dioptric adjustment to bring the
graticule into focus with the eyepiece, then you use the normal focusing
control of the microscope to bring the specimen into focus in the normal
way.  The two graticules supplied with the MBS-9 are 23mm diameter and those
with the MBS-10 are 25mm diameter.

<p>
<b>Using a Squared Graticule for drawing.</b><br>
Most of us are no doubt familiar with the method of copying a map, a
picture or a drawing, by either ruling the drawing in say " squares or, to
save marking the drawing, to cover it with a sheet of tracing paper ruled
with the squares. The paper on which the drawing is to be copied is ruled
with say " or larger squares and the method is to copy the drawing one
square at a time to a corresponding square on the larger ruled paper.
Correct proportions are maintained, resulting in a more reasonably accurate
larger size drawing than could be obtained freehand.
<p>
The same principle can be used with the squared graticule in the eyepiece
which, when looking through the microscope, will be seen superimposed over
the image, just like ruling a drawing with small squares, and the drawing
hand copied one square at a time to the sheet of paper.
<p>
<b>The Micrometer Eyepiece.</b><br>
I have mentioned the Eyepiece Micrometer, which is not the same as a
Micrometer Eyepiece, the latter commonly known as a Filar/Curtain Micrometer
Eyepiece, which fits in place of the standard eyepiece. It has its own fixed
eyepiece, often x10. At the side of the instrument is a calibrated  wheel
with scale and marker. Looking through the fixed eyepiece shows cross hairs,
one horizontal, one vertical.  Turning the calibrated wheel moves a further
vertical hair line across the field of view like the closing of a curtain,
which is how this type of micrometer eyepiece gets its name.

<H3>Why professionals?</H3>

<P>Amateurs do microscopy because they enjoy it, professionals to earn a
living. Although this simple statement is true, it leaves a great deal
unsaid. Most professionals enjoy microscopy every bit as much as amateurs,
though some of the sample preparation and statistical analysis may be
repetitive and tedious.</P>

<P>Professionals are necessary because there's important work to be done
by trained staff using equipment that is often expensive and difficult to
use correctly. As in most walks of life, professionals can devote all their
time to a specialised area so that they become highly skilled and effective
in their work.</P>

<P>Professional microscopists certainly <I>do</I> earn their living by
examining the very small, so who employs them and what do they do?

<H3>A wide range of duties</H3>

<P>Modern society depends on microscopy in many ways. Here are a few
examples.</P>

<UL>

  <LI><P><B><A HREF="http://panda.uchc.edu/htbit/">Hospitals</A></B> - In the pathology lab, microscopists take tissue
    removed during surgery and prepare it for light or electron microscopy.
    The tissue is studied to aid in diagnosis, the patient's treatment
    is often based partly on these findings, so the microscopist's role is
    literally one of life or death.</P>

  <LI><P><B><A HREF="http://moore.med.unc.edu/path/microscopy/welcome.htm">The Police</A></B> - Microscopists in the forensic science lab can
    often help by identifying small pieces of hair, fabric or other materials
    found at the scene of a serious crime. A person's guilt or innocence is
    often decided partly on the results of such findings.</P>

  <LI><P><B>Universities and Colleges</B> - Microscopy plays a part in almost
    every area of study. In
    biology, materials science, microelectronic
    design and fabrication, ecology and conservation,
    <A HREF="http://webnet.mednet.gu.se/mednet/projects.html">medical research</A>,
    and
    not least in
    <A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/Entomology/EMC.html">training</A>
    the next generation of microscopists.</P>

  <LI><P><B><A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/collections/othermicro.html">Museums</A></B> - Pollen analysis, tree ring dating and other methods
    help archaeologists date their finds. Microscopy also helps curators
    understand the structure and state of their exhibits and so plan
    how to stabilise and preserve fragile objects for display.</P>

  <LI><P><B>Industry</B> - Quality control, analysis of structural failure,
    product design and development all depend partly on the application of
    microscopical methods. Many large companies like
    <A HREF="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/stm.html">IBM</A>,
    Shell and ICI retain
    large teams of microscopists in well-equipped labs similar to those in
    universities.</P>

</UL>

<H3>What do they do?</H3>

<P>Most professional microscopists spend relatively little time actually
looking through the eyepiece of an instrument. Most of the time is
spent obtaining and preparing the specimen, developing photographs or
taking measurements, using computers to analyse or process images, writing
up the results, and doing the necessary administrative paperwork involved
in keeping a modern laboratory running smoothly and successfully.</P>

<P>Obtaining a sample is not always as easy as it may appear. Sometimes
a long series of experimental treatments must be applied first so that the
treated samples can be compared with untreated controls. Microscopy can
then pinpoint the effect of the treatment. In biology chemicals might be
applied to leaves to find out what effect they have, in materials science
a strip of metal might be repeatedly flexed to see how its crystal structure
is affected.</P>

<P>Once specimens are collected they must be carefully labelled and may
need to be preserved under special conditions or treated with chemicals
to modify them in a controlled way. Biological tissue is often fixed
chemically, rapidly frozen, embedded in wax or plastic, cut into thin
sections, squashed or smeared, then stained and mounted. Metal or mineral
samples may need to be carefully polished or cut. These processes can
take a long time and great care, only when they are complete can the
specimen be taken to the microscope for study.</P>

<P>Here are a few Web sites which illustrate the sort of work involved.</P>

<UL>

  <LI><A HREF="http://brain.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/Atlas/text/atlasFi.html">Drosophila nervous system</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.em.biol.ethz.ch/">Electron Microscopy</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/access/93.2/Nano.html">Nanolithography</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://zfish.uoregon.edu/">Zebrafish (only partially microscopy)</A>

</UL>

<P>Normally the specimen will be examined and described by making notes
and drawings, usually it will also be photographed, and it will
often need to be carefully measured. Particular features may require
counting for statistical analysis or for stereology. If photographs
have been taken they are usually developed and printed by the microscopist
in a specially equipped darkroom. Sometimes this work is farmed out to a
commercial processing lab, but usually not. Photomicrographs have special
requirements that are often hard to explain to a non-microscopist.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.lars.bbsrc.ac.uk/micro/subjects/image.html">Image analysis and image processing</A>
are becoming more widely used as
computers fall in price and continue to increase in speed and power.
Image analysis provides measurements of area, perimeter and number of
features, image processing modifies the contrast range, enhances edges
or introduces false colours. Using these techniques to full effect can
be time consuming too.</P>

<P>Writing up results is an important part of every scientist's work. It
may not be very glamorous and is often overlooked by the layman, but
results are of no value if they are not communicated. The results may be
presented in a report for internal use (hospital, industry) or published
in a scientific journal or book for use by other scientists worldwide.</P>

<P>Administrative paperwork is essential too. Professional microscopists
must apply for grants, justify the purchase of new instruments, arrange
contracts for the supply and maintenance of equipment, and make sure the
lab doen't run out of essential materials. Running out of grinding paste
or a particular stain could bring work to a halt until more can be bought,
running out of liquid nitrogen could destroy expensive equipment by
allowing it to warm above a critical temperature.</P>

<H3>Professional equipment</H3>

<P>Most amateurs hanker after a better microscope or a more powerful
objective lens. Everyone has a wish list. Professionals are just the same,
although their equipment may cost hundreds of thousands of pounds there's
usually something else they could use if there was a little more cash!</P>

<P>Professional labs have a range of microscopes depending on the type of
work which is to be done. Most labs have an assortment of light microscopes
from the humble hand lens (a <I>very</I> useful device for amateur and
professional alike) through stereo and bright field instruments which would
be familiar to most amateurs, to large
research microscopes with photographic gear, darkfield, phase contrast,
Nomarski interference contrast, and fluorescence. Many labs may also need
a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope
(TEM), either of these may be fitted with extra features like X-ray analysis,
scanning transmission (STEM) and other systems.</P>

<P>Many other kinds of microscope are in use today, often for special
purposes. Microscope technology continues to advance rapidly so new devices
will continue to appear in the years to come. The confocal light microscope
clears away all the out-of-focus clutter to give clear images of internal
structures. The acoustic microscope uses sound waves instead of light, so
the images contain information about the sample's mechanical properties.
X-ray and ion beam microscopes are available, so too are the extraordinary
scanning probe microscopes which 'feel' the surface of a sample down to
atomic scales.</P>

<P>Take a tour round some of the world's
<A HREF="http://www.lars.bbsrc.ac.uk/micro/web-org.html">microscopy labs</A>
to see what sort of
equipment they are using.</P>

<P>The microscope itself is only part of the story. Sample preparation
may require milling, grinding, polishing, chemical fixation, specialist
freezing techniques, embedding in wax or plastic, sectioning, staining,
or complex chemistry or biochemistry such as immunocytochemistry.
Equipment for all these methods and more requires at least as much space,
time and money as the microscopes themselves.
<A HREF="http://www.lars.bbsrc.ac.uk/micro/subjects/specprep.html">Details of some of these techniques</A>
are on the Web too.</P>

<H3>Professional societies</H3>

<P>Just as amateurs have clubs and societies, so too do the professionals. There
are local societies, national societies, and international societies.
<A HREF="http://www.lars.bbsrc.ac.uk/micro/meetings.html">Meetings</A>
are held where microscopists can compare methods and results
and discuss some of the difficult issues, advances in techniques and
equipment and so forth.</P>

<P>Many active societies also publish journals, books and proceedings of
various kinds.</P>

<H3>Getting alongside the professionals</H3>

<P>Amateur clubs could organise visits to professional microscopy labs
where their members could see specialist equipment at work, and even have
a chance to use it briefly. It is fascinating to see how the 'other half'
works.</P>

<P>If you belong to a local club or society why not suggest a visit of this
kind at your next meeting? To organise it, take a look at the list of
academic sites and search through the Web pages of any in your area. Make
contact with biology departments, mechanical engineering departments, and
others that might use microscopes in their work. Look especially for light
or electron microscope departments. Note down the details and write to them,
or send an e-mail if an address is provided.</P>

<P>Be polite but persistent, most universities or research institutes are
happy to arrange conducted tours for small, interested groups, but often
sucess will depend on contacting the right person. Don't forget
museums, hospitals, and industrial companies as many of these will also have
active microscopy departments too. Ask if it would be permitted to write up
the visit for your local newspaper, most editors welcome local-interest
stories and might even be willing to send a reporter or photographer. Some
tour hosts might say no, but many will be happy to have some good local
publicity. There may even be future club members amongst the paper's readership,
who knows?</P>

<P>There are many parallels between the worlds of astronomy and microscopy,
both involve magnified images of objects which subtend very small angles
in order to reveal details invisible to the naked eye. In astronomical
circles a well-developed co-operative effort exists in which amateurs help
the professionals by conducting mass surveys, reporting unusual events, and
helping out when large numbers of observers are needed to cover great areas.</P>

<P>So far this kind of co-operative effort hasn't taken hold in the world
of microscopy. There's absolutely no reason for this, at least in principle.
Working together could bring large benefits to both amateurs and professionals
and has already been
<A HREF="http://www.lars.bbsrc.ac.uk/micro/in-focus/9512.html">suggested by Maurice Smith</A>
in a short Web article.</P>

<H3>How can I become a professional?</H3>

<P>Making the jump from amateur to professional may not be easy. A
university degree is by no means essential, though it may help. There are
few qualifications in microscopy as such, most microscopists will have a
degree in biology, or physics, or materials science, or medicine or some
other discipline.</P>

<P>Once you have such a degree and some experience in
scientific work you may find that you need to use a microscope for your
research. Specialist courses and training are then available to help you
gain the skills needed for this work.</P>

<P>Other professional microscopists fill a support role, they have a
responsibility for maintaining the instruments, keeping them running in
top condition, operating them for short-term or occasional users, training
those who need longer-term access. For this sort of work it may be possible
to start with good school-level qualifications, taking a junior support
role at first and working up through your career to take greater
responsibility with growing experience.</P>

<P>But maybe, just maybe, it's better to earn your bread some other way
and retain microscopy as an absorbing hobby. Professional microscopists
certainly get to use some impressive machinery and equipment, but only
a few rise to the heights where they can study whatever specimens they
like, a priviledge shared by <I>every</I> amateur! And all of them have
to accept the drudgery of routine work which often keeps them away from
the eyepiece for longer than they might like.</P>

<P>No, amateur microscopy has its advantages after all; make the most of
it!

<h1>Beginning Scoping: where to find help.</h1>
<h3>by Mike Samworth 1996</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Articles on MicScape will have already shown you what a fascinating and
diverse world can be seen under the microscope. Hopefully you will have 
begun to experience this for yourself by looking down the tube. However, 
there is always a point where assistance is needed, either in terms of use
of the instrument itself, or in obtaining and preparing specimens for
viewing. In this short article I intend to suggest where you can get such
help.
<p>
Particularly in Victorian times, the microscope was a form of family 
entertainment for the wealthy. Indeed, it is probably fair to say that the 
heyday of both the amateur microscopist and the light microscope itself was 
during the latter part of the last century and the early part of this one.
<img src="../images/diatoms.gif" align=left>
Diatoms were a favourite study subject, and many slides were produced with
assorted and ingenuous arrangements of the silica cases (frustules) left 
behind when the microscopic algae had perished. It is astonishing to see 
slides made during this period where diatoms were often arranged into well known
images such as Christmas trees or similar, simply to delight the viewer.
<p>
Many wealthy families owned microscopes and a Saturday evening may well have seen 
the entire family gathered around the microscope eagerly awaiting their 
glimpse into a hidden world of beauty. Hence such titles as Evenings at the
Microscope by P H Gosse, 1874, which opens with;
<p>
<em>
To open the path to the myriad wonders of creation, which, altogether unseen by the unassisted eye, are made cognisable to the sight by the aid
of the microscope, is the aim and scope of this volume. Great and gorgeous
as is the display od Divine power and wisdom in the things that are seen of 
all, it may safely be affirmed that a far more extensive prospect of these 
glories lay unheeded and unknown, till the opticians art revealed it. Like 
the work of some mighty genie of Oriental fable, the brazen tube is the key 
which unlocks world of wonder and beauty before invisible, which one who has 
once gazed upon it can never forget, and never cease to admire.
</em>
<p>
Old books such as this, and newer ones, can provide ideas for what to look at and how. Some are very practical in nature and give techniques and 
instructions. However good they are though, I dont think you can beat 
direct help and advice from someone. To gain access to the numerous amateur 
microscopists in this country who are willing to help you can do no better 
than join the Quekett Microscopical Club, or QMC for short. Founded in 1865, 
this club is primarily concerned with helping amateur microscopists, that is 
you. It publishes a journal and bulletin, holds lectures and gossip meetings 
once a month in London and has a fine collection of instruments, books and 
slides. More than that though, it puts you in touch with fellow members, 
most of which are only to ready to share their enthusiasm and experience 
with you. There are some local groups based in Reading, the Midlands that 
meet from time to time, but the club produces an invaluable list of members 
addresses, together with their particular interests. You are bound to find 
someone near you, so contact them and hopefully you will have found a new 
friend who shares in your hobby. 
<p>
<p>David Bellamys father was a Quekett member, and passed on his passion to 
his son. Let another Quekett member pass on some of their experience to you. 
You can find more information about the <a href="../../amateurs/qmc/mainqmc.html">Quekett</A>
from this site. 
<p>
You may like to view diatoms in more detail. Why not look 
at some for real. You will be amazed by the complex and fine patterns, like
carefully etched symetrical artwork, which cover the silica cases.

<h1>Mammilian Spinal Cord</h1></center>
<img src="spine.gif" align=left>
The spinal cord is the main neural transmission highway in the human body and
other mammals. It provides the brain with sensory information from nerve endings
throughout the body, and allows the central nervous system to effectively control
its remote processes.
<p>
This a cross-section through a spinal cord. You can see the <strong>protective meninges -{1}</strong>
which surrounds the cord. It encloses <strong>grey matter</strong> and <strong>white matter</strong>,
which here, are represented by brown/yellow colours. The <strong>grey matter</strong> is labelled as 
<strong>{2}</strong>, and is the larger central area of lighter colour in this image; the darker areas
being <strong>white matter.</strong> The <strong>central canal -{3}</strong> is filled with cerebrospinal
fluid which acts as a transport system in the central nervous system.
<p>
White matter consists of ascending and descending nerve fibres and myelinated axons - there are no 
nuclei. Sensory neurones enter the spinal cord via the <strong>dorsal root</strong>, upper left of the 
area marked as {2} in this image. These connect with relay neurones in the grey matter, which themselves
connect to motor neurones leaving the spinal cord via the ventral root (not visible in this image).

<H2>AMATEUR PRACTICAL MICROSCOPY<br>
An extract from Booklet 1 of Practical Microscopy<br> by J. Eric Marson </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<em>Mr. J. Eric Marson has for many years been one of the most dedicated people in the UK
in teaching Amateur Microscopy and helping both the novice and amateur grow their skills.
His small business, <strong>Northern Biological Supplies</strong>, has provided material and accessories
for many years. His personal contribution to this hobby has been staggering. Eric has 
written a range of booklets which are perfect for anyone wanting to get started or wishing
to learn more about Microscopy at an amateur level. He has kindly contributed extracts from 
one of the booklets here. I strongly recommend that you write to Eric Marson for further 
details of the booklets he has to offer. Booklets 1 to 17 have been bound to form a complete 
work called <strong>Practical Microscopy</strong> which will enable the newcomer or novice to
become a skilled amateur microscopist without reference to any other instruction. The booklet
is written in a easily read format and is professionally presented. <a href="#details">Details</a>

<strong>Using your microscope</strong><br>
Specimens are examined by putting them onto a glass microslide, and covering
them with a thin coverglass. If the specimens are dry and thick, a coverglass
may not be necessary. Details of the best way are given for many specimens,
in the following pages, but in each case the specimen is placed centrally on the
microslide, and then examined by putting the microslide on the stage of the microscope.
The microslide is put with the ends under the stage clips so that it will not move, unless
you wish to move it. When the microscope is focussed correctly, a clear magnified image
of the specimen should be seen.
<p>
<a name="illum">
<strong>Illumination</strong><br>
The specimen will only be seen if the light passing through it, or reflected from it,
travels up the tube of the microscope, to the eyepiece, and into your eye.
<p>
<strong>Illuminating from below</strong><br>
Usually specimens are examined by passing light through them. This light may be
either from a mirror, or from a bulb uder the stage of the microscope. A specimen
must be fairly transparent to be examined in this way, and specimens, or parts 
of specimens, which do not allow light through them, will appear as dark areas 
in the field of the microscope. The mirror may be used to reflect either daylight
or light from a lamp, but in each case it will be necessary when setting up your 
microscope, to move the mirror on its pivots, until the field of the microscope
is evenly illuminated.
<p>
<strong>Illuminating from above</strong><br>
If an object is opaque, and will not allow light to pass through it, the microscopical
details of the surface may be seen by shining light onto the specimen from above. This
may be done by shining light from a torch or lamp, onto the stage of the microscope, or by
allowing sunlight to fall onto the stage. The image seen, will not be as bright as when illuminated
from below, because you will only see the parts which reflect the light, and the field of the 
microscope will appear quite dark. Transparent specimens often also show interesting details
when examined in this way.<br>
This method of illumination should not be used with high magnification objectives.
<p>
<a name="mag">
<strong>The magnification of your microscope</strong><br>
The magnification may be given in a leaflet supplied with your microscope, or may be marked on the microscope
itself. Usually however the eyepieces and the objectives are marked individually with their magnification, or
in the case of objectives, with their focal lengths in fractions of an inch. Total magnification is calculated
by multiplying the magnification of the objective by that of the eyepiece, thus:-
<p>
<pre>
  x4  objective with a x5  eyepiece = x20  Total Magnification.
  x40 objective with a x10 eyepiece = x400 Total Magnification.
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Using different magnifications</strong><br>
Suggested magnifications to be used when examining specimens are given in the following pages, but specimens
should always be examined first under low magnification, followed by higher magnifications. Any interesting
specimen or part of a specimen should be placed centrally in the field of the microscope, by carefully moving
the microslide, and then holding it in this position with the stage clips. A higher magnification can then
be obtained by rotating the nosepiece of the microscope, until a higher magnification objective clicks into
position. With low magnification objectives, the coarse focussing adjustment should be used, and with
a high magnification objective, the fine focussing adjustment is most suitable. If your microscope has only one
focussing adjustment, you will have to be very careful when focussing with a high magnification objective in position.

<strong>Looking at everyday things</strong><br>
In booklet 1 available from NBS, you will find details of the way to use your microscope so that you can find
out more about the microscopy and structure of a number of very common things.
<p>
For each specimen you will find details of the apparatus which you will require, details of of the simple
preparation which is necessary before specimens can be examined under the microscope, and also descriptions 
of what you will see. Drawings have not been included, but a plain margin has been left at the side of each
page, so that you can make your own drawings and notes on what you have seen. All the preparations described
in this booklet are temporary ones, and after they have been examined, the microslides and coverglasses should
be cleaned and washed in detergent solution, so that they may be used again. Details of the ways to make 
permanent mounts are contained in later booklets in this series.

<P>
The problem is that most people don't even realise that microscopy is itself an amateur
science study area. Maybe you would like to help change that?
<P>
Why not lift the following 4 pages from our site and place them on your one. All that we ask
is that you don't change their content, except of course to add the appropriate links so your own readers
can flick back to your own internal index.html or contents page. If you load all 4 pages then you can also 
remove the explicit part of the URL which links the four pages together at our site, so they link together
and cross reference each other locally on your site: speeds up the loading.
<P>
All the pages have explicit links to pick up the images direct from our site. Please leave these in.
If you want to grab the pictures and load the whole article complete with images locally to speed up
access by your readers, please <a href="mailto:mol@molcol.demon.co.uk">drop me a note</A> letting me know

<strong>The keys of creation</strong><BR>
Worlds within worlds, life within life! Our view <img src="../images/spid1.gif" width=246 height=183 border=1 align=right> into the universe is limited
only by our vision, our curiosity and the tools at our disposal. Right now modern technology 
is piercing the veil that obscures our probing, collective, mind from the secrets 
around us buried below the micro level. 
<P>
For most people, such technology is too expensive to employ but an ordinary microscope,
costing less than 100 UK pounds is affordable to all, and can plunge us deep into 
the heart of organic matter. Today, any man, woman, or child, can take a long hard look
at the microscopic beauty other living things. <img src="../../prodir/brunel/brun1i1.gif" width=101 height=148 border=1 align=left>It takes about 30 minutes to learn how to use a 
microscope properly, quicker than the time it takes for most people to get to grips
with a video recorder.
<P>
<br>
<strong>Is Amateur Microscopy significant?</strong><br>
One hundred years ago, Amateur Microscopy was the 'thrill' of middle-class Victorian
England. With the advent of modern technology, in particular - radio, television, cinema,
photography, computers, and video - interest in this area has declined to a point where
more people in the UK now spend their time knitting than practising Amateur Microscopy.
<p>
But public interest is slowly growing again. The very inventions which brought about the decline of this
area of amateur science, are now the very things driving a resurgence of common interest. We, as a species, have lived through the critical years
of 'atomic awareness'; a time where a single discovery offered a cheap source of energy or a terrible 
extinction. Our skills advance rapidly! We are poised on the brink of a new era. It has yet to receive 
a familiar title, but for now, we can call it -  the </FONT>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="RED">D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="BLUE">awn of the </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="RED">N</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="BLUE">ew </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="RED">A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="BLUE">ge... 
or just simply: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="RED">DNA!</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="BLUE">
<p>
On offer are cures for cancer, aids, illness, ageing... death! As with any new-found skill, dangers as equal to
the potential benefits, lurk sinisterly in the background: <strong><em>extinction, mutation... abuse!</em></strong>
<P>
In all areas of science, we are looking increasingly more at the tiniest of things in our quest to bring about
<img src="../images/size1.gif" width=192 height=162 align=right border=0 vspace=12>the most significant advances: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="RED">Nano-technology for machines, fractal technology
for computer data compression, quantum mechanics to understand the exotic and elegant primary laws which
govern the very existence of everything we call our Universe!</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="BLUE">
<P>
There has never been a more apt moment or significant time for people the world over to introduce themselves 'gently' to this
brave new world through the practice and interest of amateur microscopy: <strong><em>it is a way to begin to glimpse
just what secrets are waiting to be discovered!</em></strong>
<P>
<br>
<strong>Re-discovering our world!</strong><BR>
Humankind may well be taking its first faltering steps towards exploring other
worlds, yet most of us have never really looked at this one.
To gently lift any tiny sample from the planet's surface, 
and then to examine it in fine detail, brings the observer one dramatic step closer to 
appreciating their own awareness and place in the Universe. 
<P>
It is fair to say that of the entire population of the planet at this time, <strong><EM>none</EM></strong>
of us are ever likely to walk across the surface of another world. Microscopy is a means
to an end whereby everyone alive now can tale a remarkable journey, both in mind and spirit, to 
alien environments - and observe billions of forms so different to our own human composition -
that the mind is stunned by the possible variations.
<P>
One day, many of our off-spring will leap out towards the stars. Among their number will
more microscopist-biologists than representatives from any other profession. Amateur Microscopy is the long-forgotten 
interest now being re-kindled to prepare our future generations to take on
the most staggering opportunity ever likely to arise for our species.
<P>
<BR>
<strong>Eons of engineering design and improvement</strong><BR>
<img src="../images/8xeye_8.jpg" width=254 height=244 align=left border=1>
We spend billions of dollars designing, testing, and improving machines, systems,
and other artifacts affording technological benefits. Each time something is invented we waste the learning
experience already gained by Nature through its similar aim to create and maintain living
forms against a multitude of different problems. Just a few hours studying processes, 
inherent in living forms - already proven and tested in design - could save years of effort 're-inventing the wheel'.
<P>
Want to design flying machines? Then look how Nature did it. Want to build efficient
energy reservoirs? Look at any living cell! Wish to irrigate arable land at minimum cost?
Take a look at the vein structure of a leaf! Want to wage mindless war and confuse enemy detection systems?
Go look at a Mosquito eye, or a moth wing!
<P>
Whatever we wish to do... it's been done cheaper, better, and far more elegantly already down
at the microscopical level.
<P>
<br>
<strong>Microscopy for ordinary humans</strong><br>
Many of us may not be budding scientists nor be interested in what science has to offer! We live in
an age so full of scientific thinking and application, that many people feel we have lost the balance afforded
by looking at ourselves and our world through different perceptions! Art, music, philosophy,
religion, are also important 'filters' to use when understanding reality.
<img src="http://www.diwalk.demon.co.uk/walk/wild9f6.jpg" width=120 height=124 align=right border=1>Amateur Microscopy opens up a new vision of colour, imagery, 
and philosophical comprehension about life in all of its inherent richness. 
<p>
A walk in the country, a moment near a tranquil pond, a stroll along a sandy beach become moments 
where small treasures can be sought, captured, and taken away for a closer look and further enrichment
of the original experience.
<p>
<BR>
<strong>Microscopy for children</strong><br>
Like any wisdom from a by-gone age such as that for stone-cutting, roof-thatching, and 
steam-engineering, Amateur Microscopical know-how has fallen into the hands of a vital few -
who like majestic, noble, monks - preserve the 'knowledge and techniques'. With such
practices, comes 'mystic' and often personal coveting of wisdom for its own sake.
Personal awe and respect for what this knowledge and skill has to offer gain lead some people
into arrogance and selfishness.
<p>
Buy a kid today a microscope, and it's a five minute wonder without the help and support
of those who know how to use it and know how to prepare the things to be studied prperly; <strong><em>some of life's little wonders
are not so readily seen without a tip here and a hint there!</em></strong>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Microscopy-UK</strong><br>
Well, that's where we come in! It is our absolute declared objective to offer help, guidance,
know-how, support, assistance, and advice to anyone in the world, irrespective of age, sex, colour, or creed!
<p>
We know how! <a href="whymic2b.html">And we will show you everything we know!</A>

<CENTER><h3>ROTIFERS  AND  HOW  TO  FIND  THEM  <BR>by  Roy  Winsby</h3></CENTER>

<p>
<CENTER><h4>From Manchester Microscopical Society's Newsletter No. 18</h4></CENTER>


<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/julimg1.jpg"></CENTER><BR><BR>
  
Rotifers are microscopic animals of varying sizes, shapes and 
colours.   They measure up to 2mm in length, though few exceed 0.5mm, 
and are recognisable by their single, double or sometimes multiple 
crown-like corona of cilia which appear to rotate, and which is how they 
derive their name, i.e. from Rota, Latin for wheel. Though they are 
generally the size of the protozoa, the single celled animals, they are 
multi- celled and so form part of the metazoa, being one of the five main 
classes of round worms.   Worldwide there are around 2,000 species, of 
which there are over 500 in Britain, with a great variety of body 
forms.

<p>

  They are found in freshwater lakes and ponds (where they are 
particularly abundant), in puddles, in
brackish water and, to a lesser extent, in salt water and can be free 
swimming or sessile, that is attached by
the foot to plant stems, debris, etc.  They are also found in damp soil, 
in damp moss, and in fact in any place
where there is even only a little water, particularly in house or garage 
rainwater gutters that tend to hold
some water for a time before it evaporates, where in their dried-up 
state, like most water living micro
organisms, they can survive being baked during long hot and dry summers, 
quickly resuming their full lives
when damp or wet conditions return. The bodies of many species of 
rotifers are transparent and in their
living state you can see their internal organs.  After death the bodies 
tend to cloud over.  Most rotifers are
females. Males are few and not able to feed, living not more than a few 
days.<p>

   Rotifers were first discovered by Leeuwenhoek some 200 years ago and 
he explained how wonderfully
nature has provided for the preservation of the species by their 
resistance to the drying up of their abodes
and their resulting desiccation until moisture returns again.  He wrote 
We can easily conceive that in all
rainwater which is collected from gutters and in all waters exposed to 
the air, animals may be found, for
they may be carried thither by the particles of dust blown about by the 
winds.<p>

   These fascinating animals are ever so easy to find.  Try taking a 
little of the dried mud or leaf litter found
in house, garage and outhouse gutters, put it in a little water and 
leave for 24 hours.  Place a little on a slide,
cover with a cover slip, and examine with patience.  A magnification of 
x20 is ideal to start, changing up to
around x60 to x100 when you have found a suitable specimen.  You will 
find lots of nematode worms,
paramecium, tardigrades and other minute invertebrate life.  On your 
slide you will be sure to have bits of
debris from the mud in the water and whilst it is easier to find the 
swimming rotifers because of their greater
numbers I found it more interesting to search for and watch at leisure 
the rotifers adhering to this debris.<p>

   Now how to spot the rotifers when they are swimming, because when 
they are swimming they do not
always use their cilia, which are then retracted.  Also a  lot of the 
life you will see swimming around will
also have transparent bodies.  The really fast movers will be 
paramecium.  The rotifers swim in two ways.
Those from the larger areas of water swim with their coronas of cilia 
extruded, rotating as they pull
themselves through the water by means of their cilia. Those that inhabit 
damp earth and waterlogged moss, or in very shallow water and where 
there are lots of bits of debris, such as water from the gutter, swim in
jerky movements called looping, momentarily fixing their foot as a 
temporary anchorage whilst they bend
from head to foot. They straighten out before loosening their 
anchorage, repeating the process so that
they move along at a fair speed in these jerking movements.  Then 
suddenly they straighten out, extruding
their cilia and pull themselves along.   It is hard to keep them not 
only in the field of view but also in focus,
moving rapidly as they do.  You are continually trying to follow them by 
manipulation of the mechanical
stage in both up and down and sideways directions, as well as 
continually adjusting the focus as they change
their level in the minute film of water.  A drop of 10% alcohol solution 
placed at the edge of the cover slip
will gradually be drawn in and absorbed by the water, slowing down the 
animals in the water, eventually
killing them.  A solution of gum or cellulose such as wallpaper paste 
can be put in the water instead of using
alcohol.<p>

   This is why I find the sessile ones much more interesting.  Their 
coronas of cilia are continually beating,
are so easy to see and no slowing down is needed.  Dark ground 
illumination is recommended.  It shows all
the colours and makes everything much more clear by bringing out the 
fine detail which you would not see
under normal bright field illumination.  For my x60 to x100 observation 
I found a disc with a half-inch patch-stop
ideal, with good lighting, the iris diaphragm fully open and the 
condenser racked at its highest.  This is all
very simple and if you are a beginner and not familiar with dark ground 
illumination, ask me for a copy of
the dark ground article which appeared in the Society's Newsletter No. 
12.<p>

   By means of a sticky substance exuded from their single foot (which 
in many species ends in two toes,
sometimes in one long thin toe), rotifers can anchor themselves to any 
solid object, plant stem, stone or
stick, and whilst some species are sessile and spend their adult life 
attached to the one position, with others
it is not always a permanent anchorage because they can take up a 
swimming existence again.  Some can do
this temporarily, spinning a fine thread as does a spider, so they can 
pull themselves back to the anchorage
again.  So if you see a swimming rotifer trailing a long thin thread you 
will understand what it is.  You will
see the anchored ones wafting sideways to and fro in the water as they 
search for the minute life that is their
food.  The continually moving cilia produce circular currents in the 
water, and this you will also see as the
currents move the food supply in reach of the mouth.  Between the mouth 
and the stomach is the mastax, the
most conspicuous organ seen in the upper part of the transparent body, 
containing hard pointed jaws to chop
the food. An inner set of cilia surrounds the entrance to the mouth and 
the rotifers are able to reject anything
that is not in the nature of suitable food.<p>

   The different species feed in three ways, known as the filterers, the 
graspers and the capturers.  The
filterers have already been described, their cilia creating currents in 
the water to bring the food in the region
of the mouth.  The graspers extend the mastax forward into the mouth, 
whilst the capturers form a trap by
the closure of the corona cilia around the prey.  These capturers are 
always sessile.<p>

   The species are tremendously varied. Most rotifers have one eye, some 
have two and some sessile ones
are eyeless.  The bodies of some species have telescopic segments and 
they can expand or retract like a
telescope, whilst others have slight segmentation.  Some have a hardened 
skin, the lorica, and others build
themselves a tube to live in. <p>

   It was reported in the May 1990 Journal of the Worshipful Company of 
Spectacle Makers that their
member Mr. H.J.A. Dartnell was taking part in the 1989-90 Australian 
National Antarctic Research expedition
during which he would be making a study of the rotifers found in 
Antarctic waters. Mr.Dartnell points out
rotifers are survivors par-excellence as some species can survive being 
frozen solid in the Antartic.  Also
that as there are no fish in the freshwater lakes and ponds of the 
Antartic there are no predators to eat the
rotifers and they therefore proliferate in their billions to such an 
extent that they colour the water red.<p>

The Micscape Editor would like to thank Roy Winsby for generously permitting his article to be published on Micscape. The image by Ron Neumeyer is a rotifer of the genus <EM>Philodina</EM> which can be commonly found in bird-baths. This was the July 'Image of the Month', but  it deserved to be permanently on the site, rather appropriately we thought in this article published the following month.<P>

<H1>Micscape Article: The Hunt for Dustmites </H1>

<h3>Dustmites</h3>
They're in your bed! They're in your carpets! They're everywhere!
So claim the many books and references on dustmites. But are they?
<p>
Here at Micscape we thought we would take a look for ourselves. First of all we
took a look at what some of the best books say about these strange inhabitants:-
<p>
<i>
<pre>
     "Up to two million dustmites inhabit the average double bed..."
</pre>
</i>
<p>
Mmm! Do they? I marched into the bedroom, yanked back the covers, plugged in my super
120x Video Camera, high power lights, and scanned the bed. One hour later all I had for my
trouble was loads of video full of fluff! Maybe, I'm getting something wrong. Back to the books:-
<i>
<pre>
     "... many experience their whole lives under a single 
          mattress stud... "
</pre>
</i>
Ah! That's what I 'm doing wrong. Back to the bed. Several missing studs later - no dustmites!
<p>
<b>The Vacuum Cleaner</b><br>
I remembered reading in a newspaper how the average hoover was full of dustmites, picked up from
the carpet. I emptied our one on some newspaper and carefully trawled through wadges of dirt, dust, and 
fibres. Again nothing! What could I do? I had dedicated the afternoon to getting some pictures to show 
you of these awesome beasts and hours into a session I had nothing to show. Then I had an idea: phone Andrew!
<p>
This is one guy who's going to know where the hell they are in my house. 
<p>
Andrew confirmed my worst fears: "Yup", he said. "I had the same problem. In the end I asked a few 
relatives to send me the contents of their vacuum cleaners". Now here is a man after my own heart, I thought!
<p>
"But did you find any?", I begged him.
<p>
"Sure... after about the third or fourth bag. I'll send you some if you like. I started a few cultures which seem to 
be doing nicely."
<p>
And send them he did. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="../images/dustm1.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 vspace=4 ALIGN=left>



I never realised, until I looked for myself, how really small these creatures are. The images here were the first
ones I took at <b>120x</b> magnification.
<IMG SRC="../images/dustm2.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=right>
 I still haven't had the time to isolate one for proper study under the 'scope' 
but I have at least kept the culture going. These little creatures really shift. I had been under the impression they just lumbered
around blindly, but they are fast, know what they want - and getting out of the light seems to be way up on their list of 
priorities!
<p>
Andrew Syred came to my rescue and sent me a nice SEM image to show you. It was about this time we discussed a little experiment
where we could combine his skills on SEM techniques and mine on software and imaging methods to create something new and different.
The results were quite stunning. If you would like to see what we did, then <a href="../../amateurs/mainmovi.html">Download the Feb.96 Movie</A>
and see a real dustmite in a spin!
<p>
<b>The Asthma Connection?</b><br>
Dustmites are relatives of spiders. They have recently been blamed for causing asthma attacks through allergic reaction the build-up of
dust left over from their rotted carcasses. <i> I have my doubts about this since my wife suffers from asthma attacks yet todate, I have still
not found any dustmites in my house.</i> Perhaps, if you are an amateur microscopist, you can have a look at debris in your hoover and see if you 
find any. I would be interested to hear how many of you actually find any. If you have a microscope and the photographic or video equipment 
required, why not send us an image? We will publish some of the best received for all to see in future issues. And don't forget to look under the 
mattress!
<p>
It is reputed that you get most dustmites where people are sexually active in bed. Apparently, where couples <i>thrash</i> around energetically in bed,
they lose the most dead skin cells. These fall as a dust storm onto the sheets and through the fibres onto the mattress beneath, providing a 
plentiful supply of food to the waiting armies of dustmites. So, if you send us any images, maybe you wan't to hold back on us publishing your 
name and address!
<p>

Before I wish you happy hunting, I'll leave you with the image that Andrew sent to me of a dustmite.
<IMG SRC="../images/dustm3.gif"  ALT="" hspace=8 ALIGN=right>
This has been taken with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
and you are not going to get this sort of result with an optical instrument. However, I do have some software here which I have created which might help us 
get close. I am currently experimenting with it to see how useful it might be. One thing about the Internet and modern technology is that it allows us to 
work together even though we are remote from each other. Now here's a chance to 'kill two dustmites with one scope' <i>(if you will excuse the abuse of an old saying)</i>.
If you find a dustmite and manage to get it under the old scope, try taking several pictures of it (photo, 35mm slide, or video still), at different degrees of focus. 
Make sure the mite is central in the circle of light, and don't move it's postion when you refocus. Try to take 2 to 4 shots at the same magnification level and at the same
level of light. Send me the images on video tape (VHS) or as photos, or as digital pictures on disk (PCX, TIF, GIF, JPG) and I'll try the software out to rebuild a single image from your 'slices'.
<p>
We will publish the results and see what happens! If you have the time, the equipment, and the inclination but you don't have the dustmites, drop me a line and I'll
split my culture with you and send you some mites! <b> My address and email are:-</b>

<IMG SRC="../images/mac3.gif" hspace=8 align=right >
John McArthur, a distinguished son of Scotland, died on 26th. April this year aged 94.
With his passing many of us lost a friend and colleague and the whole world lost a great
medical scientist who contributed so much to many fields of endeavour. Microscopy
particularly owes him a debt. His inventive abilities led to the development of the portable
microscope that was to bear his name, a revolutionary instrument incorporating the most
radical innovation in microscopic design since Galileo.<P>

 The prototype of his unique
pocket instrument was conceived  during his medical studies at a time when he
simultaneously fell in love and failed his final examinations in consequence of which he
was "banished" to South America by his father ( in those days things like that were not
uncommon ! ). There the need for a portable and low cost instrument became apparent to
him. He returned to England, married his sweetheart and qualified as a doctor going on to
develop "the McArthur". The prototype was eventually  developed into a fully professional
instrument from the original, made during his time as a medical student, which he carved
from a block of wood and fitted with an objective, an eyepiece and a couple of scrap
second hand prisms. In its developed form both before and after WWII the  McArthur was
to prove invaluable for use in difficult situations and on expeditions where lightness of
weight was important and many discoveries and diagnoses in all kinds of situations and
terrains were to result from its availability and ease of setting up.<P>

In the Post War Years following the establishment of the Open University where there
was a desperate need for a low cost lightweight microscope for its Biology courses
permission was given for quantities of the  instrument to be produced  in plastic where it
proved a boon to students both in the rarer three objective as well as the two objective
model. In later years many of these plastic instruments were to find their into the hands of
amateur microscopists where they provided a low cost means of access to microscopy or
a light weight additional instrument for holiday and field use being a source of great
pleasure as well as an aid to field studies. He received a Design Council Award for this
instrument as a recognition of his work.<P>

John McArthur  was keenly interested in the use of his microscope  by  amateurs as well
as  professionals and was very supportive of their endeavours but few of them knew the
romantic background to the early history surrounding the development of the McArthur
until some 20 years ago when I persuaded him to "tell all" during a stay with me for a
meeting I had arranged of  "the Sorby",  a society named for another distinguished
English microscopist. Sadly John fell ill with influenza and was unable to travel but such
was his commitment and wish to avoid disappointment that he made a cassette tape
where it is believed that he for the first time revealed publicly the romantic aspects of the
story as well as his wartime ordeals. The audience listened enthralled !<P>

John was equally well known in medical and scientific circles as a malariologist of
distinction who made major contributions to the discipline from the time of his first
specialisation in Borneo in 1938 until the war and again after his release from Japanese
captivity with his wife and child in 1945. Through his research he developed an eco
friendly method of malaria control which though proven effective for use in his area of the
Far East was not taken up by WHO officials who preferred the massive use of DDT as an
alternative. He quite rightly remained bitterly disappointed by this being supported in his
views by those who were instinctively concerned for the environmental consequences of
the DDT approach.<P>

John McArthur made many contributions to science and the welfare of mankind for which
he was never given the full honours he deserved though his true genius may well yet be
recognised by future generations. What is certain is that his name will be ever
remembered through his microscope as his memory will be by those who had the
privilege of knowing him.<P>

             'This beautiful desmid is a distinctly "Western type"  and is more 
          frequent in the plankton than other situations, often occurring in 
          abundance'   West & Carter (1923).  I have only ever found a few cells of 
          this very attractive single celled freshwater plant. All from three sites 
          in Sutherland, Scotland.<P>
          
      <IMG SRC="../images/ellsr1.gif" align=left hspace=6>
       The specimen figured is <EM>Staurastrum brasiliense</EM> var. <EM>lundellii</EM> 
          W.&.G.S.West 1896. This is usually five angled <STRONG>rarely six</STRONG>  (In British 
          waters).  The type <EM>Staurastrum brasiliense</EM> Nordst 1869, which is usually 
          four angled, sometimes five, and only a little more than half the size of 
          the variety <EM>lundellii</EM>,  was not recorded from the British Isles by 
          W.&.G.S.West and is not in The British Check-List (1991). The above 
          described as a variety by West & Carter is in the list as a 'facies'. The 
          species cannot possibly be confused with any other ( that's how I like 'em 
          ). All the specimens from Scotland the five & six angled have <STRONG>straight </STRONG>
          spines, the centre ones at each angle being slightly longer than figured by 
          West & Carter, they were out of focus in my drawing at (a) and are 
          indicated by dotted lines, side view (b) and detail shown at (c). Lind & Brook 
          (1980) show the Lake District specimen with the shorter straight centre 
          spine, and the two <STRONG>outer spines at each angle are shown slightly curved</STRONG>. <P>

<H3>Micscape Article: Wasp Warriors - The Wasp Sting.</H3>
<h4> by Maurice Smith. </h4>
</center>
<P>Wasps - warriors of the air, and feared by all. What is it about these tiny creatures that causes even the bravest
adult to run around the garden as though chased by a lion... the wasp sting!
<p>
<B>Evolved mechanism</B><BR>
Wasps are predators. Along with ants, bees, and some other insects they belong to the order called Hymenoptera; sub-order - Apocrita.
There are two sections within this sub-order: Parasitica and the Aculeata, with wasps belonging to the latter. The stinging mechanism
has evolved from the ovipositor which, although used by many other insects for egg-laying, is now redundant for this function in the wasp.
A good point to remember is that as the stinging mechanism actually evolved from the female egg-laying organ, it is only the females of wasps and bees
which actually sting. (Small consolation though because you are most unlikely to meet a male of either these two insect groups).
<p>
<I>Anyone who has seen the famous film called Aliens will have witnessed the Alien queen laying eggs from her giant ovipositor.</I>
<p>
An ovipositor can be described simply as a complex sheathed tube designed for piercing the ground, plant tissue, or the bodies of other insects 
or animals, the egg being passed down the inside of the tube and into the host. With this in mind, it is easier to understand how the stinging
mechanism has been formed by adaptation from this original organ.
<p>
<B>Housing and protection</B><br>
The wasp sting is housed in the abdomen (the rear of the insect). It consists of a poison sac attached to a set of components termed the lancets
and stylus; a set of muscles also form part of the complete apparatus. Normally, no part of the mechanism is visible as it is protected within the

<IMG SRC="../images/a2f1.gif"  ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=RIGHT>

abdomen casing. When the wasp goes to sting its victim, the two halves of the abdomen casing open slightly to allow projection of the lancets and
stylet. In <B>Fig 1</B> you can see the two sides of the abdomen <B>A</B> and <B>B</B> opening either side of the dashed line. The piercing components
of the stinging apparatus are just emerging from the abdomen.
<p>
Whilst observing and filming this moment, the projected lancets were seen to sweep in an arc to and fro along the slit of the open abdomen. The direction 
and movement is indicated by the heavy black line <b>C</b>.
<p>

<b>The fatal stab</b><br>
The wasp does not really carry out a 'stabbing' action when stinging. Instead, the shaft is thrust into the victim and the lancets
move rapidly backwards and forwards (sliding along the stylet) in a sawing action. The lancets are barbed - that is, they have small
backward-pointed hooks along their edges.
<IMG SRC="../images/a2f2.gif"  ALT="" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=left>
 As the shaft penetrates further into the victim's body, the barbs allow anchorage against
the flesh until the alternate lancet moves forward and 'claws' the shaft deeper into the wound. The movement of the lancets also enables
a pumping action to take place at the abdomen end of the shaft. This causes the poison sac to pump venom down through a central poison canal,
between the lancets and out through the shaft tip into the wound.
The two lancets of the shaft are clearly visible in <B>Fig. 2</B>. Both Bees and Wasps sting their victims using a similar process but there 
is an essential difference, especially important when the victim being stung is a human-being. Bee lancets have larger barbs than wasps. The bee
is unable to rip the shaft back out through the wound due to the barbs' resistance against the firmness of human flesh. The wasp stinging apparatus
has lancets with very small barbs, more like fine serrated edges. A wasp can extract the shaft and fly happily off contented with having executed 
a nasty attack (or is it defence?) on the hapless human, whilst the poor old bee ends up having the entire stinging apparatus, poison sac and all, 
wrenched out of its abdomen. The bee will later die due to the damage caused.
<p>
<B>Poison</B><br>
The exact composition of wasp (and bee) venom is not known. It is a complicated chemical cocktail which contains enzymes and proteins as well as
other things. It is rare for a healthy human adult to suffer death from a single wasp sting, although some individuals may be over-sensitive to
the contents of the venom. In such cases, the victim may have an allergic-type reaction, go into shock, and may die as a consequence. 
Antihistamine solutions are used effectively in these cases and can reduce pain and discomfort and prevent death if used quickly enough. 
There is no known antidote to the wasp venom but, apart from a painful experience, most humans should not suffer too badly if stung.
The best way of reducing pain and minimising the consequences of a <b>bee sting</B> is to carefully, and quickly, remove the shaft from the skin using your
fingernail to lift it out - being careful to draw it back in the direction and angle of insertion to avoid breaking the shaft. It is important 
to try and remove the shaft in one piece so as not to leave part of it embedded in the wound, which can cause infection.
<p>
<b>Observations</B><br>
The images above were taken using a JVC camcorder - The GRM7 PRO, which has a special lens attachment to enable magnification of up to 110x.
The wasp studied was a German Wasp (common name) - Vespula germanica(Fabr.) found in Southern England.
A good way of observing insects without killing them is to place them into the freezer or ice-making compartment of a refrigerator for a few
minutes. The rapid reduction of temperature will cause them to become immobile for a short period. They can then be removed and studied under a 
low power microscope or magnifier. Be aware that this time may not be long if you are filming them and using hot lights for illumination.
If you leave them too long in the 'fridge' they will die. The best way to know how long is by experiment, starting with short times and gradually
increasing the length when you have timed their recovery at room or working environment temperatures.

<center><h1>Stomata</h1></center>
<img src="stomata.gif" align=left >
Two stomata can be seen, one on either surface of this leaf section. Stomata are 
really plant pores which enable gas exchanges to take place, and water vapour to be
lost. This has the benefit of moving water up the plant in a process
called <em>transpiration</em>.
<p>
The stoma (singular) can be seen in fine detail here surrounded by <strong>guard cells-{1}.</strong>
<p>
The pore  <strong>-{2}</strong> and the guard cells make up a single <em>stoma</em>. There may be as many
as 6 million per typical leaf! The area just inside the internal structure of the leaf and below
the stoma is the air space <strong>-{3}</strong> which brings carbon dioxide very close to the palisade
parenchyma tissue; so diffusion gradients are maintained over the small distances between stomata and
palisade parenchyma.

<br>
<br>
<img src="stomab.gif" align=left border=1 >



This is a much higher magnification of a stoma taken through an ordinary
optical microscope. You can clearly see the open pore and the guard cells
either side of the gap. Remember that you are looking at a section cut down through
the leaf. Stomata should also be viewed by looking at a leaf surface under a microscope
from above. This will help you understand the true shape and structure of stomata.

Soros, widely <A HREF="/news/jto/Show_News.qry?News_uid=9967">criticized</A> for his challenge to current drug policy, believes that "criminalizing drug abuse does more harm than good, blocking effective treatment and incarcerating far too many people."</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="-1">A previously unpublished federal study concluded that THC, the main ingredient in marijuana, <A HREF="/news/jto/Show_News.qry?News_uid=9944">does not cause cancer when injected</A> in laboratory animals. The findings call into question  the government's contention that marijuana is carcinogenic. Also, in an editorial, <A HREF="http://www.nejm.org/publicM/1997/0336/0005/0366/1.htm">"Federal Foolishness and Marijuana"</A>, the New England Journal of Medicine calls on the government to reclassify marijuana so it can be used for medical purposes.

<IMG SRC="/gif/new.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"><B><A HREF="tx&crime/intro.html">Providing Substance Abuse Treatment Reduces Crime</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Addiction is at the heart of much of the crime that plagues our neighborhoods.  Yet state prisons treat only 13.5 percent of offenders with substance abuse problems. Thus, most offenders who need addiction treatment don't receive it and are released from prison back to the community -- still using, still dealing -- to commit further crimes.  This action kit shows how you can  educate residents and the media in your community about the need to join together to provide treatment -- both in prison and out -- for offenders who abuse alcohol and drugs.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>




<B><A HREF="Alcohol/Alcohol_Index.html">Holiday Drinking and
Driving</A></B>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol-related crashes are a leading cause of death for young people in
the United States. This holiday season we should take the opportunity to
educate people in our communities about this fact and encourage them to
support prevention efforts to make our roads safer.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>


<B><A
HREF="reality/intro.html">Reality Check: Helping Parents Talk to Kids
About Marijuana</A></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="/gif/reality.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="40" BORDER="0"><FONT SIZE="-1">Join Together partners with the <A HREF="http://www.health.org">Center
for Substance Abuse Prevention</A> to bring you CSAP's Reality Check
campaign. Young people are constantly bombarded with conflicting
messages from music, films and television. By informing and educating
adults about the issues that influence marijuana use, they will in turn
be better able to provide young people with information that will help
them make better choices.</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A HREF="inhalants/Inhalant_Index.html">Inhalant Abuse</A></B>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and cocaine. But today, the new drugs of choice for some kids are common -- but often deadly -- household substances such as white out, glue and paint. This Hot Issue Action Kit focuses on this rising problem. We suggest you use this material to raise public awareness in March, which is National Inhalant Awareness Month.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT> 


<B><A HREF="Prevention/Prevention_Index.html">Prevention
Works!</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Across the country community groups are making great strides in preventing alcohol and drug abuse and the related problems that result. But despite these successes, more remains to be done. In fact, two recent studies suggest that some of the gains we have made in reducing substance abuse are beginning to lessen. This means that we must strengthen the message that prevention works and encourage all sectors of society to join in community-wide efforts.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="TxWorks/TxWorks_Index.html">Treatment Works &amp; We Can
Prove It</A></B>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>Several recent credible studies have found that providing substance abuse treatment is a cost-effective investment for communities.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>


<B><A HREF="DomesticViolence/DV_Index.html">Domestic Violence and
Substance
Abuse</A></B>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>Much national attention is focused on domestic violence these days. Many women who have silently suffered batterings by their mates are now beginning to speak out about their ordeals and encouraging others to do the same. What has not gotten as much media attention, however, is the fact that up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases can be linked to alcohol or drug abuse. You can help to get this message out. With the material provided in this kit, you can help reporters understand the connection between domestic violence and substance abuse and to realize how providing substance abuse treatment under health care reform is an essential step in reducing domestic violence.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT> 

<B><A HREF="Marijuana/Marijuana_Index.html">Increase in Marijuana Use
Among Young People</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Marijuana use is on the rise among teenagers across the country. Several recent studies have alerted us to this worrisome fact. Also cause for concern is the fact that anti-drug attitudes among young people are declining. Many high school students associate less danger with smoking marijuana today than their counterparts did several years ago. These findings are especially alarming since the use of marijuana--the most widely used drug--often leads to the use of other, more dangerous drugs.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="Homeless/Homeless_Index.html">Homelessness and Substance
Abuse</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Today, more than seven million people in the United States live on the streets or in shelters because they do not have a home. And nearly half of homeless people suffer from alcohol or drug addictions. These men and women live in our communities. You can help to reduce homelessness by making sure that all Americans have access to the health care they need -- including adequate substance abuse services.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="HIV/HIV_Index.html">HIV-Infection and Substance
Abuse</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">You probably know someone who is HIV-positive -- one in every 250 people in the United States has contracted this virus that ultimately leads to AIDS. This virus affects about one million people nationwide. And a number of men and women with HIV-infection have substance abuse problems that put them at risk for HIV -- either by injecting drugs or having unprotected sex. You can help many more people from becoming a statistic by making sure that all Americans have access to the health care they need including adequate substance abuse services.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="Elderly/Elderly_Index.html">Substance Abuse and Older
Americans</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Many people think of substance abuse as a problem that affects only young people. However, many older people also suffer from alcohol and drug addictions. In fact, senior citizens consume a disproportionate amount of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and have a higher risk of becoming dependent on these substances. And some older people drink heavily because they are lonely or bored. It is important that we recognize the dangers of substance abuse among older Americans and offer help to those who need it.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="National_Survey/into.html">Using the 1995 National Survey of Communities</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Join Together's third national survey of community anti-substance abuse efforts, conducted July through October, 1995, alerts us to the disturbing fact that sustance abuse problems continue to rise in many communities across the country. With the final version of the survey due in December, this action kit will give you a head-start on using these national findings to raise public awareness about substance abuse problems in your community.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="Tobacco/Tobacco_Index.html">Youth Access to Tobacco
</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Although it is illegal in all states to sell cigarettes to anyone under 18-years-old, kids have easy access to tobacco products. Each day, three thousand youngsters in the United States become regular smokers. On an annual basis, this is about one million youth. And despite our efforts to get the message out that smoking is hazardous to kids' health, the fact is that tobacco use by kids continues to rise. In the past three years, smoking among eighth graders has increased by 30 percent. This finding sends a warning bell that we must reinvigorate our efforts to keep kids from using tobacco products.<BR> The <A HREF="Tobacco/Survey_Results.html">results</A> from our nationwide survey are available now.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="Binge/Binge_Index.html">Binge Drinking on College
Campuses</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="Binge/beer.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="50"
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0"><FONT SIZE="-1">As college students head back to school, many of them will be affected by a serious problem: binge drinking. Today, nearly half of all college students binge drink. This drinking leads to a number of problems on campuses, such as violence, rapes, sexually-transmitted diseases and suicides. And even though it is illegal for anyone under 21 to consume alcohol, many minors getting served anyway. This is a pervasive problem not only for college communities but for our nation's future leadership.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A HREF="/JTO/issues/Awaremonth/month.html">April: Alcohol Awareness
Month</A></B>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>Sponsored by the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc. (NCADD) since 1987, this month-long campaign encourages local communities to take a closer look at how drinking -- America's number one drug problem -- affects young people.

States, local government and private funding sources add at least $2.6 billion more, the GAO estimates.<br><br>The report, "Drug and Alcohol Abuse: Billions Spent Annually for Treatment and Prevention Activities (GAO/HEHS-97-12), released in October 1996, found that the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (Ed), and Veterans Affairs (VA) provided 83 percent of total federal funding for treatment and prevention activities for FY 1994. Federal programs targeted specific population groups and provided a wide range of treatment and prevention services, although treatment accounts for most federal expenditures. <br><br>Federal and state spending on treatment and prevention has increased since 1994, so community-based programs probably have access to significantly more funding in 1997 than was reported by the GAO. Also, "The financial information provided by federal, state, and local governments underestimated the total amount spent on drug abuse and prevention services because they did not report all sources of contributions," notes the GAO report. "For example, federal data do not include alcohol-only programs; state and county expenditure data represent only those programs that receive funds from state alcohol and drug abuse agencies; and private sector funding is for treatment services only."<br><br>State, county, and local governments accounted for $1.6 billion for FY 1994, while private funding for substance abuse treatment totaled $1 billion in 1993. The largest source of private funding was third-party payments by health insurers and health maintenance organizations (55 percent of total private funding), followed by client fees (38 percent) and private donations (7 percent), including contributions from foundations. <br><br>Between fiscal year 1990 to 1994, the federal government increased its financial support for treatment and prevention by 60 percent, and state, county, and local governments' funding for treatment and prevention activities increased by 22 percent, the GAO said. "Numerous programs in 16 federal agencies cover a broad range of treatment and prevention services and often target specific populations, such as youths, women, and veterans," according to the GAO. "Generally, treatment services include diagnostic assessment, detoxification, and counseling. Prevention activities usually include providing information and education about alternatives to and consequences of alcohol abuse and illicit drug use."<br><br>While HHS, Ed and the VA account for the bulk of substance abuse funding, the agency that saw the biggest percentage increase between 1990 and 1994 was the Department of Housing and Urban Development, GAO said. "[HUD's] budget authority went from $106.5 million to $315 million -- the bulk of which appeared to be for increases in drug elimination grants that fund drug prevention and control at public and Native American housing developments." The Department of Justice had the highest percentage decrease in the same time period, declining from $133 million to about $98 million. "Although some offices within Justice experienced increases in their budget authority, the Office of Justice Programs' $50 million decrease resulted in Justice's overall decline in funding for substance abuse treatment and prevention activities," the report noted.<br><br>While treatment spending outweighs prevention spending, some federal agencies do both. "One federal program that provides both treatment and prevention services is Head Start, which offers prevention activities for young children and supporting community-based activities for parents and other family members," the GAO reports. "Another example is the Pregnant and Postpartum Women and Infants program. In part, it funds demonstration programs that coordinate and link health promotion and treatment services for substance-using pregnant women and their young children.  The program also supports treatment services in residential settings that permit infants and children to live with their substance-using mothers. Other programs also provide services for specific populations, such as high-risk youth; elementary, secondary, and post-secondary students; and veterans."<br><br>Even some obscure programs fund treatment or prevention, often as part of a non-substance abuse program. "For example," says GAO, "the main objective of the Department of Agriculture's Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is to provide nutritious food and nutrition education to women and children who are considered to be at nutritional risk.  As part of nutrition education, WIC counsels participants about the dangers of substance abuse.  Program participants are also referred to substance abuse counseling, when appropriate." <br><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>02/05/1997</TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><b>Source: </b>Join Together Online</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif" WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle ISMAP><BR><BR></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT> </CENTER></BODY>

The Medical Marijuana Initiative is designed to provide relief for the chronically ill suffering from intense pain, including those with cancer, glaucoma, and AIDS.<br><br>The measure gained the support of 56 percent of the voters, compared to 44 percent who opposed the initiative. Under the guidelines of the initiative, a sick person and their "primary caregiver" could legally possess and grow marijuana for medical use when recommended by a doctor. "This bill was designed for people who use marijuana for legitimate medical purposes, and we intend to see that it is implemented in that manner," said Scott Imler, one of the authors of the measure. In the past, those who have been opposed to Proposition 215 said that legalizing marijuana would give users who have been arrested a legal defense. But Imler said non-medical use of marijuana would still be illegal.<br><br>Imler also mentioned that he expected the controversial initiative to survive in a court of law. Just recently, President Clinton's drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, denounced the proposition as a "hoax" and said the federal government would not hold back on prosecuting doctors who prescribe the drug. <br><br>

"I was denigrated in congressional  hearings chaired by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), and in the New York Times, A.M. Rosenthal went so far as to imply that I represent a new kind of "drug money," Soros noted. "I must reject these accusations. I am not for legalizing hard drugs. I am for a saner drug policy. I am just as concerned about keeping drugs away from my children as any responsible parent. But I firmly believe that the war on drugs is doing more harm to our society than drug abuse itself."<br>     <br>"I have devoted much of my energies and resources over the past two decades to promoting the concept of open society in formerly communist countries. I have  started to pay more attention to my adopted country, the United States, because I feel that the relatively open society we enjoy here is in danger," said Soros. " ... Our drug policies offer a prime example of adverse, unintended consequences. There is perhaps no other field where our public policies have produced an outcome so profoundly at odds with what was intended. But those who are waging a "war on drugs" refuse to recognize this fact. They consider all criticism  subversive. To suggest the possibility that the war on drugs may be self-defeating is tantamount to treason in their eyes. This was confirmed by their reaction to the approval of the drug policy ballot initiatives in <br>California and Arizona."<br><br>"Our first priority should be to discourage children from using drugs. Even marijuana can be harmful to the mental and emotional development of youngsters," wrote Soros. "But demonizing drugs can increase their appeal to adolescents, for whom rebellion is often an important rite of passage to adulthood. And we must be particularly careful not to exaggerate the harmful effects of marijuana because it may undermine the credibility of our warnings about harder drugs."<br>     </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>02/05/1997</TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><b>Source: Join Together Online</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><I>Distributed by <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</I></P>    <P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif"WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle  ISMAP></A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML><!-- 48 tics elapsed -->

The latter provides tremendous opportunity for community-based prevention organizations that learn to market themselves as service providers to local HMOs and other health care companies, according to Michael Stoil, a senior analyst for Conwal Incorporated.<br><br>Conwal recently won a contract from the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services (ODADAS) to develop a marketing plan for community-based prevention programs, including AOD and violence prevention groups. While Stoil could not discuss the Ohio project prior to its unveiling at the <a href="mailto:dcoffice@nasadad.org">NASADAD/NPN</a> Prevention Research Conference (to be held Sept. 7 to Sept. 10 in Philadelphia), he spoke generally with Join Together about the challenges and opportunities facing MCOs and community-based groups that address substance abuse and related issues.<br><br>Stoil sees great potential for alliance between managed care and prevention organizations, because they share similar goals. "Managed care is interested in the same activities that lots of community-based organizations produce," Stoil told Join Together. "But the terminology is going to be different and the perspective is going to be different. The buzzwords are going to be behavioral health care and patient self-management."<br><br>A recent survey found that 40 percent of managed care organizations engage in some form of behavioral health promotion, provided in-house or through a contractor. The most prevalent service offering has been smoking cessation and education, but some MCOs also provide classes in stress management, parenting, and domestic violence prevention. <br><br>MCOs also provide alcohol education and adolescent substance abuse prevention classes. But few community-based prevention groups have been able to achieve the success of the <a href="http://www.jointogether.org/posting/FundingNews.qry?function=detail&FundingNews_Aid=627">Gloucester (Mass.) Prevention Network</a>, which has positioned itself as a key service provider for a local MCO. <br><br>Sometimes, notes Stoil, the MCOs corporate culture and mind-set can hinder such alliances. For example, he notes, California's Kaiser Permanente HMO would seem to be a prime target for marketing by community-based prevention groups, except that Kaiser traditionally has developed its own programs rather than contracting with outsiders. Such barriers can be difficult to overcome, but others are self-created by prevention groups themselves and would be well worth challenging, says Stoil. <br><br>"Probably the single largest barrier to marketing services to MCOs is the fear and loathing of managed care," he says. "We need to recognize that managed care is here to stay, and that most community-based HMOs are getting rid of their objectionable elements."<br><br>"Also, prevention groups have a very difficult time in defining their services and outcomes in terms that managed care companies can understand, and justify funding," Stoil adds. "Programs think that they are prevention agencies, but they're not. Prevention is an outcome. What groups do is community outreach and liaison, counseling and education. These are the things that managed care is interested in.<br><br>"Hopefully these activities will lead to prevention, but you can't prove that," says Stoil.<br><br>Stoil also says that there are very few prevention activities that are specific to alcohol and other drugs, and stresses that substance abuse prevention groups need to position themselves as providers of behavioral health promotion services via a holistic public health approach. "The whole point of managed care is to teach self-management and self-care," he states, "so primary prevention is the same thing that managed care wants.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>We Want to Hear From You!</B><BR>
Our goal is to create an interactive online space where communities around
the United States can find the information and assistance they need to be
more effective in their fight against substance abuse. <BR>
<BR>
As we develop this Web site, we want and need your comments: 

<UL>
<LI>What works?<BR>
<LI>What doesn't? <BR>
<LI>What's missing? <BR>
<LI>What's valuable? 
</UL>

We have created a discussion area for this purpose in the <A HREF="../../conf/login.qry?function%3Dform">Coffee
House</A>. If you prefer to email us, you may direct your comments to <A HREF="mailto:info@jointogether.org">info@jointogether.org</A>.<BR>

<H3>Welcome!</H3>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Like any good Web site, we are always "under construction".
It is our hope
that this Web site develops into a place where communities fighting substance
abuse come to work and interact with each other. To reach this goal, we
need to build this site in cooperation with YOU! <A HREF="comments.html">Let
us know what you think</A>.</FONT>
<BR><BR>



<BR>
<H3>Navigation</H3>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Each page has a graphical Header and Footer. These graphics will let you know
where in the site you are and allow you to click around to navigate. If
you have a slow connection to the Internet, you can still navigate easily with graphic loading in your browser turned off.  The <B><A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A></B> is a tool to easily
see the outline of our site and navigate quickily through different levels.<BR>
</FONT><BR>

<H3>Shortcuts</H3>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Once you're acquainted with Join Together Online, you'll discover the features you'll come back for again and again.  Use the Shortcuts drop-down menu on our home page to quickly access several popular destinations, eliminating the need to enter a certain section of the web site first.</FONT><BR><BR>


</td><td>

<H3>Online Service Access</H3>
<FONT SIZE="-1">To get the fastest access to JTO, or any other Web site, you need a direct, SLIP or PPP-type connection to the Internet from your computer.  Online services not offering this connection only provide indirect Internet access, often producing frustrating delays in retrieving Web pages.
<BR><BR>
America Online, a popular online service, does not presently offer this type of direct Internet connection.  Although you don't get the propietary, organized content of an online service, a SLIP or PPP account with an Internet Service Provider will give you the most efficient access to the Web.  <BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="/gif/new.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>If you need help finding such a provider, consult our online recommendations for <A HREF="/jto/help/best_win.html">Windows </A> and <A HREF="/jto/help/best_mac.html">Macintosh</A> users. Or, see our table of <A HREF="/jto/help/isptable.html">national ISPs</A>.  If you're still stumped, <A HREF="mailto:info@jointogether.org">write us</A> for help.</FONT>

<BR><BR>
<H3>Web Browsers</H3>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Like many other Web publishers, we suggest you use <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape Navigator</A> or <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/msie.htm">Microsoft Internet Explorer</A> to browse our site. These browsers operate easily and efficiently and will allow you the best, most reliable access to Join Together Online. We are designing more and more of our site to comply with Netscape formatting standards, supported in Netscape' browser as well as in Internet Explorer. Both browsers are available for free and may be downloaded from their links above.</FONT><BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Addiction is at the heart of much of the crime that plagues our neighborhoods.  Yet state prisons treat only 13.5 percent of offenders with substance abuse problems. Thus, most offenders who need addiction treatment don't receive it and are released from prison back to the community -- still using, still dealing -- to commit further crimes.  This action kit shows how you can  educate residents and the media in your community about the need to join together to provide treatment -- both in prison and out -- for offenders who abuse alcohol and drugs.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

adults about the issues that influence marijuana use, they will in turn
be better able to provide young people with information that will help
them make better choices.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and cocaine. But today, the new drugs of choice for some kids are common -- but often deadly -- household substances such as white out, glue and paint. This Hot Issue Action Kit focuses on this rising problem. We suggest you use this material to raise public awareness in March, which is National Inhalant Awareness Month.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT> 


<B><A HREF="Prevention/Prevention_Index.html">Prevention
Works!</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Across the country community groups are making great strides in preventing alcohol and drug abuse and the related problems that result. But despite these successes, more remains to be done. In fact, two recent studies suggest that some of the gains we have made in reducing substance abuse are beginning to lessen. This means that we must strengthen the message that prevention works and encourage all sectors of society to join in community-wide efforts.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="TxWorks/TxWorks_Index.html">Treatment Works &amp; We Can

<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>Several recent credible studies have found that providing substance abuse treatment is a cost-effective investment for communities.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>


<B><A HREF="DomesticViolence/DV_Index.html">Domestic Violence and
Substance
Abuse</A></B>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><BLOCKQUOTE>Much national attention is focused on domestic violence these days. Many women who have silently suffered batterings by their mates are now beginning to speak out about their ordeals and encouraging others to do the same. What has not gotten as much media attention, however, is the fact that up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases can be linked to alcohol or drug abuse. You can help to get this message out. With the material provided in this kit, you can help reporters understand the connection between domestic violence and substance abuse and to realize how providing substance abuse treatment under health care reform is an essential step in reducing domestic violence.</BLOCKQUOTE></FONT> 

<B><A HREF="Marijuana/Marijuana_Index.html">Increase in Marijuana Use
Among Young People</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Marijuana use is on the rise among teenagers across the country. Several recent studies have alerted us to this worrisome fact. Also cause for concern is the fact that anti-drug attitudes among young people are declining. Many high school students associate less danger with smoking marijuana today than their counterparts did several years ago. These findings are especially alarming since the use of marijuana--the most widely used drug--often leads to the use of other, more dangerous drugs.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="Homeless/Homeless_Index.html">Homelessness and Substance
Abuse</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Today, more than seven million people in the United States live on the streets or in shelters because they do not have a home. And nearly half of homeless people suffer from alcohol or drug addictions. These men and women live in our communities. You can help to reduce homelessness by making sure that all Americans have access to the health care they need -- including adequate substance abuse services.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="HIV/HIV_Index.html">HIV-Infection and Substance
Abuse</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">You probably know someone who is HIV-positive -- one in every 250 people in the United States has contracted this virus that ultimately leads to AIDS. This virus affects about one million people nationwide. And a number of men and women with HIV-infection have substance abuse problems that put them at risk for HIV -- either by injecting drugs or having unprotected sex. You can help many more people from becoming a statistic by making sure that all Americans have access to the health care they need including adequate substance abuse services.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="Elderly/Elderly_Index.html">Substance Abuse and Older
Americans</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Many people think of substance abuse as a problem that affects only young people. However, many older people also suffer from alcohol and drug addictions. In fact, senior citizens consume a disproportionate amount of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and have a higher risk of becoming dependent on these substances. And some older people drink heavily because they are lonely or bored. It is important that we recognize the dangers of substance abuse among older Americans and offer help to those who need it.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B><A HREF="National_Survey/into.html">Using the 1995 National Survey of Communities</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Join Together's third national survey of community anti-substance abuse efforts, conducted July through October, 1995, alerts us to the disturbing fact that sustance abuse problems continue to rise in many communities across the country. With the final version of the survey due in December, this action kit will give you a head-start on using these national findings to raise public awareness about substance abuse problems in your community.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

</A></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">Although it is illegal in all states to sell cigarettes to anyone under 18-years-old, kids have easy access to tobacco products. Each day, three thousand youngsters in the United States become regular smokers. On an annual basis, this is about one million youth. And despite our efforts to get the message out that smoking is hazardous to kids' health, the fact is that tobacco use by kids continues to rise. In the past three years, smoking among eighth graders has increased by 30 percent. This finding sends a warning bell that we must reinvigorate our efforts to keep kids from using tobacco products.<BR> The <A HREF="Tobacco/Survey_Results.html">results</A> from our nationwide survey are available now.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

This drinking leads to a number of problems on campuses, such as violence, rapes, sexually-transmitted diseases and suicides. And even though it is illegal for anyone under 21 to consume alcohol, many minors getting served anyway.

<H2><CENTER>Providing Substance Abuse Treatment Reduces Crime</CENTER>
</H2>



Addiction is at the heart of much of the crime that plagues our neighborhoods. Did you know that 60 to 70 percent of state prisoners have a history of substance use or abuse? Yet state prisons treat only 13.5 percent of these offenders. Thus, most offenders who need addiction treatment don't receive it and are released from prison back to the community -- still using, still dealing -- to commit further crimes and threaten our well-being and that of our children. <BR><BR>

That's why it is crucial that our communities provide treatment for offenders who need it. The nation's new drug czar General Barry McCaffrey, recently recognized this fact. <B>"We are not going to solve the nations crime problems by putting another million in jail"</B>, he said when he released the 1996 new drug strategy in early May. In fact, one of the five points in the 10-year strategy is to provide alcohol and drug treatment for prisoners with addictions. <BR><BR>

This goal collaborates with the recommendations of a recent Join Together policy panel that spent the past year examining how the criminal justice system deals with substance abuse. The panel's report, <A HREF="/JTO/policy/panels/cj/title.html">Fixing a Failing System</A>, recommends that police, courts, probation officers, treatment providers, and community groups work together to ensure that treatment and follow-up care are accessible for offenders with addictions. <BR><BR>

This latest Hot Issue Action Kit shows how you can use the panel's findings to educate residents and the media in your community about the need to join together to provide treatment -- both in prison and out -- for offenders who abuse alcohol and drugs. By partnering with the courts, probation and parole to make adequate treatment available, communities can reduce some of the related crime -- like assaults, burglaries, drug dealing, and drunk driving crashes that occur in our communities. <BR><BR>

While this panel focused its work on the adult population, you may want to also make the case for substance abuse treatment for juvenile offenders with addictions in your community. Many different sectors can join together around this problem and help devise effective alternatives to treat addictions and keep kids out of jail.<BR><BR>

<center><H2>Drinking and Driving</H2></center>


Alcohol-related crashes are a leading cause of death for young people in the United States. This holiday season we should take the opportunity to educate people in our communities about this fact and encourage them to support prevention efforts to make our roads safer. To help you make this point, we have enclosed the following information, adapted from material provided by the National 3D Prevention Month Coalition and the <A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</A>:


<UL>
<LI>a <A HREF="Alcohol_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> that illustrates the extent of drunk driving nationwide and shows the costs of alcohol-related car crashes;
<LI><A HREF="Alcohol_Myths.html">Myths and Truths</A> about alcohol and its effects on driving;
<LI>a <A HREF="Alcohol_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> you can revise and send to your local newspaper;
<LI>a <A HREF="Alcohol_Pitch.html">Cover Letter</A> to include with your Op-Ed;
<LI><A HREF="Alcohol_NoEtOH.html">Non-Alcoholic Drink Recipes</A> you can ask your local newspaper to run in an effort to encourage people to host safe parties this holiday season.  
</UL>


<P><H3>HOW TO USE THIS KIT:</H3>


<OL>
	<LI>Use the <A HREF="Alcohol_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> to illustrate the problem of drunk driving nationwide and to show the cost of alcohol-related car crashes on society. You can also use these facts to make the case that preventing alcohol abuse can save lives in your community.


	<LI>Use the <A HREF="Alcohol_Myths.html">Myths and Truths</A> to counter common misconceptions about alcohol to educate people about the real risks they take when they drink and drive.


	<LI>Tailor the <A HREF="Alcohol_Op-Ed.html">Op-Ed</A> provided to fit your community and try to get it published in your local paper. You can also use the sample cover letter we've included with it, and follow the guidelines we've provided for submitting 
	<LI>Op-Eds.


	<LI>Educate public officials about the link between substance abuse and fatal car crashes and ask them to help raise public awareness about the problem.


	<LI>Schedule an editorial board meeting with your local paper and ask them to write an editorial urging residents not to drink and drive this holiday season. You can invite a prevention specialist to join you and talk about steps parents can take to be sure their teenagers don't drink and drive. You can also ask the newspaper to run the creative non-alcoholic drink recipes we've provided to encourage party hosts to provide non-alcoholic beverages for guests who will be driving. In addition, you might also want to create a list of tips for hosting safe parties.

<H2><CENTER>CSAP's Reality Check Campaign</CENTER>
</H2>
Join Together partners with the <A HREF="http://www.health.org">Center for Substance Abuse Prevention</A>
to bring you CSAP's Reality Check campaign. This nationwide campaign, launched
in late June by Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, was
created to help parents talk to their kids about the dangers of marijuana
use.<BR>
<BR>
Young people are constantly bombarded with conflicting messages from music,
films and television. By informing and educating adults about the issues
that influence marijuana use, they will in turn be better able to provide
young people with information that will help them make better choices.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE CAMPAIGN THEME:</B> Marijuana is a drug. Help Our Kids Understand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>CAMPAIGN GOALS: </B>Increase awareness; Help young people refuse marijuana
or quit if they already use; Involve adults caregivers and mentors; Change
pro-use norms.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM:</B> As you surely know, marijuana use has been
gaining popularity recently. In just one year, the number of eighth graders
who use marijuana in the United States has doubled. That's why, NOW, more
than ever, it is crucial for parents to talk to their kids and discourage
them from using this drug. Unfortunately, many young people do not consider
marijuana to be dangerous.<BR>
<BR>
But contrary to this belief, the danger is there and it is getting worse,
especially as increasingly stronger blends of marijuana are crossbred in
this country. Even more alarming, some current forms of marijuana are &quot;spiked&quot;
with other illicit drugs like cocaine, crack cocaine, PCP and even embalming
fluid.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY CAN DO:</B> It is important to get this message out
to parents, and to help them feel comfortable about sharing these facts
with their kids. Some parents, who may have tried marijuana themselves when
they were younger, may not feel that they are in any position to discuss
this serious issue with their children. Nonetheless, it is crucial that
they find ways to start a dialogue about the danger of drugs with their
children.<BR>
<BR>
How can you help parents in your community keep their kids safe and drug-free?
This latest Monthly Action Kit provides you with the highlights of CSAP's
campaign and some tips on how to tailor it locally.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and cocaine.
But today, the new drugs of choice for some kids are common -- but often
deadly -- household substances such as white out, glue and paint. This Hot
Issue Action Kit focuses on this rising problem. We suggest you use this
material to raise public awareness in March, which is National Inhalant
Awareness Month. We especially encourage you to reach out to youth who have
dropped out of school and may not be aware of the dangers associated with
inhalants.<BR>
<BR>
To get this message out to the public and key groups in your community,
we have provided you with the following:
<UL>
<LI>An <A HREF="overview.html">Overview </A> outlining Inhalants and how
they are commonly abused;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A list of <A HREF="Warning.html">Warning Signs</A> of Inhalant abuse
to help others recognize when someone may be using household products to
get high;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A <A HREF="Inhalant_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> summarizing the research
on the dangers of Inhalant abuse and national trends of this problem among
youth;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Concrete <A HREF="Action_steps.html">Action Steps</A> you can take to

piece you can tailor to fit your community and then submit to your local
newspaper for publication.

<H2>Prevention Works</H2>
</center>

Across the country community groups are making great strides in preventing alcohol and drug abuse and the related problems that result. But despite these successes, more remains to be done. In fact, two recent studies suggest that some of the gains we have made in reducing substance abuse are beginning to lessen. This means that we must strengthen the message that prevention works and encourage all sectors of society to join in community-wide efforts. To help you make this point, we have enclosed the following information:

<UL>
	<LI>a <A HREF="Prevention_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> that illustrates how prevention works to reduce substance abuse and provides statistics from two recent studies;

	<LI>a <A HREF="Prevention_Pitch.html">Pitch Letter</A> to interest reporters and editors in prevention and encourage them to do a feature or series looking at various prevention efforts in your community; and

	<LI>a <A HREF="Prevention_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> you can send to your local newspaper -- either as is, or with some local examples added.
</UL>



<H3>HOW TO USE THIS ACTION KIT:</H3>

<OL>
	<LI>Use the <A HREF="Prevention_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> to illustrate that alcohol and drug problems can be prevented. You can use these statistics 	and examples as talking points to get a reporter or editor from your local newspaper to do a feature story 	looking at prevention efforts in your area and what they have accomplished. You can also use these facts to 	interest a local talk radio station to do a show on this topic.

	<LI>Tailor the <A HREF="Prevention_Pitch.html">Pitch Letter</A> with examples of local prevention efforts at work to reduce substance abuse. Use this to interest your newspaper in the topic. Also provide names and phone numbers of youth and adults involved in area prevention efforts who can talk about their experiences. Give examples of the broad range of 	prevention programs out there. 

	<LI>Send the <A HREF="Prevention_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> to your local newspaper and ask them to run it. Call to follow-up after sending it. It is written to be a recruitment piece.

<LI>Educate public officials about the scope of substance abuse problems in your community and the crucial role prevention programs play in reducing them. Provide the findings from the Monitoring the Future study and the 	Harvard School of Public Health study on the second-hand effects of binge drinking in the fact sheet. 	Challenge them to act by supporting local efforts.

<LI>Schedule an editorial board meeting with your local paper and ask them to write an editorial supporting the local prevention efforts and providing action steps that residents can take to help reduce the problem in your area. </OL>

<H2>TREATMENT WORKS &amp; WE CAN PROVE IT</H2>
</center>

<P>Several recent credible studies have found that providing substance abuse 
treatment is a cost-effective investment for communities. To get this 
message out to the public and to key groups in your community, we have 
provided you with the following:


<UL>
	<LI>a <A HREF="TXWorks_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> with key findings from the various studies that have been done;
	<LI>a <A HREF="TxWorks_Pitch.html">Sample Feature Story Pitch Letter</A> and a <A HREF="TxWorks_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> article you or your board members can revise and send to your local newspaper;
	<LI>a list of Resources you can contact for more information on the cost of substance abuse and treatment in your area, as well as tips for getting other groups to join your efforts.
</UL>


<P>


<P><H3>HOW-TO USE THIS MONTHLY ACTION KIT AND RECENT TREATMENT STUDIES:</H3>


<OL>
	<LI>Use the <A HREF="TXWorks_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> to make a case for having a similar study conducted in your state or to get publicity for the results, if one has already been done.


	<LI>Use the <A HREF="TxWorks_Pitch.html">pitch letter</a> to interest a health or feature reporter in writing about the treatment capacity, need and effectiveness in your area. Your letter should provide some story ideas and give the reporter the sense that this is an important story and that you can be a major resource for them.


	<LI>Tailor the <A HREF="TxWorks_Op-Ed.html">Op-Ed</a> provided to fit your community and try to get it published in your local paper to educate people about the cost-effectiveness of treatment.


	<LI>Meet with newly elected officials and get reacquainted with incumbents to discuss the importance of adequate and effective treatment capacity in your community.


	<LI>Call the resources listed to get local statistics on the cost of substance abuse in your state and use these numbers, along with the ones provided in our fact sheet, in the <A HREF="TxWorks_Op-Ed.html">Op-Ed</a> and as a guest on talk radio shows to illustrate that treatment works.


	<LI>Schedule an editorial board meeting with your local paper and ask them to write an editorial in favor of providing more public treatment in your state. You can present statistics from the studies that have already been done (included in the fact sheet, pitch letter and op-ed), and also use local ones gathered from the organizations listed under resources. Invite someone from a local treatment facility to join you.


	<LI>Suggest that your local television station do an investigative piece on the cost of substance abuse in your area versus the cost of providing treatment. Present the treatment survey findings from other states, as well as the information you have gathered using our resource sheet, to get them started.

<H2>Domestic Violence and Substance Abuse</H2></center>



<P>Much national attention is focused on domestic violence these days. Many women who have silently suffered batterings by their mates are now beginning to speak out about their ordeals and encouraging others to do the same. What has not gotten as much media attention, however, is the fact that up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases can be linked to alcohol or drug abuse. You can help to get this message out. With the material provided in this kit, you can help reporters understand the connection between domestic violence and substance abuse and to realize how providing substance abuse treatment under health care reform is an essential step in reducing domestic violence.


<P>To help you inform the public and key groups in your community about the need for substance abuse treatment to reduce domestic violence, we have provided you with the following:


<UL>
	<LI>a <A HREF="DV_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> with statistics on the problem and how treatment would help;

	<LI>a <A HREF="DV_Press.html">Sample Press Release</A> and a <A HREF="DV_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> article you or your board members can revise and send to your local newspaper;

	<LI>a list of <A HREF="DV_Resources.html">Resources</A> you can contact for more information on the problem, as well as tips on how to help you get other groups to join your efforts.
</UL>


<P><B>How to use these tools:</B>


<ol>
<li>Use the <A HREF="DV_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> to interest the media in this topic. -Use the statistics and some local ones of your own to help newspaper, television and radio  reporters to better understand the issue of domestic violence and its relationship to alcohol and drug abuse.

<ul>
<li>Visit local women's shelters and find victims of domestic violence who are willing to &quot;tell their stories&quot; to the media. Offer local reporters a list of area shelters and resources they can run with an article on this issue to guide other victims to seek help.


<li>Arrange an Editorial Board meeting with your local newspaper and use the statistics to show the link between alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence and the need to treat both problems simultaneously.  Invite someone who runs a group for batterers join you. Also have a spokesperson  from your local emergency room talk about the victims he or she has seen and the scope of the  problem in your area. Include a treatment provider to talk about how treatment must encompass the  addiction as well as the battering. Encourage the newspaper to do a series or insert about this serious issue, which affects a large portion of its readership.


<li>Write a Letter to the Editor or an Op-Ed (<A HREF="DV_Op-Ed.html">see sample</A> included) using key facts to show the correlation between substance abuse and domestic violence and stressing the need for treatment.
</ul>

<li>Use the <A HREF="DV_Press.html">Sample Press Release</A> to get press coverage. -Revise the release by adding local examples of victims of domestic violence in your area.

<TITLE>INCREASE IN MARIJUANA USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<H2>INCREASE IN MARIJUANA USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE</H2>
</center>

<P>Marijuana use is on the rise among teenagers across the country. Several recent studies have alerted us to this worrisome fact. Also cause for concern is the fact that anti-drug attitudes among young people are declining. Many high school students associate less danger with smoking marijuana today than their counterparts did several years ago. These findings are especially alarming since the use of marijuana--the most widely used drug--often leads to the use of other, more dangerous drugs.  Therefore, we must increase our efforts to prevent substance abuse -- especially among young people. To help you make this point, we have enclosed the following information:


<UL>
	<LI>a <A HREF="Marijuana_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> that shows the risks of marijuana use and includes the latest findings from several timely studies that reveal that marijuana use is on the rise among teenagers;

	<LI>a <A HREF="Marijuana_Pitch.nclk">Pitch Letter</A> to alert reporters to the fact that marijuana use is up among teens and to ask them to take a closer look at the problem in your area; and

	<LI>a <A HREF="Marijuana_Op-Ed.nclk">Sample Op-Ed</A> you can send to your local newspaper -- either as is, or with some local examples added.
</UL>


<P>


<P><H3>HOW TO USE THIS ACTION KIT:</H3>


<OL>
	<LI>Use the <A HREF="Marijuana_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> provided to show your local media the timeliness of running a series on marijuana use. 	Suggest that reporters interview local high school students about marijuana use in their school and ask the 	kids how accurately they think the national findings tell the story in your city or town. Your local 	newspaper may also want to convene a focus group of students to talk about their perceptions of drug use and 	why they think their peers do or don't use marijuana. Another possible angle you can suggest is for the 	newspaper to look at local prevention efforts and see how effective these are in reducing marijuana use. In 	addition, ask a talk radio station in your area to devote a drive-time show to the topic. Suggest that they 	interview students and educators about why they think marijuana usage is up and what people can do about 	this problem.

	<LI>Tailor the <A HREF="Marijuana_Pitch.nclk">Pitch Letter</A> with examples of local efforts to reduce marijuana use. Use this to interest your 	newspaper in the topic. Also provide names and phone numbers of different local substance abuse programs 	working in your area to educate teens about the risk of smoking marijuana. 

	<LI>Localize the <A HREF="Marijuana_Op-Ed.nclk">Op-Ed</A> for your community newspaper and ask them to run it. Call to follow-up after sending it. You can tailor it with a local example to make a stronger impact on readers in your community.

	<LI>Schedule an editorial board meeting with your local paper and ask them to write an editorial about the 	increase in drug use among students and suggest they include a list of action steps that parents can take to 	keep their youngsters drug-free.

<H2>HIV-Infection and Substance Abuse</H2>
</center>

<P>You probably know someone who is HIV-positive -- one in every 250 people in the United States has contracted this virus that ultimately leads to AIDS. This virus affects about one million people nationwide. And a number of men and women with HIV-infection have substance abuse problems that put them at risk for HIV -- either by injecting drugs or having unprotected sex. You can help many more people from becoming a statistic by making sure that all Americans have access to the health care they need including adequate substance abuse services.

<H2>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OLDER AMERICANS</H2>
</center>

<P>Many people think of substance abuse as a problem that affects only young people. However, many older people also suffer from alcohol and drug addictions. In fact, senior citizens consume a disproportionate amount of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and have a higher risk of becoming dependent on these substances. And some older people drink heavily because they are lonely or bored. It is important that we recognize the dangers of substance abuse among older Americans and offer help to those who need it. To help you educate your community about this problem, we have provided:
 

<UL>
<LI> a <A HREF="Elderly_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> that shows the problem of substance abuse and older Americans and the high cost to taxpayers;
<LI><A HREF="Elderly_Warnings.html">Warning Signs</A> that indicate that drinking may be a problem. You can post these in places where senior citizens congregate;
<LI><A HREF="/JTO/issues/Elderly/Elderly_Resources.html">Resources</A> that you can call to find out more about substance abuse and older people;
<LI>a <A HREF="/JTO/issues/Elderly/Elderly_Press.html">Sample Press Release</A> you can localize to interest your community paper in writing about this important topic;
<LI>a <A HREF="Elderly_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> to send to your local newspaper to educate readers about the problem of seniors abusing alcohol and prescription drugs.
</UL>
 

<H3>HOW TO USE THIS ACTION KIT</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Use the <A HREF="/JTO/issues/Elderly/Elderly_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> and <A HREF="Elderly_Press.html">Sample Press Release</A> to illustrate substance abuse problems among 	older people and to interest your local newspaper in examining the problem. Suggest that a 	reporter interview local doctors and health centers that treat senior citizens. He or she can 	also 	visit the senior center in the community or other places where older people gather and find out 	what activities are available for seniors to keep them active.
<LI>Repackage the <A HREF="Elderly_Warnings.html">Warning Signs</A> of alcohol abuse in older people and run it in your organization's newsletter to alert people to the problem and encourage them to seek help. You can also ask your local newspaper to run this list to educate readers who may have a problem and be unsure where to turn. Another way to use this information is to post it in places that seniors frequent.
<LI>Use the list of <A HREF="/JTO/issues/Elderly/Elderly_Resources.html">Resources</A> provided to find out more about substance abuse and older people and to find out about local organizations that deal with this problem. You can pass this list on to reporters and suggest they call for more information about this topic.
<LI>Revise the <A HREF="Elderly_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> and send it to your local newspaper to alert people to the problem and to raise public awareness.

<H3><CENTER>HOW TO USE JOIN TOGETHER'S <BR>
THIRD NATIONAL SURVEY FINDINGS</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Substance abuse problems continue to rise in many communities across the
country. Despite increased awareness about this fact, many community groups
report that elected officials -- governors, Congressmen and state legislators
--are LESS involved in communitywide anti-drug efforts today than they were
two years ago. Join Together's third national survey of community anti-drug
efforts conducted July through October, 1995, alerts us to this disturbing
fact. You will receive a full copy of this survey report sometime in December.
In the meantime, we have provided you with this kit to give you a head-start
on using these national findings to raise public awareness about substance
abuse problems in your community. <BR>
<BR>
To help you do this, we have provided you with the following: 
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> of the nation's substance abuse
problem; 
<LI><A HREF="highlights.html">Highlights</A> of Join Together's third national
survey of community anti-drug efforts; to give you some action steps to
get businesses, politicians, churches and other groups more involved in
anti-substance abuse efforts; 
<LI>A <A HREF="letter.html">Sample Pitch Letter</A> to entice an editor
to take a look at the scope of alcohol and drug abuse in your community
and how it compares to the scope of theproblem nationally; 
<LI>A <A HREF="release.html">Sample Press Release</A> you can send to the
editor of your local newspaper announcing the national survey findings and
showing how your community compares to others around the nation; 
<LI>A <A HREF="oped.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> you can ask your local newspaper
to run to educate residents about the survey findings and let them know
what is happening in your community. 
</UL>
<BR>
(We would like to know if you have any success using this Kit to get your
local media to run stories about substance abuse and the Join Together national
surveyfindings. Please fax a copy of any news clips to: <A HREF="mailto:lisa@jointogether.org">Lisa Falk</A> at (617)

<P>Although it is illegal in all states to sell cigarettes to anyone under
18-years-old, kids have easy access to tobacco products. Each day, three
thousand youngsters in the United States become regular smokers. On an annual
basis, this is about one million youth. And despite our efforts to get the
message out that smoking is hazardous to kids' health, the fact is that
tobacco use by kids continues to rise. In the past three years, smoking
among eighth graders has increased by 30 percent. This finding sends a warning
bell that we must reinvigorate our efforts to keep kids from using tobacco
products. To help you measure the availability of tobacco in your community
and to raise public awareness of this problem, we have provided you with
the following: 
<UL>

<H2>JOIN TOGETHER<br>
TOBACCO PROJECT RESULTS</H2>


<P>
<B>HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS CANVAS NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR SCHOOLS AND FIND OVER A THOUSAND TOBACCO OUTLETS!</B>
</center>

<P>
How easy is it for kids to buy cigarettes? That's what Join Together wanted to know when it launched its Tobacco Project in October of 1996.  To find out how accessible cigarettes are in places kids shop, Join Together asked community groups across the country to mobilize residents to count the number of outlets (ie. convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants and grocery stores) that sell tobacco products within a quarter-mile radius of a public school.  More than 500 volunteers from 27 states participated in this project. 


<P><H3>Here is what they found:</H3>


<P>Participants found over 1,200 tobacco retail outlets within a quarter-mile radius of 222 schools.  Just seven percent (7%) of the total number of schools surveyed reported that there were no outlets within the quarter mile radius.  This represents an average of six outlets located near each school.  As the chart on the next page indicates, the most common places where cigarettes were sold near schools were convenience and grocery stores.  


<P><H3>Other findings:</H3>


<UL>
	<LI>There were 76 stores selling tobacco products near one public school in Passaic, New Jersey. Many of these stores also sold candy and other items that appeal to youth.
 

	<LI>Loose cigarettes are available at some stores near a school in New Haven, Conn. Youth there say that some store clerks easily sell these to minors.
 

	<LI>Cigarette packs were readily accessible to teens at a store in Newport, New Hampshire and could easily be shoplifted. Students alerted the store owner to this fact and as a result, the rack displaying the cigarettes was moved behind the counter.


	<LI>High school students in Oshkosh, Wisc. say it is easy to purchase cigarettes from some stores located near the schools. The kids know which salespeople will sell to minors and they shop during the hours when those employee are working.


	<LI>Availability of tobacco products is widespread in Fayetteville, NC. However, this tobacco project revealed that there are no vending machines selling cigarettes near the school. Therefore, cigarette sales all come from outlets like convenience stores and gas stations.
</UL>


<PRE><P>
Type of Outlet        Number     Percentage

Convenience Store      300          24%

Grocery Store          261          21%

Gas Station            188          15%

Restaurant             153          12%

* Other                112           9%

Liquor Store           106           9%

Drug Store              72           6%

Vending Machine         44           4%

________________________________________
TOTAL                1,236         100%
</PRE>


<P>* On the survey form, teams recorded "other" tobacco outlets.  Some of these other tobacco retail outlets listed included laundromats, candy stores, card stores, bowling alleys, paper stores, take-out pizza / deli establishments, and thrift stores.  Clearly, children frequent these types of establishments, and sell products which appeal to children.  It is important to note that among youths aged 12-17 years who usually bought their own cigarettes in 1989, about 85% often or sometimes bought them from a small store, 50% from a large store, and 15% from a vending machine. These figures come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health.


<P>
<H3>Who participated in this Project?
</H3>

<P>Community volunteers acted individually, or formed teams, and canvassed their neighborhoods to measure the extent of cigarette availability within a quarter-mile radius of schools.  They counted the number of tobacco sales locations in convenience, grocery and liquor stores, gas stations, restaurants, and vending machines.  Participants recorded results on a summary sheet, and sent them back to Join Together for analysis and development of this report.  


<P>In twenty seven states, more than 500 volunteers (402 youth; 124 adults) were involved in counting tobacco outlets within a quarter-mile radius of over 200 schools.  These schools represented over 100 communities from across the country.  Communities as diverse as Anchorage, Alaska, Winner, South Dakota, Ellsworth, Maine, and Jupiter, Florida, representing all four corners of the United States, submitted results to Join Together.  
This tobacco outlet counting project generated a great deal of interest, enthusiasm, and participation among concerned citizens. 


<P><B>For instance:</B>

<UL>
 	<LI>Seventy-five youth, accompanied by three adults, counted the number of outlets near Boyne City Public Schools in Boyne City, Mich.; 
	<LI>Sixty-five youth, on their own,  counted the stores selling tobacco around a middle school in Creston, Ohio; 
	<LI>Thirty-five youth and three adults in Passaic, N.J., surveyed the area near an elementary school in their community;
	<LI>Twenty-five youth and four adults counted the outlets near a high school in Monroe, Louisiana.  
	<LI>A single volunteer in Laredo, Texas, surveyed 27 schools in his area; while another individual surveyed 22 schools in Leominster, Mass.; 
	<LI>A team of two adult volunteers in Martinsburg, WV counted the stores around 20 schools.
</UL>


<P><H3>Why are the results of this Tobacco Project important?</H3>


<UL>
	<li>Projects such as this one are important to raise public awareness about the problem of underage smoking. The fact is, more than 3,000 kids start smoking each day, and more than one million youngsters start each year. This number is on the rise, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health. 


	<li>The most effective preventive programs to reduce youth smoking are communitywide ones that combine education and public policy approaches. The placement of tobacco retail outlets near schools (especially elementary schools) has potentially harmful implications for youth, since these factors give kids the message that it is OK to smoke.  This Join Together Tobacco Project is a first step in educating people about youth access to tobacco. It also sets the stage for further communitywide public policy action. 

<B>Geographic Information:</B>

<ul>
	<LI>Community teams selected a total of 222 schools for this project, approximately half (45%) of which were elementary schools.  Middle schools represented 30%, while high schools comprised 25% of the total number of schools surveyed.


	<LI>Half (49%) of the areas surveyed surrounding schools were classified as rural, while 28% of areas were classified as urban; the remaining areas, 23%, were classified as suburban.  This means that youth access to tobacco is not just a big city problem--it affects rural communities all across the country!   


	<LI>Almost two-thirds of communities described the area in which the school is located as mixed commercial & residential; one-third indicated the areas were residential.

<H2><CENTER>BINGE DRINKING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES <BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
As college students head back to school, many of them will be affected by
a serious problem: binge drinking. Today, nearly half of all college students
binge drink. This drinking leads to a number of problems on campuses, such
as violence, rapes, sexually-transmitted diseases and suicides. And even
though it is illegal for anyone under 21 to consume alcohol, many minors
getting served anyway. This is a pervasive problem not only for college
communities but for our nation's future leadership. We encourage you to
raise public awareness about the risks associated with binge drinking. To
help you do this, we have provided the following: 
<UL>
<LI>a <A HREF="Binge_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> that shows the scope of
college drinking nationwide, as well as the problems that occur when students
binge drink; 
<LI>some <A HREF="Binge_Action.html">Community Action Steps</A> to help
you find the local angle to describe the scope of college drinking in your
area and take action to help reduce the problem; 
<LI>a <A HREF="Binge_Letter.html">Sample Pitch Letter</A> you can send to
the editor of your local newspaper encouraging him or her to devote a back-to-school
piece looking at the drinking habits of local college students and the related
problems; 
<LI>a <A HREF="Binge_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> your local newspaper can
run to create awareness about the effects of heavy drinking and to encourage
people to make smart choices. 

	<LI>A <A HREF="/JTO/news/press/cspi_binge.html">press release</A> detailing a recent initiative addressing irresponsible tavern ads in college newspapers.
</UL>
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>HOW TO USE THIS MONTHLY ACTION KIT:</CENTER>
</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Use the <A HREF="Binge_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> to educate reporters about the problem of binge drinking
on college campuses. Suggest that your local newspaper convene a focus group
of local college students to find out their reaction to these statistics
and how to discourage underage drinking. Arrange an Editorial Board Meeting
to ask the paper to encourage college administrators and alcohol servers
to set strict policies and take an active role in communitywide prevention
efforts. If you can, bring a representative from a local college to talk
about the relationship between alcohol and violence and crimes on campus.
<LI>Explore some of the resources listed on the <A HREF="Binge_Action.html">Finding the Local Angle</a>
sheet to find out the scope of college drinking in your community. By tailoring
your message to reflect what is happening locally, you will greatly increase
your chances of interesting reporters in covering this topic. While the
national picture is certainly interesting, the local picture affects each
citizen and your newspaper will therefore recognize this as valuable news.
<LI>Send the <A HREF="Binge_Letter.html">Pitch Letter</a> to an editor at your local newspaper (or television
or radio news directors) to entice him or her in covering this topic. Use
interesting and dramatic statistics to grab his or her attention. Show the
timeliness of the story and explain how the newspaper can help students
have a safer school year by raising public awareness about this issue. 
<LI>Add some local statistics to the <A HREF="Binge_Op-Ed.html">Sample Op-Ed</A> provided and ask your
newspaper to run it to alert people to the fact that college drinking can
be dangerous. Give readers some action steps that they can take to help
solve the problem.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>THE FACT IS. . . .<BR> </FONT></B></CENTER> <P> <B>Substance abuse prevention and treatment programs are critically lacking at every level of the criminal justice system.</B> <B>Consider the following statistics:<BR> </B> <UL> <LI>Over one million people are arrested each year on drug-related charges. <SUP>1</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>At least 45 percent of arrestees charged with violent crimes or robberies, burglaries and theft tested positive for the use of one or more drugs.<SUP> 2</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>The number of drug arrests <I><B>tripled</B></I><B> </B>during the 1980s -- from 471,000 in 1980 to 1,247,000 in 1989. <SUP>3</SUP> And if the jail population continues to grow at the current rate, by the year 2053 the United States will have more people in jail than out. <SUP>4</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>More than two-thirds of U.S. prison wardens surveyed think that correctional treatment options -- such as residential drug treatment programs, home detention, halfway houses and boot camps -- should be utilized more.<SUP> 5</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>Of all the money spent in the United States each year to reduce substance abuse, 78 percent goes to enforce laws, provide punishment, or to control drug trade. Only 22 percent is spent on prevention and treatment.<SUP> 6</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<P> <B>Treatment works.<BR> </B> <UL> <LI>Every dollar spent on treatment leads to a $7.46 reduction in crime-related spending and lost productivity. <SUP>7</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>In a follow-up study of treatment programs for incarcerated felony offenders, 79 percent of participants were employed upon release. And only 35 percent were rearrested, compared with a national rearrest rate of 63 percent. <SUP>8</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>Drug Courts -- which divert non-violent offenders from jail time to treatment -- could lower the recidivism rate, increase successful treatment outcomes, and save taxpayers $5,000 per defendant in jail costs alone. <SUP>9</SUP> </UL>

<UL> <LI>A treatment program based in California&iacute;s Amity Prison, which separates substance abusers from the rest of the prison population to address the myriad of problems associated with addiction, has reduced the usual recidivism rate from 60 percent to 25 percent. <SUP>10</SUP> </UL>

<P>

<UL> <LI>A diversion program for offenders in Arizona found that only 11 percent of those that entered treatment between March 1989 and March 1990 had committed another crime by May of 1991.

<P> <CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE<BR> </FONT></B></CENTER> <P> There are a number of ways communities -- and states -- across the nation are tackling crime and substance abuse. Things like implementing fair sentencing guidelines, providing drug courts that divert offenders to treatment, and creating community partnerships are proving successful. These approaches save taxpayers money and make our neighborhoods safer while giving offenders with addictions the help they need. <P> Here are a few examples of what works:<BR>

<P> <U><B>Drug Courts</B></U> <P> <B>Rochester:</B> A drug court steers non-violent offenders into treatment in Rochester, NY. This drug court employs treatment providers and case managers to link program participants with community services. In less than a year, this program has proved effective -- of 172 participants, only 12 have been rearrested. Funds for the program come from local foundations and the Monroe County Bar Association. For more information, contact: Nadine Spinell at (716) 428-2736.<BR>

<P> <B>Little Rock: </B>Treatment is far less expensive than jail in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Substance Abuse Treatment Education Program, known as STEP, allows offenders to opt for a suspended sentence and referral to social services and treatment -- which costs $3,000 a person -- instead of a stay in jail, which averages $30,000 a year.  To qualify, offenders must commit to completing the whole program. Upon graduating, their criminal record is erased. Those who fail to complete the program are sent back to court to be sentenced for their crimes. So far 40 clients have successfully graduated from STEP in 15 months and there has been no recidivism. For more information, contact: Terrel Rose, STEP project director, at (501) 374-7837. <BR>

<P> <U><B>Sentencing Guidelines<BR> </B></U> <P> Fair sentencing guidelines have helped Delaware keep the prison population in check. These guidelines establish five levels of accountability for people who have committed crimes -- ranging from unsupervised probation to prison. Since the guidelines were adopted in 1987, the number of people sent to jail for nonviolent offenses has dropped by 50 percent. In addition, in 1986 the prison population was growing at a rate of 11 percent, yet in 1990 it dropped to a 2.3 percent decline.  For more information, contact: Judge Myron Steele at the Court of Chancery at (302) 739-4397. <BR>

<P> <U><B>Community Partnerships</B></U> <P> Community partnerships are the weapon to fighting crime in Brooklyn, New York, and Portland, Oregon. In Brooklyn, the Kings County District Attorney divides the 23 police precincts into five zones. Prosecutors in each zone work closely with police officers and community organizations to improve law enforcement and prosecution. For more information, call the Brooklyn D.A.'s office at (718) 802-2000. In Portland, the Multnomah County District Attorney's office brings together local prosecutors and neighborhood safety committees to keep the community safe with activities like drug-free school and housing zones and a program that requires nonviolent criminals to serve their probation by performing community service. For more information, call the Multnomah County D.A.'s office at (503) 248-3162.<BR>

</B></FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
You may wonder how <I>you</I> can make the case in your community
that providing treatment for nonviolent criminals with addictions
is essential to community safety<I>.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Here are some things you can do:<BR>
</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>Get local crime statistics from your police department. Ask
your police chief what role alcohol and drugs played in these
crimes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Find out what treatment options exist in your area. Talk to
local treatment providers and find out how many clients were incarcerated
before getting help. Ask providers about the nature of the violent
crimes clients committed. If most of the crimes were minor, this
will help make your case for providing treatment alternatives
to jail.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Read the police blotter in your community newspaper and see
if alcohol and/or drugs are mentioned in relationship to many
of the incidents. If not, talk to the editor and suggest that
the newspaper start including this information where it is pertinent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Monitor the front page of the community newspaper to see for
yourself how many crimes are related in some way to substance
abuse.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Find out how much it costs per year to incarcerate a prisoner
in your community, county or state. Compare this figure to the
price of an average stay in a local treatment facility and see
what the savings are.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Are there drug courts or diversionary treatment programs in
your community? If so, find out how successful they have been.
Does the capacity meet the need in your community? If not, make
the case for expanding treatment options. If no such programs
exist locally, talk to other communities in your state who have
successfully implemented such options and learn how they started.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Talk to local judges, prison officials, prosecutors, probation
supervisors and treatment providers about your findings. Brainstorm
ways you can work more closely with them to provide substance
abuse treatment for criminals. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Remember that many residents care about safety and cost. Therefore,
keep these key issues in mind when you make your case for providing
such treatment options.  
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Look at what options exist for juvenile offenders with substance
abuse problems in your community. Suggest alternatives that could
prevent kids from being incarcerated and at the same time, treat
their substance abuse problems and teach them new skills.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Convene a policy panel to examine local problems and make
recommendations on how your community can benefit by providing
treatment for criminals with addictions. (See &quot;How to Convene
a Local Policy Panel&quot; included in this Kit.)

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>SAMPLE PITCH LETTER<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I>You can tailor the following letter to interest an editor at
your local newspaper in doing an in-depth article or series examining
the link between substance abuse and crime and the need for treatment
in your community.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dear Editor:<BR>

<P>
Many people feel safe simply locking criminals up in prisons.
But, if you take a closer look at the criminal justice system,
you'll see there is a false security in the &quot;lock-em up&quot;
solution.  <BR>

<P>
Alcohol and drug addictions are at the root of many crimes, particularly
domestic violence and homicide. Yet, instead of taking the time
to treat these addictions when criminals are in jail, these problem
are all too often ignored by the criminal justice system. That
means when the addicted prisoners are released, they return back
to society to commit further crimes. This jeopardizes our safety
and the safety of our children. <BR>

<P>
Recently, General Barry McCaffrey, the nation's new drug czar,
recognized this serious gap in America's drug strategy by announcing
that part of his 10-year plan to reduce drugs includes expanding
drug treatment in prisons.<BR>

<P>
Most offenders with addictions commit nonviolent crimes. Therefore,
it is less expensive -- and more effective -- to treat the addiction
than to house that person in jail. The price tag for treatment
is also less than the price associated with crime. A national
study conducted by the RAND Corporation for the Office of National
Drug Control Policy tells us that every dollar spent on treatment
leads to a $7 reduction in crime-related spending and lost-productivity.
Other studies collaborate this finding. <BR>

<P>
In fact, a recent national policy panel convened by the Boston
University School of Public Health recommends that non-violent
offenders with substance abuse addictions should be diverted to
drug courts, treatment programs and supervision, instead of or
along with, jail. This panel also recommends that police, courts,
judges and probation officers work more closely with treatment
providers and citizens to reduce crime.<BR>

<P>
A full 60 percent of all prisoners in the United States are in
prison because of alcohol and drug-related offenses. This is up
25 percent from a decade earlier. If the prison population continues
to grow at the current rate, experts predict we will have more
people in jail than out by the year 2053.<BR>

<P>
I urge you to look at the link between substance abuse and crime
in our community. I can put you in touch with some local sources.
You can reach me at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER). I will call you next
week to follow up.<BR>

<P>
Sincerely,<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>SAMPLE OP-ED<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I>You can tailor the following Op-Ed with some examples and statistics
from your community and send this to your local newspaper.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B>WE <I>CAN</I> MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER<BR>
</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Many of the crimes committed on our streets today have their
roots in alcohol and drug addictions. Yet, too often we simply
lock the offenders away in jail and do not try to treat the problems
that led them there. <BR>

<P>
This oversight is really at our own expense. When we release
criminals with addictions back to our communities, they usually
pick up with a new crime spree and new prison sentences. This
means that our safety and our tax dollars are at their mercy.
<BR>

<P>
Consider that by the end of the 1980's, about one-third of people
in state prisons were there because of drug offenses -- and 60
to 70 percent had a history of substance abuse. Yet despite in
1991, only 13.5 percent of state prisoners were enrolled in drug
programs. This gap simply does not make sense, especially when
you consider that it costs <I>less</I> to provide treatment than
to keep an inmate in jail for a year. Outpatient drug treatment
averages about $3,000 to $10,000 per person, while housing an
inmate in jail for a year costs close to $30,000. And studies
confirm that jail alone <I>increases</I> the likelihood of further
crimes, while substance abuse treatment <I>decreases</I> it.<BR>

<P>
That's why some communities have started alternative programs,
such as drug courts, that make their streets safer and save taxpayers
money. They also give offenders a closely-supervised chance to
become responsible, law-abiding taxpayers. These programs include
diversionary drug courts that steer addicts who commit non-violent
crimes, such as larceny or drug dealing, to treatment instead
of jail; sentencing guidelines that set standards to ensure equity
for jail time based on the crime; and community partnership programs
that encourage police, courts, prosecutors, probation and parole
officers, treatment providers and citizens to work together to
create healthy and safe environments that benefit all of us.<BR>

<P>
When community groups and criminal justice agencies join together
to provide treatment for offenders, the rates of success is high.
For instance, a community policing program in one of the highest
crime areas in Kansas City, Missouri, has reduced crime by 13
percent, compared to a 6 percent reduction nationwide. And in
two Kansas City neighborhoods, crime is down 22 and 28 percent
after the police have gone a step further and established &quot;community
action networks.&quot; These centers are staffed by teams of community
police officers, code inspectors, and neighborhood volunteers.
In addition, the state of California found that illegal activity
dropped 43.3 percent after providing treatment.<BR>

<P>
Success stories like these across the country tell us that providing
treatment and creating community/ criminal justice partnerships
make sense to reduce crime and make our streets safer. To get
involved in supporting such efforts in our community, contact
(YOUR ORGANIZATION) at (PHONE NUMBER). <BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>HOW TO CONVENE A LOCAL POLICY PANEL<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
Policy panels are an effective way to join together a group of
concerned leaders representing different vantage points of your
community around a timely policy issue. At the same time, local
policy panels can help to generate public awareness of substance
abuse problems. You may want to convene a policy panel in your
community to examine ways to reduce substance-related crime with
treatment and encourage the criminal justice system to work more
effective.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Getting Started<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
<I>The following steps can help you to start such a policy panel
in your area.<BR>
</I>
<UL>
<LI>Select several diverse leaders in the community to serve on
the panel. Ensure that they represent expertise and awareness
of the community. Select a chairperson to help guide your progress.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Outline the panel's mission so the members will focus on what
is expected of them. Agree on key questions for the panel to address.

</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Hold a public hearing to get input from citizens concerned
about this topic. Be sure to invite representatives from diverse
points of view. This will help the panel to see all sides of the
issue and also help it to move toward making its recommendations.
Invite the media to attend the hearing. In addition to covering
the proceedings, reporters can help you raise public awareness
about this issue.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>After the panel agrees on a series of recommendations, highlight
these in a final report you can release to the public and the
media. Include examples of ways these recommendations have been
implemented in other places, as well as resources people can use
to help them implement these suggestions locally.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Brief the media about your findings. You may use this as an
opportunity to reinforce existing relationships with local press
and also to make new allies. Consider arranging an editorial board
meeting and talk radio show interviews for panel members.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Be alert for other opportunities to promote your findings.
The panel chair and members may want to make presentations to
elected officials and local groups, such as civic clubs and neighborhood
organizations.

<H2>The Fact Is. . .</H2></center>


<UL>

			<LI>Alcohol-related highway crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents 	and young adults in the United States. (From the <A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</A>'s 3-D Campaign)


			<LI>About two in every five Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash at 	some time in their lives. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, Traffic Safety Facts 1993 - Alcohol)


			<LI>Approximately 17,461 Americans died in alcohol-related crashes in 1993, and about one-third of them under the age of 25. This figure accounts for 44 percent 	of all traffic fatalities that occurred that year. (NHTSA 3-D)


		<LI>Among young people (aged 15 to 20), 5,905 died in motor vehicle crashes in 	1993. Forty percent (2,364) of these crashes were alcohol-related.  (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, 	Youth Fatal Crash and Alcohol Facts 1993)


		<LI>Alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes cost the nation $46 billion annually in lost 	productivity (63.4%), medical costs (12%), property damage (18%), and other 	direct expenditures (6.6%). Over $5 billion of these costs are for health care. 	(<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A> 3-D)


			<LI>Many young people report riding with a driver who had been drinking, says the 	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, 11.3 percent of 12 to 13-	year-olds said they had been driven by someone who had been drinking in the 	past month; the same was true of 21.7 percent of 14 to 17-year-olds; and 34.5 	percent of 18 to 21-year-olds. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A> 3-D)


			<LI>Even when they haven't been drinking, young drivers (age 15 - 20) have a higher 	crash risk than other drivers -- this risk increases more with each drink than for 	drivers age 21 and older. (Zador, P., Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 1991 )
</UL>


<P><H3>PREVENTION WORKS TO SAVE LIVES</H3>


<UL>
	<LI>The number of alcohol-related car crashes has declined by 26 percent in the last 	decade. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, Traffic Safety Facts) 


	<LI>All states and the District of Columbia now have a minimum drinking age of 21. 	These laws have reduced fatal car crashes involving drivers age 18 to 20 by 13 	percent and have saved an estimated 13,968 lives since 1975. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, Traffic Safety Facts) 


	<LI>If all states adopted .00 or .02 legal Blood Alcohol Content limits for drivers 	under 21 (Zero Tolerance Laws), each year 375 fatal car crashes would be 	prevented. However, 26 states still have not adopted zero tolerance laws (From a study called &quot;Lower Legal Blood Alcohol Limits for Young Drivers,&quot; 	published in the November-December 1994  issue of Public Health Reports)

<H2>Myths And Truths About Alcohol And Driving</H2></center>


<P>
Myths and misconceptions about alcohol and its effects on safe driving are widespread. Knowing the truth could mean the difference between life and death this holiday season. You may want to distribute the following information through your media campaign, organizational newsletter and church bulletins to better educate the public about the effects of alcohol. Your local newspaper may also be interested in running this information.
<hr>

<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Myth:</B> 	Alcohol is a stimulant.<br>
<B>Fact: </B>		Alcohol is a depressant. It acts on the central nervous system like an anesthetic to lower or depress the activity of the brain.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;Drinking coffee sobers me up.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B> 		Coffee can't rid your system of alcohol. It just makes you a nervous, wide-awake drunk. Only time reverses the impairment.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> &quot;I always stay away from the hard stuff.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B> 		Alcohol is alcohol. Beer has the same affect as straight scotch. One 12-ounce  glass of beer has as much alcohol as a 1.5-ounce shot of whiskey or a 5-ounce  glass of wine.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;I'm bigger so I can handle my liquor better than other people.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B> 		Size is only one factor in how much you can drink. Metabolism, amount of rest  and food intake all play a part in how you handle liquor. Impairment in motor  reflexes and judgment can begin with the first drink.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;Once I roll down my car window, I'm okay to drive.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B>		No amount of fresh, chilly air can reverse impairment. You gain nothing by 	 rolling down a window or turning on the air conditioner.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;I just drive slower after drinking.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact: </B>		Many people believe that by driving more slowly, they can compensate for being  impaired. Actually, this can be very dangerous. The truth is, drunk drivers are  dangerous at any speed.<p>


<B>Myth:</B>	&quot;All I have to do is splash my face with cold water.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B>		Cold water or even a cold shower won't sober you up or make you a safer driver.<p>

<P>
<B>RESPONSIBLE DRIVERS ARE KEY TO HIGHWAY SAFETY THIS HOLIDAY SEASON</B>
	

<P>	The holidays are a time of joy for most people -- but for the relatives of people killed in fatal drunk driving crashes, this time of year is tinged with sorrow.<p>

Last year, 17,461 Americans died as a result of alcohol and drug-related drunk driving crashes, and 5,000 of them were under the age of 25, according to the National Highway Safety Administration.<p>

What makes these deaths especially tragic is the fact that many of them could have been prevented. Research has shown that states with tougher drunk driving laws have a lower death rate due to alcohol-related car crashes than states that do not crack down as hard on drunk drivers. <p>

In fact, a study published in the November-December issue of Public Health Reports, called &quot;Lower Legal Blood Alcohol Limits for Young Drivers,&quot; found that 375 fatal car crashes could be avoided each year if all states adopted laws making it illegal for people under the age of 21 to drive after drinking. <p>

The study found that the proportion of single vehicle fatal crashes at night declined by 20 percent in states that had lowered their legal Blood Alcohol Content limit (the amount of alcohol a person can legally have in his or her body when driving) to .00 or .02 for drivers under age 21 (Zero Tolerance Laws).<p>

Alcohol-related car crashes cost the nation $46 billion annually, according to NHTSA. These costs are associated with lost productivity, medical costs and property damage.<p>

And there is no way to put a dollar amount on the lifetime trauma endured by the family members of victims killed or injured in alcohol-related car crashes.<p>

That's why it is so important that residents urge their legislators to implement tougher BAC laws for all drivers in our state. <p>

In addition, there are several other steps that residents can take to prevent any unnecessary deaths in our community this holiday season.<p>

First, people should educate themselves and others about the risks of drinking and driving. They should also be responsible party hosts and offer non-alcoholic beverages to drivers. In addition, they should prevent any intoxicated guests from getting behind the wheel of a car. Finally, parents should not serve alcohol to minors, and should come up with an arrangement for their children to call home if they -- or someone else who is driving them -- has been drinking.<p>

If everyone makes the effort to be a responsible driver and host, we can significantly reduce the risk of deaths from drunk driving accidents in our community this holiday season.<p>

<P>
Dear <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Reporter" VALUE="Editor" SIZE=35>:<p>


<P>Each holiday season, lives are tragically lost as the result of fatal drunk driving crashes.
You can help prevent more residents of our community from becoming a statistic by helping to raise public awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving.


<P>Enclosed is an Op-Ed alerting readers to the problem of drinking and driving and to urge them to support lower legal Blood Alcohol Content levels in our state, which have been proven to save lives. In addition, the Op-Ed provides them with some concrete steps they can take -- such as educating themselves and others about the dangers of drunk driving, becoming responsible drivers and responsible party hosts, and encouraging parents not to provide alcohol to minors. 


<P>Please feel free to call me at <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Phone" VALUE="Phone number"> if you need help getting in touch with some local prevention programs.<p>

<P>Thank you for helping to make our streets and highways safer for everyone.

<P>Sincerely,
<p>

<H2><CENTER>How to Get the Message Out Locally</CENTER>
</H2>
The Reality Check campaign can serve as a valuable resource to you and to
your community. The campaign theme is:  <BR>
<H4><CENTER>Marijuana Is a Drug. Help Our Kids Understand. </CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
You can take this message and localize it with your community name and/or
other specifics. (For instance, Help Milwuakee's Kids Understand.) You can
also tailor the message and scope of your campaign in other ways, depending
on the specific resources -- and needs -- of your particular region. For
instance, if marijuana is at the root of a problem of kids skipping school
and vandalizing public property, you may want to work closely with school
personnel and law enforcement in your city or town. Or there may a lack
of drug education on the local level. Then you could consider working with
the PTA (which is already a partner in this campaign) and school personnel
in your area to get materials and messages out to local youth. If there
are stores in your area that sell pro-marijuana paraphernalia and promote
pro-use messages to youth, you might approach some of the merchants and
provide them with new pro-health slogans and novelty items such as T-shirts
and key chains to help change community norms.  And working with the media
is vital, whatever your community issues and concerns.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some things to remember:<BR>
</B>
<UL>
<LI>Involve students in your planning. They can be a good audience to test
your messages on and to advise you on what will have the most impact locally,
as well as how best to reach both kids at risk for marijuana use and their
parents.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Be sensitive to cultural issues and economic differences that exist
in your community.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Partner with other organizations to extend the reach of your campaign.
You can volunteer your time, skills and materials to other groups and ask
them to share their resources with you.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Get your message out in a number of ways. Target traditional media outlets
(your daily and weekly newspapers and television stations), as well as more
alternative places (church bulletins and newspapers, talk radio stations,
cable and specialty publications).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Be sure to include a broad range of groups in your efforts. Invite participation
from schools, parents, volunteer groups, the faith community, health care
providers, law enforcement, prevention and treatment organizations, maternal
and child health services, legal and social services, organizations serving
low-income families, labor unions, neighborhood-based social clubs, and
American Legion Posts and/or other veteran organizations.
</UL>
Joining together with other groups is now easier than ever. CSAP has established
the National Coalition to Prevent Marijuana Use. For more information, contact
the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at (800) 729-6686.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Local Groups Can Do</CENTER>
</H2>
There are many groups in your community that can help spread the word that
marijuana use is dangerous. Some organizations you might want to partner
with include businesses, youth groups, mall management, coaches and parent/
teacher associations, civic and professional groups, doctors offices, health
clinics, movie theaters, video stores and restaurants. Here are some things
these groups can do:
<UL>
<LI>Hold brown bag lunches for employees and volunteers to present the latest
statistics on marijuana problems, describe the Reality Check campaign, and
discuss what different groups can do to promote marijuana prevention among
youth in your community.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask businesses to co-sponsor the campaign by providing their logo or
slogan so you can add it to some of the materials included in this kit.
You or they can reproduce these pieces and distribute them to employees,
board members, and other businesses in the area to show their support for
this effort.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask companies to use their newsletter or other printed materials to
let employees and customers or members know about the risks of marijuana
and what parents can do.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Present marijuana prevention sessions at conferences, workshops and
trainings related to substance abuse, health and safety, parenting, education,
child development, law enforcement or any other related topic.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Insert copies of marijuana prevention materials in employee payroll
envelopes, membership mailings, invoices, bills, and statements to customers
or members.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Organize volunteers to distribute prevention materials at health fairs,
sporting events and rock concerts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Incorporate prevention tips, information and messages on the harmful
effects of marijuana in newsletters, bulletins and other mailings to members
and constituents<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Develop a speakers bureau on this issue, make local law enforcement,
advocacy, and other speakers available for community gatherings and meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Provide talking points to religious and civic leaders to incorporate
into sermons and speeches.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Hold an anti-marijuana essay, poster, slogan, rap music or video contest
for area youth. Ask local companies to help you advertise and provide prizes.

<H2><CENTER>THE FACT IS. . .</CENTER>
</H2>

You can share these facts with parents, teachers and guidance counselors
when school resumes in the fall. You can also use these statistics as talking
points when speaking with reporters, being interviewed on television or
radio talk shows, and giving a presentation on this issue.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>More than 75,000 children in the 6th grade have tried marijuana. (PRIDE
Questionnaire Report: 1992-1993 National Summary-USE grades 6-12, National
Institute on Drug Abuse, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health,
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1994, p. 259.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nearly one in every ten 8th graders and one out of every four high school
students uses marijuana. (NIDA. Monitoring the Future Study: Advance Data:
July 1995. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The average first-use age of marijuana is 13.9 years of age. (SAMHSA.
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Main Findings 1993, 1995, pp. 148.
U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>According to data accumulated over the past 20 years, the likelihood
of using a drug is affected by one's perceptions of harms associated with
that drug. (NIDA. National Survey Results on Drug Use From the Monitoring
the Future Study, 1975-1994, 1995, Table I, pp. 8. U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services.) For instance, the latest research shows that the increase
in marijuana use among youth was both preceded and accompanied by a decrease
in perceived risk. (Ibid., pp. 254.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Problems among young people that are associated with marijuana include:
school drop-out; not learning important interpersonal coping skills; problematic
relationships between parents and their children; poor role modeling for
younger siblings; and decreasing ability to make appropriate decisions,
solve problems and learn new, developmentally appropriate skills. (NIDA.
Marijuana: What Parents Need to Know, 1995, pp.19. U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>One in four youths entering juvenile detention test positive for marijuana.
(OJJDP. Juvenile Offenders and Victims; A National Report, August 1995,
pp.65. U.S. Dept. of Justice.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Between 1990 and 1994, marijuana-related emergency room episodes increased
by 155 percent -- from 15,700 to 40,100. (SAMHSA, Preliminary Estimates
from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, November 1995, pp. 17. U.S. Dept. of

<H2><CENTER>Sample Pitch Letter</CENTER>
</H2>
Your local media outlets can be of valuable assistance in helping you get
the message out that marijuana use among young people is dangerous. But
it is important to keep in mind when approaching local reporters with a
story idea that establishing a relationship with them is a two-way street.
Just as they can provide widespread coverage of an issue, you can provide
them with valuable facts and other sources they can contact for more information
and interviews. Keep this in mind as you tailor the following pitch letter
with local examples and statistics and send it to a reporter or editor at
your local newspaper, or to an assignment editor at your local television
or radio station. 
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P><B>Dear (Media Contact):</B><BR>
<BR>
Did you know that some current forms of marijuana are &quot;spiked&quot;
with other illicit drugs like cocaine, crack cocaine, PCP and even embalming
fluid?<BR>
<BR>
This makes a dangerous drug even more dangerous. Especially when we realize
some of its users are as young as 9 or 10-years-old, according to recent
surveys. And more and more older kids are using marijuana. Marijuana usage
rates among older students -- ages 12 to 17 -- have almost doubled since
the early 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
This sends a clear message that we need to educate another generation about
the dangers of marijuana use. And we also need to educate their parents.
Part of what makes this issue so complex is that some of these parents used
marijuana themselves in the past, so they do not feel comfortable about
talking to their children about this serious issue.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the fact is that this drug impairs young people's judgment,
which can lead to unprotected sex, pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases,
including HIV/AIDS. It also contributes to accidents, violence and car crashes.
The 1995 Drug Abuse Warning Network report released last November shows
that medical emergency room episodes related to marijuana have increased
155 percent since 1990. In addition, this drug also negatively affects concentration
and schoolwork and can cause young users to be suspended, expelled, or get
a police record.<BR>
<BR>
You can help alert residents in our community about the growing problem
of marijuana use and the many dangers associated with this drug. I can provide
you with many statistics showing the scope of the problem, and the consequences.
I can also put you in touch with some parents, teachers and students to
get their input on this issue.<BR>
<BR>
You can reach me at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER). I will call you next week to follow
up. This is a serious issue and one we can no longer ignore. Thanks for
your time.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Public Service Announcements</CENTER>
</H2>
The following public service announcement scripts about the problem of marijuana
use among young people are targeted to parents and are specifically tailored
to be run in the summer when kids are out of school. Provide a few of these
to your local radio station during the summer months and ask the station
manager to air them. You can also insert some local facts.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Subject: MAKE THIS SUMMER SAFE: TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT MARIJUANA<BR>
</B><BR>
1) Keep things sailing smoothly this summer. Talk with your kids about the
dangers of using marijuana. In just one year, the number of eighth graders
who use marijuana has doubled. Don't let your child be part of next year's
statistics. Call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
at 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
2) It's summertime and the going is easy. But some kids are going for the
wrong thing. They are going for marijuana. Marijuana use is a growing problem
among young people. Set your kids straight. Talk to them about marijuana.
To find out more, call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
at 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
3) Help your kids stay on the right side of the fence this summer. Sit down
and have a heart-to-heart talk with them about the dangers of using marijuana.
Kids are under a lot of pressure as they get older. Pressures to do well
in school, pressures from parents, pressures from kids who use drugs. It's
never too early to talk to your kids about the dangers of using marijuana
and other drugs. Call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
at 1-800-729-6686. Marijuana: It's a drug. Help your kids understand.<BR>
<BR>
4) Don't let your kids rock the boat this summer. Talk to them about the
dangers of using marijuana now, before it's too late. More and more 12 to
17 year olds are using marijuana these days. Don't let your kids become
part of the growing numbers. Need some tips on what to say? Call the National
Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at 1-800-729-6686. Marijuana:
It's a drug. Help your kids understand.<BR>
<BR>
5) Don't let your kids' dreams go up in smoke this summer. In just one year,
the number of eighth graders who use marijuana has doubled. That's why you
should talk to your kids about the dangers of drug use now, before it's
too late. Need tips? Call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug
Information at 1-800-729-6686. Marijuana: It's a drug. Help your kids understand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>GENERAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS</B><BR>
<BR>
These Public Service Announcements are more general and can be run on radio
stations that parents listen to at any time of the year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Starting Point <BR>
</B>Where would you start if you wanted to undermine the future of a generation?
What would you do first to make sure that kids did poorly in school, made
careless and dangerous decisions about their friendships and school activities?
How would you begin disrupting their communities, destroying traditions,
and threatening the stability of homes and families? Reality check: marijuana
is a drug. Help our kids understand. Call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A Terrible Thought <BR>
</B>Wouldn't it be terrible if kids used something they thought was harmless
but really caused a lot of trouble. Suppose it made them not care, made
it harder to pay attention and learn, harder to remember things, and harder
to make friends and get along with others? What if they believed that everybody
was using it, even though most kids really weren't? Reality check: marijuana's
a drug -- help our kids understand. Call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Company They Keep</B> <BR>
Marijuana is more harmful than we think. But here's another reality check:
it also exposes our kids to a drug culture. It puts them in touch with people
using and pushing other drugs, and these people may be involved in dangerous
activities. Like early and unsafe sex. Carrying weapons and starting fights.
Drug abuse, trafficking and addiction. Give kids what they need to avoid
marijuana and you may prevent a whole lot more. To find out how, call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cause &amp; Effect</B> <BR>
If you think there is no scientific evidence that the use of one drug necessarily
causes the use of any other drug, you need a reality check. Among adolescents
who use illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin--almost every one of them
used marijuana first. So if we prevent use of marijuana we might also prevent
other illicit drug use. Makes you think, doesn't it? For more information,
call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bluntly Speaking<BR>
</B> Let's be blunt about marijuana. Did you know, like many kids do, that
&quot;blunt&quot; is street slang for a hollowed-out cigar filled with marijuana?
Sometimes blunts contain marijuana mixed with cocaine, crack, PCP, methamphetamine,
even embalming fluid. How's that for a reality check? Learn how to have
a blunt talk with your kids about drugs. Call 1-800-729-6686 for a free
copy of &quot;Keeping Youth Drug Free.&quot;<BR>

<I>You can tailor the following Op-Ed with some examples and statistics

<P><CENTER></I><B>Don't Let Our Kids' Dreams Go Up in Smoke</B></CENTER>
<P>In the 60's and 70's, `marijuana use was &quot;cool.&quot; In the 80's,
it was &quot;out.&quot; But now, suddenly, in the mid-90's, marijuana is
making a big comeback. And its popularity is growing.<BR>
	<BR>
Recent studies have alerted us to the disturbing fact that even elementary
school students are using marijuana. And usage rates among older students
-- ages 12 to 17 -- have almost doubled since the early 1990s. This could
be in part because of the new pop culture that glamorizes marijuana and
other drugs. Movies, television shows, music videos, song lyrics and clothing
insignia carry pro-marijuana messages.<BR>
	<BR>
Complicating this problem is the fact that the parents of many of these
kids who use marijuana today may have tried the drug themselves in the past
and are reluctant to talk to their children about this controversial subject.
<BR>
	<BR>
As a result, we have a generation of young people who think marijuana is
&quot;no big deal.&quot; But the truth is, a number of harms can result
from its use. For instance, it impairs young people's judgment, which can
lead to unprotected sex, pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases, including
HIV/AIDS. <BR>
	<BR>
It also contributes to accidents, violence and car crashes. The 1995 Drug
Abuse Warning Network report released last November shows that medical emergency
room episodes related to marijuana have increased 155 percent since 1990
-- from 15,700 to 40,100. <BR>
<BR>
Use of this drug also negatively affects kids' concentration and schoolwork.
And using, buying or selling can result in a school suspension or expulsion
and a police record.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, some current forms of marijuana are &quot;spiked&quot; with
other illicit drugs like cocaine, crack cocaine, PCP and even embalming
fluid, making an already dangerous drug even more dangerous.<BR>
	<BR>
This is why now, more than ever, it is crucial for parents to know the facts,
and to feel comfortable sharing these facts with their children.<BR>
	<BR>
Some things parents can do include the following: be a good role model;
make sure your children feel safe sharing their fears and thoughts about
alcohol and drugs with you; use the media's portrayal of alcohol and marijuana
to start a dialogue with your kids about these substances; and help your
kids resist peer pressure by listening to their concerns and validating
them.<BR>
	<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Parents Should Know</CENTER>
</H2>
Here are some of the common reasons why kids use marijuana and other drugs
and some things you can do to counteract these reasons. You can copy and
distribute this sheet to parents, teachers and other adults who work with
children to let them know some of the reason's kids use marijuana and how
to counteract some these reasons. You can also ask businesses to share this
information with employees and customers and you can post it at religious
centers, grocery stores and health care facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kids use marijuana to feel grown up.</B> <BR>
Children like to imitate adults. This imitation takes on many forms as they
grow, including wearing their parents' clothes, copying the way that they
speak, and imitating some of their behaviors. This is because they think
that being grown up is a very desirable thing. Grownups have the freedom
to say and do anything they want. They can also eat and drink anything they
want.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take: </I>Let your children grow
up. The harder you try to rein them in, the harder your children may rebel.
In most cases, when you let your children have increasing amounts of independence
when they prove they can handle it, they are less likely to turn to alcohol
and drugs. You can also be a good role model for your children, point out
examples of irresponsible drinking and drug use. Use these incidences as
a starting point for constructive dialogue around these issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to fit in and belong.</B> <BR>
Children want others to like them. Sometimes the group they want to join
is using alcohol or marijuana. They may feel that if they start using these
drugs themselves they will fit in with the others better and become more
popular and comfortable socially. Establishing a clear position with a child
that alcohol and drugs are bad is not always enough to counteract all this
pressure. Children must also have a range of judgment skills to help them
make good decisions.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take: </I>Help your child deal
with peer pressure. You can do this by sharing information on a variety
of topics with your child and helping to establish a strong relationship
early on so he or she has the skills to resist pressures from other youth
and the ability to chose not to hang out with kids who use drugs. You can
also help your child understand how to act appropriately in social situations
and teach him or her how to build solid relationships with non-drug using
friends. In addition, act as a mentor by providing support and encouragement
to your child and setting aside time to spend together.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to relax and feel good. <BR>
</B>There is a lot in the environment today that makes things difficult
for kids today. These things include increased violence and gangs, economic
pressures, HIV and AIDS, changing family structures and easy access to alcohol,
drugs and tobacco. These factors may contribute to the upswing in substance
abuse among young people. Some of them think that using drugs will help
them forget about their problems.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take: </I>Help reduce stress in
your child's life. Allow your child to express his or her feelings and concerns.
Let the child also know that you, too, experience pain, fear, anger and
nervousness and that these are normal feelings. Help him or her to express
these feelings, without having to resort to violence. You can also teach
your child some relaxation exercises like deep breathing or sitting quietly
for 10 to 20 minutes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to take risks and rebel. <BR>
</B>Children need to learn how to take risks. This is an important part
of growing up. There are all kinds of risks that people of all ages take
everyday -- and young people take even more than adults, because they want
to push the limits. This is because to grow, children must learn a lot of
new skills that adults often take for granted.  As greater levels of risks
are achieved, children continue to look for opportunities to expand their
horizons and grow. That's why drugs and alcohol hold such allure for young
people.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take:</I> Talk to your child about
risk-taking and what it means. You can tell you child about all different
kinds of risk-taking and the advantages and disadvantages associated with
each one. The fact is, kids and adults both have to acknowledge the consequences
of risk-taking. There are some children who NEED lots of sensation or thrills
in their lives. They like loud noises. They need a lot of stimulation to
keep their attention. They seem to thrive on chaos. These young people are
particularly at high risk for alcohol and drug problems. In addition, some
young people really want to rebel against society by engaging in anti-social
behavior. You can provide supportive parenting to counteract these tendencies.
If you are warm and accepting of your child, you are less likely to raise
children who use drugs, alcohol and tobacco.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to satisfy curiosity.</B> <BR>
Even if parents have done an outstanding job educating and nurturing children,
there are some children who will remain innately curious about alcohol and
other drugs. And they may seek information about those drugs from unreliable
sources.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take:</I> Help your children get
the facts. Share information with your child about drugs and the consequences
of using them. You may also encourage your child do research on his or her
own. This may give the child additional ownership about the information
and prompt more learning as a result. The first bit of information you could
share is 1 (800) 729-6686. This is the phone number for the National Clearinghouse
for Alcohol and Drug Information. If your child has access to the Internet
or the World Wide Web, provide those addresses (Internet: telnet ncadi.health.org
or http://www.health.org). You can also show your child the devastating
effects of substance abuse -- take him or her to a local treatment center,
visit areas of your community plagued by substance abuse problems, or arrange
to visit the police station and talk to some of the officers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><CENTER>What Are Inhalants?</CENTER>
</H2>
Today, more than 1,000 legal and useful household, school and office products
are being used--primarily by youth--to get high. This practice is commonly
known as inhalant abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Inhalants are divided into the following four categories: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Volatile gases and solvents -- lighter fluid, barbecue grill gas, spray
paint, paint thinner and glue. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Aerosols -- hair spray, deodorants and other pressurized products that
are used more for the propellant capability than for the contents inside
the can. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nitrates -- Butyl nitrites, which are often known by the trade names
of Rush, Locker Room, Bolt and Climax and are used as room odorizers; and
amyl nitrates, which are packaged in capsules known as poppers and snappers
and were originally created for heart patients. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Anesthetic gases -- Nitrous oxide, which is known as the dentists laughing
gas is also available in small cylinders called whippets, which propel whipped
cream in commercial machines. 
</UL>
<B>These substances are abused in the following ways: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Sniffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the nose. A youngster
may sniff a container of white out, glue, paint thinner or gasoline to inhale
the fumes through the nostrils. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Huffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the mouth. A student
can spray paint on a handkerchief and hold it over his or her mouth and
breath in the fumes. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Bagging -- Inhaling the vapors through a bag. A youth can spray fumes
on a cloth or piece of clothing, then insert it into a plastic or paper
bag to increase the concentration of the vapors. Then he or she puts the
bag opening over the mouth or nose and breathes in. Some users may also
place their heads directly inside the bag.

<H2><CENTER>Warning Signs of Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
You may want to send the following list to your local newspaper and ask
the editor to run this to educate readers about the signs of inhalant abuse.
You can also create a poster or flier from this list and distribute to parents,
teachers and youth in your community, and post it in local schools, grocery
stores, churches and recreation centers. <BR>
<BR>
It is important for parents, teachers and young people to know some of the
signs of inhalant abuse, so they can recognize when someone is using household
products to get high. Some effects of inhalants are short-term, and they
vary greatly from product to product.<BR>
 <BR>
Some of the following symptoms listed below, provided by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, are warning signs that someone may be using inhalants: 
<UL>
<LI>Red, runny eyes or nose 
<LI>Sores around the mouth 
<LI>Chemical breath 
<LI>Drunk, dazed appearance 
<LI>Nausea 
<LI>Loss of appetite 
<LI>Anxiety or irritability 
<LI>Paint or stains on the body or clothing 
<LI>Chronic inhalant abusers are also anxious, easily excited, irritable
and restless. 
<LI>Inhalant withdrawal symptoms include hand tremors, headaches, nervousness
and sweating.

<H2><CENTER>Some Facts About Inhalants</CENTER>
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Inhalants -- including glue, paint and other regular household products
-- are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds, after
alcohol and tobacco.<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">1 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>As many as one in every five students in the United States has sniffed
or huffed (inhaled through the mouth) such products as markers, gasoline
and air fresheners by the time they reach seventh grade.<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">2
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Inhalant use is on the rise. The number of 8th graders reporting having
used inhalants at least once in their lifetime rose from 20 percent in 1994
to 22 percent in 1995. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">3</A> <BR>
<BR>
<LI>One of the greatest dangers is that while many youth admit to sniffing
some toxic items, they do not consider this to be inhalant abuse. These
products are easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and may give a
pleasurable effect by depressing the central nervous system. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">4
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Today, young people and adults abuse more than 1,000 common products.
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">5 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis put themselves at risk
for permanent and severe brain damage. This is because the human brain is
composed of about one-third fatty tissue. Inhalant vapors react with these
fatty tissues by literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic inhalant
abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks like
walking, talking and thinking. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">6</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Sudden Sniffing Death syndrome frequently occurs when someone inhales
high concentration aerosol sprays, model airplane glue and spot removers.
These items emit especially toxic fumes absorbed by the brain cells, kidneys,
liver and bone marrow. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">7</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Inhalant use often leads to other illicit drug use. Youngsters may try
inhalants first because they are legal, easy to get, inexpensive and difficult
to detect. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">8 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Because the chemicals in inhalants enter the lungs in such high concentrations,
they can have a more toxic affect than any other type of abused drug. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">9
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Each year, hundreds of children die from inhalant use, yet many parents
and educators remain ignorant of this silent epidemic. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">10
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nearly nine out of 10 parents say they would be very surprised if they
found out their children were using inhalants. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">11

<H2><CENTER>What You Can Do About Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
Inhalant abuse is a widespread--and serious--problem among youth today.
In fact, as many as one in five students abuses regular household substances--such
as glue, hair spray, lighter fluid and paint thinner--to get high. And unlike
alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, these products are easy for kids to obtain
and do not make adults suspicious if they see a child using them.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, these products can lead to a number of serious side affects
for users, including sudden death. And the problem is not getting better.
The rate of inhalant users continues to rise in states across the country,
prompting some schools to educate kids and parents about the dangers. But
unfortunately, many young inhalant users have dropped out of school or do
not attend classes. Therefore, these young people do not know the possible
consequences of their behavior. That's why it is crucial that we find ways
to warn them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Here are some steps you can take:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Involve a wide variety of local groups in your public education efforts.
You may want to include doctors, nurses, pharmacists, politicians, school
drug-education coordinators, law enforcement officers, teachers, youth,
parents, business owners, media representatives and clergy. Brainstorm together
ways to reach high-risk youth in your community. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Put up posters warning about the dangers of inhalant abuse in places
young people frequent, such as recreation centers, record stores, fast food
restaurants, pizza places, ice cream parlors, candy stores, movie theaters
and supermarkets. Be sure to list resources people can turn to for help.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local radio stations that play music that appeals to youth to run
public service announcements about inhalant abuse and the associated risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local movie theaters to run a public service announcement about
inhalant abuse before each movie. See if a local corporation or business
that caters to youth will donate the money to produce the PSA. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local newspaper to run a full-page advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse to warn parents and young people about the risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>See if your local cable station will run an advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse. Ask local students to write, direct, produce
and act in the ad. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local grocery stores to stuff fact sheets about inhalant abuse--and
how to get help--in customers bags. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local businesses--such as the gas or phone company--to include bill
stuffers about the dangers of inhalant abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask manufacturers of products that youth inhale to work with you to
find ways to reduce this abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Plan ahead for &quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week,&quot;
which is sponsored by the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition/Texas Prevention
Partnership and is held the third week in March. Ask your mayor or city
council to sign a proclamation recognizing this week in your city or town
and plan some events to call attention to this serious problem. (For more
information about this week, see <A HREF="others.html">What Others Have
Done</A>.) <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Call the photo editor at your local newspaper and offer to set up a
photograph of some of the products that can be misused as inhalants. This
can help to alert parents that some &quot;innocent-looking&quot; household
products can actually be deadly.

<UL>
<LI>Many innocent-looking substances stored in household cabinets, closets
and garages may actually be fatal. That's because young people abuse these
products to get high. That's the message from the National Inhalant Prevention
Coalition/Texas Prevention Partnership. They sponsor a week-long annual
campaign called, <I>&quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week:
They're Right Under Your Nose.&quot;</I> The goal of the campaign is to
alert communities to the danger of everyday products being inhaled or misused.
The campaign began in response to a 1992 Texas school survey that showed
one in four students have tried inhalants by the time they reach the seventh
grade. This national campaign relies on local groups to get the message
out in their communities. To do so, artwork, news releases and advertisements
are provided and can be tailored for individual schools, prevention coalitions,
cities and towns. In addition, videos and posters are available for a small
fee. In 1995, over 1,000 partners from almost every state joined the campaign.<B>
For more information, contact Harvey Weiss at (800) 269-4237.</B><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Illinois residents are getting a crash course in the dangers of inhalant
abuse, thanks to a statewide educational campaign there launched by the
lieutenant governor's office. The ongoing campaign, which began in 1994
and follows Texas' example, was sparked in response to survey findings that
inhalants are the fastest growing category of drug use in that state. In
fact, one in 10 Illinois teenagers abuses household projects to get high.
The statewide campaign, called &quot;Danger: Right Under Your Nose,&quot;
provides materials, tools and suggestions that communities can use to localize
the message. There is also an 800 number people can call for more information
about inhalants. The campaign has been very successful to date, raising
awareness about the problem and risks of inhalant abuse throughout the state.
<B>For more information about the campaign, call Debra Palandech at (312)
814-5220.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Letter to the Editor</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following letter--or use it as is--and send it to
the editor of your local newspaper</I>.<BR>
<HR>Dear Editor:<BR>
<BR>
White out. Glue. Nail polish remover. Lighter fluid. Paint. What do these
various household products all have in common? They all tragically kill
kids.<BR>
<BR>
Today, many young people in our community abuse such products that are readily
available in our medicine chests and on the shelves in our stores. They
inhale these and a host of other substances through the nose and/or mouth
to get a quick high.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, these kids are not aware of the high risks that come along
with this behavior. The fact is that each year hundreds of children die
from inhalant use--sometimes on their first try--yet many parents and educators
remain ignorant of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has sniffed or &quot;huffed&quot;
(inhaled through the mouth) such products as magic markers, gasoline and
air fresheners by the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; These products are easily available,
free or inexpensive, legal and may give a pleasurable affect by depressing
the central nervous system.<BR>
<BR>
And those kids who do not die from inhalants still put themselves at a risk
for a number of other serious side affects, including permanent and severe
brain damage. Chronic inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability
to perform everyday tasks like walking, talking and thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Please help to get the message out to parents and to kids that inhalants
are dangerous. If you suspect someone you know may be using inhalants, consult
a school counselor or a drug counseling center for help.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Sample Op-Ed</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following Sample Op-Ed to fit your community and then
ask your Editorial Page Editor at your local  newspaper to run it.<BR>
</I><HR><BR>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and crack
cocaine. But some of the most lethal drugs are simpler and easier to obtain.
<BR>
<BR>
We can find them in the drawers of our desks, stashed in our cabinets, and
lined up on our grocery store shelves. Things like paint, magic markers,
white out, lighter fluid, hair sprays, vegetable cooking sprays and air
fresheners. Things that are cheap and easy to obtain, and at the same time,
when inhaled can prove fatal.<BR>
<BR>
These and close to 1,000 other everyday household products are being abused
by our kids to get a quick high. They inhale them through their nose (sniffing)
or mouth (huffing). Most kids who try these products think they are harmless.
They do not know the facts.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that hundreds of children each year die from inhalant use--sometimes
on their first try. Nonetheless, many parents and educators remain ignorant
of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has tried inhalants by
the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; That is because these products are
easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and give a pleasurable affect
by depressing the central nervous system. <BR>
<BR>
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<BR>
<BR>
People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis and do not die put themselves
at risk for permanent and severe brain damage. Inhalant vapors react with
fatty tissues in the brain, literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic
inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks
like walking, talking and thinking. <BR>
<BR>
That's why we must warn our kids about the dangers of inhalants, and make
sure that they know enough not to try them.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the symptoms of inhalant abuse include red or runny eyes and/or
nose; spots and/or sores around the mouth; unusual breath odor; drunk, dazed
or dizzy appearance; correction fluid on fingernails; sitting with a pen
or marker near the nose; constantly smelling shirt sleeves; nausea and/or
loss of appetite; and paint or stain marks on clothing or on skin.<BR>
<BR>
If you suspect your child or someone else you know is using inhalants, please
call (NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF EITHER YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LOCAL INHALANT
ABUSE RESOURCE) for help.<BR>

<BR>

<H3>Prevention Works</H3>

<H2>THE FACT IS . . . .</H2>
</center>

<P>
<H3>SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS COSTLY:</H3> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>--The nation spends about $168 billion on alcohol and drug problems a year(FN-1)-- that's $675 for every man, woman and child in the country.(FN-2)


<P>--The amount the country spends on health care could be reduced by $90.4 billion if alcohol and other drug problems were prevented before they started.(FN-3)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><H3>PREVENTION WORKS TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE:</H3> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>--The number of adolescents (ages 12 to 17) who drink alcohol has decreased by almost 3 million since 1979 -- from 37 percent to 20 percent.(FN-4)


<P>--There has also been a significant decrease in illicit drug use among adolescents -- from 18 percent in 1979 to less than 7 percent in 1991. This represents 2.5 million young people who have stayed away from drugs.(FN-5)


<P>--Prevention messages about the dangers of drinking and driving have been reaching young people. In fact, the number of fatal alcohol-related car crashes among teens has declined by 55 percent over the past 10 years. However, such crashes among young adults aged 21 - 35 have only fallen by 32 percent, indicating the need for more targeted efforts.(FN-6)


<P>--A 1994 study by Cornell University Researchers of 6,000 students in New York state found that the odds of drinking, smoking or using marijuana were 40 percent lower among kids who participated in a prevention program during 7th, 8th and 9th grades than their counterparts who did not. (FN-7)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><H3>DESPITE OUR SUCCESSES, WE NEED TO STEP UP PREVENTION EFFORTS:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE> --A December 1994 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that nearly half (44 percent) of all college students are binge drinkers, consuming five or more drinks at a time. On a national scale, this means that approximately 3 million students a year binge drink, and 1.3 billion do so more than once a week.(FN-8)


<P>--Fifty percent of binge drinkers in this study said they had ridden with a driver who was high or drunk, and 40 percent of the males said they had driven after five or more drinks.(FN-9)


<P>--Binge drinking affects not only the drinker but also his or her peers -- physical assault, sexual harassment and impaired sleep and study time are some of the &quot;secondhand binge&quot; effects experienced by non-binging students as the result of the heavy drinking of their classmates.(FN-10)


<P>--The 1994 Monitoring the Future Survey found that marijuana use is up among 8th, 10th and 12th graders, and anti-drug attitudes are deteriorating.(FN-11 )


<P> --Specifically, over the past two or three years marijuana use has doubled among 8th graders (to 13 percent), grown by two-thirds among 10th graders (to 25 percent), and grown by 40 percent among 12th graders (to 31 percent).(FN-12)


<P>--Other illicit drugs that have been on the rise among students -- including LSD, hallucinogens, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, cocaine and crack.(FN-13)


<P>--In other Monitoring the Future survey findings, binge drinking has remained constant among students in 8th, 10th and 12th grades.  One in seven 8th graders reported having five or more drinks in the past two weeks, as did nearly one in four 10th graders, and more than one in every four seniors.(FN-14)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><H3>PREVENTION EFFORTS WORK -- AND MUST INVOLVE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY:</H3> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>--Prevention works best when all parts of the community make it a priority and get involved together. That means community leaders, policy makes, educators, clergy, business leaders, volunteers, parents, employers, employees, youth and social service providers, children and youth, and representatives of the media.(FN-15) (See recommendation 2 from Join Together's Public Policy Panel on Preventing Substance Abuse.)


<P>--Many liquor stores in South Central Los Angeles that were closed down during the 1992 riots are being replaced with other businesses. This is due to the work of the Center for Substance Abuse Partnership grantee there that has mobilized the whole community in this effort.(FN-16)


<P>--Close to 600 drug locations in Tacoma, Washington, have been closed since 1989, thanks to Tacoma's Campaign for Safe Streets. This campaign brings together volunteers from over 30 neighborhoods working to reclaim their streets from drug dealers.(FN-17)


<P>--In the Liberty City section of Miami, known for its heavy drug trafficking, the Miami Coalition had succeeded in bringing together clergy, schools and police to organize community watches, shut drug houses, clean up parks, and start community service and neighborhood beautification programs.(FN-18)


<P> --Drug treatment is now readily available in the Marshall Heights section of Washington, D.C., thanks to the efforts of Marshall Heights Fighting Back, operated through the Marshall Heights Community Development Corporation. This area of the nation's capital, which has a high rate of drug use and crime, had no drug treatment       capacity, so the Fighting Back program organized key members of the community to help build a drug treatment and social service program right in the neighborhood.(FN-19)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FORM ACTION="Prevention_PitchOutput.nclk" METHOD=POST>

Dear 
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Reporter" VALUE="Editor" SIZE=35>
:<br>


<P>Substance abuse prevention programs in our community are making great strides against alcohol and drug use and the resulting problems -- like violent crime, HIV-infection, domestic violence and fatal car crashes. Fewer young people today drink and use drugs than their counterparts a decade ago as a result of extensive efforts to educate them about the dangers.


<P>But several recent national studies have found this decrease in substance use to be slipping. For instance, the Harvard School of Public Health found that almost half of all college students now binge drink (five or more drinks at a time), and widespread binge drinking creates problems for other students on college campuses throughout the country. And the latest Monitoring the Future Study found that marijuana use is up among 8th, 10th and 12th graders.


<P>In light of these findings and talk in the new Congress to cut prevention funding, now would be an opportune time to take an in-depth look at some prevention programs at work in our community. Some examples of prevention programs are student organizations like Students Against Drunk Driving, after-school activities to keep kids off the streets, workplace programs that educate employees about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse and public awareness campaigns that get the message out throughout the community.


<P>These programs are really making a difference. By calling attention to these efforts, you can help these programs gain support to increase their effectiveness and create a healthier community.


<P>Please feel free to call me at <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Phone" VALUE="Phone number"> if you need help getting in touch with some local prevention programs.


<P>Sincerely,

<B>PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS YOUR BUSINESS</B>


<P>This is no time to cut prevention for illicit drug and alcohol abuse.


<P>Recent studies have shown us that more kids are using marijuana today. There's also widespread binge drinking on college campuses. And heroin dealers are having an introductory sale on a new, more powerful inhalable heroin to lure a new generation of customers.


<P>Other recent stories also bring news of new AIDS cases attributable to drug use and tell us that a large portion of our prison inmates have alcohol and drug addictions.


<P>Appropriately applied prevention strategies work to reduce illicit drug and alcohol use -- just as immunizations, when given, work to reduce the spread of other diseases. However, much of the progress we have made against illicit drugs and excessive alcohol in the last decade is at risk if we do not continue existing prevention efforts. And in order for prevention to be even more effective, all sectors of a community must join together.


<P>For example, volunteers from 30 neighborhoods in Tacoma, Washington, joined forces and were able to close down almost 600 drug dealing locations there. And a community-wide effort in South Central Los Angeles has been able to keep some liquor stores that closed during the 1992 riots from reopening. Some of these stores were replaced with other businesses.  


<P>A national panel examining the substance abuse problem in America recently recommended that all public and private organizations incorporate prevention principles and themes into their ongoing initiatives. In addition, the panel recommended that private sector and community groups work together on prevention efforts to amplify their impact. For instance, parents and schools should link their prevention efforts with those of police, businesses and religious groups. The panel also urged government and the private sector to support such efforts with long-term commitments in funding, training and other resources.


<P>Here are some other things that can really make a difference:<br>

Businesses, in conjunction with social service agencies, can create drug-free workplace policies and provide information about alcohol and drugs to their employees, many of whom are parents; Recreation programs and schools can work with kids to plan creative alternatives to drinking and drug use after school and on the weekends; Religious leaders can work with treatment providers to reach out through their congregations to those who need help; The media can host public forums for coalitions in their communities to find solutions to local substance abuse problems; Employers can make jobs available for high-risk youth and people coming out of treatment programs; and Law enforcement can work to mentor high-risk youth. Please act now to make sure that substance abuse prevention policies and programs are a priority in our community.

<H3>Treatment Works &amp; We Can Prove It</H3>
<H2>The Fact Is. . .</H2>

</center>
<B>Here are some key findings from recent surveys that illustrate how substance abuse
treatment saves money and leads to healthier communities:
</B>
<hr>
<P><H3>RECOVERY SERVICES: THE CALIFORNIA DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT ASSESSMENT 
(CALDATA).</H3>
The largest and most rigorous study done in California released in August surveyed 3,000 providers and participants in four types of treatment programs in the state between October 1991, and September 1992. In a second followup phase of the study, 1,850 treatment recipients were interviewed 15 months after treatment.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> <B>FINDINGS</B>

<P><B>Cost benefits to taxpayers</B>. 
<p>For every dollar invested in treatment, taxpayers save $7.14 in future costs. The cost of treating approximately 150,000 participants represented in the CALDATA study in 1992 was $209 million, while the benefits received during  treatment and the first year afterwards were worth approximately $1.5 billion in cost savings to taxpayers  primarily through the avoidance of crime.


<P><B>Decline in criminal activities</B>. 
<p>Following treatment, the level of crime declined by two-thirds. The greater the length of time spent in treatment, the greater the reduction in criminal activities.


<P><B>Improvements in health and hospitalizations.</B> 
<p>Emergency room admissions were reduced by one third following treatment. A one-third reduction in hospitalizations was reported following treatment.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>


<P><H3>NASADAD: INVEST IN TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG PROBLEMS: IT PAYS:</H3>


<P>The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors gathered studies conducted by 14 state alcohol and drug abuse agencies on the effectiveness of treatment for alcohol and drug problems. These studies were submitted by state directors from 14 states.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Crime</B>
<p>Maine's Office of Substance Abuse compared client outcome status of 180 clients admitted to treatment programs between September, 1990, and October 1991 to determine their outcome status at least one year following treatment. The state found that 79 percent of clients who received substance abuse treatment were not arrested one year after the treatment. People who resumed drinking since treatment had a 31 percent arrest rate versus 8 percent for those who did not drink.


<P><B>Health Care</B> 
<p>Ohio did a one-year followup of 668 clients who had completed treatment, and found they had a 66 percent decrease in hospital admissions (from 32 percent to 11 percent) and a 41 decrease in emergency room visits (from 34 percent to 20 percent).


<P>Minnesota's State AOD Authority, which operates the Consolidated Chemical Dependency Treatment Fund to provide treatment services to more than 17,000 clients, has done an extensive evaluation of its programs and reports that these services have resulted in an abstinence rate of 64 percent for clients six months after treatment. For chemical dependency clients, the state estimates that it saves $22 million in annual health care costs by providing treatment.


<P>Iowa measured health-related outcomes for over 1,400 clients by comparing the number of hospitilizations a client had in the six months prior to treatment admission with the six month period before the followup assessment date. The results showed that clients who completed treatment had a 12 percent less hospitalization rate than their counterparts who did not treatment.


<P><B>Employment</B> 
<p>Ohio's Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services contracted with New Standards, Inc. to conduct a Comprehensive Assessment Treatment Outcomes Registry (CATOR) analysis of 668 residents one year after completing treatment. The findings include a decrease in worker absenteeism by 89 percent, tardiness by 92 percent and on-the-job injuries by 57 percent.


<P>Colorado compared clients status at treatment admission with clients status nine to 23 months following discharge. For fiscal years 1990 and 1991, over 26,000 treatment admissions were represented in a stratified random sample of 868 clients. The state found the income of clients following treatment increased by an average of $2,760 a year. The percentage of clients employed also improved by 70 percent.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><H3><B>THE RUTGERS STUDY: SOCIOECONOMIC EVALUATIONS OF ADDICTIONS TREATMENT</B></H3>
 In the fall of 1992, researchers at Rutgers University were asked by the President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws to review existing scientific literature on the cost-offsets of providing addiction treatment in the United States. Five populations were examined  Blue Cross/Blue Shield and private insurance eligibles, Medicare/Medicaid eligibles, employee groups, criminal justice populations and pregnant women. Information was derived from a series of computerized and hand literature searches, as well as from materials provided by HMOs, employee assistance programs, major insurance carriers, and officials in state health departments and federal government. The report pulls together a number of points from all the literature in an integrated review.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>FINDINGS:</B>


<P><B>Health care</B> 
<p>The average alcoholic or other drug addict is conservatively estimated to be using more than 20 times the medical services of a non-addict.


<P>On the average, untreated alcoholics generally incur general health care costs that are at least 100 percent higher than those of nonalcoholics. In the last 12 months before treatment, the alcoholics costs are close to 300 percent higher.


<P><B>Business</B>


<P>Untreated addictions cost American businesses from $50 billion to $100 billion each year in increased medical claims and disability costs from illnesses and injuries, theft, absenteeism and decreased productivity.


<P>Treatment results in a reduction in sick-claim benefits, a better than 50 percent reduction in absenteeism and a similar reduction in days on disability.


<P>After treatment, reduction in days lost due to illness, sickness claims and hospitalization dropped by around 50 percent.


<P><B>Cost Savings</B>


<P>Treatment has projected returns of anywhere from $2 to $10 for every dollar spent on treatment.


<P>Although estimates of the cost of untreated addiction run as high as $172 billion annually, dollars directed to supporting prevention and treatment amount to less than one percent of the annual cost of untreated addiction.


<P> Two reports published by the RAND Drug Policy Research Center, Modeling the Demand for Cocaine and Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs, make the case that providing treatment is cost-effective. The research provided in the reports was sponsored by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the U.S. Army, and RAND's Social Policy Department.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>SAMPLE PITCH LETTER</H2>
</center>

<P>
You can take the following letter and localize it to encourage a feature 
reporter at your daily paper to take a look at the treatment system in your 
area. If you don't have a certain reporter in mind, you may want to send it 
to the Editor.<br>
If you wish, you can generate a ready to print letter by filling in the form boxes and pressing [Generate] at the bottom.

<FORM ACTION="TxWorks_PitchOutput.nclk" METHOD=POST>

Dear 
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Reporter" VALUE="Reporter's Name" SIZE=35>
:<br>


<P>In recent months, you may have heard about several national and state 
studies that show that providing alcohol and drug treatment is an effective 
way to reduce health care costs and crime in our communities.


<P>As the holiday season approaches, alcohol and drug problems are often 
exacerbated for many people. Knowing that treatment does work -- and 
knowing where to find it -- is an important first step for many of your 
readers who have alcohol or drug problems.


<P>This is a great time for you to do a feature or even a series on various 
alcohol and drug treatment options available in the area and show how they 
help people to get their lives back on track.


<P>Some angles you might take include looking at the difference between public 
and private treatment services and/or inpatient and outpatient services. 
You might also speak with people who have completed treatment to see the 
impact it had on their lives, as well as with business owners and human 
resource specialists who refer employees with addiction to treatment. (You 
can add or substitute other story ideas here.)


<P>I can help you with these and other facets of stories you may want to 
write. Enclosed is a fact sheet with some key findings from the recent 
studies I mentioned.  I will contact you next week to follow up.


<P>Sincerely,


<P>

<P>
<B>PROVIDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IS COST EFFECTIVE</B>



<P>Every single day, our televisions and newspapers are filled with the 
details of brutal murders, fatal car crashes, incidents of domestic 
violence and child abuse, babies born addicted to crack, and increasing 
numbers of people infected with the deadly HIV.   


<P>While most people are shocked and saddened by these tragedies, few ever 
stop to consider their underlying cause.


<P>Yet, my colleagues and I working in the substance abuse field know all too 
well that the roots of these and other equally devastating social ills can 
often be linked to alcohol and drug addictions.


<P>Today, more than 18 million alcohol abusers and five million drug abusers 
in the United States need treatment, according to a study done last year by 
Brandeis University. And this abuse dramatically affects us all -- in lives 
needlessly lost, gang violence in our neighborhoods, decreased productivity 
in our workplaces, drunk driving crashes on our roads, more hospital 
emergency room visits in our communities and higher health care costs that 
we ultimately pay for out of our own pockets.


<P>This problem, indeed, belongs to each of us!


<P>Over the past year, the nation has been engaged in a debate over health 
care reform and we have heard many people say that we can't afford to pay 
for treatment of alcohol and drug addictions under a national health plan.


<P>But the truth is -- we can't afford NOT to pay for these services.


<P>Several credible studies have been released to illustrate that providing 
substance abuse treatment actually costs LESS than paying for the related 
social problems that result when addictions are ignored.


<P>In fact, a study of California alcohol and drug treatment services found 
that for every dollar invested in treatment, taxpayers save $7.14 in future 
costs, primarily due to a decrease in crime.
        

<P>Nationally, the cost of untreated addiction runs as high as $172 billion a 
year, yet dollars directed to prevention and treatment equal less than one 
percent of this amount, according to researchers at Rutgers University. And 
these researchers estimate that untreated alcoholics incur health care 
costs that are 100 percent higher than those of nonalcoholics. 


<P>And as the addiction progresses, this number keeps rising. In fact, in the 
last 12 months before an alcoholic seeks treatment, his or her health care 
costs tend to be close to 300 percent higher than that of someone without a 
substance abuse problem.


<P>That's why treating the addiction proves to be so cost-effective. The 
Rutgers study found that providing treatment results in a number of 
cost-savings in the health care and work arenas-- including a significant 
reduction in sick-claim benefits, and a decrease of more than 50 percent in 
both absenteeism and in days lost to disability.


<P>For instance, Minnesota estimates that it saves $22 million in annual 
health care costs by providing treatment for drug addicts. And in Ohio, 
providing treatment decreased worker absenteeism by 89 percent, tardiness 
by 92 percent and on-the-job injuries by 57 percent.


<P>These successes -- and others like them in other states throughout the 
country-- are compiled in a report released earlier this fall by the 
National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Directors called Invest in 
Treatment: It Works! 


<P>In every example included in this report, the outcome was the same: 
investing in alcohol and drug treatment dramatically saves money.


<P>We can use these successes from other states to encourage our legislators 
to take a closer look at the public treatment system and ensure it is 
accessible to all Americans who need it.  It is clear that our money is 
better spent on expanding substance abuse services than on paying for the 
crime, violence, cirrhosis, HIV and other health and social costs that 
often result.


<P>Maybe then there would be more room for positive stories on the 6 o'clock 
news and in the daily paper.

<H3>Domestic Violence and Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>The Fact Is ...</H2>
</center>

<UL>
	<LI>Every 12 seconds a woman is beaten by her partner, reports Women's Work, a public arts program funded through Liz Claiborne, Inc.


	<LI>More than 2.5 million women a year are victims of violence in the United States, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.


	<LI>Research shows that alcohol and drugs are associated with up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases.


	<LI>Experts suggest that men who batter women may drink in order to give themselves permission to be violent. Men also learn that violent behavior that occurs while drinking may be excused or even forgiven.


	<LI>Medical expenses from domestic violence total from $3 to $5 billion each year. Businesses lose another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and lowered productivity, according to the Colorado Domestic Violence Coalition.


	<LI>The National Crime Victimization Survey found that domestic violence accounts for almost 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 doctors appointments each year.


	<LI>A study sponsored by the Sheriff's Department of Lemon Grove, Calif., found that domestic violence occurs more frequently in areas with high concentrations of liquor stores.


	<LI>A study of 234 men charged with assaulting their mates in Marion County, Indiana, found that 32 percent of the men had a drug problem and 22 percent had dual drug and alcohol problems.


	<LI>Studies have found that by treating substance abuse problems,


	<LI><P>incidences of domestic violence may be decreased.


	<LI>Counselors for batterers report that treatment for domestic violence alone is not enough --batterers with addictions must also receive substance abuse -treatment as well.

<P>ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT HELPS REDUCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE


<P>BOSTON -- &quot;When my husband gets drunk, he slaps me around,&quot; says Ruth, a soft-spoken woman in her late 40's, with visible bruises on her arms and her neck. &quot;He gets into these rages and you never know where they will lead,&quot; she says, her voice quivering as she speaks. &quot;Like last week, he went out drinking with his friends and when he came home, he punched me so hard that I fell to the floor and I couldn't get up.&quot;


<P>Every 12 seconds in the United States a woman is battered by her mate, according to Women's Work, a public arts program run by the women's clothing manufacturer, Liz Claiborne, Inc. And many of these incidents are related to alcohol and drug abuse.  But until recently, many women were afraid to talk about their ordeals -- fearing for their safety or that of their children.  The recent brutal murder of Nicole Simpson, the ex-wife of athlete and sportscaster O.J. Simpson, brought the issue of domestic violence into the national spotlight. O.J. has been charged with Nicole's death.


<P>&quot;How many people have to die to get this country to recognize and do something about the very real problem of domestic violence?&quot; asks Lila Brown, director of the local Coalition Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse. &quot;We know that more than 2.5 million women are victims of violence in this country every year, and that alcohol and drugs are associated with up to 50 percent of all spousal attacks. Isn't it time we woke up and did something about this?&quot;


<P>While not all batterers consume alcohol, studies have shown that for those who drink, alcohol increases the chance and severity of an attack.  And it is of no surprise that the most severe batterers tend to be the heaviest drinkers. Experts explain that men who batter women drink to give themselves permission to be violent.  Medical expenses for domestic violence total from $3 to $5 billion each year, according to the Colorado Domestic Violence Coalition. And businesses lose another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and reduced productivity related to domestic violence.  In fact, a survey by the Department of Justice found that domestic violence accounts for 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 doctors appointments a year.


<P>&quot;The fact is, we can't afford not to treat substance abuse and the related domestic violence that so often results against women,&quot; Brown says. She points out that for substance abusers, treatment for domestic violence alone will not be effective without simultaneously providing treatment for the alcohol and/or drug addictions.  &quot;It is cost-effective to treat the substance abuse problem, rather than just paying for the damage that results,&quot; Brown says, adding that the damage is measured not only in money but also in lives. &quot;That's why as the nation looks to implement a new health plan, it is absolutely essential that substance abuse treatment be included in this plan for all those who need it.&quot;<p>

<P><B>ALCOHOL AND DRUG Treatment is Crucial TO REDUCE  HOMELESSNESS</B>


<P>For many men, their homes are their castles. But for many women in the United States, these &quot;castles&quot; are filled with pain and fear. These women are the victims of domestic violence and most of them feel far from secure in their homes, knowing their spouses could strike at any time. While the attacks of battering are often unpredictable, many women know that when their husbands abuse alcohol and drugs, the beatings will be worse. In fact, alcohol and drugs are involved in up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases.


<P>Experts says that some men use these substances to give themselves permission to be more violent. Therefore, it is no surprise that such attacks are all the more severe.  Domestic violence actually accounts for almost 100,000 days of hospitalizations in this nation, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 doctors appointments each year, according to a national crime victimization survey done by the Department of Justice. Yet until recently, many victims have felt they could not tell medical personnel the truth behind their injuries, fearing for their own safety and for their children.  But today, more and more domestic violence victims are beginning to speak out -- and the country is beginning to listen. The brutal murder of domestic-violence victim Nicole Brown Simpson has made it impossible for people to look the other way anymore.


<P>While this growing attention to this issue is crucial, that alone is not enough. As a nation it is important that we not only create avenues for women to voice their ordeals, we need to respond with viable escapes from their ongoing nightmares. We can do this by treating batterers -- both for their violent patterns and for their substance abuse addictions. As the country reforms its health care system, we must ensure that proper substance abuse services are available to all who need them.

<H2>THE FACT IS . . . .</H2>
</center>


<UL>
	<LI>Marijuana is the most widely used drug in the United States, and research has shown that it has many serious and harmful consequences. Some of the short term 	effects include impairments in learning and memory, perception, judgment and 	complex motor skills. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">1</A>


	<LI>Thirty-one percent of high school seniors use marijuana today -- this is an increase of forty percent over the past three years. In addition, marijuana use has 	doubled among eighth graders. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">2</A>

	<LI>Active daily marijuana use is up as well, reaching 3.6 percent among high school seniors in 1994 -- up by 50 percent from the 1993 level. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">3</A>

	<LI>The perceived risk of marijuana use among youngsters has declined. In fact, only 65 percent of kids think there is any danger associated with marijuana use, down 	from 79 percent in 1991. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">4</A>


	<LI>Emergency room episodes related to marijuana or hashish rose by 48 percent between 1991 and 1992. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">5</A>

	<LI>The number of teens arrested for marijuana use has increased sharply. The latest data collected in 12 major urban areas found that the national median of 	arrested/detained teens testing positive for marijuana jumped from 16.5 percent to 	26 percent from 1992 to 1993. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">6</A>

	<LI>Young people who use marijuana regularly, with or without other illicit drugs, 	have higher rates of skipping school, fighting, delinquency, arrests and health 	problems than their counterparts. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">7</A>


	<LI>Teenagers (12 to 17 years old) who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than their counterparts who do not use marijuana. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">8</A>


	<LI>Marijuana smoke contains some of the same carcinogens and toxic particulates as tobacco, sometimes in higher concentrations. Daily use of 1 to 3 joints a day appears to produce some of the same lung diseases (bronchitis, emphysema and 	bronchial asthma) and potential cancer risk as smoking five times as many cigarettes. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">9</A>

Dear 
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Columnist" VALUE="Columnist's Name" SIZE=40>


<P>More eighth graders in our community are smoking marijuana. And a study on gateway drugs conducted by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse has shown that kids who get high are 85 times more likely to start using other, more dangerous drugs -- like crack, cocaine and heroin -- than their non-using counterparts.


<P>Consider the fact that smoking one to three joints a day has the respiratory risk of smoking five times as many cigarettes, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This means that kids who get high put themselves at risk for bronchitis, emphysema and cancer. 


<P>Marijuana use also causes impairments in learning and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills. In addition, users are more likely to skip school, get into fights and get arrested than their classmates who don't do drugs.


<P>Despite all the negative consequences, marijuana use is on the rise. In fact, 31 percent of all high school seniors now smoke marijuana, according to the Monitoring the Future Survey released in December of 1994. This is an increase of 40 percent over the past three years. In addition, marijuana use has doubled among eighth graders over the past few years. 


<P>You might want to examine the extent of the drug problem in our community and see why these kids are turning to drugs again. Your column could help call attention to this alarming trend and educate parents, teachers and other role models about the importance of helping kids remain drug-free.


<P>If I can be of any assistance, please contact me at <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Phone" VALUE="Your phone #" SIZE=15>. 


<P>Sincerely,

<center><B>MARIJUANA USE IS ON THE RISE AMONG STUDENTS</B></center>


<P>	A few afternoons a week, 17-year-old Sarah Smith gets high with her friends. She thinks smoking a joint is a "cool" thing to do. What she doesn't know is that marijuana use could seriously harm her.<p>
	Today, a full 31 percent of high school seniors get high, according to the latest Monitoring the Future Survey released in December of 1994.  This is an increase of forty percent over the past three years. And marijuana usage has doubled among eighth graders over the past few years.<p>
	These findings are pretty alarming -- especially when you realize the risks associated with marijuana usage. Consider the fact that smoking a joint every day is equivalent to smoking five times as many cigarettes. This means that kids who smoke marijuana put themselves at high risk for cancer, bronchitis and emphysema.<p>
	Marijuana use also affects memory, learning, judgment and motor skills. And kids who use marijuana on a regular basis have a higher rate of skipping school, fighting, delinquency and arrests than their classmates who don't use drugs.<BR>
	In addition, marijuana is considered a "gateway drug," which means that users often go on to experiment with other, even more dangerous drugs, such as crack, cocaine and heroin.  In fact, kids who get high are 85 times more likely to use other drugs than their classmates, according to a recent study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. </P>



<P>	Many young marijuana users are unaware of these potential -- and dangerous -- consequences. The Monitoring the Future Survey found that fewer youngsters today than in the past recognize the risks associated with getting high. Only 65 percent of respondents thought there was any danger in smoking marijuana, down from 79 percent in 1991.<p>
	This means that we have some serious work cut out for us in educating kids about the risks and harms of marijuana use. We must take every opportunity to prevent teens from using this drug, and to help those who already do use to quit. <p>
	Prevention programs already in place have made great strides over the past decade in reducing substance abuse. But as these latest findings remind us, we can not stop here. We must understand that every seven years there is a whole new market of school-aged kids who must be introduced to these anti-drug messages. <p>
	Just as the Walt Disney Corporation must market its movies and products to each new generation of youngsters, we must market our anti-drug messages to each new generation as well.<p>

<H3>Homelessness and Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>FACTS ABOUT HOMELESSNESS</H2></center>


<P><B>The fact is. . .</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>--As many as 7 million people in the United States today are 
homeless, according to estimates by the federal government.


<P>--Half of all homeless adults--that is 3.5 million Americans--have 
a drug or alcohol problem, cites the National Coalition for the 
Homeless (NCH).


<P>--There are not enough alcohol and drug treatment services 
available for homeless people with addictions -- 80 percent of 
local treatment programs surveyed by the NCH were forced to turn 
people away. (What is the treatment capacity versus the need in 
your area?)


<P>--Homeless people with untreated substance abuse problems are at a 
higher risk for HIV infection and are more likely to have serious 
health problems and severe mental illness, reports NCH. Homeless 
people are more likely to be arrested, to be victimized on the 
streets or to suffer an early death.


<P>Many homeless people who undergo treatment for their addictions are 
able to move off the streets into temporary or permanent housing.  
For instance:


<P>--The Harbor House, a Salvation Army shelter in St. Louis, 
Missouri, provides two treatment programs for homeless people with 
substance abuse problems. Seventy-five percent of graduates from 
both programs go on to secure stable jobs and housing.


<P>--Clean and Sober Streets, a Washington. D.C.-based drug and 
alcohol treatment and rehabilitation community serving homeless 
people, said at least 70 percent of their graduates stay clean 
after graduating from the program and move into their own houses.


<P>--At the O'Hara Outreach Program for homeless men in Chicago, 95 
percent of the clients have diagnosable substance abuse problems. 
About half of these men receive treatment and of them, 75 percent 
successfully graduate and go on to obtain housing.

<P>PROVIDING ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT REDUCES HOMELESSNESS


<P>BOSTON--Paul Smith makes his home on the streets. Most nights he can be found on a park bench, huddled beneath a 
tattered blanket with a whiskey bottle clutched close to his chest. 
(Replace with an example of homelessness in your area.)


<P>Although this is a lonely situation, Paul is far from alone. Close 
to seven million single adults in the United States today are 
homeless, according to statistics released by the federal 
government. And half--or about 3.5 million--of these men and women 
have alcohol and drug addictions, reports the National Coalition 
for the Homeless.


<P>But despite these high numbers, treatment options are very limited 
for people who can't afford to pay. And those programs that do 
exist can not begin to handle the pressing need for their services. 
In fact, a survey of homeless treatment programs conducted by the 
National Coalition found that fully 80 percent of them were forced 
to turn people away.


<P>This means that for a lot of homeless people, their chances of 
breaking the cycle of addiction and getting into permanent homes 
look bleak.  But for those men and women who are fortunate enough 
to get into a treatment program, their odds of getting off the 
streets greatly improve.


<P>For instance, 70 percent of the graduates of Clean and Sober 
Streets, a drug and alcohol treatment community for disadvantaged 


<P>people in Washington, D.C., kick their addictions and move into 
permanent housing. And the Harbor House, a Salvation Army homeless 
shelter in St. Louis. Missouri, has a 75 percent success rate for 
graduates of its two treatment programs.


<P>&quot;We know that treatment is effective in getting homeless people 
with addictions clean and into their own homes,&quot; said William 
Arena, director of Green's Shelter for Men in Boston. &quot;The problem 
is, many Americans say they don't want to pay to provide such 
services for the homeless. What they fail to realize is that they 
are paying for the problem anyway -- just in health care and 
disability,&quot; he said. (Replace with quote from director of your 
local shelter.)


<P>&quot;If we are going to tackle homelessness and other social problems 
facing our country today, people have to wake up and realize that 
now--as the country moves to develop a national health plan--we 
must ensure that substance abuse treatment services are available 
for all who need them,&quot; Green said.

<P><B>ALCOHOL AND DRUG Treatment is Crucial TO REDUCE  HOMELESSNESS</B>


<P>For seven million Americans today, home is a cardboard box or a park bench or the back seat of an abandoned car. Or if they are lucky, a bed in an emergency shelter.Homelessness is sweeping the nation, as more and more people find it increasingly difficult to find affordable housing. And about half--or 3.5 million--of these men and women suffer from alcohol or drug addictions, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, making it hard for them to hold down a job.


<P>Those with substance abuse problems who do make it into temporary shelters are steered by staff into detox programs, but severely limited space in these programs means that not everyone gets the services they need. In fact, a survey of treatment programs that serve homeless persons by NCH found that 80 percent of them are forced to turn people away.


<P>This means that for a lot of homeless people, their chances of breaking the cycle of addiction look bleak.  This is tragic, since many programs treating homeless alcoholics and addicts have been successful in getting them off the streets and into permanent homes.


<P>For instance, The Harbor House, a Salvation Army shelter in St. Louis, Missouri, provides two treatment programs for homeless people with substance abuse problems. Seventy-five percent of graduates from both programs go on to secure stable jobs and housing. And Clean and Sober Streets, a Washington. D.C.-based drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation community serving homeless people, said at least 70 percent of their graduates stay clean after graduating from the program and move into their own homes.


<P>But the waiting lists for programs like as these are long. And for those addicts who live on the streets, every day can feel like an eternity.


<P>That's why as the nation undertakes health care reform, we must make sure that adequate alcohol and drug treatment services are available for all Americans. You can help educate your public officials about the link between substance abuse problems and homelessness. The fact is, we all ay for substance abuse problems -- the choice is whether to pay to treat these problems and help people go on to lead productive lives and get permanent homes or whether we would rather pay for the disability and health care costs for men and women who remain homeless due to untreated addictions.

<H3>HIV-Infection and Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>FACTS ABOUT HIV</H2></center>


<P><H3>The fact is. . .</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>--There are approximately one million people infected with HIV in the United States, according to the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">Center for Disease Control</A>. This is one in every 250 people.


<P>--In 1992, close to 35 percent of all AIDS cases reported to the CDC were associated with drug injection. In addition, more than 80 percent of all HIV-positive women inject drugs or have sexual partners who do.


<P>--And about two million heterosexual men and women put themselves at risk for getting infected with HIV through intravenous drug use and engaging in risky (i.e. unprotected) sexual behavior, the CDC reports.


<P>--The reason people who inject drugs and share drug-injecting equipment are at high-risk for becoming infected is because needles and syringes often transfer HIV-infected blood among drug users.


<P>--Some drug users also put themselves at risk for HIV by trading sex for cocaine and other non-injected drugs. In doing so, they have multiple sex partners and do not use protection.


<P>--Alcohol and drug use often results in impaired judgment. This may lead people to engage in unprotected sex, and this puts them at risk for HIV infection.


<P>--Studies done by the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A> in New York City and Miami found that young crack users who had never injected drugs or had male homosexual intercourse were still at high-risk for HIV infection -- particularly the females. In fact, 32 percent of crack-using women got HIV in NYC and 45 percent in Miami, compared with 11 percent of crack-using males in both places.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B>TREATMENT WORKS IN REDUCING THE RISK OF HIV INFECTION</B>.


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>--Treating people with drug and alcohol addictions can help reduce their risk of getting infected with HIV - both by stopping them from catching the disease through the use of needles and syringes and by preventing them from engaging in risky sexual behavior.


<P>--In the state of Maryland, it costs $120,000 to treat one AIDS patient. Compare this with the cost of a pilot needle exchange program soon-to-open in Baltimore, which on a budget of $160,000 will serve up to 1,000 addicts -- providing them with clean needles to prevent the spread of HIV and helping to steer them into treatment.


<P>There are 361,509 adults in the United States who have been diagnosed with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), according to a report soon-to-be-released by the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">Center for Disease Control</A> (<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A>).


<P>Out of these adults, 86,961 of them contracted the HIV virus through intravenous drug use, the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A> reports. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>PROVIDING ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT HELPS REDUCE THE RISK OF HIV-INFECTION</B>


<P>MILWAUKEE--&quot;I never thought it could happen to me,&quot; says 33-year- old Betty Johnson, an artist who found out last year that she is HIV-positive. (REPLACE WITH LOCAL EXAMPLE.)


<P>Until then, Johnson used to shoot up heroin with her friends, passing around a hypodermic needle that ultimately infected her with tainted blood.


<P>&quot;In those days, I never worried about AIDS. I was only thinking of my next high,&quot; Johnson admits.


<P>But today she is forced to worry about AIDS all the time.


<P>Like Johnson, about one million people in the United States are infected with the HIV virus, according to recent estimates by the Centers for Disease Control. This means that one person out of every 250 tests positive for the HIV antibodies that develop into six months after infection.


<P>And like Johnson, close to 35 percent of these men and women who are HIV-positive contracted the virus through intravenous drug use.


<P>&quot;I see cases like Johnson's all the time,&quot; says Dr. Paul Rubin, an infectious disease specialist at Milwaukee Hospital.  &quot;There are many people out there who injected drugs or got drunk and had unprotected sex and now they are paying for it dearly -- with their lives,&quot; he says.


<P>&quot;It is crucial that we stop this tragic disease in its tracks,&quot; stresses Rubin. &quot;While we don't have a cure yet for people who have the virus, we can work to prevent others from catching it,&quot; he says.


<P>Rubin points that one way to do this is to provide substance abuse treatment for all who need it.


<P>&quot;If we can educate people about how to have protected sex and help those with alcohol and drug problems to overcome their addictions, they would not put themselves at such high risk for HIV,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;That's why we must make sure that an adequate substance abuse benefit is included in any new health plan that is passed.&quot;

<P><B>ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT IS CRUCIAL TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF HIV</B>


<P>In the waiting room of the HIV clinic at Milwaukee Hospital, clients come from a wide range of backgrounds.


<P>But they are all hoping for the same thing -- to be told that they are not infected with HIV.


<P>Unfortunately, about one in every 250 men and women will not be so lucky.


<P>Today, close to one million men and women in the United States have HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS.  And about two million people put themselves at risk for contracting the virus every day. No longer considered the disease of only homosexual men, today the possibility of AIDS affects everybody.


<P>Researchers now know that injecting drugs and engaging in unprotected sex are two of the leading culprits that put people at risk for HIV.  This is because injecting drug users often share the same needle with other people and if there is any infected blood in the needle, it is easily passed between addicts. Close to 35 percent of people with HIV inject intravenous drugs, according to the Centers for Disease Control.


<P>But not all addicts who are HIV-positive inject drugs. Some people while drunk or high, may take more chances when they have sex and are less likely to use condoms. Recent studies by the CDC in New York and Miami found that young crack users who had never injected drugs or had male homosexual encounters were still at very high risk for HIV. And women were particularly vulnerable to the virus. This is because studies have shown that the virus is more easily transmitted from man to woman than from woman to man. Of those crack addicts surveyed, 32 percent of the women in New York tested positive for HIV and 45 percent of the women in Miami, compared with 11 percent of the men in both cities.


<P>Those who have already contracted HIV can only hope for a miracle. But for people with alcohol and drug problems who continue to engage in risky behaviors and thus far have managed to allude the virus, there is still time for them to seek treatment.


<P>That's why as the nation undergoes health reform, it is crucial that we ensure an adequate substance abuse benefit is available to all who need it. Somebody's life might be counting on it. You can get the message out about the link between substance abuse and HIV and the need to provide addicts with access to treatment.

<H2>WARNING SIGNS THAT DRINKING MAY BE A PROBLEM</H2>
</center>

<P>Many older people who drink do so because they are lonely or bored with their lives. The problem could get worse with time if the person does not receive help. Health care experts say the following warning signs indicate when drinking could be a problem. You may want to repackage this list to include your organization's newsletter; post it at senior centers, your local library or supermarkets; or ask your community newspaper to run it along with a list of local resources people can call for help.


<UL>
<LI>Do you neglect your personal appearance when you drink?


<LI>Do you drink so much you forget to feed your pets and clean your house?


<LI>Do you drink in the middle of the day?


<LI>Do you suffer injuries as a result of your drinking?


<LI>Do you become defensive if someone mentions your drinking?


<LI>Do you seek out people with whom you can drink?


<LI>Do you avoid places where no drinking takes place?


<LI>Do you experience:

<UL>
<LI>a flushed face?
<LI>trembling?
<LI>gaps in memory?
<LI>depression?
<LI>fatigue?
<LI>weight loss?
<LI>aggression?
</UL>


</UL>


<P>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, you may want to:

<UL>
<LI>Talk to a family member or a friend about this problem.
<LI>Call your doctor or local addiction center for help.
<LI>Attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting or seek out another self-help group.
<LI>Get help as soon as you can. The problem will only get worse with time.
</UL>


<P>If you would like more information about older people and alcohol, call the American Association of Retired Persons at (202) 434-2200.

<B>SOME SENIORS USE ALCOHOL TO DEAL WITH LONELINESS</B>
</center>


<P>	CHICAGO -- Since his wife died six months ago, Richard Moore, aged 76, has found himself drinking more and drinking earlier. Lately, he even forgets to shower and change his clothes. (REPLACE WITH A LOCAL EXAMPLE.)<br>
  Like Richard, between 1.1 and 2.3 million senior citizens use alcohol to deal with their loneliness and boredom. In fact, widowers over the age of 75 have the highest rate of alcoholism in the country, according to a report released in 1992 by the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging.<br> Yet drinking problems among the elderly are often difficult for doctors to detect -- often because the symptoms mirror those of old age. However, such problems are crucial to address, since people's metabolism slows as they age and therefore, they are more strongly affected by alcohol than their younger counterparts.<br>
 	A 1993 study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association 
found that alcoholism among older people is such a widespread problem that more 
seniors are hospitalized for alcohol-related problems that for heart attacks.
And older alcoholics who are depressed comprise the highest risk group for committing suicide, reports the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). In addition, 30 percent of all Alcoholics Anonymous members are over 50 years of age. <br>
 The good news is that older people with alcohol addictions have the highest rate of success in becoming sober after treatment, NIAAA reports. The key is to educate people about the problem of alcohol abuse among older Americans and to make sure that there are adequate treatment options available to them.<br>

<H2>SAMPLE OP-ED</H2>

<P><I>You can submit the following Op-Ed as is to your community newspaper or localize it with examples and statistics of substance abuse among the elderly in your city or town. You can sign this with your name or ask one of your board members to sign it.</I>

<P><H3>SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS DON'T DISCRIMINATE BY AGE</H3>
		Many Americans look forward to their "golden years" -- that time when they can retire from work and concentrate on leisure activities. But for some, those years are lost in an alcohol or prescription-drug induced blur.<br>
	People over age 65 make up about 12 percent of the United States population, but this age group consumes more than 30 of all prescription drugs and 70 percent of over-the-counter remedies. And the risk of becoming dependent on some of these medications is high. Changes in absorption, distribution and metabolism as people age can alter a body's reaction to such substances.<br>
	The same is true with alcohol. Diminished liver function means that older adults get higher blood alcohol levels than younger counterparts who consume the same amount of alcohol. And people with untreated alcohol addictions will carry these addictions into old age. In addition, experts say that at least 15 percent of older Americans will develop a drinking problem when they retire or when a spouse dies.<br>
	Such addictions prove costly to the United States. Medicare spends more than $230 million a year for alcohol-related problems. And a typical hospital stay for alcohol abuse costs more than $4,500 a year, according to Medicare figures. Overall, 23 percent of Medicare costs are attributable to alcohol, drugs or tobacco addictions. And a recent study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York estimates that more than $1 trillion will be drained from the Medicare system by problems related to substance abuse.<br>
	While taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for such costs, older addicts also suffer by having a severely reduced quality of life. This is why it is essential we help treat these addictions, rather than just paying the price for them. We need to ensure that substance abuse treatment is available for every person who needs it -- whether it is a 16-year-old daughter or a 75-year-old grandfather.<br>
	People must take the opportunity to let their legislators know that providing substance abuse treatment for all Americans -- including older Americans -- is a crucial component of health care.<br>

However, such problems are crucial to address, since people's metabolism slows as they age and therefore, they are more strongly affected by alcohol than their younger counterparts.<br>
 	A 1993 study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association 
found that alcoholism among older people is such a widespread problem that more 
seniors are hospitalized for alcohol-related problems that for heart attacks.
And older alcoholics who are depressed comprise the highest risk group for committing suicide, reports the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). In addition, 30 percent of all Alcoholics Anonymous members are over 50 years of age. <br>
 The good news is that older people with alcohol addictions have the highest rate of success in becoming sober after treatment, NIAAA reports. The key is to educate people about the problem of alcohol abuse among older Americans and to make sure that there are adequate treatment options available to them.<br>

<H3><CENTER>FACT SHEET: THE NATION'S SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
--Each year, there are more deaths and disabilities from  substance abuse
than from any other preventable cause. Of the two million U.S. deaths each
year, one in four is attributable to alcohol, illicit drug or tobacco use.
(Substance Abuse: The Nation's Number One Health Problem, Brandeis University,
1993.)<BR>
<BR>
--Nearly one of every four Americans is directly affected by the alcohol
or drugdependency of a family member, friend or co-worker. (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
--The latest National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found: 
<UL>
<LI>An estimated 13 million Americans use illegal drugs, and 10 million
use marijuana. 
<LI>13 million Americans had five or more drinks in one sitting on five
ormore occasions in one month. 60 million Americans -- including 4 million
people aged 12 to 17 -- smoke cigarettes. (1994 National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse.)
</UL>
<BR>
--Over a third of all eighth graders have used some illicit drug, including
inhalants, while over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50 percent
of all 12th graders have done so. (Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency
and Prevention, 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
--Fewer youth today than in 1992 believe that marijuana use is harmful to
their health. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
--During the mid-1980s, the public began to understand the devastation of
drug use and addiction. Nationwide, drug prevention efforts came together
in schools,media, the workplace, and communities, resulting in dramatic
shifts in attitudestoward drugs and declines of more than 50 percent in
the number of new triers and non-addicted users in all segments of the population.
(Partnership for a Drug-Free America, 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
--Despite this success, however, diminishing national leadership, public
focus and resource allocation threaten future success. (Partnership for
a Drug-Free America, 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
--The United States spends about $268 billion on alcohol and drug problems
a year -- that's $675 for every man, woman and child in the country. (Lewis,
Ed.D., Social and Health Economic Services, Ltd., 1992)<BR>
<BR>
--The amount this country spends of health care each year could be reduced
by $90.4 billion if alcohol and drug problems were prevented before they
started. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration, 1992.)<BR>
<BR>
--Each day 800,000 people receive services in a special alcohol or drug
program.Nevertheless, only about one-fourth of those needing alcohol or
drug treatment get it. (Substance Abuse: The Nation's Number One Health
Problem, Brandeis University, 1993.)<BR>
<BR>
--Alcohol-related driving crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescentsand
young adults in the United States. In fact, in 1993 approximately three
million people were injured in motor vehicle crashes and close to 40,000
died. (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
--More than 1.7 million people are the victims of alcohol-related crimes
in the United States each year. And over 4,000 people die as a result of
alcohol-related violence annually. (National Public Research Institute,
1994)<BR>
<BR>
--As many as 83 percent of arrestees in the United States had used illicit
substances within the 48 hours prior to their arrest. (Drug Use Forecasting,
1993.)<BR>
<BR>
--About 70 percent of all illicit drug users are employed. (U.S. Department
of Labor, 1990.)<BR>
<BR>
--Close to 35 percent of all AIDS cases are associated with drug injection.
In addition, more than 80 percent of all HIV-positive women inject drugs
or have sexual partners who do. (Center for Disease Control, 1992.)<BR>

<H3><CENTER>JOIN TOGETHER 1995 NATIONAL SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Join Together surveyed 4,200 leaders of community anti-drug abuse coalitions
fighting substance abuse around the country last summer to learn about their
activities, views and impact. Here are some of the things respondents said:<BR>
<BR>
Local leaders believe the substance abuse problem is either not improving
(48%) or getting worse( 36%). For the first time, people in rural communities
are as concerned as those in the big cities. Only 16 % of community leaders
think the problem is improving.<BR>
<BR>
When asked to rate how key leaders are responding to increasing substance
abuse problems, the local coalition leaders charge that most key elected
officials arepaying LESS attention to this problem. Fifty four percent (54%)
say that Congress is paying less attention, and  37% say that their governors
and state elected officials are paying less attention to substance abuse
than 2 years ago.In contrast, 29% say that mayors have INCREASED  their
attention to substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
Business and labor fared even worse from coalition leaders, with their performance
rated  fair to poor by 79% and 88% respectively. Media and religiousgroups
 also received fair to poor marks by 64% and 69% respectively.<BR>
<BR>
Community coalition leaders strongly support public policy changes to prevent
and reduce substance abuse: 90% support restrictions on alcohol advertising,
92%call for lower legal blood alcohol limits for drivers, and 80% support
immediateaccess to drug treatment for everyone who needs it. Further, 77%
strongly opposelegalization of drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Access to treatment is critical to solving substance abuse:  In communities
where access to treatment is increasing (31%), leaders are more likely to
say the problem is getting better or remaining the same; conversely, in
communities where access to treatment is decreasing (30%),  people say the
problem is getting worse.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal government's role in fostering the community coalition movement
is essential.  Many community coalitions (38%) are highly dependent on federal
money, which is currently on the chopping block. Only about 22% of coalition
funds comes from state governments.  Recognizing the need for additional
money, a growing number (24%)  of coalitions diversified their funding base
over the past two years.<BR>
<BR>
The American tradition of neighbors joining together to solve community
problems, like substance abuse, is flourishing. Over the last two years,
49% of coalition leaders report that citizen participation is growing and
new coalitions are forming to deal with substance abuse, and related problems
like HIV, teen smoking and gang violence.<BR>

</H3>
<BR>
Dear Editor:<BR>
<BR>
Drug use -- and related crime, HIV infections and homelessness -- is on
the risein Stamford, (replace with your community's name) as it is in other
communities around the nation. We issue a call to action to influential
people in our city, particularly elected officials, business leaders and
citizens, to support substance abuse efforts. <BR>
<BR>
A national study conducted by Join Together, a resource center helping communities
fight substance abuse, found that elected officials and business andreligious
leaders received poor marks from more than 4,000 anti-drug groups around
the country for their lack of involvement fighting alcohol and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
I have enclosed some of the survey highlights, which I think will greatly
interest you. As you well know, alcohol and drug-related crime stories often
runon the front page of your newspaper. And hospital and shelter records
in our community detail the frightening scope of AIDS and domestic violence.
<BR>
<BR>
I urge you to take a close look at substance abuse here in Stamford (replace
with your community's name) and see how the problem -- and the commitment
of keyleaders to fight it -- here compares with the rest of the nation.
<BR>
<BR>
You may want to interview youth, parents, teachers and community groups
about their perception of local alcohol and drug abuse problems and ask
them what solutions they suggest. Then you could talk to business leaders
and elected officials and ask them if they are involved in efforts to fight
such problems. Ican suggest some people you can talk with. I can also give
you suggestions of ways more people in the community can help make a difference.<BR>
<BR>
By raising public awareness about the substance abuse problem in Stamford
(replace with your community's name), we can get all the key groups in the
community working together to help fight it.<BR>
<BR>
If you have any questions, you can contact me at (your phone number). <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H3><CENTER>SAMPLE PRESS RELEASE</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
You can localize the following press release with some examples of substance
abuse problems -- and solutions -- at work in your community. Send this
release along with a  copy of the key findings from the national survey
to the editor atyour local newspaper.<BR>
<BR>
MORE LOCAL GROUPS NEED TO JOIN IN ANTI-SUBSTANCE ABUSE EFFORTS<BR>
<BR>
STAMFORD, Conn.--Beer. Wine Coolers. Marijuana: These are some of the drugs
of choice for the kids who live in our community.  <BR>
<BR>
The fact is that substance abuse is on the rise among youth -- not only
here in Stamford (replace with your community's name) but also across the
country.   And just at a time when we need them the most, many key leaders
and institutionswhose support is crucial to successful anti-drug efforts
have been withdrawing from the fight.        <BR>
<BR>
A recent national survey documents this alarming trend and sends out a warning
call for these groups to rejoin the effort.  The survey, conducted by Join
Together, a national resource center helping communities fight substance
abuse, found that critical participation from some groups -- including politicians,
business leaders, labor, churches and the media--is lacking.        <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We will be losing another generation of our kids to alcohol and drugs
if these and other key groups do not help us get the message out about all
the dangers associated with substance abuse,&quot; said Michael Smith, head
of the local Anti-Substance Abuse Coalition, which is run through the Mayor's
Office (replace with your organization's name). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Perhaps some of these groups assumed that the war on drugs was won
when abuse levels dropped in the 1980s, but the reality is that the problem
is increasing again among our children and we need everyone in the community
to take an activerole in our anti-substance abuse efforts to make them truly
effective,&quot; Smith said.<BR>
<BR>
Some groups in Stamford that are heavily involved in local efforts to reduce
alcohol and drug abuse have been able to accomplish great things. For instance
. . . .  (give some examples here of effective anti-substance abuse efforts
taken on by local business, recreation groups, clergy, etc.)         To
find out how you can help fight alcohol and drugs in Stamford (replace with
your community's name), call (your organization's name) at (your phone number).#

You can tailor the following op-ed with local examples and statistics and
send it to newspapers in your area. <BR>
<BR>
KEY INSTITUTIONS NEED TO JOIN ANTI-SUBSTANCE ABUSE EFFORTS        <BR>
<BR>
Missing in action: that's the status of elected officials, businesses, labor,
media and religious groups in the nation's war against drugs.        <BR>
<BR>
This finding comes from a recent national survey of 4,200 community coalitions
fighting substance abuse. When asked to rate the performance of such key
institutions, respondents said they are NOT as involved in anti-substance
abuse efforts as they could be.        <BR>
<BR>
This is alarming news; especially since alcohol and drug problems are on
the rise in communities like ours across the country.        <BR>
<BR>
In Stamford (replace with your community's name),  many programs are hard
at work battling substance abuse and related problems -- such as violent
crime, fatal car crashes, domestic violence, homelessness and HIV infection.
But these programs can not win this battle without support from other groups.
        <BR>
<BR>
Some of the ways you can help: ask your company to start a drug-free workplace
program; help schools bring kids and parents together to talk openly about
alcohol and drugs; write to legislators demanding they make substance abuse
problems a priority; ask your church or temple to sponsor events to raise
money for substance abuse programs; brainstorm with neighbors about ways
to keep your street drug-free; ask the media to recognize outstanding people
in the communitywho are making a difference; or volunteer a few hours a
week to help a local substance abuse organization.        <BR>
For more information about how to get involved in local efforts, call the
Stamford Substance Abuse Coalition at  (203) 555-1234. (Replace with your
organization's name and number).<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Surveys: <BR>
Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<B>November 9, 1995 </B>
<H3>Hundreds of Volunteers Canvas<BR>
Neighborhoods Near Schools and <BR>
Find Over 1,000 Tobacco Outlets</H3>
<BR>
Join Together, a national resource for communities fighting substance abuse
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, recently conducted a nationwide
survey on underage access to tobacco. Community volunteers acted individually,
or formed teams, and canvassed their neighborhoods to measure the extent
of cigarette availability within a quarter-mile radius of schools. They
counted the number of tobacco sales locations in convenience, grocery and
liquor stores, gas stations, restaurants, and vending machines. Community
teams recorded results on a summary sheet, and sent them back to Join Together
for analysis and development of this report. <BR>
<BR>
The importance of tobacco control projects centers around the fact that
each day, more than 3,000 young people begin to smoke-or more than 1 million
each year, and that number is on the rise. The Surgeon General has stated
that most effective preventive programs to reduce youth smoking are communitywide
ones that combine education and public policy approaches. The placement
of tobacco retail outlets near schools (proximity and advertising), especially
elementary schools, has potentially harmful implications for youth, since
these factors interact to encourage youth to take up the habit. This Join
Together project is a first step in raising the level of awareness as to
youth access to tobacco among community citizens and youth, as well as setting
the stage for further communitywide public policy action. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>JOIN TOGETHER TOBACCO PROJECT DESCRIPTION </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Purpose Of This Project: For communities to count the number of outlets
(i.e. convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, gas stations and
vending machines, etc.) that sell cigarettes within a quarter-mile radius
of a public school. You can then use this information to determine the underage
tobacco policies and priorities of these stores. 
<H3>Why You Should Participate:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>To measure the extent of cigarette availability near schools in your
community. 
<LI>To release this information to the press. 
<LI>To raise public awareness in your community about underage smoking.
</OL>
<H3>HOW TO GET STARTED: </H3>
<OL>
<LI>Use the FACT SHEET, the PROJECT DESCRIPTION and the suggestions on HOW
TO ORGANIZE LOCAL GROUPS to alert residents to the problem of youth access
to tobacco and get them to join up with you to assess the extent of the
problem locally. Be sure to include youth in your efforts! 
<LI>Select a school (elementary, middle or high school) in your community
that will be your base. Pick a day and distribute copies of the WORKSHEET
we've provided to participants. Ask them to go out and count the number
of stores and vending machines within a quarter-mile radius of that school
that sell tobacco products and record their results of these worksheets.
Tally the results from all the worksheets onto the RESULTS FORM for the
scope of tobacco availability in this area. Disseminate the results to the
media and other interested groups and also fax a copy back to Join Together.
<LI>Use the SAMPLE PITCH LETTER to interest your local media in coming along
with you to compile this data. This could make a good news story in your
local paper or on a local television station. Suggest a newspaper photographer
accompany you as well. 
<LI>Arrange an editorial board meeting with the editorial editor of your
local newspaper and use the national statistics from the fact sheet, as
well as your local findings, as talking points. Ask the newspaper to run
an editorial suggesting ACTION STEPS the community can take to reduce the
problem. For instance, the editorial might urge retailers to remove cigarette
displays that appeal to youth and to place tobacco products behind counters
to make them less available. Tailor the SAMPLE OP-ED with your findings
and ask the newspaper to run it to encourage residents to get involved in
local efforts to reduce youth access to tobacco. 
<LI>Use the examples of WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE for suggestions on how to
tackle the availability of tobacco in your area. Use the RESOURCES and FURTHER
READING to develop your own communitywide strategy.

<center><H3>Tobacco and Youth</H3>
<P><H2>THE FACT IS. . .</H2> <BR></center>
<BR>
--Each day, three thousand youth in the United States become regular smokers
- that's more than 1 million each year. Many of these youth will die prematurely
from smoking-related illnesses. 1 <BR>
<BR>
--Smoking among eighth graders increased by 30% between 1991 - 1994. 2 <BR>
<BR>
--Although it is now illegal in all states to sell cigarettes to persons
under age 18, kids have easy access to tobacco products. It has been estimated
that underage youth can purchase cigarettes successfully 70%-80% of the
time over the counter, and 90%-100% of the time through vending machines.
3 <BR>
<BR>
--Each year, merchants illegally sell minors 947 million packs of cigarettes
and 26 million containers of spitting tobacco. These products are worth
$1.26 billion, and they generate $221 million in tobacco industry profits.
4 <BR>
<BR>
--About 80 percent of adolescent smokers report having at least one close
friend who smokes. And about half of adolescent smokers have parents who
smoke. 5 <BR>
<BR>
--Cigarettes are seen as a &quot;gateway drug&quot; meaning cigarette use
is likely to precede the use of alcohol or illegal drugs. One recent study
found that current youth smokers, aged 12-21 years, were three times more
likely to have used alcohol within the past 30 days, and were thirteen times
more likely to have used marijuana than youth who had never smoked. 6 <BR>
<BR>
--Among young people, those with poorer grades and lower self images are
most likely to start using tobacco. 7 <BR>
<BR>
--Most young people who have smoked as few as 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
are addicted to nicotine and report that they want to quit but are unable
to do so. 8 <BR>
<BR>
--Since the start of the &quot;Old Joe&quot; campaign in 1988, Camel's share
of the illegal children's market has increased from 0.5% to 32.8%, representing
about $476 million in annual sales in 1991. (R.J. Reynolds spends an estimated
$22 million a year on Camel ads.) 9 <BR>

HOW TO ORGANIZE LOCAL GROUPS </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
It is easier to bring about lasting change when you have the support of
a cross-section of organizations and people representing your community.
That's why it is important to try to involve as many groups of people as
possible in your efforts to count the number of stores and outlets that
sell tobacco within a quarter-mile of a local public school. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to helping you with this project, these groups can also offer
valuable resources to help your organization be more successful. <BR>
<BR>
Some groups that can assist your efforts: 
<UL>
<LI>Students 
<LI>Parents 
<LI>Teachers 
<LI>Parent/Teacher Organizations 
<LI>Teachers' Unions 
<LI>Highway Safety Agencies 
<LI>Insurance Companies 
<LI>Health Care Workers 
<LI>Public Health Care Officials 
<LI>Police 
<LI>Media 
<LI>MADD 
<LI>SADD 
<LI>Neighborhood groups 
<LI>Civic organizations 
<LI>Chamber of Commerce 
<LI>Local legislators 
<LI>Religious groups 
<LI>Senior Citizens 
</UL>
Some ways to get these groups to join you: 
<OL>
<LI>Publicize your event in the calendar section of your local newspaper
and ask your local radio station to mention it on the air. 
<LI>Call representatives from these groups and extend a personal invitation.
<LI>Send a written announcement in the mail. 
<LI>Put up posters in schools, grocery stores and churches 
<LI>Announce this project in your organization's newsletter, in the school
newspaper, and through a mailing to parents and the media. 
</OL>

SAMPLE PITCH LETTER </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Dear Editor: <BR>
<BR>
As you know, it is illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase tobacco. Nonetheless,
kids in our community are increasingly beginning to smoke cigarettes by
the ages of 12 and 13. And cigarette smoking is on the rise among kids in
communities like ours across the nation. In fact, a recent University of
Michigan study recently found that smoking by eighth graders has increased
by 30 percent over the past three years. This finding tells us that we need
to do a better job of raising public awareness about the dangers of tobacco
use and in discouraging retailers from illegally selling to youth. <BR>
<BR>
To determine just how available tobacco products are in our neighborhoods,
citizens will be coming together on Saturday, Oct. 7, to count the number
of outlets (stores, gas stations, vending machines, etc.) that sell tobacco
within a quarter-mile radius of Kendall Middle School. (REPLACE WITH YOUR
OWN DETAILS.) Many of these places are easily accessible to kids on their
way to and from school. <BR>
<BR>
We invite you and a photographer from your newspaper to join our efforts.
We will be meeting in front of Kendall at 10 a.m. (REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN
DETAILS.) Our findings will be of great interest to your readers, many of
whom have children and grandchildren in our community. We need your help
in getting the message out that smoking is dangerous to our youth. We also
encourage you to call on retailers to take steps to prevent kids from being
able to buy tobacco products. <BR>
<BR>
I can also put you in touch with some students, parents, former smokers
and health care workers if you are interested in doing a feature or a series
on kids who smoke and why, as well as the risks of such behavior. <BR>
<BR>
We will be I will contact you next week to follow up on this. In the meantime,
if you have any questions, you can call me at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER). <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>
<BR>

</H2>
<BR>
Once you have documented the availability of tobacco near a public school
in your community, you may want to mobilize other groups to team up with
you to take some of the following steps: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>--Initiate sting operations to pinpoint which stores actually sell tobacco
products to youth under age 18 (which is illegal); 
<LI>--Look at the placement and advertising of tobacco products in stores
to see if they are displayed in places that appeal to youth; 
<LI>--See if stores have proper warnings posted to remind consumers that
it is illegal to sell cigarettes to youth; 
<LI>--Consider providing tobacco retailer training; 
<LI>--Count cigarette advertisements near schools, including posters, billboards
and promotional giveaways; 
<LI>--Ask retailers to sign a pledge promising not to illegally sell cigarettes
to youth; 
<LI>--Ask your city council to ban vending machines; 
<LI>--Get youth involved in all of your efforts.

<H3>Youth Access to Tobacco</H3>
<H2>SAMPLE OP-ED</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>You can tailor the following Op-Ed with your findings about tobacco availability in your community and submit it to your local newspaper. Sign this with your name or ask an influential board members to author it.
<hr><br>

<P>TOBACCO PRODUCTS MAY BE TOO AVAILABLE TO YOUTH


<P>What is it about smoker's breath, nicotine-stained teeth and a hacking cough that draws more than one million kids each year to start smoking? 
	

<P>Perhaps it is the easy availability of tobacco in places near our schools that makes it easy for teens to try cigarettes. Consider the alarming fact that in the quarter-mile radius around Kendall Middle School there are 12 stores and vending machines selling tobacco. (REPLACE WITH YOUR LOCAL DATA.) This sends a subtle message to our youth that smoking for them is socially acceptable. And many of those who smoke will die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses.
	

<P>It is illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase tobacco, yet studies have found that this law is rarely a deterrent to keep youth from buying. The fact is that youth can purchase cigarettes successfully 70%-80% of the time over the counter, and 90%-100% of the time through vending machines. And each year merchants illegally sell 947 million packs of cigarettes to minors and 26 million containers of spitting tobacco. These products are worth $1.26 billion, and they generate $221 million in tobacco industry profits.
	

<P>The latest Monitoring the Future Study (released by the University of Michigan in July) found that smoking has increased by 30 percent among eighth graders over the past four years. This sends a clear signal that we need to reinvigorate our efforts to educate youth about the dangers of tobacco use and also to make sure that it is less available to them.
	

<P>Some of the ways we can do this include: "stings" -- sending youth under cover to find out which stores will sell them cigarettes; seeing if stores use displays that appeal to kids; providing tobacco retailer training for store owners and youth; counting cigarette advertisements near schools, including signs, posters, billboards and promotional giveaways; asking the city council to ban vending machines in our community; and asking store owners to partner with others to prevent kids from smoking in our community.
	

<P>We can keep kids from smoking -- and putting themselves in danger of premature death from cigarette-related illnesses -- if we all work together. 
	

<P>If you are interested in joining a communitywide effort to reduce the availability of cigarettes to kids, please contact (YOUR ORGANIZATION) at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER).


<P>Sincerely,<br>

<H2>WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE. . .</H2>

</CENTER



<P>

Gloucester Prevention Network, Stop Using Nicotine (SUN) Coalition

Cigarette vending machines are banned in the sea-side town of Gloucester, Massachusetts, thanks to the efforts of four seventh grade girls there.  The girls, who wanted to keep their peers from smoking, circulated a petition among residents to get support for keeping vending machines out of the community. Then, with the help of the SUN Coalition, they submitted the petition to the city council and got them to pass a local ordinance. Now the neighboring town of Salem is also considering following Gloucester's lead. For more information, contact Phillip Salzman, Program Director of the Gloucester Prevention Network, or Pamela Dungan, Tobacco Control Coordinator, 96 Main Street, Gloucester, MA  01930.  Tel: (508) 281-0311.  





<P> "GROSS" -- Get Rid of Second Hand Smoke

Recognizing that illegal single cigarette sales lure youth to smoke, GROSS initiated a major letter writing campaign to state and federal agencies asking them to crack down on the problem.  The organization also sent copies of state laws to outlets that illegally sold single cigarettes, in an attempt to get them to stop. This campaign did successfully discourage many retailers from selling single cigarettes. For more information, contact Rob Perry or Joe Perry, Co-Chairmen, P.O. Box 765, Kiefer, OK  74041.  (918) 321-5077.





<P>The Uptown Coalition for Tobacco Control and Public Health.

A cigarette test-marketing campaign aimed at African American youth galvanized Philadelphia residents to action. Refusing to let their youngsters risk their health to sample the Uptown cigarettes, parents got together through the Uptown Coalition for Tobacco Control and Public Health and demanded the tobacco company  remove this product from their city. Supporting this effort were numerous local, state and national organizations. The coalition's efforts were ultimately successful: R.J. Reynolds finally agreed to remove Uptown cigarettes from the market.  For more information, contact Reverend Jesse Brown at (215) 225-5232.  





<P> "HORA" -- Hispanics On the Rise Again

The large number of cigarette advertisements on billboards in a Hispanic neighborhood in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, prompted a 17-year-old youth there to action. With the support of a group called HORA, he counted the number of cigarette billboards in his neighborhood and then went to the city council and asked them to replace these ads with ones that would send a more positive message to kids. (Source: "The Surgeon General's Report for Kids About Smoking." U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health,  March 1994.

<H3>Binge Drinking on Campuses</H3>
<H2>THE FACT IS.. .</CENTER>
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Nearly half of all college students binge drink. (Binge drinking is
defined as five or more drinks at a time for men, four of more drinks for
women.) On a national scale, this is about three million students. (Footnote
1) 
<LI>On campuses where binge drinking is rampant (where more than 70 percent
of the student body binge drinks) the vast majority of college students
&oacute; 87 percent &oacute; have experienced one or more problems as a
result of their peers' binge drinking. These problems include physical assault,
sexual harassment and impaired sleep and study time.(Footnote 2) 
<LI>As many as 360,000 of the nation's 12 million undergraduates will ultimately
die from alcohol-related causes while in school. This is more than the number
who will get MAs and PhDs combined. (Footnote 3) 
<LI>Alcohol on college campuses is a factor in 40 percent of all academic
problems and 28 percent of all dropouts. (Footnote 4) 
<LI>College students drink an estimated four billion cans of beer each year.
And the total amount of alcohol consumed by them annually is 430 million
gallons, which is enough for each college and university in the United States
to fill an Olympic-sized pool. (Footnote 5) 
<LI>Each year, college students spend $5.5 billion on alcohol (mostly beer).
This is more than they spend on books, soda, coffee, juice and milk combined.
On a typical campus, the average amount a student spends on alcohol is $466
a year. (Footnote 6) 
<LI>Students at schools with high levels of binge drinking are three times
more likely to report being hit, pushed, sexually assaulted or experience
unwanted sexual advances by other students who had been drinking than their
counterparts who reside at schools with less drinking. (Footnote 7) 
<LI>The number of college women who drink to get drunk has more than tripled
in the past 10 years &oacute; rising from 10 percent to 35 percent. (Footnote
8) 
<LI>Nearly one-third of college students surveyed said they wished alcohol
was not readily available at campus events. (Footnote 9) 
<LI>Beer brewers spend an estimated $15-20 million annually to promote their
products to college students. (Footnote 10)

<H2><CENTER>What Community Leaders Can Do: Finding the Local Angle </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
The statistics provided in this Join Together Monthly Action Kit show the
scope of binge drinking on college campuses nationwide. With the start of
school right around the corner, many reporters might want to take an in-depth
look at this trend. However, to make the information even more valuable
to your community paper, you can supplement the national picture with statistics
and anecdotes about what is happening on the local level. We all like to
read about what is happening in our own neighborhoods and in our own communities.
And local stories that have a national context are even more valuable to
reporters, because they show how their community compares to others around
the country. <BR>
<BR>
To localize the information in their kit on binge drinking, you may want
to consider the following ideas: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Talk to students on your organization's youth advisory board and find
out their perceptions about college drinking. 
<LI>Convene a focus group of college students and share these national statistics
with them and get their reaction. See how accurate they think these statistics
describe what is going on in your area. Invite a reporter to attend this
session. 
<LI>Check with the administrators of local colleges to find out how prevalent
binge drinking is in your area. Find out what types of alcohol policies
are in place. Do they have restrictions on fraternity and sorority parties?
Have these rules gotten stricter in the last year or two? If so, why? 
<LI>Even if there are no colleges or universities in your town, you can
talk to parents of college students to find out what is happening with their
children. 
<LI>Find out if there are server training programs in place in your community,
especially in bars and liquor stores that college students frequent. Are
sanctions enforced? 
<LI>Call health clinics at colleges and/or in your town and find out what
the relationship is between alcohol and rapes, violence and sexually-transmitted
diseases. Ask what treatment options are available. You can also check with
employees at your local hospital and with campus and/or community police
to find out the connection between alcohol and other problems. 
<LI>Find out if there are student groups sponsoring alcohol-free activities.
If so, suggest that a reporter contact these groups to learn more about
them. 
<LI>Suggest a reporter go visit local campuses (or if there are none, then
places where college students home for the summer hang out) and interview
students about their drinking habits and those of their peers. 
</UL>
<HR>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>COMMUNITY ACTION STEPS </CENTER>
</H2>
<H3><CENTER>What Students Can Do </CENTER>
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>--Come together and define the drinking problem on their campuses. Have
them suggest solutions. 
<LI>--If there are no alcohol-free dorms on campuses, form a committee to
implement one. 
<LI>--Find out if there is an alcohol-policy on their campus. If not, suggest
the school start one. 
<LI>--Suggest fraternities and sororities sponsor alcohol-free events. 
<LI>--Get petitions signed to eliminate advertising of beer specials and
happy hours on campus. 
<LI>--Start free ride services so students don't drive drunk. 
<LI>--Find out if there are any organized groups of students against alcohol
abuse like Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD). If not, students may want
to start one. 
<LI>--Ask the college newspaper to do an expose on drinking on campus and
the problems that result. 
<LI>--Suggest students work to change policies in your community or state.
For instance, if your state does not currently have zero tolerance laws,
students can work to get laws implemented making it illegal for minors to
drive with any alcohol in their bodies; support a ban on alcohol advertising
and promotion on college campuses; and propose increased taxes on alcohol
products. 
<LI>--Bring together college officials and local activists with local owners
of liquor stores and bars to find common solutions to underage drinking.
<LI>--Post facts about substance abuse in dorms, bathrooms, common areas
and health centers. 
<LI>--Sponsor alcohol-free events &oacute;like dances, bands, speakers,
readings&oacute; that give students things to do besides drinking. 
<LI>--Make sure AA and other treatment options are available to help those
already having alcohol problems. 
</UL>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
You may want to use these ideas as is, or adapt them to fit your community,
and:
<UL>
<LI>Send them to administrators and health centers at local colleges and
high schools 
<LI>Include them in your organization's newsletter 
<LI>Post them at community pools or recreation centers 
<LI>Provide them to youth groups &oacute;Give them to students to hang in
their dorms 
<LI>Put them up at grocery stores, churches, temples and libraries. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>SAMPLE PITCH LETTER </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
You may want to send the following sample pitch letter (with local examples)
to an editor or reporter at your local newspaper. <BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
Dear Editor: <BR>
<BR>
Did you know that college students drink an estimated FOUR BILLION cans
of beer each year? This is a total of 430 million gallons -- enough to fill
an Olympic-sized pool at every college and university in the country. And
students spend $5.5 billion on alcohol annually (or an average of $466 per
student), which is more than they spend on books, coffee, soda, juice and
milk combined. <BR>
<BR>
Movies, television shows and beer commercials often portray youthful drinking
as an acceptable way for students to fit in and be popular. But for some,
along with this &quot;popularity&quot; comes many hazards. <BR>
<BR>
The fact is that as many as 360,000 of the nation's 12 million undergraduates
will die as a result of alcohol abus. This is more than the number who will
get MAs and PhDs combined. And alcohol abuse is also a major factor in other
campus problems, such as violent crimes, rapes and sexually-transmitted
diseases, including AIDS, despite the fact that it is illegal for anyone
under 21 to drink. <BR>
<BR>
As the summer draws to a close and students start heading back to campus,
you may want to take an in-depth look at the scope of college drinking in
our community and some of the problems that result. I can put you in touch
with some local students to find out about their drinking habits, what alternatives
exist, what they think should be done to curb student drinking and how aware
they are of the risks. I can also connect you with some local experts who
can give you more insight on the problem and suggest some fun college activities
that do not involve alcohol that you can spotlight. <BR>
<BR>
As I'm sure you are aware, this is an important topic and one that ultimately
affects us all. By shining the spotlight on this issue, you can help make
this a safer year for students and the whole community. <BR>
<BR>
You can reach me at <SAMP>(YOUR PHONE NUMBER)</SAMP>. I'll call you next
week to follow up. <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Binge Drinking on Campus</H3>
<H2>SAMPLE OP-ED</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR>
Tailor the following Op-Ed with some local statistics and send it to your
college or local newspaper. <HR><BR>
<H3>COLLEGE DRINKING LEADS TO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS </H3>
<BR>
Some college traditions are ageless: Eating pizza at midnight. Pulling all-nighters
before a big test. But recent national reports about other &quot;traditions&quot;
- guzzling cold beers with friends or getting so drunk you can barely find
your dorm room - are being seriously examined for the long-term damage they
cause to drinkers and non-drinkers alike. <BR>
<BR>
Excessive drinking remains a major problem on college campuses nationwide.
Despite increased public awareness about the strong relationship between
substance abuse and other social problems like fatal car crashes, increased
risk of HIV infection and date rape to students continue to binge drink.
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, today nearly half of all college students drink at least four or
five drinks at one time, according to the results of a recent study on binge
drinking published by Henry Wechsler in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. <BR>
<BR>
While many students do not see the harm in having &quot;a few&quot; beers,
the truth is that risks of excessive alcohol consumption involve more just
a hangover the next day. Studies show that alcohol is a factor in 66 percent
of student suicides and 60 percent of all sexually-transmitted diseases,
including HIV. In addition, one out of four student deaths is related to
alcohol use. <BR>
<BR>
Many students who drink heavily have problems keeping up with their school
work and often skip class. Studies show that 41 percent of all academic
problems stem from alcohol abuse and 28 percent of the students who drop
out of school may do so because of alcohol. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, students who do not drink are affected by their classmates
who do. Students at schools with high levels of binge drinking are three
times more likely to be pushed, hit or sexually assaulted by drunk peers
than are students at schools with less drinking. Are we graduating many
young people who are compromising their health and effectiveness in the
prime of their lives? <BR>
<BR>
But college students do not have to remain the victims of beer manufacturers,
who spend about $15 to $20 million each year to get them to drink, despite
the fact that drinking alcohol is illegal for anyone under 21. <BR>
<BR>
At campuses across the country, there is a growing movement of students
who are taking charge &oacute; by deciding to stay sober. Many colleges
and universities have responded by implementing strong alcohol policies
to keep drinking to a minimum. Some have also designated alcohol-free dorms
and made alcohol-free social events a high priority. <BR>
<BR>
While this is a good start, it is also crucial that college administrators
work with local communities to come up with solid solutions such as alcohol
beverage server training and enforcing underage drinking laws to keep students
safe and healthy. If college officials, police, businesses, the media and
students all work together to deglamorize college drinking and provide alternative
activities, we can make each school year safer than the one before. <BR>

<CENTER><H2>College Health Officials Flunk Tavern Ads That Promote Heavy Drinking</H2>

<H3>Demand Industry Standards for Responsible Advertising</H3></CENTER>

Bar and tavern advertisements that entice college students with the promise of cheap, abundant booze help fuel an epidemic in student binge drinking, according to an alliance concerned with alcohol abuse.<BR>

<BR>The Coalition to Reduce Binge Drinking today urged the National Licensed Beverage Association (NLBA) to adopt voluntary college newspaper advertising standards. It offered to work with the trade association to eliminate advertising that promotes heavy and daily drinking among students. The coalition letter was signed by 32 health officials from 27 college carnpuses. The NLBA is the national association representing bars, taverns, and other establishments licensed to serve alcohol.<BR>

<BR>"Too many campus newspapers fail to recognize that these binge-pushing ads and promotional gimmicks subvert the academic mission of the university and the well-being of students," said George Hacker, head of the Alcohol Policies Project of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), which coordinates the coalition. Among promotions CSPI and the coalition cite as particularly targeted at encouraging heavy drinking:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Penny- and nickel-drink nights
	<LI>All-you-can-drink specials
	<LI>Ladies' nights
	<LI>"Crawls" with specials at several different bars,
	<LI>Ads that expand drinking time to include traditional "study nights"
</UL>

The coalition also sent an <B><A HREF="/JTO/news/press/cspi_ltr.html">open letter</A></B> to the editors of college newspapers asking that they consider restricting or barring from their publications ads that promote irresponsible alcohol consumption.

<BR><BR>"We're not saying, 'stop advertising,' explained Janine Gracey, a prevention specialist at the University of Kansas and a member of the coalition, "but we want local bars to look for alternatives to telling kids it's okay to drink until they pass out."

<BR><BR>According to Dennis McBee, alcohol and drug education coordinator at the University of Vermont, "It' s hard enough to deal with student drinking problems without this constant assault of ads telling students to 'get tanked' or promoting discounts for women based on how short their skirts are. It' s infuriating to see the health and safety risks that these bars so glibly promote."

<BR><BR>"Newspapers at quite a few schools already choose either not to run alcohol ads at all or accept only those that promote responsible alcohol consumption," noted CSPI's Hacker. "We are calling on college editors to reject a binge culture that causes havoc on campus and contributes to countless personal and academic tragedies."

<BR><BR>The advertising standards proposed by the coalition are similar to voluntary guidelines currently adopted by national associations representing beer, wine, and distilled spirits producers, such as refraining from advertising "all-you-can-drink-nights" or free or discounted drinks in college newspapers. They would also include principles that have been adopted by responsible members of the hospitality industry, such as training beverage servers to recognize signs of intoxication and to refuse service to inebriated patrons.

<BR><BR>In a 1995 study, the Harvard University School of Public Health found that students who binge-drink suffer many adverse effects in addition to hangovers, among them hospitalization for alcohol overdose, trouble with police, property destruction, injury, unprotected sexual activity, and missed classes. Even non-binging students and others in the community are affected: in the Harvard study, 81 percent of students on "high-binging" campuses reported a sexual or other assault, property damage, having to "baby-sit" a drunken friend, or having study or sleep interrupted because of heavy drinking by other students.

<BR><BR>The study defined binge drinking as five or more consecutive drinks one or more times in two weeks for men and four or more consecutive drinks in two weeks for women. A campus was considered "high-binging" if more than half of all students reported binge-drinking.

<BR><BR>Responsible marketing of alcohol products has been a subject of increasing national concern. The White House cover letter to Congress introducing the 1996 National Drug Control Strategy, released on April 29, 1996, cites marketing to young people of products that "legitimate and elevate the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs" as a reason young people continue to use drugs.

<BR><BR>CSPI is a leading nonprofit health-education and advocacy organization supported in large part by the 750,000 subscribers to its Nutrition Action Healthletter. It is widely recognized for studies in the fields of nutrition, food safety and alcohol policy.

<H3>FORWARD</H3>
<font size=6>O</FONT><font size=4>ne of our nation's major substance abuse problems today stems from the
criminal justice system's failure to address addiction effectively. This
fact has long been identified in our surveys of community coalitions and
is clear to Join Together's National Advisory Committee.<BR>
<BR>
That's why Join Together convened a policy panel of criminal justice experts
from several fields in the summer of 1995 to look at ways police, prosecutors,
courts, and corrections agencies can work more effectively with communities
to stop alcohol and drug abuse in our neighborhoods. Over the past few months
the panel has heard from people around the country -- as well as from respondents
to Join Together's national survey -- about how criminal justice organizations
are not consistently integrated into a community response to substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
After much work, the panel has proposed a series of recommendations to help
these groups work together more effectively. Their recommendations are included
in this report. On behalf of the National Advisory Committee, I thank panel
chair Donald Fraser, former mayor of Minneapolis, and the other distinguished
members of the panel for all their hard work. I also express admiration
for their fine proposals, which, if implemented, should make a significant
contribution to the attack on substance abuse at the national, state, and
local levels.<BR>
<BR>
This report is not a panacea. It is, however, a tool kit of six thoughtful
recommendations which every legislator, criminal justice professional, and
community advocate can use to fix what the panel has characterized as a
failing system.<BR>
<BR>
This panel's report now belongs to you. Put it to work in your community,
in your organization, in your legislative committee. For many of you, the
way to begin will be to hold your own policy panel, focusing on the specific
issues that affect your city, town, or state. Others of you may already
have a community strategic plan in place, and you can use this report to
reinforce and energize that process.<BR>
<BR>
We offer special thanks to The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for its continuing
support and efforts to help the nation's communities use local public policy
change as a tool for reducing substance abuse. We are also grateful to the
Johnson Institute Foundation of Minneapolis for their generous support of
this panel. And finally, thanks to the National Alliance for Model State
Drug Laws, for co-sponsoring a public forum at which the panel heard valuable
and informed testimony from local, state, and national figures.<BR>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<font size=4>
I was pleased to be asked to chair a panel that would focus on how the criminal
justice system could better aid communities in overcoming alcohol and drug
abuse. The panel members included a police commander, a district attorney,
a probation and parole supervisor, a judge, a treatment program administrator,
a defense attorney, a youth advocate, and an elected county legislator.
All agreed on virtually every issue identified as an impediment to the workings
of the criminal justice system.<BR>
<BR>
The panel quickly agreed that the most pressing need for an effective criminal
justice response to substance abuse is treatment -- treatment before and
after sentencing, treatment that continues after relapse, treatment appropriate
to a wide range of adult nonviolent offenders, and treatment that supplements
and strengthens responsible sanctions including incarceration as well as
community-based, supervision by parole and probation professionals.<BR>
<BR>
The panel met in the summer and fall of 1995 in Chicago, Minneapolis, and
Kansas City, Missouri, where community advocates and experts from every
facet of the criminal justice field presented valuable testimony. These
witnesses emphasized the need for treatment and for criminal justice agencies
to work together and with their communities to develop and implement strategic
plans to meet the growing crisis of substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
This inquiry is timely because our failure to reduce alcohol and drug abuse
leaves our communities facing an increasingly bleak future. And it is our
children who are the victims of our failed responses. I am pleased with
this panel's report. No single panel or report will touch on every aspect
of a problem as pervasive as this. Yet, we offer these six recommendations
as a starting place for your community and your criminal justice organizations.<BR>
<BR>
The key to these proposals, and to this entire report, is to start now.
Our communities, and our children, will reap the benefits.<BR>

<P><BR>

<H3>FIXING A FAILING SYSTEM<BR>
Time To Tell the Truth</H3>
<font size=4>
The criminal justice system is failing us. We are caught in the midst of
a substance abuse crisis that has overwhelmed our nation and left no community
untouched. Yet the criminal justice system has not responded effectively.
Instead, it confuses and misleads us with lies and half-truths. It insists
that we need to lock up drug offenders and throw away the keys, but it neglects
to tell us that those offenders will return to our streets, still using,
still dealing. It pushes prison as a cure, when the truth is that merely
locking someone up rarely ends addiction. It pretends to know what is best
for substance abusers, even when it has no training in treatment. The time
has come to stop the lies. The time has come to face facts and begin to
build a criminal justice system that will be effective in reducing substance
abuse.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is, the criminal justice system is as much a part of us and our
communities -- and we of it -- as is the drug dealer on the corner or the
drunk driver on our street. And the elderly woman who calls to report the
dealer in front of her apartment building is as much a part of the system
as the police officer who comes to investigate.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, if there is to be any finger pointing, it must be at ourselves;
if there is to be a solution, we must plant its roots. This is the real
key to reducing substance abuse in our communities. We cannot leave the
problem to the police alone. We cannot hope that judges will lock substance
abuse away in a prison cell. We cannot wait for our lawmakers to legislate
drugs out of our neighborhoods. All the different parts of the community
must work together, cooperatively, toward a common solution. This includes
the police, prosecutors, educators, religious leaders, business people,
and homeowners. By pooling training, resources, and insight, we can reduce
substance abuse and the problems it poses for our communities and for ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
The truth is that merely locking someone up rarely ends addiction.<BR></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE POLICY PANEL</B><BR>
<BR>
In the summer of 1995, Join Together convened a national panel of experts
to examine the role criminal justice can play in reducing substance abuse
in our communities. Included were experts directly involved in criminal
justice -- a police commander, a prosecutor, a public defender, a federal
judge, and a probation officer -- as well as representatives of municipal
government, substance abuse treatment, and community organizations.<BR>
<BR>
The panel met several times to share experiences and insights. It also held
a public hearing in October in Kansas City to hear testimony from representatives
of criminal justice and substance abuse programs from across the United
States.<BR>
<BR>
Almost immediately in their deliberations, panel members reached agreement
on several themes: 
<UL>
<LI>The criminal justice &quot;system&quot; is no system at all. Its various
players fail to collaborate with each other or with their communities. Instead,
they often work at cross purposes, competing for resources and fighting
over turf. 
<LI>Citizens have been shut out of their rightful roles in the criminal
justice system, despite the fact that they are key players. If substance
abuse can be reduced in the community, then citizens must demand of law
enforcement, the judiciary, and other criminal justice entities a more formal
structure for sharing problems and developing solutions. 
<LI>Programs for prevention and treatment of substance abuse are critically
lacking at every level of the criminal justice system. Unless it can do
much more to deter and treat substance abuse, the criminal justice system
will never break the vicious cycle of drug and alcohol abuse and related
crime. 
<LI>We are wasting enormous amounts of money and time because of misguided
policies for addressing substance abuse. Rather than overwhelm the criminal
justice system with the task of locking away low-level offenders in expensive
jail cells, we should be concentrating resources on prevention and treatment,
freeing the system to tackle high-level and violent crimes. 
</UL>
In keeping with these themes, and based on deliberations and input from
the public hearing and other sources, the panel presents six recommendations
for helping the criminal justice system respond more effectively to substance
abuse in our communities.<BR>
<BR>
Our focus is on low-level, nonviolent criminals like the drunk driver, the
needle user, and the street-corner dealer -- not on members of the cocaine
cartel or organized crime.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCOPE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS <BR>
OUR PARAMETERS</B><BR>
<BR>
To fully understand the purpose and scope of this report, it is important
to note what this report is not. No single report can be the final answer
to problems relating to substance abuse in our communities. Ours simply
sets out what we believe are the best ways for the criminal justice system
to begin to be more effective in helping to reduce substance abuse. Our
proposals will not change the system overnight. There are no quick fixes,
despite the contrary assertions of some politicians and public officials.<BR>
<BR>
This report is not exhaustive in its examination of criminal justice. Our
focus is on low-level, nonviolent crimes associated with substance abuse.
Our recommendations of more effective treatment and less punitive sanctions
are directed at the drunk driver, the needle user, and the street-corner
dealer, not at members of the cocaine cartel or organized crime. We do not
purport to address specialized segments of the criminal system. Juvenile
justice, for example, raises a host of issues that are beyond the scope
of this report. Likewise, we recognize that substance abuse is merely one
of many problems plaguing the criminal justice system. Those who work in
the system are akin to doctors in a crowded emergency room, with each patient
crying louder than the next for help.<BR>
<BR>
Problems endemic to our society that are reflected in the criminal justice
system likewise are beyond the scope of this report. We acknowledge that
there often are dual standards of justice in our society: one for the rich,
another for the poor; one for whites, another for minorities. The professional
athlete who abuses drugs is unlikely to be locked away in prison; the junkie
who rehabilitates himself is unlikely to be heralded for his courage. An
October 1995 study by The Sentencing Project, for example, found that almost
a third of all black men in their twenties are under the supervision of
the criminal justice system, compared to fewer than seven percent of white
men of the same age. We do not purport to offer a cure for social inequality.<BR>
<BR>
We take it as a given that more money across the board, for public and private
entities alike, would be a big step toward helping to reduce substance abuse.
At the same time, we recognize that social-reform proposals based on demands
for more money are too easily pushed to the side while policy makers battle
over spending plans. So we steer clear of money talk, except to discuss
in broad terms the allocation of existing resources. Nevertheless, it is
worth noting that our proposals for cooperation, coordination, and training
across agency lines would eliminate duplication of efforts, resulting in
greater efficiencies and thereby reducing the overall cost of criminal justice
-- or at least freeing existing resources to be put to more constructive
uses, such as training. Moreover, our call for greater community participation
in criminal justice likewise can lead to savings. It is, after all, cheaper
for a community to hold a barn raising than to call in a contractor.<BR>
<BR>
The only way to keep a substance abuser who has gone to jail once from returning
a second or third time is to treat the addiction, not ignore it and continue
to use incarceration alone.<BR>
<BR>
Our assumptions in this report: First, we cannot emphasize enough that prevention
is key. The best way to keep substance abuse out of the criminal justice
system is to keep it from ever happening in the first place. Although the
justice system can play an important role in prevention, it must begin much
earlier -- as a collaboration with families, in schools, and in our neighborhoods
to build and maintain constructive community efforts. Similarly, treatment
of substance abuse must be seen as an extension of prevention. The only
way to keep a substance abuser who has gone to jail once from returning
a second or third time is to treat the addiction, not ignore it and continue
to use incarceration alone.<BR>
<BR>
Second, leadership is essential. The recommendations we make require strong
dynamic leaders to make them take effect. Leadership cannot be legislated;
its qualities cannot be written into a report such as this. Leaders must
emerge from our neighborhoods, and throughout the criminal justice system
to guide us to success.<BR>

<H3>RECOMMENDATION 1</H3>
<font size=4>
We must stop pushing low-level, nonviolent substance abusers through a revolving
door of ineffective punishment. Sanctions and sentences for low-level, non-violent
substance abusers must focus on treatment and rehabilitation as well as
deterrence and separation. The system must serve to break the cycle of substance
abuse, not merely interrupt it.
<H3>Specific Policies </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Mandatory sentencing laws must be repealed. These include laws that
impose minimum sentences for particular crimes and those that impose lifetime
sentences after a set number of crimes.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>There should be truth in sentencing. By this we mean that sentences
should reveal the actual time that an offender will serve.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Delaware Sentencing Guidelines <BR>
Help Non-Violent Offenders <BR>
</B><BR>
Sentencing guidelines in Delaware have helped keep the prison population
from growing. These guidelines provide consistency and predictability in
sentencing without resorting to mandatory minimum penalties, according to
Judge Myron Steele.<BR>
<BR>
The guidelines establish five accountability levels ranging from unsupervised
probation to prison. Each judge completes a sentencing worksheet that includes
an explanation if a sentence falls outside the guidelines. But Steele says
that more that 90% of sentences are within the standards.<BR>
<BR>
Delaware state Rep. Richard Davis says since the guideline were implemented
in 1987, there has been a 64% increase in offenders incarcerated for violent
offenses, while the number of people incarcerated for non-violent offenses
has dropped by almost half. The prison population has not dropped, but the
rate of growth in the prison population has decreased from an 11% growth
in 1986 to a 2.3% decline in 1990.<BR>
<BR>
Steele and Davis concur that the voluntary guidelines shortened sentences
for some crimes, and the public has accepted the guidelines because they
provide uniformity in sentencing. In addition, they have helped make room
in prisons for violent offenders.<BR>

  <UL>
  <LI>Judges and legislators must craft and impose sanctions and sentences
that focus on curbing negative behavior rather than on processing those
who run afoul of the law. This should include a greater emphasis on community-based
alternatives to prison. 
  <LI>Judges in all jurisdictions should use treatment for nonviolent, low-level
offenders with substance abuse problems, not simply a jail sentence. However,
at the discretion of the judge,&quot;shock&quot; intervals of incarceration,
and the threat of incarceration, as part of a treatment-based sanction can
be effectively deployed. Assessment and treatment must be required for everyone
who comes into the system with a substance abuse problem. 
  <LI>Drug courts should be established or expanded in order to allow judges
to divert offenders to treatment and rehabilitation programs where appropriate.
Drug courts route non-violent offenders who use drugs into a closely supervised,
intensive treatment regimen. They use the expertise and jurisdiction of
judges, probation officers, correctional and law enforcement personnel,
prosecutors, defense counsel, drug testing, rehabilitation and treatment
specialists, and community advocates to make defendants face the consequences
of their substance abuse problems. 
  <LI>There must be close supervision of drug offenders on probation or
parole, not only to rehabilitate them, but also to reassure the community
that neighborhood-based sanctions can work. 
  <LI>Disparities in sentencing based on race or class must be eliminated.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Treatment Gives Woman a New Lease <BR>
on Life in Dade County, Florida<BR>
</B><BR>
The same streets that held despair for a 29-year-old woman in Dade County,
Florida, have also turned out to be her salvation. The neighborhood where
Mary White (not her real name) worked as a prostitute, sold drugs and slept
on the streets also houses the substance abuse treatment program that has
ultimately turned her life around. For 12 years, White had been in and out
of jail for a variety of crimes, including forgery, drug possession, and
aggravated assault. But this cycle finally ended two years ago when a judge,
with the support of probation personnel, ordered White into treatment.<BR>
<BR>
At first, White begged her probation officer to let her go to prison, saying
jail was easier than enduring taunts from the old friends she was forced
to walk by on her way to the treatment center. But despite these difficulties,
White did not give up.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, she successfully completed the program and has been able to stay
free of drugs and meet her probation requirements for close to two years.
Today, she attends community college and also works as a manager in a retail
store.<BR>
<BR>
White's success is largely due to the close cooperation of the court, her
probation supervisor, and the treatment program, as well as her own determination
to be drug-free.<BR>

<BR>
The criminal justice system must go after the disease, not the symptoms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>Rationale</H3>
<BR>
Penalizing substance abusers who commit crimes does not cure them. Locking
them up does not keep them from committing other crimes when they are released.
The criminal justice system is throwing away enormous amounts of money and
tying up many of its resources with an utterly ineffective approach to substance
abuse. The police, prosecutors, courts, corrections officials, and probation
officers are consumed with the task of locking away low-level, nonviolent
offenders, yet major criminals are being let off with a plea bargain.<BR>
<BR>
This is all for naught. Prison is not treatment. It does not cure alcohol
or drug dependency. The majority of offenders who go to prison will sooner
or later be released back into the community, still addicted, still dealing.
The criminal justice system must go after the disease, not the symptoms.
It must emphasize treatment and prevention, not incarceration. It is time
to stop wasting time and money filling prison cells with substance abusers.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the system's greatest failing is its stubborn adherence to mandatory
minimum sentences for drug offenders. Overwhelming evidence reveals that
since mandatory sentences were introduced in 1974, all they have accomplished
is to cripple the system under the sheer weight of drug cases. The statistics
are staggering. Between 1980 and 1994, the number of people behind bars
in the United States has tripled, to nearly 1.5 million. More than 5.1 million
people, or 2.7 percent of the adult population, are under some form of court
supervision. In 1993, 60 percent of federal prisoners were there for drug-related
crimes, up from 25 percent a decade earlier. During a twelve- month period
in 1993-1994, 35 percent of all convictions in federal court were for drug
offenses, resulting in more than 17,000 defendants being sent to prison
to serve an average sentence of seven years, nearly double the average sentence
of a decade earlier. The same is true in state courts, where in 1992 alone,
seven out of 10 persons convicted of drug offenses were incarcerated. From
1980 to 1993, the number of inmates in state prisons for drug convictions
rose from 19,000 to 186,000. If the jail populations continue to grow at
the current rate, by the year 2053 the United States will have more people
in jail than out, according to a recent study by Camille Gear and David
C. Lewis (Locking Up the Drug Problem: Criminal and Legal Responses to Drug
Addiction, Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Brown University, 1995).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Drug Sentencing Laws in Massachusetts <BR>
May Target the Wrong Suspects<BR>
</B><BR>
Massachusetts drug-sentencing laws may be missing their mark. The laws,
which require a mandatory-minimum sentence for offenders, are set up in
such a way that they often punish street-level drug dealers and allow kingpins
to go free. This is because under the current system, high-level dealers
can bargain down their charges by forfeiting assets, thereby averting tough
mandatory sentences. Low level dealers, however, have little to bargain
with.<BR>
<BR>
That's why a panel of Massachusetts legislators, appointed by the House
Speaker, is reviewing current laws. Experts suggest that the state take
a multi-pronged approach instead -- by implementing sentencing guidelines,
intermediate sanctions, enhanced probation services, and drug treatment
programs.<BR>
<BR>
For more information, contact Ann Walker of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court at (617) 557-1157.<BR>
<BR>
One federal appellate judge recently estimated that unnecessary imprisonment
of minor drug offenders is costing taxpayers nearly $359 million a year.<BR>
<BR>
This high rate of incarceration has not made our streets safer. The offenders
being locked away under mandatory sentencing laws are not high-level drug
dealers or violent criminals. In fact, nearly three-quarters of these prisoners
committed nonviolent offenses, such as larceny or drug dealing. One-third
of the federal defendants sentenced to mandatory minimums in 1992 had no
prior criminal record. More than a quarter of the federal defendants receiving
mandatory minimums were not even U.S. citizens; many were the &quot;mules&quot;
who carry drugs across the border. This means that while the system's resources
are being drained by the prosecution and incarceration of nonviolent offenders,
violent crime is escalating and drug kingpins are going free. Ironically,
both the offenders and their communities would be far better served by treatment
than by incarceration, and at far less cost to taxpayers. One federal appellate
judge recently estimated that unnecessary imprisonment of minor drug offenders
is costing taxpayers nearly $359 million a year. This money would be better
used in fighting high-level and violent crime. Only 8% of prison wardens
surveyed believe that imposing longer sentences for drug users makes a major
difference in reducing crime in their community or state.<BR>
<BR>
Another form of mandatory sentencing that is equally misguided is the&quot;three
strikes and youUre out&quot; laws, under which offenders are sent to prison
for life after their third felony violation. Public perception of the effect
of three-strikes laws is dramatically different from the reality. Many Americans
believe these laws target frequent violent offenders. In fact, such laws
often put away offenders who are less likely to commit more crime. Most
criminal offenders are between the ages of 15 and 24. The older an offender
grows, the less sense it makes to lock him or her in prison. Further, many
repeat felons, although falling under the scope of these laws, actually
committed rather minor, nonviolent offenses. Judges in such cases have no
discretion to vary from the sentence imposed by law and often find themselves
forced to lock someone away for life when he or she is not actually a threat
to anyone.<BR>
<BR>
Only 8% of prison wardens surveyed believe that imposing longer sentences
for drug users make a major difference in reducing crime in their community
or state.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mandatory Minimum Sentencing <BR>
Laws Prove Costly For States</B><BR>
<BR>
Many states have mandatory minimum sentencing laws today.<BR>
<BR>
The laws--which are based on the &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot;
campaign used in the 1993 Washington state elections--are also now pending
in several other states.<BR>
<BR>
Largely as a result of these laws, states spent approximately $5 billion
in 1995 to build and operate prisons.<BR>
<BR>
But no state spends more than California, which will increase its Dept.
of Corrections costs by $75 million in 1996, and by nearly $1 billion by
the year 2000. In fact, California now spends more on its corrections system
than it does on its colleges and universities. This information comes from
the BJS State Justice Sourcebook of Statistics, September 1992.<BR>
<BR>
And what of the long-term cost of warehousing people -- sometimes for 60
years -- under these laws? We tend to think of these laws as targeting the
young and the violent. Yet even the young and the violent grow old and feeble.
When we lock them away for life, we lock ourselves into the cost of caring
for them for life. For the taxpayer, the burden of caring for these people
will become staggering. As this population ages, we will be paying not merely
for their incarceration, but also for their hospitalization and related
medical costs. Whom are we helping by keeping aging, former offenders off
the streets?<BR>
<BR>
Finally, a rational sentencing policy must be one that is blind to race
and class. The federal system, for example, doles out a much harsher penalty
for possession of crack cocaine than for possession of powder cocaine. A
person convicted of trafficking in five grams of crack with a maximum retail
value of $750 will receive the same sentence as an offender charged with
selling 500 grams of powder cocaine retailing for $50,000, according to
a recent report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Yet the primary difference
between crack and powder cocaine lies in who uses them. Powder cocaine can
be found among even the wealthy, whereas crack is a drug of the streets.

<H3>RECOMMENDATION 2</H3>
<font size=4>
Access to prevention and treatment of substance abuse must be an integral
part of the criminal justice system. The entire system must aggressively
and actively support community efforts at prevention. Every level of the
system must incorporate and offer appropriate quality treatment as an alternative
or, when appropriate, in addition to punitive sanctions.<BR>
<H3>Specific Policies</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Treatment must be required for every substance abuser who comes in contact
with the criminal justice system.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Treatment must be available at every step of the criminal justice process
and must be provided in a coordinated and continuous manner. For this to
happen, there must be cooperation among judges, prosecutors, parole and
probation authorities, treatment providers, mental health providers, and
human service agencies.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Drug Court Links Addicts with <BR>
Treatment Services in Rochester, New York</B><BR>
<BR>
Providing treatment -- not jail -- for non-violent offenders with substance abuse
problems is key to reducing crime in Rochester, New York. This is the premise
of the Drug Court Program there, which was started in January of 1995.<BR>
<BR>
This program employs treatment providers and case managers. They provide
an important link between program participants and community services, such
as Rochester Mental Health, Family Service of Rochester, Strong Recovery,
Catholic Family Center, and Daybreak ATF. Judges and other drug court staff
work collaboratively with case managers to be sure offenders get the help
they need.<BR>
<BR>
In less than a year, this low-cost approach has been effective --  of the 172
participants, only 12 have been rearrested. In all, 27 defendants have quit
or been released from the drug court program and sent back to the traditional
criminal justice system.<BR>
<BR>
Judge John Schwartz, who implemented the program, has been able to raise
private funds from local foundations and the Monroe County Bar Association
to pay for the drug court. The New York State Commissioner of Criminal Justice
Services suggests using the Rochester Drug Court as a model for drug court
expansions throughout the state. "The current system, in my opinion, has
failed clients (with substance abuse addictions)," said Drug Court Administrator
Nadine Simpson, adding, "This innovative approach has given new opportunities
for defendants."<BR>
<BR>
For more information, call Simpson at (716) 428-2736 or write to her at
the Drug Court, Hall of Justice, Room 1, Rochester, NY 14614.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <UL>
  <LI>Treatment programs must be appropriately matched to the individual
and the addiction, meeting the unique clinical needs of each individual.
  <LI>Courts in every jurisdiction must provide diversionary treatment programs
and monitor offenders. Courts should allow for deferral of prosecution or
sentencing during treatment.
  <LI>Criminal justice agencies must work as equal partners with prevention
and treatment programs and with related educational and job-skills programs.
  <LI>Training of criminal justice professionals at every level of the system
must include an introduction to the nature of substance abuse and the importance
of prevention and treatment.
  <LI>Criminal justice agencies must be partners in evaluating and monitoring
treatment referral programs. They should refer to programs that have experience
in treating various classes of criminal offenders.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Although 62% of state prisoners admit to substance use or abuse,
state prisons have facilities to treat only 18% of their populations. Similarly,
federal prisons are able to treat only 14% of the 42% of federal prisoners
who admit to abusing alcohol and/or drugs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rehabilitating Offenders Is Goal of <BR>
STEP in Little Rock, Arkansas</B><BR>
<BR>
Rehabilitation is just a step away for criminals with addictions in Little
Rock, Arkansas. The Substance Abuse Treatment Education Program there, known
as STEP, is a pre-trial diversionary court program that offers offenders
treatment instead of jail. Trial judges preside over the STEP court and
are responsible for setting diversionary programs -- such as suspended sentences
and referrals to social service and treatment professionals -- to meet an offender's
situation. The cost is $3,000 vs. $30,000 to house an inmate for a year.<BR>
<BR>
In order to qualify for STEP, which has been operating for three years,
offenders must commit to completing the whole program. There is no standard
time that a person must stay in STEP -- judges decide each case on an individual
basis. Once someone successfully graduates, his or her criminal record is
erased. However, those who fail the program or drop out are sent back to
trial court to be sentenced for their crimes. Currently, about 300 clients
are enrolled in STEP. Forty clients have graduated from the program after
15 months -- with no recidivists.<BR>
<BR>
RWhen someone has hit the bottom, wants out, wants help, and then has worked
through the program to graduation, it's truly a revelation.S said Judge
Jack Holt, one of STEP's founders.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<B>Wardens Want to Attack <BR>
Crime At Its Roots</B><BR>
<BR>
More than nine out of ten wardens believe that "expanding the use of drug
treatment in prison or in the community will make a major (39%) or moderate
(52%) difference in reducing crime in their community."<BR>
<BR>
This finding comes from a survey sponsored by the U.S. Senate Judiciary
CommitteeTs Subcommittee on the Constitution. A total of 157 wardens from
eight states--who represented more than 60% of the prisons in these states--responded to the survey.<BR>
<BR>
More than two-thirds (68%) of respondents said they support the sentencing
policy that"to reduce drug-related crime, we must pay more attention to
the underlying causes of crime by providing job opportunities and training,
drug education, and treatment for everyone who needs it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><HR><BR>
Rationale</H3>
<BR>
If we prevent substance abuse, we prevent related crimes. If we treat substance
abusers who have committed crimes, we prevent recidivism. It is that simple.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the criminal justice system does little in the way of prevention
and treatment. It reasons that prevention is for families and schools and
churches to worry about. Treatment, the system believes, is something it
must offer only because society expects it; therefore, it is best farmed
out to the lowest bidder. The system does not concern itself with quality
of care, relapse, or rates of recidivism.<BR>
<BR>
Statistics speak to the system's inability to provide treatment. Although
42 percent of federal and 62 percent of state prisoners admit to substance
use or abuse, federal prisons have facilities to treat only 14 percent of
their populations and state prisons are able to treat only 18 percent. Of
all prisoners with moderate to severe substance abuse problems, the U.S.
General Accounting Office estimates that fewer than 20 percent receive treatment.
At the federal level, fewer than 1 percent do. Of the nearly 1.5 million
people incarcerated in federal, state, and local prisons, only slightly
more than 100,000 received treatment for substance abuse during 1994. Of
all the money spent in the United States each year to reduce substance abuse,
78 percent goes to enforce laws, provide punishment, or to control drug
trade, whereas only 22 percent is spent on prevention and treatment, according
to the ONDCP 1995 Drug Control Strategy.<BR>
<BR>
In a follow-up study of treatment programs for incarcerated felony offenders,
79% of participants were employed upon release and only 35% were re-arrested.
The re-arrest rate for all offenders nationally is 63%. Source: SAMSHA<BR>
<BR>
The sad irony is that if the system were to balance the emphasis of cutting
demand with reducing supply, it would be far more effective in reducing
substance abuse and related crime, at a far lower cost. Consider these facts:
<UL>
<LI>Treatment is by far the most cost-effective means to reduce drug use
and related crime. Every dollar spent on treatment leads to a $7.46 reduction
in crime-related spending and lost productivity, according to a study conducted
by the RAND Corporation for the Office of National Drug Control Policy and
the U.S. Army. A California study similarly found that every dollar spent
on treatment saved taxpayers $7.
<LI>reatment is far cheaper than interdiction, enforcement, and prosecution.
The RAND corporation estimates that a 1 percent reduction in annual drug
consumption over the next 15 years would require spending $783 million for
source-country control, $366 million for interdiction, $246 million for
domestic enforcement, or $34 million for treatment.
<LI>Treatment and prevention have been proven effective in reducing drug
use and drug-related crime. Government efforts to seize illicit drugs do
little to reduce overall supply, the RAND study found, whereas treatment
measurably cuts demand. Other studies support this: P California found that
illegal activity dropped 43.3 percent after treatment. And the longer participants
remained in treatment, the greater the reduction in criminal activity. P
An Illinois study followed offenders who participated in an in-jail treatment
program for 600 days after release. Offenders who received optimum exposure
to the program, with aftercare in the community, committed significantly
less crime than other offenders. P In Missouri, graduates of a court-supervised
treatment program have a 50 percent lower recidivism rate than a comparable
population without treatment. P In Maine, a survey of offenders who had
undergone treatment found that after a year, 79 percent had no further arrests.
In Texas, 80 percent of clients who completed treatment had no arrests after
a year.
<LI>Treatment and prevention are far less expensive than incarceration.
The cost of incarcerating an adult for one year ranges across the country
from $16,000 to $37,000, and averages $18,330. In contrast, residential
substance abuse treatment costs an average of $14,600 a year and outpatient
treatment costs an average of $2,300 a year.
</UL>
<BR>
The criminal justice system has the opportunity to play a critical role
in prevention and treatment. It is not enough for the system merely to give
lip service to this notion. Prevention and treatment must be made the focus
at every step of the process, by every entity within the system.<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment defines addiction as a chronic
disorder. Addicts will inevitably suffer relapses. Courts, correction officials,
and probation/parole authorities should coordinate services among themselves,
as well as with substance abuse treatment services, health services, mental
health services, and providers of educational and vocational training. Law
enforcement officials and educators should work as equal partners. They
should have programs to divert substance abusers into treatment programs.
Judges should craft alternatives to incarceration that focus on treating
substance abuse and reducing recidivism. Prison officials should take responsibility
for ensuring the quality of the treatment provided within their walls. Probation
officers should follow through in seeking and ensuring quality treatment
including aftercare and follow-up.<BR>
<BR>
RWe are convinced that mandatory substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation
programs will work, and that the courts have an unparalleled opportunity
and obligation to use their authority to persuade appropriate defendants
and civil litigants to enter treatment.S Paul J. Liacos, chief justice of
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court<BR>
<BR>
<B>Drug Courts Steer <BR>
Drug-Addicted Offenders To Treatment</B><BR>
<BR>
All across the country, drug courts -- which route non-violent offenders with
addictions into treatment -- are helping break the cycle of crime and drugs
and giving addicts a second chance.<BR>
<BR>
These drug courts rely on the expertise and jurisdiction of judges, probation
officers, correctional and law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, defense
counsel, drug testing, rehabilitation and treatment specialists, and community
advocates to make defendants face their substance abuse addictions and the
consequences.<BR>
<BR>
Today, there are more than 50 drug courts in existence throughout the nation,
and at least that number in the planning stages. These courts not only help
offenders with substance abuse problems overcome their addictions, but they
are also very cost-effective.<BR>
<BR>
It costs between $20,000 and $50,000 a year to incarcerate an offender.
And the cost to build each prison cell is $80,000 to $90,000. Meanwhile,
drug court systems average less than $2,000 annually for each offender.
And preliminary data shows that recidivism has been significantly reduced
for drug court program participants, while treatment success has increased.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the Florida drug court consistently shows less recidivism than
other courts in the same jurisdiction. And there are similar success stories
in drug courts around the country.

<H3>RECOMMENDATION 3</H3>
<font size=4>
Barriers must be broken among the various entities that make up the criminal
justice system -- no matter their role, no matter their level of government -- so
that they can cooperate with each other and with their communities to reduce
substance abuse."Cooperate" means to share resources, training, and insight
while continuing to respect and observe each other's appropriate role in
the system.<BR>
<H3>Specific Policies</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The federal government should restrict itself to its most appropriate
role in drug cases: going after high-level drug dealers. It should leave
local drug efforts to local governments and not use federal funds to micromanage.
State governments should focus on setting appropriate standards for treatment,
correction, and probation and parole.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Citizens must aggressively direct public officials to develop a team
approach to reducing substance abuse. Criminal justice agencies must be
encouraged to work together to clearly define each other's appropriate role
in helping to reduce substance abuse. Once the roles have been defined,
each player must respect the responsibilities and limits of their authority
and the authority of others.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Criminal justice entities must include communities in the planning and
implementation of strategies for reducing substance abuse on a system-wide
basis.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Community Partnerships Result <BR>
from Conference in Norfolk, Virginia</B><BR>
<BR>
The City of Norfolk, Virginia, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation co-sponsored
a Conference on Addressing Violent Crime Through Community Partnerships
in 1992. The conference brought together Norfolk city officials, community
activists, religious leaders, educators, and law enforcement officers to
exchange ideas and produce recommendations to reduce crime. One result has
been the creation of community partnerships to improve their neighborhoods
through resident cooperation with city agencies. Contact: James Oliver,
City Manager's Office, 1101 City Hall Building, Norfolk, VA 23501, or call
(804) 664-4242.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <UL>
  <LI>Training in issues related to substance abuse should be coordinated
and conducted across agency lines. Everyone involved in the criminal justice
system should be trained in the fundamentals of the nature, prevention,
and treatment of addiction. Key training points include types of treatment,
distinctions between different substances, rates and nature of treatment
relapse, and effects of treatment on reducing criminal behavior. Entities
and individuals with particular expertise must be encouraged to share their
knowledge with others.
  <LI>There should be interdisciplinary training across agency lines, so
that everyone in the system understands the breadth and limits of each other's
responsibilities. The police, for example, might invite a treatment counselor
to speak at a roll call. The treatment counselor might spend some time with
a probation officer.
  </UL>
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>Rationale</H3>

&quot;The war on drugs&quot; is a slogan often used by law-enforcement agencies
to describe their efforts to reduce substance abuse, but it sometimes seems
that the only wars being fought are between those very agencies as they
battle over turf. High- profile cases become political footballs, while
the public stands on the sidelines waiting to see who emerges from the scrimmage:
The U.S. attorney or the county prosecutor? The FBI or the DEA? State or
local police? Meanwhile, low-level cases are pushed through the system like
widgets on an assembly line before overburdened judges -- pushed into crowded
prisons or plea- bargained into nondescript treatment programs, sooner or
later to return to the streets and begin the process all over again.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Prosecutors and Community <BR>
Form Partnerships in Two Communities</B><BR>
<BR>
Prosecutors work hand in hand with other community representatives in places
like Brooklyn, New York, and Portland, Oregon. These partnership are part
of a strategy that is called community prosecution and is often combined
with other programs that have neighborhood partnerships -- such as community-
oriented policing, treatment, courts and intensive community supervision
featuring probation and parole officers.
<UL>
<LI>In Brooklyn, the Kings County DA uses a zone prosecution program to
stimulate community participation and to reinforce the cases prosecuted
in that borough. The 23 police precincts are divided into five zones, with
assistant prosecutors assigned to those zones. These prosecutors work with
the police officials and community organizations in three zones, leading
to improved enforcement and prosecution. The courts have helped this initiative
by handling cases on a zone basis, increasing community responsiveness and
awareness.
<LI>In Portland, Oregon, the Multnomah County DA developed a community prosecution
program for selected nonviolent crimes. The program involves local prosecutors
meeting with neighborhood public safety committees; drug free zones created
by city ordinances and enforced aggressively; drug-free public housing zones,
where a community police officer enforces trespassing laws against non-tenants;
and a community probation program which requires participants to serve out
their probation and community service conditions in the community where
they committed the crimes.
</UL>
What we have come to think of as the"criminal justice system" is not really
a system at all. There is no systematic planning, no systematic coordination,
no systematic training. The"system" is ruled only by anarchy among its
various entities. If criminal justice is ever to be effective in reducing
substance abuse, this must change. Each entity must clearly define its role
in reducing substance abuse. Federal, state, and local prosecutors, for
example, all have appropriate parts to play. There are cases in which federal
law enforcement agencies should become involved and others where they should
not. Likewise, at each level of government, different entities and different
branches must coordinate planning and implementation of substance abuse
policy. Not everyone can be the quarterback. The sooner the players in criminal
justice realize that, the sooner they will start functioning as a team.<BR>
<BR>
A recent study conducted for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found
that the lack of a comprehensive, coordinated approach to substance abuse
among governmental entities is "the predominant barrier to success" in developing
effective treatment programs. "Significantly absent from this landscape
of services and administrative agencies is a set of integrated and coordinated
policies, treatment philosophies, values, or other organizational dynamics
that would maximize the efforts of individual probation officers, counselors,
judges, and others who work directly with substance abuse offenders." The
study called for the courts and others at the state and local levels to
join together"to develop a consistent, coordinated approach to the disease
of substance abuse."<BR>

<H3>RECOMMENDATION 4</H3>
<font size=4>
The criminal justice system must include the entire community in ensuring
public safety -- not merely those in traditional law- enforcement roles, but
also teachers, clergy, business people, neighborhood activists, homeowners,
and tenants -- anyone with a stake in the safety of their neighborhoods and
the well-being of their neighbors.<BR>
<H3>Specific Policies</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Citizens must be equal participants in the criminal justice system,
helping to identify, prioritize, and solve local substance abuse problems.<BR>

<LI>Criminal justice agencies must reach out to -- and cooperate with -- the public
and private sectors, including schools, treatment programs, the faith community,
the business community, prevention programs, and grassroots community organizations.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Many Programs Reduce Drugs and <BR>
Violence In New Haven, Connecticut</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
Murder, robbery and assault are on the decline in New Haven, Connecticut.
This is thanks to the efforts of police and residents, who have come together
to rid the city of these problems with a variety of community programs.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, police officers are encouraged to live in the neighborhoods
where they work. Officers not only fight crime but also oversee housing
rehabilitation and code enforcement, truancy in schools, and street paving.<BR>
<BR>
Police officers are trained to help children who have witnessed a violent
crime through the Child Development and Community Policing Program, which
was developed by the Yale University Child Study Center and the city of
New Haven. Officers refer child witnesses to a psychologist for help, since
children who see violence often imitate it. The program attempts to break
this cycle.<BR>
<BR>
Another important program is New Haven Fighting Back, a citywide effort
that creates partnerships between police, residents, schools, and health
care and treatment providers. Police go into residential neighborhoods and
schools to help solve local problems, such as truancy and juvenile crime.
Local police stations also work hand-in-hand with residents by providing
funding and special programs like adult education. New Haven's Needle Exchange
Program was one of the first in the nation to be conducted in vans on the
street. Drug addicts are given clean needles in an attempt to stop the spread
of the AIDS virus. Clients are also referred to treatment.<BR>
<BR>
These and other programs throughout the city are making it a healthier,
safer place to live.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;[The system] is like a tree, and we're hanging more and more services
off it. In the process, you're creating these models of neighborhood organization
where people are getting engaged again,&quot; said New Haven Mayor John
DeStefano.</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <UL>
  <LI>For more information, contact Barbara Geller, Fighting Back, New Haven
City Hall, 165 Church Street, New Haven, CT 06510 or call (203) 787-8445.
  <LI>Criminal justice agencies and community institutions should sponsor
policy in their communities to focus public attention on this issue, and
also develop options for planning and implementation.
  <LI>Partnerships between law enforcement and the community must be based

  </UL>
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>Rationale</H3>

Public safety is a community effort. It starts with prevention, and prevention
starts in the home, the school, the church, and the neighborhood. Reducing
crime also requires reducing recidivism, and that, too, requires the cooperation
of the community, so that those who have served their time can return to
society to lead constructive lives.<BR>
<BR>
Recovery may begin in treatment, but it is sustained in the community. Those
entities that we think of as being "the system" are only parts of a true
system. The police, the courts, corrections, and probation/parole cannot
succeed in their respective missions without cooperation and support from
each other and their communities. Unfortunately, these entities have tended
to function as autonomous units, rather than as part of the community. The
reasons for this vary. Sometimes they are simply so overwhelmed by their
day-to-day tasks that they never take the time to reach out. Ironically,
it is only by reaching out that those day-to-day tasks will ever be eased.<BR>
<BR>
Criminal justice officials must become partners with community leaders in
seeking to reduce substance abuse. The police, local courts, and probation/parole
officials must coordinate planning and strategy with parent-teacher organizations,
church leaders, tenantsU groups, business owners, and other community groups.
Other governmental entities must be involved as well. If a community needs
better recreational facilities to help its teens stay away from drugs, local
and state government should be available to facilitate such development.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Residents Can Help <BR>
Courts Be More Effective</B><BR>
<BR>
Community residents can work with judges, members of the bar association,
district attorneys, and other criminal justice principals to change the
way their courts do business.<BR>
<BR>
In Franklin County, Massachusetts, a district court judge and an attorney
received permission from the state supreme court to restructure their local
courts to better meet changing local needs. Building on a report presented
to the state supreme court, Judge Thomas Merrigan and Attorney Diane Esser
convened a Reinventing Justice Futures Lab Task Force that featured citizens
from every community in the county.<BR>
<BR>
Following special town meetings and other forums in which substance abuse
was established to be a concern for communities throughout the county, the
task force presented an action plan which would ensure that defendants in
the county's courts would be assessed for substance abuse treatment. The
plan also called for a system that would ensure substance abuse services
for family members of the defendant.<BR>
<BR>

279 Main Street, Lower Level, Greenfield, MA 01301, or call (413) 772-8711.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Collaboration Reduces Gang Activity <BR>
in Mountlake Terrace, Washington</B><BR>
<BR>
A school gym provides a safe place for rival gang members to meet and play
sports in Mountlake Terrace, Washington. This is because in the evenings
the school becomes a recreation center called the Neutral Zone.<BR>
<BR>
The zone was created by the Mountlake Terrace Community Action Resource
Team (CART), a community collaboration of public and private agencies and
residents. Youth play sports and are served free pizza and soda on Friday
and Saturday nights.<BR>
<BR>
A uniformed police officer and a supervisor keep order among the youngsters,
while a host of adult volunteers coordinate activities ranging from basketball,
ping pong and pool to darts. Other on-duty officers are encouraged to stop
by for pizza and to interact with participants. This interaction is often
valuable: it helps police learn about tension between gangs and often leads
them to solve burglaries and other local crimes.<BR>
<BR>
In 1991, before the Neutral Zone was formed, there were 73 incidents of
juvenile crime on a typical summer night. However, since the opening of
the center, juvenile crime has decreased by 50 percent. In addition to making
the community a safer place, the Neutral Zone has also sparked new trust
and collaboration between police and residents.<BR>
<BR>

<HR>
<H3>Rationale</H3>

To many people in the community, the police are the public face of the criminal
justice system. Their intimate relationships with people on the streets
and in the neighborhoods uniquely situates them to act as a bridge linking
the community and the justice system. Unfortunately, however, the police
often are actually more of a barrier than a bridge. This is due not to a
lack of concern for community, but to a preoccupation with crises. If the
criminal justice system is a revolving door, the police are its harried
doorkeepers, forever tossing offenders in one side only to see them come
out the other.<BR>
<BR>
In the long run, it would be more effective for the police to take the time
to develop a scheme to reduce the flow of traffic through the door. To do
this, the police will want to develop partnerships with the community to
prevent and reduce substance abuse, and they must work with community leaders
to develop alternatives to arrest and incarceration.<BR>
<BR>
This notion has been taking shape in a number of "community policing" programs
around the country. In some respects, community policing is a step back
in time to when officers were familiar faces walking a beat. Their presence
created a sense of safety and their familiarity allowed them to be trusted.
In the most successful programs today, community policing is becoming much
more, integrating not only crime enforcement but also code and safety enforcement
and related social services. The best community policing programs strive
to mold themselves to the needs and strengths of their particular neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
Such programs work. A community policing program in one of the worst crime
districts of Kansas City, Mo., has reduced crime by 13 percent, compared
to a 6 percent reduction citywide. In two neighborhoods where the police
have gone a step further and established "community action networks,"creating
centers staffed by dedicated police officers, code inspectors, and community
volunteers, crime is down 28 and 22 percent, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<B>New Policing Strategy Makes <BR>
Neighborhoods Safer in Chicago</B><BR>
<BR>
Groups are banding together in neighborhoods throughout Chicago to make
the city a safer place. Through a program called the Chicago Alternative
Policing Strategy (CAPS), police, community groups, government agencies,
and service providers work together to identify and solve crime and substance
abuse problems.<BR>
<BR>
CAPS officially began in 1993 in five of Chicago's 25 police districts.
It has been so successful in controlling and preventing crime that it has
since expanded citywide. As part of the program, officers receive training
in how to devise problem- solving strategies and build community partnerships.
The officers have consistent beats, which allows them to get to know residents
and to become familiar with neighborhood problems. This ultimately helps
the police to devise effective solutions to common problems -- such as graffiti,
broken street lights, and abandoned buildings -- which lead to crime and disorder.<BR>

<H3>RECOMMENDATION 6</H3>
<font size=4>
It is time to tell the truth. Citizens must stop allowing themselves to
be deluded by sound bites, snappy slogans, and quick solutions. Public officials
and criminal justice agencies must be held accountable for the truth about
what works -- and what does not -- in reducing substance abuse.<BR>
<H3>Specific Policies</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Criminal justice and citizen leaders should not wait for the media to
take the initiative in reporting community efforts and successes in reducing
substance abuse; they should aggressively seek out and educate editors,
news directors, and reporters.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Citizens must send the message to their politicians and public officials
that they will no longer accept sound bites over substance.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Criminal justice agencies must stop advertising cars, boats, and other
property they confiscate using drug-seizure laws; this serves only to feed
the naive notion of drug dealing as a glamorous, high-profit enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The media must avoid sensation and stereotyping in their coverage of
drug crimes. TV news, in particular, must avoid broadcasting images that
perpetuate the false notion that the majority of drug criminals are young,
violent, and often black.
</UL></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Pennsylvania District Attorneys <BR>
Educate Legislators About Treatment</B><BR>
<BR>
All state district attorneys in Pennsylvania are behind an effort to educate
the state legislature about the need for substance abuse treatment instead
of jail for non-violent addicted offenders. This support has provided political
cover for politicians who were afraid they would have looked soft on crime
by favoring treatment options.<BR>
<BR>
Public officials need to know that putting drug offenders into prison will
not cure the addictions that got them there. In fact, addicts can still
get drugs in jail. By providing treatment, however, the revolving cycle
of drug use and crime can be stopped. However, it is important to note that
some people with substance abuse problems may relapse following treatment
and may need to undergo treatment again.<BR>
<BR>
In Philadelphia, prosecutors have formed alliances with drug and alcohol
treatment providers to illustrate the need for treatment for offenders.
Philadelphia prosecutors have also vigorously lobbied for funding for such
treatment programs.<BR>
<BR>
For more information, contact: Gary Tennis, Office of the District Attorney,
1421 Arch St., Philadelphia, PA, 19102; (215) 686-5873.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>Rationale</H3>

Some public officials tell us what they think we want to hear. If they think
we want mandatory minimum sentencing, then they will tell us what we need
is mandatory minimum sentencing. Others are more sincere in looking for
an attempt to reduce substance abuse. As criminal justice professionals
and as community advocates, we can help all of these officials develop and
promote genuine solutions and programs if we provide political support and
cover. The legislator who can point to the testimony of an experienced district
attorney or judge, or the mayor who can count on the support of a community
coalition, is in a better position to promote treatment-oriented sentencing
alternatives. Therefore, we must hold our officials to a higher standard,
one in which popularity is not allowed to get in the way of truth.<BR>
<BR>
The media must share the blame. It is far simpler to cover the sensational
story than the complex one. A reporter on a short deadline can easily bang
out a story about a drug arrest, but to write an in-depth examination of
sentencing takes time and effort. Still, the media can be up to the task,
as was seen in a September, 1995 four-part examination of drug sentencing
in the Boston Globe. Those in the criminal justice system must help the
media see the big picture; they must provide editors and reporters with
a succinct analysis of the problems and substantive solutions in place of
sound bites and photo opportunities. Officials must learn that it is more
important to see their communities heal than to see themselves on the six
oUclock news.<BR>
<BR>
Both the media and politicians must be sure of their facts. An example of
what can happen when they are not is the previously noted much harsher federal
sentence for possession of crack than for possession of powder cocaine.
The U.S. Sentencing Commission found that politicians scrambled to adopt
the crack policy in the wake of the intense media coverage of the death
of basketball star Len Bias from cocaine intoxication. Although it was widely
speculated in the media that Bias had been using crack, it was learned a
year later that he had in fact been snorting powder cocaine. By then, the
crack laws were already in place.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Judges Call for Revised <BR>
Mandatory Sentencing Laws</B><BR>
<BR>
Members of the federal bench are among those who have called for a revision
in the mandatory sentencing guidelines. Judges Jack Weinstein (Brooklyn)
and Lyle Strom (Nebraska) are among the judges who have objected to the
rigid sentencing structure. Weinstein refuses to try drug cases, and has
said that our justice system is in crisis because of drug prosecutions.<BR>
<BR>
Strom does try drug cases, and recently apologized to defendants when he
was required by the appeals court to resentence them using the guidelines.
He had initially handed down reduced sentences, because he said he felt
the guidelines discriminated against blacks. "I am saying to you there is
no justification to this sentence," he said.<BR>
<BR>
A 1992 Federal Judicial Center survey of federal judges showed many opposed
to retaining the current system of mandatory sentencing guidelines, and
in favor of repealing most or all mandatory minimum sentences.<BR>
<BR>
(This information comes from Planning for the Future: Results of a 1992
Federal Judicial Center Survey of United States Judges, published by the
Federal Judicial System in 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>CONCLUSION</B><BR>
<BR>
These six recommendations are offered to concerned citizens who are willing
to face the facts. They know that mandatory minimum sentences do not work
for low-level offenders with substance abuse problems. They also know that
locking these offenders away does not cure their addictions. Building more
prisons does not prevent crime. Arresting abusers reduces neither supply
nor demand. And the three strikes laws do not rid our streets of drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Those who are willing to look past the rhetoric know that what does work
best is treatment. That's why it is crucial for the criminal justice system
to link with community services to help offenders overcome their addictions.
This breaks the cycle of drug use and crime. It will also make our streets
safer.<BR>
<BR>
If criminal justice officials -- from the cop on the beat, to the prosecutor,
to the judge on the bench, and the probation officer -- work together and with
their communities to find a range of alternatives, we will fix the failing
system.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Community Settings Key To <BR>
Treating Offenders With Addictions</B><BR>
<BR>
Thomas Coughlin, New York State Corrections Commissioner, recently told
a New York Assembly Committee, "drug addiction affecting the street level
addict can be far more successfully treated in community settings, instead
of the prison environment. Treatment, not punishment, should be the first
line of defense. Street addicts are coming to 100,000 prison cells that
cost $27,000 a year to operate. . . to get the same drug treatment that
could be available at $5,000 to $10,000 per person on the street. I am well
aware that the public response to the prevalence of crime is Tlock Tem up
and throw away the key.U It isnUt enough to tell the public Twe can prove
weUre toughU on crime because we wonUt enact alternatives. I believe that
common sense can prevail, if we only take the time to communicate to the
general public calmly and clearly what is going on."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITIES</B><BR>
<BR>
Here are two resources to assist communities in improving their criminal
justice responses to substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Byrne Grant Programs</B><BR>
Communities have an opportunity to influence and share in their state and
local criminal justice agencies initiatives by participating in the funding
process for the annual Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement
Assistance Program. This program, funded by the Department of Justice's
Bureau of Justice Assistance, is the key source of federal funding devoted
to fighting crime at the local level. Reducing the demand for drugs is one
of the key uses of the funds from this program. The program also funds community
oriented policing. For information on how you can participate in your state's
Byrne Grant funding process, contact your local police executive, governorTs
office, or the Bureau of Justice Assistance, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW, Washington,
D.C. 20531; (202) 514-6638 (formula grants to states) or (202) 514-5943
(discretionary grants to community-based organizations).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Convene a Local Policy Panel </B><BR>
Policy panels are useful for generating public awareness of substance abuse
problems among public officials and citizens. They can also encourage coordinated
strategic planning. The following steps can help lead to a successful local
policy panel:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Select key leaders in the community to serve on the panel.
Ensure that they represent expertise as well as awareness of the community.<BR>
<BR>
2. Outline the mission of your panel, so the members will know what is expected
of them.<BR>
<BR>
3. Hold a public hearing as part of the process of preparing final recommendations.
Select informed and credible witnesses representing varying points of view.<BR>
<BR>
4. Prepare a report to support the panel's recommendations. Include some
resources and examples that readers can use to implement the recommendations
in their communities.<BR>
<BR>
5. Each of the above steps can be used to attract media attention to the
issue. They are also opportunities to reinforce existing relationships and
recruit new allies. Your media strategy might include editorial board meetings
and talk radio interviews.<BR>
<BR>
6. Once the report has been released, be alert for opportunities to promote
the findings. The panel chair and members can be instrumental in making
presentations to legislative committee hearings, conferences, etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><CENTER>Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and cocaine.
But today, the new drugs of choice for some kids are common -- but often
deadly -- household substances such as white out, glue and paint. This Hot
Issue Action Kit focuses on this rising problem. We suggest you use this
material to raise public awareness in March, which is National Inhalant
Awareness Month. We especially encourage you to reach out to youth who have
dropped out of school and may not be aware of the dangers associated with
inhalants.<BR>
<BR>
To get this message out to the public and key groups in your community,
we have provided you with the following:
<UL>
<LI>An <A HREF="overview.html">Overview </A> outlining Inhalants and how
they are commonly abused;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A list of <A HREF="Warning.html">Warning Signs</A> of Inhalant abuse
to help others recognize when someone may be using household products to
get high;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A <A HREF="Inhalant_Facts.html">Fact Sheet</A> summarizing the research
on the dangers of Inhalant abuse and national trends of this problem among
youth;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Concrete <A HREF="Action_steps.html">Action Steps</A> you can take to
address Inhalant abuse in <B>your</B> community, and profiles of <A HREF="others.html">What
Others Have Done</A> in their communities.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Sample <A HREF="letter.html">Letter to the Editor</A> and <A HREF="oped.html">Op-Ed</A>
piece you can tailor to fit your community and then submit to your local
newspaper for publication. 
</UL>
We would like to know if these tools are helpful and if you have attracted
media attention for your efforts. Please give us your feedback and any suggestions
for improving Hot Issues. You can call <A HREF="mailto:diane@jointogether.org">Diane
Barry</A> or <A HREF="mailto:lisa@jointogether.org">Lisa Falk</A> at Join

<H2><CENTER>Surveys: <BR>
Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>Participants:</H3>
In twenty seven states, more than 500 volunteers (402 youth; 124 adults)
were involved in counting tobacco outlets within a quarter-mile radius of
over 200 schools. These schools represented over 100 communities from across
the country. Communities as diverse as Anchorage, Alaska, Winner, South
Dakota, Ellsworth, Maine, and Jupiter, Florida, representing all four corners
of the U.S., submitted results to Join Together. <BR>
<BR>
This tobacco outlet counting project generated a great deal of interest,
enthusiasm, and participation among concerned citizens. For example: 
<UL>
<LI>75 youth, accompanied by 3 adults surveyed Boyne City Public Schools
in Boyne City, MI; 
<LI>64 youth on their own surveyed a middle school in Creston, OH; 
<LI>35 youth and 3 adults in Passaic, NJ surveyed an elementary school in
their community; 
<LI>25 youth and 4 adults surveyed a high school in Monroe, LA. 
<LI>A single volunteer in Laredo, TX surveyed 27 schools in his area; while
another one surveyed 22 schools in Leominster, MA; 
<LI>A team of two adult volunteers in Martinsburg, WV surveyed 20 schools.
</UL>
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION:<BR>
<BR>
Community teams selected a total of 222 schools for this project, approximately
half (45%) of which were elementary schools. Middle schools represented
30%, while high schools comprised 25% of the total number of schools surveyed.<BR>
<BR>
Half (49%) of the areas surveyed surrounding schools were classified as
rural, while 28% of areas were classified as urban; the remaining areas,
23%, were classified as suburban. This means that youth access to tobacco
is not just a big city problem--it affects rural communities all across
the country! <BR>
<BR>
Almost two-thirds of communities described the area in which the school
is located as mixed commercial &amp; residential; one-third indicated the
areas were residential.<BR>

Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>Survey Results:</H3>
<BR>
There were <B>over 1,200 tobacco retail outlets</B> found within a quarter-mile
radius of these 222 schools. Just seven percent (7%) of the total number
of schools surveyed reported that there were no outlets within the quarter
mile radius! This represents an average of approximately 6 outlets located
near each school. As the chart below indicates, convenience and grocery
stores which sell tobacco were most commonly found near schools. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type of Outlet | Number | Percentag</B>e
<UL>
<LI>Convenience Store | 300 | 24%<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Grocery Store | 261 | 21%<BR>

<LI>Gas Station | 188 | 15%<BR>

<B>TOTAL</B> <B>| 1,236 | 100%</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
* On the survey form, teams recorded &quot;other&quot; tobacco outlets.
Some of these other tobacco retail outlets listed included <B>laundromats,
candy stores, card stores, bowling </B>alleys, paper stores, take-out pizza
/ deli establishments, and thrift stores. Clearly, children frequent these
types of establishments, and sell products which appeal to children. Among
youths aged 12-17 years who usually bought their own cigarettes in 1989,
about 85% often or sometimes bought them from a small store, 50% from a
large store, and 15% from a vending machine.<BR>

Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>Interesting Stories:</H3>
<BR>
The community teams we worked with presented us with some interesting stories
and comments. Here are just a few: 
<UL>
<LI>At a convenience store in Newport, NH, a team of seven students reported
that &quot;individual packs on a rack in the store were readily <B>accessible
to teens</B>, and that they could easily be shoplifted.&quot; The team leader,
a school nurse, and the student team brought this problem to the attention
of the store employees, and the rack was moved behind the counter. The team
confirmed that this is a store where their friends and other students would
go to purchase cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In Boone, Iowa, the team reported that <B>almost all establishments</B>
(which sold tobacco products)<B> had in-store single pack displays in front
of the counter</B>. Again, the implication is that underage youth could
easily steal the packs. When a team member (who happened to be a local sheriff)
brought this fact to the attention of a store employee, he replied &quot;What
do I care? The tobacco industry pays for this display, so any loss due to
shoplifting doesn't come out of our pocket.&quot; This team plans to release
its findings to the two local newspapers, and to the local radio station.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>While some rural communities indicated that none to few tobacco outlets
exist within a quarter-mile radius of schools, others, like the team from
Passaic, NJ indicated that there were a total of <B>76 tobacco outlets surrounding
one school, including candy </B>stores! The Director of the Passaic Alliance
for the Prevention of Substance Abuse told us that this project was very
enlightening for the kids who conducted the survey. &quot;The kids were
shocked to find this incredibly high number of tobacco outlets on the streets
surrounding their school! Also noteworthy, many of the stores which sold
cigarettes were mom &amp; pop-type stores, which often sell candy and items
that appeal to youth.&quot; Additionally, the Director plans to submit the
survey results to the local newspaper, in order to increase citizens' awareness.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Several communities, such as Mount Vernon, OH indicated that they had
previously conducted sting operations, whereby minors attempt to purchase
tobacco products. The team from Mount Vernon has reported that during the
first sting, tobacco retailers illegally sold tobacco products to minors
44% of the time; during the second sting, the percentage dropped to 33%.
By having conducted the tobacco retail outlet counting project, other communities
may decide to follow-up with a sting operation as well. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>A high school football coach in Oshkosh, WI conducted a survey in his
community, polling 6 schools. The coach reported that &quot;students admitted
that it is easier to purchase cigarettes during certain hours...the kids
know who is working during certain shifts (friends or lenient store employees),
and will go to those stores during those times.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In New Haven, CT, the team found that in many of the tobacco retail
outlets, &quot;loosies&quot; or single cigarettes were being sold. The youth
team confirmed to one of the adults who worked with them that &quot;it is
<B>much easier for underage kids to buy </B>loosies.&quot; In this community,
the adult volunteer stated, &quot;single cigarette sales is a huge problem.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In Fayetteville, NC, an adult volunteer reported that, &quot;the availability
of tobacco near schools in their community is immense, as is advertising
for tobacco products. But more surprising is the fact that there were zero
vending machines--efforts should therefore focus on convenience stores and
gas stations.&quot; Volunteers plan to address these issues when planning
follow-up steps. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>An Open Letter to the Editors of College Newspapers from the Coalition to Reduce Binge Drinking</H3></CENTER>

May 10, 1996<BR><BR>

Dear Student Editors:<BR><BR>


College and university-sponsored newspapers play a unique and important role in campus life. They serve the college community by informing students, giving voice to student concerns and raising issues for consideration and debate. In what you choose to publish, you influence student life and attitudes. It is because of this influence that we are asking you to adopt editorial policies (if your paper doesn't already have them) which would prohibit alcohol advertisements that promote heavy and abusive drinking.<BR><BR>

Binge drinking has reached epidemic levels in college communities across the country. A 1995 Harvard University study by Dr. Henry Wechsler and others found that almost half of all college students binge drink. In that context, advertisements by local bars that promote penny or nickel drinks, all-you-can-drink specials, ladies nights, and weeknight discounts represent an assault on the academic community and the purposes for which students attend college. Those ads encourage abusive alcohol consumption and contribute to alcohol-related problems that cause serious consequences for students and the community.<BR><BR>

According to the Harvard study, students who binge drink reported adverse effects including: hospitalization for alcohol overdose, trouble with police, damaging property, physical injury, unplanned or unprotected sexual activity, blackouts, falling behind on school work, missing classes, doing something they later regretted, arguing with friends, and hangovers.<BR><BR>

Binging also has "second-hand" effects on non-binging students and community members. 87% of students on "high-binging" campuses, where more than half of students binge drink, reported one or more of the following problems as a result of anothers' binge drinking: being the victim of sexual assault or "date rape"; being pushed, hit, or assaulted; having property damaged; being insulted or humiliated, being confronted with unwanted sexual advances; being in a serious argument or quarrel, having to "baby-sit" a drunken friend; and having study or sleep interrupted.<BR><BR>

Publishing advertisements for "bar crawls" or "quarter pitchers" sends the message that college and heavy drinking are inextricably linked. By refusing to accept ads that promote heavy drinking, you can help establish more sensible drinking norms, revitalize students' academic missions, and contribute to the health of the college community.<BR><BR>

For technical assistance in developing policies restricting alcohol advertising or for more information on binge drinking in general, please contact Debra Erenberg at the Alcohol Policies Project of the Center for Science in the Public Interest at 202-332-9100, ext. 338.<BR><BR>

Sincerely, <BR><BR><BR><B>The Coalition to Reduce Binge Drinking</B>
<BR>1875 Connecticut Ave, N. W., Suite 300<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20009-5728<BR><BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Are Inhalants?</CENTER>
</H2>
Today, more than 1,000 legal and useful household, school and office products
are being used--primarily by youth--to get high. This practice is commonly
known as inhalant abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Inhalants are divided into the following four categories: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Volatile gases and solvents -- lighter fluid, barbecue grill gas, spray
paint, paint thinner and glue. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Aerosols -- hair spray, deodorants and other pressurized products that
are used more for the propellant capability than for the contents inside
the can. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nitrates -- Butyl nitrites, which are often known by the trade names
of Rush, Locker Room, Bolt and Climax and are used as room odorizers; and
amyl nitrates, which are packaged in capsules known as poppers and snappers
and were originally created for heart patients. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Anesthetic gases -- Nitrous oxide, which is known as the dentists laughing
gas is also available in small cylinders called whippets, which propel whipped
cream in commercial machines. 
</UL>
<B>These substances are abused in the following ways: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Sniffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the nose. A youngster
may sniff a container of white out, glue, paint thinner or gasoline to inhale
the fumes through the nostrils. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Huffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the mouth. A student
can spray paint on a handkerchief and hold it over his or her mouth and
breath in the fumes. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Bagging -- Inhaling the vapors through a bag. A youth can spray fumes
on a cloth or piece of clothing, then insert it into a plastic or paper
bag to increase the concentration of the vapors. Then he or she puts the
bag opening over the mouth or nose and breathes in. Some users may also
place their heads directly inside the bag.

<H2><CENTER>Warning Signs of Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
You may want to send the following list to your local newspaper and ask
the editor to run this to educate readers about the signs of inhalant abuse.
You can also create a poster or flier from this list and distribute to parents,
teachers and youth in your community, and post it in local schools, grocery
stores, churches and recreation centers. <BR>
<BR>
It is important for parents, teachers and young people to know some of the
signs of inhalant abuse, so they can recognize when someone is using household
products to get high. Some effects of inhalants are short-term, and they
vary greatly from product to product.<BR>
 <BR>
Some of the following symptoms listed below, provided by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, are warning signs that someone may be using inhalants: 
<UL>
<LI>Red, runny eyes or nose 
<LI>Sores around the mouth 
<LI>Chemical breath 
<LI>Drunk, dazed appearance 
<LI>Nausea 
<LI>Loss of appetite 
<LI>Anxiety or irritability 
<LI>Paint or stains on the body or clothing 
<LI>Chronic inhalant abusers are also anxious, easily excited, irritable
and restless. 
<LI>Inhalant withdrawal symptoms include hand tremors, headaches, nervousness
and sweating.

<H2><CENTER>Some Facts About Inhalants</CENTER>
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Inhalants -- including glue, paint and other regular household products
-- are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds, after
alcohol and tobacco.<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">1 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>As many as one in every five students in the United States has sniffed
or huffed (inhaled through the mouth) such products as markers, gasoline
and air fresheners by the time they reach seventh grade.<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">2
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Inhalant use is on the rise. The number of 8th graders reporting having
used inhalants at least once in their lifetime rose from 20 percent in 1994
to 22 percent in 1995. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">3</A> <BR>
<BR>
<LI>One of the greatest dangers is that while many youth admit to sniffing
some toxic items, they do not consider this to be inhalant abuse. These
products are easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and may give a
pleasurable effect by depressing the central nervous system. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">4
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Today, young people and adults abuse more than 1,000 common products.
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">5 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis put themselves at risk
for permanent and severe brain damage. This is because the human brain is
composed of about one-third fatty tissue. Inhalant vapors react with these
fatty tissues by literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic inhalant
abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks like
walking, talking and thinking. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">6</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Sudden Sniffing Death syndrome frequently occurs when someone inhales
high concentration aerosol sprays, model airplane glue and spot removers.
These items emit especially toxic fumes absorbed by the brain cells, kidneys,
liver and bone marrow. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">7</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Inhalant use often leads to other illicit drug use. Youngsters may try
inhalants first because they are legal, easy to get, inexpensive and difficult
to detect. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">8 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Because the chemicals in inhalants enter the lungs in such high concentrations,
they can have a more toxic affect than any other type of abused drug. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">9
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Each year, hundreds of children die from inhalant use, yet many parents
and educators remain ignorant of this silent epidemic. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">10
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nearly nine out of 10 parents say they would be very surprised if they
found out their children were using inhalants. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">11

<H2><CENTER>What You Can Do About Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
Inhalant abuse is a widespread--and serious--problem among youth today.
In fact, as many as one in five students abuses regular household substances--such
as glue, hair spray, lighter fluid and paint thinner--to get high. And unlike
alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, these products are easy for kids to obtain
and do not make adults suspicious if they see a child using them.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, these products can lead to a number of serious side affects
for users, including sudden death. And the problem is not getting better.
The rate of inhalant users continues to rise in states across the country,
prompting some schools to educate kids and parents about the dangers. But
unfortunately, many young inhalant users have dropped out of school or do
not attend classes. Therefore, these young people do not know the possible
consequences of their behavior. That's why it is crucial that we find ways
to warn them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Here are some steps you can take:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Involve a wide variety of local groups in your public education efforts.
You may want to include doctors, nurses, pharmacists, politicians, school
drug-education coordinators, law enforcement officers, teachers, youth,
parents, business owners, media representatives and clergy. Brainstorm together
ways to reach high-risk youth in your community. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Put up posters warning about the dangers of inhalant abuse in places
young people frequent, such as recreation centers, record stores, fast food
restaurants, pizza places, ice cream parlors, candy stores, movie theaters
and supermarkets. Be sure to list resources people can turn to for help.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local radio stations that play music that appeals to youth to run
public service announcements about inhalant abuse and the associated risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local movie theaters to run a public service announcement about
inhalant abuse before each movie. See if a local corporation or business
that caters to youth will donate the money to produce the PSA. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local newspaper to run a full-page advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse to warn parents and young people about the risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>See if your local cable station will run an advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse. Ask local students to write, direct, produce
and act in the ad. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local grocery stores to stuff fact sheets about inhalant abuse--and
how to get help--in customers bags. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local businesses--such as the gas or phone company--to include bill
stuffers about the dangers of inhalant abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask manufacturers of products that youth inhale to work with you to
find ways to reduce this abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Plan ahead for &quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week,&quot;
which is sponsored by the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition/Texas Prevention
Partnership and is held the third week in March. Ask your mayor or city
council to sign a proclamation recognizing this week in your city or town
and plan some events to call attention to this serious problem. (For more
information about this week, see <A HREF="others.html">What Others Have
Done</A>.) <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Call the photo editor at your local newspaper and offer to set up a
photograph of some of the products that can be misused as inhalants. This
can help to alert parents that some &quot;innocent-looking&quot; household
products can actually be deadly.

<UL>
<LI>Many innocent-looking substances stored in household cabinets, closets
and garages may actually be fatal. That's because young people abuse these
products to get high. That's the message from the National Inhalant Prevention
Coalition/Texas Prevention Partnership. They sponsor a week-long annual
campaign called, <I>&quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week:
They're Right Under Your Nose.&quot;</I> The goal of the campaign is to
alert communities to the danger of everyday products being inhaled or misused.
The campaign began in response to a 1992 Texas school survey that showed
one in four students have tried inhalants by the time they reach the seventh
grade. This national campaign relies on local groups to get the message
out in their communities. To do so, artwork, news releases and advertisements
are provided and can be tailored for individual schools, prevention coalitions,
cities and towns. In addition, videos and posters are available for a small
fee. In 1995, over 1,000 partners from almost every state joined the campaign.<B>
For more information, contact Harvey Weiss at (800) 269-4237.</B><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Illinois residents are getting a crash course in the dangers of inhalant
abuse, thanks to a statewide educational campaign there launched by the
lieutenant governor's office. The ongoing campaign, which began in 1994
and follows Texas' example, was sparked in response to survey findings that
inhalants are the fastest growing category of drug use in that state. In
fact, one in 10 Illinois teenagers abuses household projects to get high.
The statewide campaign, called &quot;Danger: Right Under Your Nose,&quot;
provides materials, tools and suggestions that communities can use to localize
the message. There is also an 800 number people can call for more information
about inhalants. The campaign has been very successful to date, raising
awareness about the problem and risks of inhalant abuse throughout the state.
<B>For more information about the campaign, call Debra Palandech at (312)
814-5220.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Letter to the Editor</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following letter--or use it as is--and send it to
the editor of your local newspaper</I>.<BR>
<HR>Dear Editor:<BR>
<BR>
White out. Glue. Nail polish remover. Lighter fluid. Paint. What do these
various household products all have in common? They all tragically kill
kids.<BR>
<BR>
Today, many young people in our community abuse such products that are readily
available in our medicine chests and on the shelves in our stores. They
inhale these and a host of other substances through the nose and/or mouth
to get a quick high.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, these kids are not aware of the high risks that come along
with this behavior. The fact is that each year hundreds of children die
from inhalant use--sometimes on their first try--yet many parents and educators
remain ignorant of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has sniffed or &quot;huffed&quot;
(inhaled through the mouth) such products as magic markers, gasoline and
air fresheners by the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; These products are easily available,
free or inexpensive, legal and may give a pleasurable affect by depressing
the central nervous system.<BR>
<BR>
And those kids who do not die from inhalants still put themselves at a risk
for a number of other serious side affects, including permanent and severe
brain damage. Chronic inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability
to perform everyday tasks like walking, talking and thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Please help to get the message out to parents and to kids that inhalants
are dangerous. If you suspect someone you know may be using inhalants, consult
a school counselor or a drug counseling center for help.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Sample Op-Ed</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following Sample Op-Ed to fit your community and then
ask your Editorial Page Editor at your local  newspaper to run it.<BR>
</I><HR><BR>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and crack
cocaine. But some of the most lethal drugs are simpler and easier to obtain.
<BR>
<BR>
We can find them in the drawers of our desks, stashed in our cabinets, and
lined up on our grocery store shelves. Things like paint, magic markers,
white out, lighter fluid, hair sprays, vegetable cooking sprays and air
fresheners. Things that are cheap and easy to obtain, and at the same time,
when inhaled can prove fatal.<BR>
<BR>
These and close to 1,000 other everyday household products are being abused
by our kids to get a quick high. They inhale them through their nose (sniffing)
or mouth (huffing). Most kids who try these products think they are harmless.
They do not know the facts.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that hundreds of children each year die from inhalant use--sometimes
on their first try. Nonetheless, many parents and educators remain ignorant
of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has tried inhalants by
the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; That is because these products are
easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and give a pleasurable affect
by depressing the central nervous system. <BR>
<BR>
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<BR>
<BR>
People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis and do not die put themselves
at risk for permanent and severe brain damage. Inhalant vapors react with
fatty tissues in the brain, literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic
inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks
like walking, talking and thinking. <BR>
<BR>
That's why we must warn our kids about the dangers of inhalants, and make
sure that they know enough not to try them.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the symptoms of inhalant abuse include red or runny eyes and/or
nose; spots and/or sores around the mouth; unusual breath odor; drunk, dazed
or dizzy appearance; correction fluid on fingernails; sitting with a pen
or marker near the nose; constantly smelling shirt sleeves; nausea and/or
loss of appetite; and paint or stain marks on clothing or on skin.<BR>
<BR>
If you suspect your child or someone else you know is using inhalants, please
call (NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF EITHER YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LOCAL INHALANT
ABUSE RESOURCE) for help.<BR>

<H3>Points of Presence (POP)</H3>
</CENTER>
Points of Presence is the number of local dial-up phone numbers a national ISP offers.   Almost always, each point of presence is actually a series of phone lines, each with a modem capable of connecting the customer's computer with the ISPs Internet gateway.  For example, if an ISP says it has 300 points of presence across the nation, it means that there are 300 local dial-up numbers in various cities and states.
<BR><BR>
<B>Caveat</B><BR>
While many major national providers own their POPs, some of them lease networks from other providers to supplement their national or regional POP coverage.  SprintNet and Compuserve's vast national modem networks are the two such networks that are commonly leased by other ISPs.  Usually, but not always, you will pay an hourly surcharge to access your ISP over another company's network connection.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>About Mailing Lists</CENTER>
</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What are mailing lists?</B><BR>
Internet mailing lists are an easy and efficient method of conducting group
discussion on any topic between individuals across the nation
or even the world. A mailing list is organized around a specific topic (such
as substance abuse), and interested readers subscribe via their own e-mail
address to monitor and contribute to the ongoing discussion. For this reason,
mailing lists are often called Discussion Groups. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How do they work?</B><BR>
Internet email lists are a sort of &quot;closed circuit&quot; communication
device between subscribers with a common interest. Using regular Internet
email, subscribers send messages to a special email address on a computer
maintained by the organization managing the list. This computer then automatically
re-sends each message to the email address of every subscriber on the mailing
list, usually within a matter of minutes. <BR>
<BR>
Subscribers follow and contribute to the ongoing discussion simply by reading
and sending their personal email. If a subscriber wishes to comment on a
post to the mailing list, he or she has the option of sending a response
for broadcast to the entire group, or just to the person originally posting
the message. <BR>
<BR>
<B>SUBSCRIBING</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Restricted Subscription</B><BR>
Some mailing lists (such as <A HREF="subabuse.html">Subabuse</A>) screen potential subscribers. You'll need to send
email to the list adminstrator
asking to be placed on the mailing list. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Listservs: automated subscribing</B><BR>
Many mailing lists have an automated subscription program called Listserv
that has it's own email address on the computer managing the mailing list.
To subscribe to these lists, you need two things: 
<UL>
<LI>the listserv address; and 
<LI>the name of the mailing list. 
</UL>
Listserve addresses usually look something like &quot;listserv@statecollege.edu&quot;.
List names are usually concise, one-word titles that suggest the general
discussion topic (e.g., a substance abuse discussion list might be named
&quot;drug-talk&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
To sign up for the list, just send a piece of email to the Listserv address
with one line in the body of the letter: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>subscribe <B>listname yourname </B>(e.g., "subscribe drug-talk
Kay Smith")<BR>
<BR>
<I>Caution:</I> be sure to send your subscription message to the Listserv
address, not the discussion list address, or everyone on the list will read
it!</BLOCKQUOTE>

Watch for an automated reply welcoming you to the list. It will include
instructions about how to post messages, and how to remove yourself from
the list. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Other automated list servers</B> <BR>
Other mailing list servers (such as Majordomo) may use slightly different
language for subscribing. Most majordomo-type servers want your email address
instead of your name in the subscribe message you send. In almost all cases,
if your subscription request doesn't work, you'll get an automated reply
with instructions about the proper syntax needed.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>Subabuse:
<BR>
Join Together's National Discussion List
</H2></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Description</B><BR>
Subabuse, the electronic mailing list operated by Join Together, has become
a major avenue of discussion, collaboration and technical assistance for
hundreds of organizations and individuals across the nation. Subscribers
routinely post questions, answers and comments about community-based efforts
to reduce substance abuse. In addition, Join Together's technical assistance
staff monitors Subabuse traffic and frequently responds to queries via the
list. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Purpose</B><BR>
Participation in Subabuse is not open to the general public.  The purpose
of Subabuse is to support community organizations involved in the planning,
funding and management of substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.
 Subabuse is designed for peer-to-peer interaction between professionals
who are working to strengthen community-based prevention and treatment programs.
 For this reason, we restrict participation in Subabuse discussion to such
individuals.<BR>
<BR>
Other areas of Join Together Online, such as the <A HREF="/JTO/forum/coffee.html">Coffee
House</A>, are broader in focus and provide opportunities for group interaction
for anyone visiting our site.  In addition, many of the discussion lists profiled in <A HREF="otherlists.html">Other
mailing lists</A> are open to anyone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sample the Content!</B><BR>
We archive the discussion on Subabuse at our gopher site. Take a few minutes
to <A HREF="/go.qry?gopher://gopher.igc.apc.org:7003/11/idea/subabuse">browse recent
posts</A> to the list from your colleagues across the nation. Doing so will
give you an idea of the kind of questions, answers and ongoing discussion
on Subabuse.  It may also help you determine whether to request a subscription yourself. <BR>
<BR>
You may also do a full-text <A HREF="gopher://gopher.igc.apc.org:2998/7JT-TALK-SUBABUSE">search
of all posts</A> to look for a specific topic that's been discussed. In
fact, we recommend that you conduct a quick search of the Subabuse archives
prior to mailing a new question to the mailing list; you might be surprised
to see that it has already come up before.<BR>

Internet mailing lists are an easy and efficient method of conducting group
discussion on any topic between individuals across the nation
or even the world. A mailing list is organized around a specific topic (such
as substance abuse), and interested readers subscribe via their own e-mail
address to monitor and contribute to the ongoing discussion. For this reason,
mailing lists are often called Discussion Groups. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How do they work?</B><BR>
Internet email lists are a sort of &quot;closed circuit&quot; communication
device between subscribers with a common interest. Using regular Internet
email, subscribers send messages to a special email address on a computer
maintained by the organization managing the list. This computer then automatically
re-sends each message to the email address of every subscriber on the mailing
list, usually within a matter of minutes. <BR>
<BR>
Subscribers follow and contribute to the ongoing discussion simply by reading
and sending their personal email. If a subscriber wishes to comment on a
post to the mailing list, he or she has the option of sending a response
for broadcast to the entire group, or just to the person originally posting
the message. <BR>
<BR>
<B>SUBSCRIBING</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Restricted Subscription</B><BR>
Some mailing lists (such as <A HREF="subabuse.html">Subabuse</A>) screen potential subscribers. You'll need to send
email to the list adminstrator
asking to be placed on the mailing list. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Listservs: automated subscribing</B><BR>
Many mailing lists have an automated subscription program called Listserv
that has it's own email address on the computer managing the mailing list.
To subscribe to these lists, you need two things: 
<UL>
<LI>the listserv address; and 
<LI>the name of the mailing list. 
</UL>
Listserve addresses usually look something like &quot;listserv@statecollege.edu&quot;.
List names are usually concise, one-word titles that suggest the general
discussion topic (e.g., a substance abuse discussion list might be named
&quot;drug-talk&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
To sign up for the list, just send a piece of email to the Listserv address
with one line in the body of the letter: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>subscribe <B>listname yourname </B>(e.g., "subscribe drug-talk
Kay Smith")<BR>
<BR>
<I>Caution:</I> be sure to send your subscription message to the Listserv
address, not the discussion list address, or everyone on the list will read
it!</BLOCKQUOTE>

Watch for an automated reply welcoming you to the list. It will include
instructions about how to post messages, and how to remove yourself from
the list. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Other automated list servers</B> <BR>
Other mailing list servers (such as Majordomo) may use slightly different
language for subscribing. Most majordomo-type servers want your email address
instead of your name in the subscribe message you send. In almost all cases,
if your subscription request doesn't work, you'll get an automated reply
with instructions about the proper syntax needed.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>Subabuse:
<BR>
Join Together's National Discussion List
</H2></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Description</B><BR>
Subabuse, the electronic mailing list operated by Join Together, has become
a major avenue of discussion, collaboration and technical assistance for
hundreds of organizations and individuals across the nation. Subscribers
routinely post questions, answers and comments about community-based efforts
to reduce substance abuse. In addition, Join Together's technical assistance
staff monitors Subabuse traffic and frequently responds to queries via the
list. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Purpose</B><BR>
Participation in Subabuse is not open to the general public.  The purpose
of Subabuse is to support community organizations involved in the planning,
funding and management of substance abuse prevention and treatment programs.
 Subabuse is designed for peer-to-peer interaction between professionals
who are working to strengthen community-based prevention and treatment programs.
 For this reason, we restrict participation in Subabuse discussion to such
individuals.<BR>
<BR>
Other areas of Join Together Online, such as the <A HREF="/JTO/forum/coffee.html">Coffee
House</A>, are broader in focus and provide opportunities for group interaction
for anyone visiting our site.  In addition, many of the discussion lists profiled in <A HREF="otherlists.html">Other
mailing lists</A> are open to anyone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sample the Content!</B><BR>
We archive the discussion on Subabuse at our gopher site. Take a few minutes
to <A HREF="/go.qry?gopher://gopher.igc.apc.org:7003/11/idea/subabuse">browse recent
posts</A> to the list from your colleagues across the nation. Doing so will
give you an idea of the kind of questions, answers and ongoing discussion
on Subabuse.  It may also help you determine whether to request a subscription yourself. <BR>
<BR>
You may also do a full-text <A HREF="gopher://gopher.igc.apc.org:2998/7JT-TALK-SUBABUSE">search
of all posts</A> to look for a specific topic that's been discussed. In
fact, we recommend that you conduct a quick search of the Subabuse archives
prior to mailing a new question to the mailing list; you might be surprised
to see that it has already come up before.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Local Groups Can Do</CENTER>
</H2>
There are many groups in your community that can help spread the word that
marijuana use is dangerous. Some organizations you might want to partner
with include businesses, youth groups, mall management, coaches and parent/
teacher associations, civic and professional groups, doctors offices, health
clinics, movie theaters, video stores and restaurants. Here are some things
these groups can do:
<UL>
<LI>Hold brown bag lunches for employees and volunteers to present the latest
statistics on marijuana problems, describe the Reality Check campaign, and
discuss what different groups can do to promote marijuana prevention among
youth in your community.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask businesses to co-sponsor the campaign by providing their logo or
slogan so you can add it to some of the materials included in this kit.
You or they can reproduce these pieces and distribute them to employees,
board members, and other businesses in the area to show their support for
this effort.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask companies to use their newsletter or other printed materials to
let employees and customers or members know about the risks of marijuana
and what parents can do.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Present marijuana prevention sessions at conferences, workshops and
trainings related to substance abuse, health and safety, parenting, education,
child development, law enforcement or any other related topic.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Insert copies of marijuana prevention materials in employee payroll
envelopes, membership mailings, invoices, bills, and statements to customers
or members.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Organize volunteers to distribute prevention materials at health fairs,
sporting events and rock concerts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Incorporate prevention tips, information and messages on the harmful
effects of marijuana in newsletters, bulletins and other mailings to members
and constituents<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Develop a speakers bureau on this issue, make local law enforcement,
advocacy, and other speakers available for community gatherings and meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Provide talking points to religious and civic leaders to incorporate
into sermons and speeches.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Hold an anti-marijuana essay, poster, slogan, rap music or video contest
for area youth. Ask local companies to help you advertise and provide prizes.

You can share these facts with parents, teachers and guidance counselors
when school resumes in the fall. You can also use these statistics as talking
points when speaking with reporters, being interviewed on television or
radio talk shows, and giving a presentation on this issue.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>More than 75,000 children in the 6th grade have tried marijuana. (PRIDE
Questionnaire Report: 1992-1993 National Summary-USE grades 6-12, National
Institute on Drug Abuse, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health,
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1994, p. 259.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nearly one in every ten 8th graders and one out of every four high school
students uses marijuana. (NIDA. Monitoring the Future Study: Advance Data:
July 1995. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The average first-use age of marijuana is 13.9 years of age. (SAMHSA.
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Main Findings 1993, 1995, pp. 148.
U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>According to data accumulated over the past 20 years, the likelihood
of using a drug is affected by one's perceptions of harms associated with
that drug. (NIDA. National Survey Results on Drug Use From the Monitoring
the Future Study, 1975-1994, 1995, Table I, pp. 8. U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services.) For instance, the latest research shows that the increase
in marijuana use among youth was both preceded and accompanied by a decrease
in perceived risk. (Ibid., pp. 254.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Problems among young people that are associated with marijuana include:
school drop-out; not learning important interpersonal coping skills; problematic

<H2><CENTER>Sample Pitch Letter</CENTER>
</H2>
Your local media outlets can be of valuable assistance in helping you get
the message out that marijuana use among young people is dangerous. But
it is important to keep in mind when approaching local reporters with a
story idea that establishing a relationship with them is a two-way street.
Just as they can provide widespread coverage of an issue, you can provide
them with valuable facts and other sources they can contact for more information
and interviews. Keep this in mind as you tailor the following pitch letter
with local examples and statistics and send it to a reporter or editor at
your local newspaper, or to an assignment editor at your local television
or radio station. 
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P><B>Dear (Media Contact):</B><BR>
<BR>
Did you know that some current forms of marijuana are &quot;spiked&quot;
with other illicit drugs like cocaine, crack cocaine, PCP and even embalming
fluid?<BR>
<BR>
This makes a dangerous drug even more dangerous. Especially when we realize
some of its users are as young as 9 or 10-years-old, according to recent
surveys. And more and more older kids are using marijuana. Marijuana usage
rates among older students -- ages 12 to 17 -- have almost doubled since
the early 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
This sends a clear message that we need to educate another generation about
the dangers of marijuana use. And we also need to educate their parents.
Part of what makes this issue so complex is that some of these parents used
marijuana themselves in the past, so they do not feel comfortable about
talking to their children about this serious issue.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the fact is that this drug impairs young people's judgment,
which can lead to unprotected sex, pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases,
including HIV/AIDS. It also contributes to accidents, violence and car crashes.
The 1995 Drug Abuse Warning Network report released last November shows
that medical emergency room episodes related to marijuana have increased
155 percent since 1990. In addition, this drug also negatively affects concentration
and schoolwork and can cause young users to be suspended, expelled, or get
a police record.<BR>
<BR>
You can help alert residents in our community about the growing problem
of marijuana use and the many dangers associated with this drug. I can provide
you with many statistics showing the scope of the problem, and the consequences.
I can also put you in touch with some parents, teachers and students to
get their input on this issue.<BR>
<BR>
You can reach me at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER). I will call you next week to follow
up. This is a serious issue and one we can no longer ignore. Thanks for
your time.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Public Service Announcements</CENTER>
</H2>
The following public service announcement scripts about the problem of marijuana
use among young people are targeted to parents and are specifically tailored
to be run in the summer when kids are out of school. Provide a few of these
to your local radio station during the summer months and ask the station
manager to air them. You can also insert some local facts.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Subject: MAKE THIS SUMMER SAFE: TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT MARIJUANA<BR>
</B><BR>
1) Keep things sailing smoothly this summer. Talk with your kids about the
dangers of using marijuana. In just one year, the number of eighth graders
who use marijuana has doubled. Don't let your child be part of next year's
statistics. Call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
at 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
2) It's summertime and the going is easy. But some kids are going for the
wrong thing. They are going for marijuana. Marijuana use is a growing problem
among young people. Set your kids straight. Talk to them about marijuana.
To find out more, call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
at 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
3) Help your kids stay on the right side of the fence this summer. Sit down
and have a heart-to-heart talk with them about the dangers of using marijuana.
Kids are under a lot of pressure as they get older. Pressures to do well
in school, pressures from parents, pressures from kids who use drugs. It's
never too early to talk to your kids about the dangers of using marijuana
and other drugs. Call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
at 1-800-729-6686. Marijuana: It's a drug. Help your kids understand.<BR>
<BR>
4) Don't let your kids rock the boat this summer. Talk to them about the
dangers of using marijuana now, before it's too late. More and more 12 to
17 year olds are using marijuana these days. Don't let your kids become
part of the growing numbers. Need some tips on what to say? Call the National
Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at 1-800-729-6686. Marijuana:
It's a drug. Help your kids understand.<BR>
<BR>
5) Don't let your kids' dreams go up in smoke this summer. In just one year,
the number of eighth graders who use marijuana has doubled. That's why you
should talk to your kids about the dangers of drug use now, before it's
too late. Need tips? Call the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug
Information at 1-800-729-6686. Marijuana: It's a drug. Help your kids understand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>GENERAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS</B><BR>
<BR>
These Public Service Announcements are more general and can be run on radio
stations that parents listen to at any time of the year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Starting Point <BR>
</B>Where would you start if you wanted to undermine the future of a generation?
What would you do first to make sure that kids did poorly in school, made
careless and dangerous decisions about their friendships and school activities?
How would you begin disrupting their communities, destroying traditions,
and threatening the stability of homes and families? Reality check: marijuana
is a drug. Help our kids understand. Call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A Terrible Thought <BR>
</B>Wouldn't it be terrible if kids used something they thought was harmless
but really caused a lot of trouble. Suppose it made them not care, made
it harder to pay attention and learn, harder to remember things, and harder
to make friends and get along with others? What if they believed that everybody
was using it, even though most kids really weren't? Reality check: marijuana's
a drug -- help our kids understand. Call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Company They Keep</B> <BR>
Marijuana is more harmful than we think. But here's another reality check:
it also exposes our kids to a drug culture. It puts them in touch with people
using and pushing other drugs, and these people may be involved in dangerous
activities. Like early and unsafe sex. Carrying weapons and starting fights.
Drug abuse, trafficking and addiction. Give kids what they need to avoid
marijuana and you may prevent a whole lot more. To find out how, call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cause &amp; Effect</B> <BR>
If you think there is no scientific evidence that the use of one drug necessarily
causes the use of any other drug, you need a reality check. Among adolescents
who use illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin--almost every one of them
used marijuana first. So if we prevent use of marijuana we might also prevent
other illicit drug use. Makes you think, doesn't it? For more information,
call 1-800-729-6686.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bluntly Speaking<BR>
</B> Let's be blunt about marijuana. Did you know, like many kids do, that
&quot;blunt&quot; is street slang for a hollowed-out cigar filled with marijuana?
Sometimes blunts contain marijuana mixed with cocaine, crack, PCP, methamphetamine,
even embalming fluid. How's that for a reality check? Learn how to have
a blunt talk with your kids about drugs. Call 1-800-729-6686 for a free
copy of &quot;Keeping Youth Drug Free.&quot;<BR>

<I>You can tailor the following Op-Ed with some examples and statistics
from your community and send this to your local newspaper.<BR>
<P><CENTER></I><B>Don't Let Our Kids' Dreams Go Up in Smoke</B></CENTER>
<P>In the 60's and 70's, `marijuana use was &quot;cool.&quot; In the 80's,
it was &quot;out.&quot; But now, suddenly, in the mid-90's, marijuana is
making a big comeback. And its popularity is growing.<BR>
	<BR>
Recent studies have alerted us to the disturbing fact that even elementary
school students are using marijuana. And usage rates among older students
-- ages 12 to 17 -- have almost doubled since the early 1990s. This could
be in part because of the new pop culture that glamorizes marijuana and
other drugs. Movies, television shows, music videos, song lyrics and clothing
insignia carry pro-marijuana messages.<BR>
	<BR>
Complicating this problem is the fact that the parents of many of these
kids who use marijuana today may have tried the drug themselves in the past
and are reluctant to talk to their children about this controversial subject.
<BR>
	<BR>
As a result, we have a generation of young people who think marijuana is
&quot;no big deal.&quot; But the truth is, a number of harms can result
from its use. For instance, it impairs young people's judgment, which can
lead to unprotected sex, pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases, including
HIV/AIDS. <BR>
	<BR>
It also contributes to accidents, violence and car crashes. The 1995 Drug
Abuse Warning Network report released last November shows that medical emergency
room episodes related to marijuana have increased 155 percent since 1990
-- from 15,700 to 40,100. <BR>
<BR>
Use of this drug also negatively affects kids' concentration and schoolwork.
And using, buying or selling can result in a school suspension or expulsion
and a police record.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, some current forms of marijuana are &quot;spiked&quot; with
other illicit drugs like cocaine, crack cocaine, PCP and even embalming
fluid, making an already dangerous drug even more dangerous.<BR>
	<BR>
This is why now, more than ever, it is crucial for parents to know the facts,
and to feel comfortable sharing these facts with their children.<BR>
	<BR>
Some things parents can do include the following: be a good role model;
make sure your children feel safe sharing their fears and thoughts about
alcohol and drugs with you; use the media's portrayal of alcohol and marijuana
to start a dialogue with your kids about these substances; and help your
kids resist peer pressure by listening to their concerns and validating
them.<BR>
	<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Parents Should Know</CENTER>
</H2>
Here are some of the common reasons why kids use marijuana and other drugs
and some things you can do to counteract these reasons. You can copy and
distribute this sheet to parents, teachers and other adults who work with
children to let them know some of the reason's kids use marijuana and how
to counteract some these reasons. You can also ask businesses to share this
information with employees and customers and you can post it at religious
centers, grocery stores and health care facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kids use marijuana to feel grown up.</B> <BR>
Children like to imitate adults. This imitation takes on many forms as they
grow, including wearing their parents' clothes, copying the way that they
speak, and imitating some of their behaviors. This is because they think
that being grown up is a very desirable thing. Grownups have the freedom
to say and do anything they want. They can also eat and drink anything they
want.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take: </I>Let your children grow
up. The harder you try to rein them in, the harder your children may rebel.
In most cases, when you let your children have increasing amounts of independence
when they prove they can handle it, they are less likely to turn to alcohol
and drugs. You can also be a good role model for your children, point out
examples of irresponsible drinking and drug use. Use these incidences as
a starting point for constructive dialogue around these issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to fit in and belong.</B> <BR>
Children want others to like them. Sometimes the group they want to join
is using alcohol or marijuana. They may feel that if they start using these
drugs themselves they will fit in with the others better and become more
popular and comfortable socially. Establishing a clear position with a child
that alcohol and drugs are bad is not always enough to counteract all this
pressure. Children must also have a range of judgment skills to help them
make good decisions.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take: </I>Help your child deal
with peer pressure. You can do this by sharing information on a variety
of topics with your child and helping to establish a strong relationship
early on so he or she has the skills to resist pressures from other youth
and the ability to chose not to hang out with kids who use drugs. You can
also help your child understand how to act appropriately in social situations
and teach him or her how to build solid relationships with non-drug using
friends. In addition, act as a mentor by providing support and encouragement
to your child and setting aside time to spend together.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to relax and feel good. <BR>
</B>There is a lot in the environment today that makes things difficult
for kids today. These things include increased violence and gangs, economic
pressures, HIV and AIDS, changing family structures and easy access to alcohol,
drugs and tobacco. These factors may contribute to the upswing in substance
abuse among young people. Some of them think that using drugs will help
them forget about their problems.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take: </I>Help reduce stress in
your child's life. Allow your child to express his or her feelings and concerns.
Let the child also know that you, too, experience pain, fear, anger and
nervousness and that these are normal feelings. Help him or her to express
these feelings, without having to resort to violence. You can also teach
your child some relaxation exercises like deep breathing or sitting quietly
for 10 to 20 minutes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to take risks and rebel. <BR>
</B>Children need to learn how to take risks. This is an important part
of growing up. There are all kinds of risks that people of all ages take
everyday -- and young people take even more than adults, because they want
to push the limits. This is because to grow, children must learn a lot of
new skills that adults often take for granted.  As greater levels of risks
are achieved, children continue to look for opportunities to expand their
horizons and grow. That's why drugs and alcohol hold such allure for young
people.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take:</I> Talk to your child about
risk-taking and what it means. You can tell you child about all different
kinds of risk-taking and the advantages and disadvantages associated with
each one. The fact is, kids and adults both have to acknowledge the consequences
of risk-taking. There are some children who NEED lots of sensation or thrills
in their lives. They like loud noises. They need a lot of stimulation to
keep their attention. They seem to thrive on chaos. These young people are
particularly at high risk for alcohol and drug problems. In addition, some
young people really want to rebel against society by engaging in anti-social
behavior. You can provide supportive parenting to counteract these tendencies.
If you are warm and accepting of your child, you are less likely to raise
children who use drugs, alcohol and tobacco.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Kids use marijuana to satisfy curiosity.</B> <BR>
Even if parents have done an outstanding job educating and nurturing children,
there are some children who will remain innately curious about alcohol and
other drugs. And they may seek information about those drugs from unreliable
sources.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The counteraction you can take:</I> Help your children get
the facts. Share information with your child about drugs and the consequences
of using them. You may also encourage your child do research on his or her
own. This may give the child additional ownership about the information
and prompt more learning as a result. The first bit of information you could
share is 1 (800) 729-6686. This is the phone number for the National Clearinghouse
for Alcohol and Drug Information. If your child has access to the Internet
or the World Wide Web, provide those addresses (Internet: telnet ncadi.health.org
or http://www.health.org). You can also show your child the devastating
effects of substance abuse -- take him or her to a local treatment center,
visit areas of your community plagued by substance abuse problems, or arrange
to visit the police station and talk to some of the officers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
You may wonder how <I>you</I> can make the case in your community
that providing treatment for nonviolent criminals with addictions
is essential to community safety<I>.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Here are some things you can do:<BR>
</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>Get local crime statistics from your police department. Ask
your police chief what role alcohol and drugs played in these
crimes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Find out what treatment options exist in your area. Talk to
local treatment providers and find out how many clients were incarcerated
before getting help. Ask providers about the nature of the violent
crimes clients committed. If most of the crimes were minor, this
will help make your case for providing treatment alternatives
to jail.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Read the police blotter in your community newspaper and see
if alcohol and/or drugs are mentioned in relationship to many
of the incidents. If not, talk to the editor and suggest that
the newspaper start including this information where it is pertinent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Monitor the front page of the community newspaper to see for
yourself how many crimes are related in some way to substance
abuse.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Find out how much it costs per year to incarcerate a prisoner
in your community, county or state. Compare this figure to the
price of an average stay in a local treatment facility and see
what the savings are.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Are there drug courts or diversionary treatment programs in
your community? If so, find out how successful they have been.
Does the capacity meet the need in your community? If not, make
the case for expanding treatment options. If no such programs
exist locally, talk to other communities in your state who have
successfully implemented such options and learn how they started.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Talk to local judges, prison officials, prosecutors, probation
supervisors and treatment providers about your findings. Brainstorm
ways you can work more closely with them to provide substance
abuse treatment for criminals. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Remember that many residents care about safety and cost. Therefore,
keep these key issues in mind when you make your case for providing
such treatment options.  
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Look at what options exist for juvenile offenders with substance
abuse problems in your community. Suggest alternatives that could
prevent kids from being incarcerated and at the same time, treat
their substance abuse problems and teach them new skills.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Convene a policy panel to examine local problems and make
recommendations on how your community can benefit by providing
treatment for criminals with addictions. (See &quot;How to Convene
a Local Policy Panel&quot; included in this Kit.)

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>SAMPLE PITCH LETTER<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I>You can tailor the following letter to interest an editor at
your local newspaper in doing an in-depth article or series examining
the link between substance abuse and crime and the need for treatment
in your community.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dear Editor:<BR>

<P>
Many people feel safe simply locking criminals up in prisons.
But, if you take a closer look at the criminal justice system,
you'll see there is a false security in the &quot;lock-em up&quot;
solution.  <BR>

<P>
Alcohol and drug addictions are at the root of many crimes, particularly
domestic violence and homicide. Yet, instead of taking the time
to treat these addictions when criminals are in jail, these problem
are all too often ignored by the criminal justice system. That
means when the addicted prisoners are released, they return back
to society to commit further crimes. This jeopardizes our safety
and the safety of our children. <BR>

<P>
Recently, General Barry McCaffrey, the nation's new drug czar,
recognized this serious gap in America's drug strategy by announcing
that part of his 10-year plan to reduce drugs includes expanding
drug treatment in prisons.<BR>

<P>
Most offenders with addictions commit nonviolent crimes. Therefore,
it is less expensive -- and more effective -- to treat the addiction
than to house that person in jail. The price tag for treatment
is also less than the price associated with crime. A national
study conducted by the RAND Corporation for the Office of National
Drug Control Policy tells us that every dollar spent on treatment
leads to a $7 reduction in crime-related spending and lost-productivity.
Other studies collaborate this finding. <BR>

<P>
In fact, a recent national policy panel convened by the Boston
University School of Public Health recommends that non-violent
offenders with substance abuse addictions should be diverted to
drug courts, treatment programs and supervision, instead of or
along with, jail. This panel also recommends that police, courts,
judges and probation officers work more closely with treatment
providers and citizens to reduce crime.<BR>

<P>
A full 60 percent of all prisoners in the United States are in
prison because of alcohol and drug-related offenses. This is up
25 percent from a decade earlier. If the prison population continues
to grow at the current rate, experts predict we will have more
people in jail than out by the year 2053.<BR>

<P>
I urge you to look at the link between substance abuse and crime
in our community. I can put you in touch with some local sources.
You can reach me at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER). I will call you next
week to follow up.<BR>

<P>
Sincerely,<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>SAMPLE OP-ED<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I>You can tailor the following Op-Ed with some examples and statistics
from your community and send this to your local newspaper.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B>WE <I>CAN</I> MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER<BR>
</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Many of the crimes committed on our streets today have their
roots in alcohol and drug addictions. Yet, too often we simply
lock the offenders away in jail and do not try to treat the problems
that led them there. <BR>

<P>
This oversight is really at our own expense. When we release
criminals with addictions back to our communities, they usually
pick up with a new crime spree and new prison sentences. This
means that our safety and our tax dollars are at their mercy.
<BR>

<P>
Consider that by the end of the 1980's, about one-third of people
in state prisons were there because of drug offenses -- and 60
to 70 percent had a history of substance abuse. Yet despite in
1991, only 13.5 percent of state prisoners were enrolled in drug
programs. This gap simply does not make sense, especially when
you consider that it costs <I>less</I> to provide treatment than
to keep an inmate in jail for a year. Outpatient drug treatment
averages about $3,000 to $10,000 per person, while housing an
inmate in jail for a year costs close to $30,000. And studies
confirm that jail alone <I>increases</I> the likelihood of further
crimes, while substance abuse treatment <I>decreases</I> it.<BR>

<P>
That's why some communities have started alternative programs,
such as drug courts, that make their streets safer and save taxpayers
money. They also give offenders a closely-supervised chance to
become responsible, law-abiding taxpayers. These programs include
diversionary drug courts that steer addicts who commit non-violent
crimes, such as larceny or drug dealing, to treatment instead
of jail; sentencing guidelines that set standards to ensure equity
for jail time based on the crime; and community partnership programs
that encourage police, courts, prosecutors, probation and parole
officers, treatment providers and citizens to work together to
create healthy and safe environments that benefit all of us.<BR>

<P>
When community groups and criminal justice agencies join together
to provide treatment for offenders, the rates of success is high.
For instance, a community policing program in one of the highest
crime areas in Kansas City, Missouri, has reduced crime by 13
percent, compared to a 6 percent reduction nationwide. And in
two Kansas City neighborhoods, crime is down 22 and 28 percent
after the police have gone a step further and established &quot;community
action networks.&quot; These centers are staffed by teams of community
police officers, code inspectors, and neighborhood volunteers.
In addition, the state of California found that illegal activity
dropped 43.3 percent after providing treatment.<BR>

<P>
Success stories like these across the country tell us that providing
treatment and creating community/ criminal justice partnerships
make sense to reduce crime and make our streets safer. To get
involved in supporting such efforts in our community, contact
(YOUR ORGANIZATION) at (PHONE NUMBER). <BR>

<P><B>PROVIDING ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT HELPS REDUCE THE RISK OF HIV-INFECTION</B>


<P>MILWAUKEE--&quot;I never thought it could happen to me,&quot; says 33-year- old Betty Johnson, an artist who found out last year that she is HIV-positive. (REPLACE WITH LOCAL EXAMPLE.)


<P>Until then, Johnson used to shoot up heroin with her friends, passing around a hypodermic needle that ultimately infected her with tainted blood.


<P>&quot;In those days, I never worried about AIDS. I was only thinking of my next high,&quot; Johnson admits.


<P>But today she is forced to worry about AIDS all the time.


<P>Like Johnson, about one million people in the United States are infected with the HIV virus, according to recent estimates by the Centers for Disease Control. This means that one person out of every 250 tests positive for the HIV antibodies that develop into six months after infection.


<P>And like Johnson, close to 35 percent of these men and women who are HIV-positive contracted the virus through intravenous drug use.


<P>&quot;I see cases like Johnson's all the time,&quot; says Dr. Paul Rubin, an infectious disease specialist at Milwaukee Hospital.  &quot;There are many people out there who injected drugs or got drunk and had unprotected sex and now they are paying for it dearly -- with their lives,&quot; he says.


<P>&quot;It is crucial that we stop this tragic disease in its tracks,&quot; stresses Rubin. &quot;While we don't have a cure yet for people who have the virus, we can work to prevent others from catching it,&quot; he says.


<P>Rubin points that one way to do this is to provide substance abuse treatment for all who need it.


<P>&quot;If we can educate people about how to have protected sex and help those with alcohol and drug problems to overcome their addictions, they would not put themselves at such high risk for HIV,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;That's why we must make sure that an adequate substance abuse benefit is included in any new health plan that is passed.&quot;

<H3>HIV-Infection and Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>FACTS ABOUT HIV</H2></center>


<P><H3>The fact is. . .</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>--There are approximately one million people infected with HIV in the United States, according to the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">Center for Disease Control</A>. This is one in every 250 people.


<P>--In 1992, close to 35 percent of all AIDS cases reported to the CDC were associated with drug injection. In addition, more than 80 percent of all HIV-positive women inject drugs or have sexual partners who do.


<P>--And about two million heterosexual men and women put themselves at risk for getting infected with HIV through intravenous drug use and engaging in risky (i.e. unprotected) sexual behavior, the CDC reports.


<P>--The reason people who inject drugs and share drug-injecting equipment are at high-risk for becoming infected is because needles and syringes often transfer HIV-infected blood among drug users.


<P>--Some drug users also put themselves at risk for HIV by trading sex for cocaine and other non-injected drugs. In doing so, they have multiple sex partners and do not use protection.


<P>--Alcohol and drug use often results in impaired judgment. This may lead people to engage in unprotected sex, and this puts them at risk for HIV infection.


<P>--Studies done by the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A> in New York City and Miami found that young crack users who had never injected drugs or had male homosexual intercourse were still at high-risk for HIV infection -- particularly the females. In fact, 32 percent of crack-using women got HIV in NYC and 45 percent in Miami, compared with 11 percent of crack-using males in both places.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B>TREATMENT WORKS IN REDUCING THE RISK OF HIV INFECTION</B>.


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>--Treating people with drug and alcohol addictions can help reduce their risk of getting infected with HIV - both by stopping them from catching the disease through the use of needles and syringes and by preventing them from engaging in risky sexual behavior.


<P>--In the state of Maryland, it costs $120,000 to treat one AIDS patient. Compare this with the cost of a pilot needle exchange program soon-to-open in Baltimore, which on a budget of $160,000 will serve up to 1,000 addicts -- providing them with clean needles to prevent the spread of HIV and helping to steer them into treatment.


<P>There are 361,509 adults in the United States who have been diagnosed with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), according to a report soon-to-be-released by the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">Center for Disease Control</A> (<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A>).


<P>Out of these adults, 86,961 of them contracted the HIV virus through intravenous drug use, the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A> reports. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> <CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE<BR> </FONT></B></CENTER> <P> There are a number of ways communities -- and states -- across the nation are tackling crime and substance abuse. Things like implementing fair sentencing guidelines, providing drug courts that divert offenders to treatment, and creating community partnerships are proving successful. These approaches save taxpayers money and make our neighborhoods safer while giving offenders with addictions the help they need. <P> Here are a few examples of what works:<BR>

<P> <U><B>Drug Courts</B></U> <P> <B>Rochester:</B> A drug court steers non-violent offenders into treatment in Rochester, NY. This drug court employs treatment providers and case managers to link program participants with community services. In less than a year, this program has proved effective -- of 172 participants, only 12 have been rearrested. Funds for the program come from local foundations and the Monroe County Bar Association. For more information, contact: Nadine Spinell at (716) 428-2736.<BR>

<P> <B>Little Rock: </B>Treatment is far less expensive than jail in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Substance Abuse Treatment Education Program, known as STEP, allows offenders to opt for a suspended sentence and referral to social services and treatment -- which costs $3,000 a person -- instead of a stay in jail, which averages $30,000 a year.  To qualify, offenders must commit to completing the whole program. Upon graduating, their criminal record is erased. Those who fail to complete the program are sent back to court to be sentenced for their crimes. So far 40 clients have successfully graduated from STEP in 15 months and there has been no recidivism. For more information, contact: Terrel Rose, STEP project director, at (501) 374-7837. <BR>

<P> <U><B>Sentencing Guidelines<BR> </B></U> <P> Fair sentencing guidelines have helped Delaware keep the prison population in check. These guidelines establish five levels of accountability for people who have committed crimes -- ranging from unsupervised probation to prison. Since the guidelines were adopted in 1987, the number of people sent to jail for nonviolent offenses has dropped by 50 percent. In addition, in 1986 the prison population was growing at a rate of 11 percent, yet in 1990 it dropped to a 2.3 percent decline.  For more information, contact: Judge Myron Steele at the Court of Chancery at (302) 739-4397. <BR>

<P> <U><B>Community Partnerships</B></U> <P> Community partnerships are the weapon to fighting crime in Brooklyn, New York, and Portland, Oregon. In Brooklyn, the Kings County District Attorney divides the 23 police precincts into five zones. Prosecutors in each zone work closely with police officers and community organizations to improve law enforcement and prosecution. For more information, call the Brooklyn D.A.'s office at (718) 802-2000. In Portland, the Multnomah County District Attorney's office brings together local prosecutors and neighborhood safety committees to keep the community safe with activities like drug-free school and housing zones and a program that requires nonviolent criminals to serve their probation by performing community service. For more information, call the Multnomah County D.A.'s office at (503) 248-3162.<BR>

<hr>
<P><B>ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT IS CRUCIAL TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF HIV</B>


<P>In the waiting room of the HIV clinic at Milwaukee Hospital, clients come from a wide range of backgrounds.


<P>But they are all hoping for the same thing -- to be told that they are not infected with HIV.


<P>Unfortunately, about one in every 250 men and women will not be so lucky.


<P>Today, close to one million men and women in the United States have HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS.  And about two million people put themselves at risk for contracting the virus every day. No longer considered the disease of only homosexual men, today the possibility of AIDS affects everybody.


<P>Researchers now know that injecting drugs and engaging in unprotected sex are two of the leading culprits that put people at risk for HIV.  This is because injecting drug users often share the same needle with other people and if there is any infected blood in the needle, it is easily passed between addicts. Close to 35 percent of people with HIV inject intravenous drugs, according to the Centers for Disease Control.


<P>But not all addicts who are HIV-positive inject drugs. Some people while drunk or high, may take more chances when they have sex and are less likely to use condoms. Recent studies by the CDC in New York and Miami found that young crack users who had never injected drugs or had male homosexual encounters were still at very high risk for HIV. And women were particularly vulnerable to the virus. This is because studies have shown that the virus is more easily transmitted from man to woman than from woman to man. Of those crack addicts surveyed, 32 percent of the women in New York tested positive for HIV and 45 percent of the women in Miami, compared with 11 percent of the men in both cities.


<P>Those who have already contracted HIV can only hope for a miracle. But for people with alcohol and drug problems who continue to engage in risky behaviors and thus far have managed to allude the virus, there is still time for them to seek treatment.


<P>That's why as the nation undergoes health reform, it is crucial that we ensure an adequate substance abuse benefit is available to all who need it. Somebody's life might be counting on it. You can get the message out about the link between substance abuse and HIV and the need to provide addicts with access to treatment.

<H2><CENTER>Sample Op-Ed</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following Sample Op-Ed to fit your community and then
ask your Editorial Page Editor at your local  newspaper to run it.<BR>
</I><HR><BR>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and crack
cocaine. But some of the most lethal drugs are simpler and easier to obtain.
<BR>
<BR>
We can find them in the drawers of our desks, stashed in our cabinets, and
lined up on our grocery store shelves. Things like paint, magic markers,
white out, lighter fluid, hair sprays, vegetable cooking sprays and air
fresheners. Things that are cheap and easy to obtain, and at the same time,
when inhaled can prove fatal.<BR>
<BR>
These and close to 1,000 other everyday household products are being abused
by our kids to get a quick high. They inhale them through their nose (sniffing)
or mouth (huffing). Most kids who try these products think they are harmless.
They do not know the facts.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that hundreds of children each year die from inhalant use--sometimes
on their first try. Nonetheless, many parents and educators remain ignorant
of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has tried inhalants by
the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; That is because these products are
easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and give a pleasurable affect
by depressing the central nervous system. <BR>
<BR>
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<BR>
<BR>
People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis and do not die put themselves
at risk for permanent and severe brain damage. Inhalant vapors react with
fatty tissues in the brain, literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic
inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks
like walking, talking and thinking. <BR>
<BR>
That's why we must warn our kids about the dangers of inhalants, and make
sure that they know enough not to try them.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the symptoms of inhalant abuse include red or runny eyes and/or
nose; spots and/or sores around the mouth; unusual breath odor; drunk, dazed
or dizzy appearance; correction fluid on fingernails; sitting with a pen
or marker near the nose; constantly smelling shirt sleeves; nausea and/or
loss of appetite; and paint or stain marks on clothing or on skin.<BR>
<BR>
If you suspect your child or someone else you know is using inhalants, please
call (NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF EITHER YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LOCAL INHALANT
ABUSE RESOURCE) for help.<BR>

</H2>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and cocaine.
But today, the new drugs of choice for some kids are common -- but often
deadly -- household substances such as white out, glue and paint. This Hot
Issue Action Kit focuses on this rising problem. We suggest you use this
material to raise public awareness in March, which is National Inhalant
Awareness Month. We especially encourage you to reach out to youth who have
dropped out of school and may not be aware of the dangers associated with
inhalants.<BR>
<BR>
To get this message out to the public and key groups in your community,
we have provided you with the following:
<UL>
<LI>An <A HREF="overview.html">Overview </A> outlining Inhalants and how
they are commonly abused;<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Are Inhalants?</CENTER>
</H2>
Today, more than 1,000 legal and useful household, school and office products
are being used--primarily by youth--to get high. This practice is commonly
known as inhalant abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Inhalants are divided into the following four categories: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Volatile gases and solvents -- lighter fluid, barbecue grill gas, spray
paint, paint thinner and glue. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Aerosols -- hair spray, deodorants and other pressurized products that
are used more for the propellant capability than for the contents inside
the can. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nitrates -- Butyl nitrites, which are often known by the trade names
of Rush, Locker Room, Bolt and Climax and are used as room odorizers; and
amyl nitrates, which are packaged in capsules known as poppers and snappers
and were originally created for heart patients. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Anesthetic gases -- Nitrous oxide, which is known as the dentists laughing
gas is also available in small cylinders called whippets, which propel whipped
cream in commercial machines. 
</UL>
<B>These substances are abused in the following ways: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Sniffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the nose. A youngster
may sniff a container of white out, glue, paint thinner or gasoline to inhale
the fumes through the nostrils. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Huffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the mouth. A student
can spray paint on a handkerchief and hold it over his or her mouth and
breath in the fumes. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Bagging -- Inhaling the vapors through a bag. A youth can spray fumes
on a cloth or piece of clothing, then insert it into a plastic or paper
bag to increase the concentration of the vapors. Then he or she puts the
bag opening over the mouth or nose and breathes in. Some users may also
place their heads directly inside the bag.

<H2><CENTER>Warning Signs of Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
You may want to send the following list to your local newspaper and ask
the editor to run this to educate readers about the signs of inhalant abuse.

teachers and youth in your community, and post it in local schools, grocery
stores, churches and recreation centers. <BR>
<BR>
It is important for parents, teachers and young people to know some of the
signs of inhalant abuse, so they can recognize when someone is using household
products to get high. Some effects of inhalants are short-term, and they
vary greatly from product to product.<BR>
 <BR>
Some of the following symptoms listed below, provided by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, are warning signs that someone may be using inhalants: 
<UL>
<LI>Red, runny eyes or nose 
<LI>Sores around the mouth 
<LI>Chemical breath 
<LI>Drunk, dazed appearance 
<LI>Nausea 
<LI>Loss of appetite 
<LI>Anxiety or irritability 
<LI>Paint or stains on the body or clothing 
<LI>Chronic inhalant abusers are also anxious, easily excited, irritable
and restless. 
<LI>Inhalant withdrawal symptoms include hand tremors, headaches, nervousness
and sweating.

<H2><CENTER>What You Can Do About Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
Inhalant abuse is a widespread--and serious--problem among youth today.
In fact, as many as one in five students abuses regular household substances--such
as glue, hair spray, lighter fluid and paint thinner--to get high. And unlike
alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, these products are easy for kids to obtain
and do not make adults suspicious if they see a child using them.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, these products can lead to a number of serious side affects
for users, including sudden death. And the problem is not getting better.
The rate of inhalant users continues to rise in states across the country,
prompting some schools to educate kids and parents about the dangers. But
unfortunately, many young inhalant users have dropped out of school or do
not attend classes. Therefore, these young people do not know the possible
consequences of their behavior. That's why it is crucial that we find ways
to warn them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Here are some steps you can take:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Involve a wide variety of local groups in your public education efforts.
You may want to include doctors, nurses, pharmacists, politicians, school
drug-education coordinators, law enforcement officers, teachers, youth,
parents, business owners, media representatives and clergy. Brainstorm together
ways to reach high-risk youth in your community. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Put up posters warning about the dangers of inhalant abuse in places
young people frequent, such as recreation centers, record stores, fast food
restaurants, pizza places, ice cream parlors, candy stores, movie theaters
and supermarkets. Be sure to list resources people can turn to for help.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local radio stations that play music that appeals to youth to run
public service announcements about inhalant abuse and the associated risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local movie theaters to run a public service announcement about
inhalant abuse before each movie. See if a local corporation or business
that caters to youth will donate the money to produce the PSA. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local newspaper to run a full-page advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse to warn parents and young people about the risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>See if your local cable station will run an advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse. Ask local students to write, direct, produce
and act in the ad. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local grocery stores to stuff fact sheets about inhalant abuse--and
how to get help--in customers bags. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local businesses--such as the gas or phone company--to include bill
stuffers about the dangers of inhalant abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask manufacturers of products that youth inhale to work with you to
find ways to reduce this abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Plan ahead for &quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week,&quot;
which is sponsored by the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition/Texas Prevention
Partnership and is held the third week in March. Ask your mayor or city
council to sign a proclamation recognizing this week in your city or town
and plan some events to call attention to this serious problem. (For more
information about this week, see <A HREF="others.html">What Others Have
Done</A>.) <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Call the photo editor at your local newspaper and offer to set up a
photograph of some of the products that can be misused as inhalants. This
can help to alert parents that some &quot;innocent-looking&quot; household
products can actually be deadly.

<LI>Many innocent-looking substances stored in household cabinets, closets
and garages may actually be fatal. That's because young people abuse these
products to get high. That's the message from the National Inhalant Prevention
Coalition/Texas Prevention Partnership. They sponsor a week-long annual
campaign called, <I>&quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week:
They're Right Under Your Nose.&quot;</I> The goal of the campaign is to
alert communities to the danger of everyday products being inhaled or misused.
The campaign began in response to a 1992 Texas school survey that showed
one in four students have tried inhalants by the time they reach the seventh
grade. This national campaign relies on local groups to get the message
out in their communities. To do so, artwork, news releases and advertisements
are provided and can be tailored for individual schools, prevention coalitions,
cities and towns. In addition, videos and posters are available for a small
fee. In 1995, over 1,000 partners from almost every state joined the campaign.<B>
For more information, contact Harvey Weiss at (800) 269-4237.</B><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Illinois residents are getting a crash course in the dangers of inhalant
abuse, thanks to a statewide educational campaign there launched by the
lieutenant governor's office. The ongoing campaign, which began in 1994
and follows Texas' example, was sparked in response to survey findings that
inhalants are the fastest growing category of drug use in that state. In
fact, one in 10 Illinois teenagers abuses household projects to get high.
The statewide campaign, called &quot;Danger: Right Under Your Nose,&quot;
provides materials, tools and suggestions that communities can use to localize
the message. There is also an 800 number people can call for more information
about inhalants. The campaign has been very successful to date, raising
awareness about the problem and risks of inhalant abuse throughout the state.

<H2><CENTER>Letter to the Editor</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following letter--or use it as is--and send it to
the editor of your local newspaper</I>.<BR>
<HR>Dear Editor:<BR>
<BR>
White out. Glue. Nail polish remover. Lighter fluid. Paint. What do these
various household products all have in common? They all tragically kill
kids.<BR>
<BR>
Today, many young people in our community abuse such products that are readily
available in our medicine chests and on the shelves in our stores. They
inhale these and a host of other substances through the nose and/or mouth
to get a quick high.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, these kids are not aware of the high risks that come along
with this behavior. The fact is that each year hundreds of children die
from inhalant use--sometimes on their first try--yet many parents and educators
remain ignorant of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has sniffed or &quot;huffed&quot;
(inhaled through the mouth) such products as magic markers, gasoline and
air fresheners by the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; These products are easily available,
free or inexpensive, legal and may give a pleasurable affect by depressing
the central nervous system.<BR>
<BR>
And those kids who do not die from inhalants still put themselves at a risk
for a number of other serious side affects, including permanent and severe
brain damage. Chronic inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability
to perform everyday tasks like walking, talking and thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Please help to get the message out to parents and to kids that inhalants
are dangerous. If you suspect someone you know may be using inhalants, consult
a school counselor or a drug counseling center for help.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Sample Op-Ed</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following Sample Op-Ed to fit your community and then
ask your Editorial Page Editor at your local  newspaper to run it.<BR>
</I><HR><BR>
When we think of drugs, most of us think of marijuana, heroine and crack
cocaine. But some of the most lethal drugs are simpler and easier to obtain.
<BR>
<BR>
We can find them in the drawers of our desks, stashed in our cabinets, and
lined up on our grocery store shelves. Things like paint, magic markers,
white out, lighter fluid, hair sprays, vegetable cooking sprays and air
fresheners. Things that are cheap and easy to obtain, and at the same time,
when inhaled can prove fatal.<BR>
<BR>
These and close to 1,000 other everyday household products are being abused
by our kids to get a quick high. They inhale them through their nose (sniffing)
or mouth (huffing). Most kids who try these products think they are harmless.
They do not know the facts.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that hundreds of children each year die from inhalant use--sometimes
on their first try. Nonetheless, many parents and educators remain ignorant
of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has tried inhalants by
the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; That is because these products are
easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and give a pleasurable affect
by depressing the central nervous system. <BR>
<BR>
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<BR>
<BR>
People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis and do not die put themselves
at risk for permanent and severe brain damage. Inhalant vapors react with
fatty tissues in the brain, literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic
inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks
like walking, talking and thinking. <BR>
<BR>
That's why we must warn our kids about the dangers of inhalants, and make
sure that they know enough not to try them.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the symptoms of inhalant abuse include red or runny eyes and/or
nose; spots and/or sores around the mouth; unusual breath odor; drunk, dazed
or dizzy appearance; correction fluid on fingernails; sitting with a pen
or marker near the nose; constantly smelling shirt sleeves; nausea and/or
loss of appetite; and paint or stain marks on clothing or on skin.<BR>
<BR>
If you suspect your child or someone else you know is using inhalants, please
call (NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF EITHER YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LOCAL INHALANT
ABUSE RESOURCE) for help.<BR>

</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Below are stories from some of the <A HREF="comex.html">Community Exchanges</A> sponsored by Join
Together:<BR>
<B> <BR>
Community Prevention Network of Western New York <BR>
Amherst, New York</B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B>  Fewer minors will be served alcohol in Amherst, N.Y.,
thanks to a new partnership between police and alcohol servers in that suburb
to keep youth from using fake identification. This collaboration resulted
from the Join Together Community Exchange, which spurred involvement of
religious, business and criminal justice representatives in communitywide
substance abuse efforts. The Exchange also brought Amherst and the nearby
city of Buffalo together to host a one-day joint event to raise public awareness
about drug abuse. Called &quot;Take A Stand Against Drugs,&quot; the event
brought families from both municipalities out onto street corners to express
their support for anti-drug efforts.
</blockquote>
<B>Rural Neighbors in Partnership <BR>
Tallahassee, Florida </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact</B>: Kids in Tallahassee will get a healthier start to life,
thanks to a $10,000 grant from the state of Florida to start a church-based
health program for residents there. This grant was just one outcome of the
Join Together Community Exchange. In addition, the youth committee of the
Center for Substance Abuse Partnership found a home through the 4-H Club.
This merger will provide the club with permanency and leadership development
opportunities for its members.
</blockquote>
<B>Community Partnership Program in Arecibo <BR>
Arecibo, Puerto Rico </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact</B>:  The Join Together Community Exchange in Arecibo planted
valuable new roots in that Puerto Rican community. First, the Exchange brought
business leaders in Camuy and Barcelonita; together to form a coalition.
Second, it established new alliances among the Governor's Public Safety
Office, Partnership with Drug-Free America, the National Guard and others
that led to three new federal grants to sustain their efforts. Third, it
sparked a regional collaborative strategic plan with close to 300 participants
to address substance abuse. And finally, it helped the Arecibo Community
Partnership Program expand into three other neighboring communities to strengthen
its efforts.
</blockquote>

<B>Alliance for Substance Education - BASE <BR>
Belleville, New Jersey Belleville </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B>  Anti-substance abuse efforts are making headlines in Belleville,
N.J., a small town outside of New York City. The editor of the local paper
there has committed to run a weekly column on the Belleville Alliance for
Substance Education's activities. This was one of many positive outcomes
of the Join Together Community Exchange, which served to revitalize residents
by recognizing them for their outstanding efforts. The Exchange also raised
awareness about alcohol and drug problems -- and solutions -- among all
sectors of the community, including students, parents, religious leaders,
businesses and health care workers. In addition, minors will have a tougher
time getting alcohol, as the result of a local ordinance established by
elected officials. And youth may have a new place to hang out, because the
town is considering turning a public building into a youth center on weekends.
</blockquote>
<B>Regional Office of Education &amp; Junior League of Kankakee County <BR>
Kankakee, Illinois </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B> Drug offenders in Kankakee can now choose treatment instead
of jail, thanks to a new drug court there. This program is the result of
linkages between the criminal justice system and the community that were
strengthened during the Join Together Community Exchange. Another outcome
is the involvement -- for the first time ever-- of the inter-faith community
in substance abuse issues. This collaboration has led to the creation a
new task force to find strategies to racial/cross-cultural tensions in the
community.
</blockquote>
<B>Safe Streets Coalition <BR>
Tacoma, Washington </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B>  Workers in Tacoma, Wash., may need to take less sick days
as a result of a new focus on wellness among small businesses there. The
Join Together Exchange sparked the development of a task force on youth
and workplace health. The Exchange also led to the creation of a union-based
alliance with the County Labor Council, the Chamber of Commerce; 80 small
businesses, large companies and labor unions. Members have started a workplace
food collection drive and are developing a resource guide to substance abuse
in the workplace.

<H2><CENTER>Community Exchange In Action</CENTER>
</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Below are stories from some of the <A HREF="comex.html">Community Exchanges</A> sponsored by Join
Together:<BR>
<B> <BR>
Community Prevention Network of Western New York <BR>
Amherst, New York</B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B>  Fewer minors will be served alcohol in Amherst, N.Y.,
thanks to a new partnership between police and alcohol servers in that suburb
to keep youth from using fake identification. This collaboration resulted
from the Join Together Community Exchange, which spurred involvement of
religious, business and criminal justice representatives in communitywide
substance abuse efforts. The Exchange also brought Amherst and the nearby
city of Buffalo together to host a one-day joint event to raise public awareness
about drug abuse. Called &quot;Take A Stand Against Drugs,&quot; the event
brought families from both municipalities out onto street corners to express
their support for anti-drug efforts.
</blockquote>
<B>Rural Neighbors in Partnership <BR>
Tallahassee, Florida </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact</B>: Kids in Tallahassee will get a healthier start to life,
thanks to a $10,000 grant from the state of Florida to start a church-based
health program for residents there. This grant was just one outcome of the
Join Together Community Exchange. In addition, the youth committee of the
Center for Substance Abuse Partnership found a home through the 4-H Club.
This merger will provide the club with permanency and leadership development
opportunities for its members.
</blockquote>
<B>Community Partnership Program in Arecibo <BR>
Arecibo, Puerto Rico </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact</B>:  The Join Together Community Exchange in Arecibo planted
valuable new roots in that Puerto Rican community. First, the Exchange brought
business leaders in Camuy and Barcelonita; together to form a coalition.
Second, it established new alliances among the Governor's Public Safety
Office, Partnership with Drug-Free America, the National Guard and others
that led to three new federal grants to sustain their efforts. Third, it
sparked a regional collaborative strategic plan with close to 300 participants
to address substance abuse. And finally, it helped the Arecibo Community
Partnership Program expand into three other neighboring communities to strengthen
its efforts.
</blockquote>

<B>Alliance for Substance Education - BASE <BR>
Belleville, New Jersey Belleville </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B>  Anti-substance abuse efforts are making headlines in Belleville,
N.J., a small town outside of New York City. The editor of the local paper
there has committed to run a weekly column on the Belleville Alliance for
Substance Education's activities. This was one of many positive outcomes
of the Join Together Community Exchange, which served to revitalize residents
by recognizing them for their outstanding efforts. The Exchange also raised
awareness about alcohol and drug problems -- and solutions -- among all
sectors of the community, including students, parents, religious leaders,
businesses and health care workers. In addition, minors will have a tougher
time getting alcohol, as the result of a local ordinance established by
elected officials. And youth may have a new place to hang out, because the
town is considering turning a public building into a youth center on weekends.
</blockquote>
<B>Regional Office of Education &amp; Junior League of Kankakee County <BR>
Kankakee, Illinois </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B> Drug offenders in Kankakee can now choose treatment instead
of jail, thanks to a new drug court there. This program is the result of
linkages between the criminal justice system and the community that were
strengthened during the Join Together Community Exchange. Another outcome
is the involvement -- for the first time ever-- of the inter-faith community
in substance abuse issues. This collaboration has led to the creation a
new task force to find strategies to racial/cross-cultural tensions in the
community.
</blockquote>
<B>Safe Streets Coalition <BR>
Tacoma, Washington </B>
<blockquote><B>Impact:</B>  Workers in Tacoma, Wash., may need to take less sick days
as a result of a new focus on wellness among small businesses there. The
Join Together Exchange sparked the development of a task force on youth
and workplace health. The Exchange also led to the creation of a union-based
alliance with the County Labor Council, the Chamber of Commerce; 80 small
businesses, large companies and labor unions. Members have started a workplace
food collection drive and are developing a resource guide to substance abuse
in the workplace.

<H2><CENTER>How to Get the Message Out Locally</CENTER>
</H2>
The Reality Check campaign can serve as a valuable resource to you and to
your community. The campaign theme is:  <BR>
<H4><CENTER>Marijuana Is a Drug. Help Our Kids Understand. </CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
You can take this message and localize it with your community name and/or
other specifics. (For instance, Help Milwuakee's Kids Understand.) You can
also tailor the message and scope of your campaign in other ways, depending
on the specific resources -- and needs -- of your particular region. For
instance, if marijuana is at the root of a problem of kids skipping school
and vandalizing public property, you may want to work closely with school
personnel and law enforcement in your city or town. Or there may a lack
of drug education on the local level. Then you could consider working with
the PTA (which is already a partner in this campaign) and school personnel
in your area to get materials and messages out to local youth. If there
are stores in your area that sell pro-marijuana paraphernalia and promote
pro-use messages to youth, you might approach some of the merchants and
provide them with new pro-health slogans and novelty items such as T-shirts
and key chains to help change community norms.  And working with the media
is vital, whatever your community issues and concerns.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some things to remember:<BR>
</B>
<UL>
<LI>Involve students in your planning. They can be a good audience to test
your messages on and to advise you on what will have the most impact locally,
as well as how best to reach both kids at risk for marijuana use and their
parents.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Be sensitive to cultural issues and economic differences that exist
in your community.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Partner with other organizations to extend the reach of your campaign.
You can volunteer your time, skills and materials to other groups and ask
them to share their resources with you.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Get your message out in a number of ways. Target traditional media outlets
(your daily and weekly newspapers and television stations), as well as more
alternative places (church bulletins and newspapers, talk radio stations,
cable and specialty publications).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Be sure to include a broad range of groups in your efforts. Invite participation
from schools, parents, volunteer groups, the faith community, health care
providers, law enforcement, prevention and treatment organizations, maternal
and child health services, legal and social services, organizations serving
low-income families, labor unions, neighborhood-based social clubs, and
American Legion Posts and/or other veteran organizations.
</UL>
Joining together with other groups is now easier than ever. CSAP has established
the National Coalition to Prevent Marijuana Use. For more information, contact
the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at (800) 729-6686.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Letter to the Editor</CENTER>
</H2>
<I>You can tailor the following letter--or use it as is--and send it to
the editor of your local newspaper</I>.<BR>
<HR>Dear Editor:<BR>
<BR>
White out. Glue. Nail polish remover. Lighter fluid. Paint. What do these
various household products all have in common? They all tragically kill
kids.<BR>
<BR>
Today, many young people in our community abuse such products that are readily
available in our medicine chests and on the shelves in our stores. They
inhale these and a host of other substances through the nose and/or mouth
to get a quick high.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, these kids are not aware of the high risks that come along
with this behavior. The fact is that each year hundreds of children die
from inhalant use--sometimes on their first try--yet many parents and educators
remain ignorant of this &quot;silent epidemic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inhalants are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds
in the United States, coming in right behind alcohol and tobacco. And as
many as one in five students in the United States has sniffed or &quot;huffed&quot;
(inhaled through the mouth) such products as magic markers, gasoline and
air fresheners by the time they reach the seventh grade.<BR>
<BR>
Yet while many kids admit to sniffing toxic items, they do not consider
this to be &quot;inhalant abuse.&quot; These products are easily available,
free or inexpensive, legal and may give a pleasurable affect by depressing
the central nervous system.<BR>
<BR>
And those kids who do not die from inhalants still put themselves at a risk
for a number of other serious side affects, including permanent and severe
brain damage. Chronic inhalant abusers may permanently lose the ability
to perform everyday tasks like walking, talking and thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Please help to get the message out to parents and to kids that inhalants
are dangerous. If you suspect someone you know may be using inhalants, consult
a school counselor or a drug counseling center for help.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Others Have Done</CENTER>
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Many innocent-looking substances stored in household cabinets, closets
and garages may actually be fatal. That's because young people abuse these
products to get high. That's the message from the National Inhalant Prevention
Coalition/Texas Prevention Partnership. They sponsor a week-long annual
campaign called, <I>&quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week:
They're Right Under Your Nose.&quot;</I> The goal of the campaign is to
alert communities to the danger of everyday products being inhaled or misused.
The campaign began in response to a 1992 Texas school survey that showed
one in four students have tried inhalants by the time they reach the seventh
grade. This national campaign relies on local groups to get the message
out in their communities. To do so, artwork, news releases and advertisements
are provided and can be tailored for individual schools, prevention coalitions,
cities and towns. In addition, videos and posters are available for a small
fee. In 1995, over 1,000 partners from almost every state joined the campaign.<B>
For more information, contact Harvey Weiss at (800) 269-4237.</B><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Illinois residents are getting a crash course in the dangers of inhalant
abuse, thanks to a statewide educational campaign there launched by the
lieutenant governor's office. The ongoing campaign, which began in 1994
and follows Texas' example, was sparked in response to survey findings that
inhalants are the fastest growing category of drug use in that state. In
fact, one in 10 Illinois teenagers abuses household projects to get high.
The statewide campaign, called &quot;Danger: Right Under Your Nose,&quot;
provides materials, tools and suggestions that communities can use to localize
the message. There is also an 800 number people can call for more information
about inhalants. The campaign has been very successful to date, raising
awareness about the problem and risks of inhalant abuse throughout the state.
<B>For more information about the campaign, call Debra Palandech at (312)
814-5220.<BR>

<H3>Binge Drinking on Campus</H3>
<H2>SAMPLE OP-ED</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR>
Tailor the following Op-Ed with some local statistics and send it to your
college or local newspaper. <HR><BR>
<H3>COLLEGE DRINKING LEADS TO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS </H3>
<BR>
Some college traditions are ageless: Eating pizza at midnight. Pulling all-nighters
before a big test. But recent national reports about other &quot;traditions&quot;
- guzzling cold beers with friends or getting so drunk you can barely find
your dorm room - are being seriously examined for the long-term damage they
cause to drinkers and non-drinkers alike. <BR>
<BR>
Excessive drinking remains a major problem on college campuses nationwide.
Despite increased public awareness about the strong relationship between
substance abuse and other social problems like fatal car crashes, increased
risk of HIV infection and date rape to students continue to binge drink.
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, today nearly half of all college students drink at least four or
five drinks at one time, according to the results of a recent study on binge
drinking published by Henry Wechsler in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. <BR>
<BR>
While many students do not see the harm in having &quot;a few&quot; beers,
the truth is that risks of excessive alcohol consumption involve more just
a hangover the next day. Studies show that alcohol is a factor in 66 percent
of student suicides and 60 percent of all sexually-transmitted diseases,
including HIV. In addition, one out of four student deaths is related to
alcohol use. <BR>
<BR>
Many students who drink heavily have problems keeping up with their school
work and often skip class. Studies show that 41 percent of all academic
problems stem from alcohol abuse and 28 percent of the students who drop
out of school may do so because of alcohol. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, students who do not drink are affected by their classmates
who do. Students at schools with high levels of binge drinking are three
times more likely to be pushed, hit or sexually assaulted by drunk peers
than are students at schools with less drinking. Are we graduating many
young people who are compromising their health and effectiveness in the
prime of their lives? <BR>
<BR>
But college students do not have to remain the victims of beer manufacturers,
who spend about $15 to $20 million each year to get them to drink, despite
the fact that drinking alcohol is illegal for anyone under 21. <BR>
<BR>
At campuses across the country, there is a growing movement of students
who are taking charge &oacute; by deciding to stay sober. Many colleges
and universities have responded by implementing strong alcohol policies
to keep drinking to a minimum. Some have also designated alcohol-free dorms
and made alcohol-free social events a high priority. <BR>
<BR>
While this is a good start, it is also crucial that college administrators
work with local communities to come up with solid solutions such as alcohol
beverage server training and enforcing underage drinking laws to keep students
safe and healthy. If college officials, police, businesses, the media and
students all work together to deglamorize college drinking and provide alternative
activities, we can make each school year safer than the one before. <BR>

<BR><BR>
<H2>1. Compel substance abuse treatment<BR>
for criminal offenders.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Treatment of substance abuse must be an integral part of the criminal justice
system. Every substance abuser who passes through the system must be compelled
to undergo programs of treatment and rehabilitation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
The criminal justice system can take substance abusers off the streets,
but it cannot keep them off the streets. Under our current system of probation
and parole, drug and alcohol abusers who commit crimes and serve their time
will be let out of jail, usually to return to the very communities in which
they were arrested. And when they return, many will still be users, because
the system does very little to treat the addiction that often led them to
commit the crime in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
If we are to stop the revolving door of incarceration and release and incarceration
once again, the criminal justice system must serve to break the cycle of
substance abuse, not merely to interrupt it. Its objective should be not
simply to punish offenders, but also to use their arrest and incarceration
in a way that maximizes the benefits that can be gained for the community.
To achieve this, the system must recognize and respond to the fact that
addiction is a chronic condition that jailing, alone, will not cure.<BR>
<BR>
Science has come to understand that addiction is a disease of the brain
that weakens the addict's self-control and rationality. Alcohol and drugs
alter the user's brain chemistry in ways that can take years to reverse.
In this sense, addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. Many people mistakenly
believe that the enforced abstinence that results from incarceration will
cure addiction. But this is simply not so. Even after a lengthy abstinence,
the addict can still crave the pleasure of the drug, and the craving can
become even more intense when the addict returns to the community, where
there are many strong reminders of that earlier life. Besides, incarceration
does not equal abstinence; it is a sad fact that prisons and jails are not
drug-free.<BR>
<BR>
But for that window of time that the criminal justice system has the offender
in its grips, it has an unparalleled opportunity to do something about the
addiction. The system should compel offenders who have substance abuse problems
to undergo a program of treatment and rehabilitation. For offenders sentenced
to prison, treatment should be made part of the sentence. For those on probation
or parole, treatment should be a condition of release. Treatment programs
offer a high payoff in reducing crime. <BR>
<BR>
Consider:<BR>
<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A 1994 study conducted by the RAND Corporation1 found that while law enforcement
	efforts to seize illicit drugs do little to reduce supply, treatment measurably
	cuts demand.<BR>

	<LI>A 1994 study by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs2
	(CALDATA) found that illegal activity in the state dropped by 43.3 percent
	after treatment; the longer participants remained in treatment, the greater
	the reduction in criminal activity.<BR>

	<LI>An Illinois study3 which followed ex-offenders for two years after they
	participated in an in-jail treatment program found that they committed significantly
	less crime than other offenders.<BR>

	<LI>In Missouri,4 graduates of a court-supervised treatment program had a
	50 percent lower recidivism rate than a comparable population without treatment.
</UL>

Compelled treatment and rehabilitation should be in addition to, not in
place of, other punishments. Further, treatment must be integrated into
every step of the criminal justice system, not merely its prisons. Police
officers, prosecutors, courts, correction officials and probation/parole
authorities all must work together to push offenders into programs that
will prevent them from returning to drugs and crime. We know that the greatest
cost savings can be realized by providing substance abuse treatment for
addicts within the criminal justice system. But when we carry this concept
a step further, we can also save lives and money by providing treatment
for other people with addictions in our own communities.<BR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">As the former Mayor of Houston, I have seen the damage that alcohol and
drug abuse can cause to families, neighborhoods, and all of a community's
institutions. However, I also know that when the residents of a community
are determined to confront substance abuse, and to involve public officials
in this effort, it is possible to reduce and to prevent this problem. The
key to this success lies in having national and local policies that support
such community efforts.<BR>
<BR>
With this in mind, Join Together recently convened a policy panel to help
determine what the nation's policies should be to reduce substance abuse.
I had the honor of chairing this latest panel, which brought together members
of several previous Join Together panels. We believe that these policies
will make a difference. That's why I urge you to discuss them with your
neighbors and members of your local substance abuse coalition, as well as
with your local, state and national officials. Working together we can get
these policies adopted. And the sooner we begin, the more impact we will
have.<BR>
<BR>
Mayors, city councilors, school committee members, state legislators, and
other key office holders will respond if you present them with proposals
for solving your community's drug problems. The earlier you involve them
in the discussion, the more enthusiastic and supportive they will be. You
don't even have to wait until candidates for office have been elected -
talk to them now when they are running for the position. Ask them to support
policies which will have a real impact in preventing and reducing substance
abuse. I want to thank my colleagues who joined me on this panel. We hope
these recommendations lead you to take action now. <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

<H2>Take Action</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco are tearing apart the fiber of our nation.
Yet we can dramatically reduce their use and the harm they cause. Below
are five policies that, if implemented, will make our lives, and those of
our families and neighbors, healthier and safer.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
The panel offers these policies as a call to action. Take them and make
them work in your community. Join together with your neighbors, co-workers
and local officials to create change. Every community can begin today to
reduce substance abuse if you take steps to:<BR>
<BR>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>Compel substance abuse treatment for criminal offenders.<BR>
	<LI>Ensure that every person who has an addiction gets treatment.<BR>
	<LI>Make substance abuse prevention an urgent priority in every community.<BR>
	<LI>Increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco.<BR>
	<LI>Provide media time for counter-advertisements portraying the health risks
	associated with alcohol that is equal to the time spent promoting alcohol.
</OL>


How do we know these policies will have an impact? We base them not merely
on our own extensive, first-hand experiences, but also on three national
surveys of community leaders conducted by Join Together during the last
five years, and on the deliberations of four national policy panels that
studied underage drinking, criminal justice issues, substance abuse treatment
and prevention. Throughout our research, we have heard an echo of unanimity
from community leaders supporting these five themes.<BR>
<BR>
And we discovered something else, even more important. We cannot wait for
someone else to tackle the problem. There are success stories all across
the nation: Communities have reduced drunk driving, closed down crack dens,
and found jobs for troubled teens. And the members of these communities
have found success - not by waiting for others to act, but by taking matters
into their own hands.<BR>
<BR>
Substance abuse is a national problem, but tackling it requires the work
of every community and of every concerned citizen. Each community must develop
a comprehensive strategy for reducing alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco
abuse, coordinated across institutions and among individual citizens. Everyone
in the community, from all walks of life, must become involved, from parents
to police, from ministers to magistrates, from teachers to tavern owners.<BR>
<BR>
These policies will work - but only if you make them work. Share them with
your neighbors. Urge your elected officials to support them. Develop a plan
for putting them into effect and seeing them through to achieve success.
You will change your community - and yourself - for the better.

<H2>2. Ensure that every person who has <BR>
an addiction gets treatment.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Treatment is the most cost-effective method to reduce drug abuse and related
crime; for this reason, we must ensure that every substance abuser receives
treatment.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Treatment of substance abuse saves us all money. It cuts tax expenditures,
reduces health care and law enforcement costs, and enhances workplace productivity.
According to the RAND study mentioned earlier, every dollar spent on treatment
saves more than $7 in crime-related spending and lost workplace productivity.
This makes treatment the most cost-effective means of reducing substance
abuse. It is important to also understand that the savings in societal costs
and reduced crime benefit not only the addict, but also the people who live
in the community. And a recent Harvard University report5 said that these
savings occur even if the person undergoing treatment experiences relapse,
as most will on several occasions. The report said that even temporary periods
of reduced substance abuse benefit society. This point is crucial and means
that we must redefine our measures of success to include even short periods
of abstinence.<BR>
<BR>
Although treatment saves money and improves the quality of life for all
of us, only a small percentage of substance abusers receive it today. There
are an estimated 23 million people who require treatment for drug problems,
alcohol abuse or both. But in 1991, only 4 percent of these people were
enrolled in treatment programs. Some primary reasons for this gap include:<BR>
<BR>
Inadequate private health coverage Most private-sector health insurance
policies and managed-care plans either do not cover, or do not adequately
cover, substance abuse treatment. In fact, the recent growth of managed-care
threatens to cut private-sector substance abuse programs substantially.<BR>
<BR>
Lack of intervention Our policy must be to get substance abusers into treatment,
not just wait to treat those who ask for it. Critical to this is that medical
care providers be trained and required to take an affirmative role in intervention
and referral. Other community organizations, as well, should create mechanisms
for early assessment and intervention. Public-sector decline There has been
a decline in public spending for substance abuse treatment during a time
when the need for such programs has grown.<BR>
<BR>
The obvious remedy is that third-party coverage for substance abuse must
be the same as that for other treatable diseases, like diabetes, cancer
and heart conditions. The added cost of this coverage will more than be
offset by increased productivity and reduced overall costs of health care
and criminal justice. As we discuss in recommendation 4, taxes on alcohol
and tobacco should be increased, with revenues earmarked for the financing
of treatment and prevention programs. <BR>

<H2>3. Make prevention of substance abuse an urgent priority in every community.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">All young people are at risk of becoming substance abusers. Therefore, we
must enact an urgent agenda of prevention including strengthened enforcement
of underage alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco laws; targeting of higher-risk
youth; and comprehensive substance abuse education.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
We find ourselves at a critical juncture. At a time when our population
of young people is growing significantly, our commitment to prevention of
substance abuse is declining. Efforts at prevention made great strides in
the 1980s, particularly in the schools, where programs sought to educate
young people about the dangers of drugs. But over the last few years, these
efforts have lost momentum. Many schools are doing less about substance
abuse now than they did ten years ago. Resources have not kept up with need.<BR>
<BR>
As a new generation of young people faces the pressures to use drugs, drink
alcohol and smoke, it faces the possibility of never hearing the message
of prevention. We must begin immediately to enhance existing programs and
develop more effective tactics for the long run. In particular, our strategy
should include these elements:<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Law enforcement</H3>
We must be firm on underage drinking and alcohol use. We must step up enforcement
of laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol and tobacco to minors. Stores that
break these laws and sell to minors should have their licenses revoked.
Adults who sell or serve alcohol to minors should face criminal penalties.
Every jurisdiction should enact laws making it illegal for adolescents to
drive after drinking. A recent Join Together survey shows that 97 percent
of community coalition leaders support such laws. Legal loopholes preventing
or relaxing enforcement of these laws must be closed.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Targeting</H3>

While we should never forget that all kids are at risk, we should nevertheless
make special efforts to target higher-risk populations with enhanced prevention
techniques. Prevention efforts should be, in effect, customized to meet
the specific needs of particular groups of young people. These efforts should
take into account all environmental factors, including schools, peers, community
and family. And, to the extent feasible, they should take into account individual
risk factors; if a parent is arrested for drug possession, for example,
the child should be given special counseling.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Education</H3>
We must develop comprehensive programs to educate young people about drug
and alcohol use. These programs must not be left only to the schools; they
must be integrated throughout the community. Religious and athletic organizations,
the media, families, businesses, police, and other community organizations
all must play a role in prevention. Further, steps must be taken to ensure
the effectiveness of these programs. They should rely not on slogans, but
instead on teaching young people the true nature of addiction. They should
incorporate current knowledge of effective prevention techniques, such as
role playing. Most importantly, prevention programs should strive to involve
young people as partners in the prevention and policy-making process.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond policy, prevention must become a way of life. Most importantly, adults
must see themselves as role models and begin to practice what they preach.
If we do not want our children to drink and drive or use illegal drugs,
then we should not do so ourselves.<BR>

There is now a wealth of data demonstrating that increases in federal, state and local taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco reduce their consumption and related injuries and deaths, particularly among adolescents. And higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco have the support of 95 percent of community coalition leaders, a Join Together survey shows. </FONT>
<BR><BR>
For example, a 1994 Surgeon General report, "Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People," concluded that price increases at the state and national levels significantly reduced cigarette smoking among youth and adults. And in California, an increase in the tobacco excise tax resulted in a sharp decline in smoking, according to a study conducted by the State Department of Health Services. In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicted that increases in alcoholic beverage prices would lead to substantial reductions both in the frequency of youth alcohol consumption and in heavy drinking among the young. Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Economic Research in a 1993 report found that increased beer taxes could have resulted in a 54 percent reduction in the number of teens killed in motor vehicles between 1975 and 1981.6<BR> <BR>
Revenues from these taxes on alcohol and tobacco should be earmarked to
help fund treatment and prevention programs, thus helping to offset some
of the costs imposed on society as a result of the use of these products.<BR>

<H2>5. Provide media time for counter-advertisements portraying the health
risks associated with alcohol that is equal to the time spent promoting
alcohol.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Broadcasters who air alcohol advertising should be required to provide equal
air time for advertisements portraying the negative effects of drinking.
Other media should voluntarily provide equal space for such counter-advertising.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Ninety-eight percent of community anti-drug program leaders tell us that
they want alcohol advertising restricted, according to Join Together's latest
survey of community coalitions. The alcohol industry spends over $2 billion
a year promoting its products. One brewer alone spends more each year promoting
its beer than the entire budget of the National Institute on Alcoholism
and Alcohol Abuse. Advertising glamorizes drinking, associating it with
success, sophistication, athletic ability and sex.<BR>
<BR>
Among those most influenced by alcohol advertising are adolescents. Ninety
percent of high school seniors have consumed alcohol, 30 percent within
two weeks of being polled, a recent national survey revealed. A Massachusetts
survey7 found that, of teens aged 16-19, 20 percent typically consumed five
or more drinks at a sitting. Teen drinking has immediate and horrible consequences.
Every year in the U.S., at least 6,000 young people die and countless others
are injured in events linked directly to alcohol - including traffic crashes,
homicides, suicides, drownings and fires.8 Drinking is also a factor in
unprotected sex that results in teen pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases
and HIV infection. In the longer term, teens who drink are more likely to
progress to drug abuse and chronic alcoholism continuing into adulthood.<BR>
<BR>
Although advertising is not solely to blame for teen drinking, it offers
constant reinforcement of the notion that drinking equals the good life.
And, while print and broadcast media are brimming with alcohol advertising,
they offer almost nothing showing the negative effects of alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
In order to level the playing field and give young people a fair shot at
avoiding alcohol use, there should be equal time for counter-advertisements.
Any TV, radio and cable operator who runs advertisements promoting alcohol
should be required to provide equal time for advertisements about the health
risks of alcohol use. Print and other media should voluntarily provide equal
space for such counter-advertisements. <BR>

<H2>A Call For Community Action</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">The policies above can form the core of a local action plan. But every community
is unique; each should thoroughly assess its own particular needs and identify
action steps, policies and strategies appropriate to meeting those needs.
In undertaking this assessment, community leaders should call together as
diverse a gathering of community representatives as possible. They should
perform at least these steps:<BR>
<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Assess the harms substance abuse is causing the community.<BR>
	
	<LI>Determine what is already being done and what else needs to be done.<BR>
	
	<LI>Identify the community groups that are already involved and those that
	<LI>should be involved.<BR>
	
	<LI>Develop a plan allowing the various groups to collaborate in reaching
	<LI>the community's goals.<BR>
</UL>
</FONT>
The plan, of course, is only a beginning. It must be put into effect and
carried through to the end. To ensure that this happens, each community
should designate a local office to facilitate implementation of the plan
and to coordinate related community efforts to fight substance abuse. The
office should also be given responsibility for assessing the progress and
success of community efforts, measured against benchmarks set by the community
as a whole.<BR>
<BR>
It cannot be emphasized enough that local efforts to reduce substance abuse
must truly be community efforts. Join Together's surveys identified more
than 30 types of agencies, organizations and citizens that need to be involved
in efforts to prevent and reduce substance abuse. Yet the bulk of the work
is being left to schools, law-enforcement officials and prevention service
agencies. Among those falling far too short in their involvement are religious
organizations, private businesses, local governments, the media, private
human and health services agencies, courts, and civic organizations. Get
them involved. Everyone can play a role.<BR>
<BR>
The time to act is now, before you or someone you love becomes the next
victim. The place to act is right where you are, in your home, your schools,
your church, your community. It is up to you and your neighbors to put these
policies into action. These are the building blocks, but only you can make
something happen. Do it now, before it is too late. <BR>

<H2>Action Steps</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">1. Use this report as a reason to schedule a meeting with every current
elected and appointed official in your community, as well as with candidates
running for local offices. Tell them what you would like them to do to reduce
substance abuse. Leave a copy of the report with them.<BR>
<BR>
2. Circulate this report to others in your community concerned about substance
abuse.<BR>
<BR>
3. Use this report to reach out to new groups, such as fraternal and civic
organizations, schools, businesses, physicians, law enforcement agents,
district attorneys and others, and work toward common goals.<BR>
<BR>
4. Convene a town meeting to discuss the issues raised in this report. Ask
participants what they want done about substance abuse in your community.
Ask your local cable companies to broadcast the meeting so residents who
were unable to attend can still benefit from the content.<BR>
<BR>
5. Schedule editorial board meetings with your local newspaper. Brief them
on how substance abuse is affecting your community. Make recommendations
for change.<BR>
<BR>
6. Meet with junior high and high school students. Ask them what they think
should be done to reduce and prevent alcohol, illicit drug and tobacco use
among youth.<BR>
<BR>
7. Connect with Join Together Online. (<A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">http://www.jointogether.org</A>)<BR></FONT>

<H2>2. Ensure that every person who has <BR>
an addiction gets treatment.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Treatment is the most cost-effective method to reduce drug abuse and related
crime; for this reason, we must ensure that every substance abuser receives
treatment.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Treatment of substance abuse saves us all money. It cuts tax expenditures,
reduces health care and law enforcement costs, and enhances workplace productivity.
According to the RAND study mentioned earlier, every dollar spent on treatment
saves more than $7 in crime-related spending and lost workplace productivity.
This makes treatment the most cost-effective means of reducing substance
abuse. It is important to also understand that the savings in societal costs
and reduced crime benefit not only the addict, but also the people who live
in the community. And a recent Harvard University report5 said that these
savings occur even if the person undergoing treatment experiences relapse,
as most will on several occasions. The report said that even temporary periods
of reduced substance abuse benefit society. This point is crucial and means
that we must redefine our measures of success to include even short periods
of abstinence.<BR>
<BR>
Although treatment saves money and improves the quality of life for all
of us, only a small percentage of substance abusers receive it today. There
are an estimated 23 million people who require treatment for drug problems,
alcohol abuse or both. But in 1991, only 4 percent of these people were
enrolled in treatment programs. Some primary reasons for this gap include:<BR>
<BR>
Inadequate private health coverage Most private-sector health insurance
policies and managed-care plans either do not cover, or do not adequately
cover, substance abuse treatment. In fact, the recent growth of managed-care
threatens to cut private-sector substance abuse programs substantially.<BR>
<BR>
Lack of intervention Our policy must be to get substance abusers into treatment,
not just wait to treat those who ask for it. Critical to this is that medical
care providers be trained and required to take an affirmative role in intervention
and referral. Other community organizations, as well, should create mechanisms
for early assessment and intervention. Public-sector decline There has been
a decline in public spending for substance abuse treatment during a time
when the need for such programs has grown.<BR>
<BR>
The obvious remedy is that third-party coverage for substance abuse must
be the same as that for other treatable diseases, like diabetes, cancer
and heart conditions. The added cost of this coverage will more than be
offset by increased productivity and reduced overall costs of health care
and criminal justice. As we discuss in recommendation 4, taxes on alcohol
and tobacco should be increased, with revenues earmarked for the financing
of treatment and prevention programs. <BR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">As the former Mayor of Houston, I have seen the damage that alcohol and
drug abuse can cause to families, neighborhoods, and all of a community's
institutions. However, I also know that when the residents of a community
are determined to confront substance abuse, and to involve public officials
in this effort, it is possible to reduce and to prevent this problem. The
key to this success lies in having national and local policies that support
such community efforts.<BR>
<BR>
With this in mind, Join Together recently convened a policy panel to help
determine what the nation's policies should be to reduce substance abuse.
I had the honor of chairing this latest panel, which brought together members
of several previous Join Together panels. We believe that these policies
will make a difference. That's why I urge you to discuss them with your
neighbors and members of your local substance abuse coalition, as well as
with your local, state and national officials. Working together we can get
these policies adopted. And the sooner we begin, the more impact we will
have.<BR>
<BR>
Mayors, city councilors, school committee members, state legislators, and
other key office holders will respond if you present them with proposals
for solving your community's drug problems. The earlier you involve them
in the discussion, the more enthusiastic and supportive they will be. You
don't even have to wait until candidates for office have been elected -
talk to them now when they are running for the position. Ask them to support
policies which will have a real impact in preventing and reducing substance
abuse. I want to thank my colleagues who joined me on this panel. We hope
these recommendations lead you to take action now. <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

<H2>Take Action</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco are tearing apart the fiber of our nation.
Yet we can dramatically reduce their use and the harm they cause. Below
are five policies that, if implemented, will make our lives, and those of
our families and neighbors, healthier and safer.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
The panel offers these policies as a call to action. Take them and make
them work in your community. Join together with your neighbors, co-workers
and local officials to create change. Every community can begin today to
reduce substance abuse if you take steps to:<BR>
<BR>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>Compel substance abuse treatment for criminal offenders.<BR>
	<LI>Ensure that every person who has an addiction gets treatment.<BR>
	<LI>Make substance abuse prevention an urgent priority in every community.<BR>
	<LI>Increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco.<BR>
	<LI>Provide media time for counter-advertisements portraying the health risks
	associated with alcohol that is equal to the time spent promoting alcohol.
</OL>


How do we know these policies will have an impact? We base them not merely
on our own extensive, first-hand experiences, but also on three national
surveys of community leaders conducted by Join Together during the last
five years, and on the deliberations of four national policy panels that
studied underage drinking, criminal justice issues, substance abuse treatment
and prevention. Throughout our research, we have heard an echo of unanimity
from community leaders supporting these five themes.<BR>
<BR>
And we discovered something else, even more important. We cannot wait for
someone else to tackle the problem. There are success stories all across
the nation: Communities have reduced drunk driving, closed down crack dens,
and found jobs for troubled teens. And the members of these communities
have found success - not by waiting for others to act, but by taking matters
into their own hands.<BR>
<BR>
Substance abuse is a national problem, but tackling it requires the work
of every community and of every concerned citizen. Each community must develop
a comprehensive strategy for reducing alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco
abuse, coordinated across institutions and among individual citizens. Everyone
in the community, from all walks of life, must become involved, from parents
to police, from ministers to magistrates, from teachers to tavern owners.<BR>
<BR>
These policies will work - but only if you make them work. Share them with
your neighbors. Urge your elected officials to support them. Develop a plan
for putting them into effect and seeing them through to achieve success.
You will change your community - and yourself - for the better.

<BR><BR>
<H2>1. Compel substance abuse treatment<BR>
for criminal offenders.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Treatment of substance abuse must be an integral part of the criminal justice
system. Every substance abuser who passes through the system must be compelled
to undergo programs of treatment and rehabilitation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
The criminal justice system can take substance abusers off the streets,
but it cannot keep them off the streets. Under our current system of probation
and parole, drug and alcohol abusers who commit crimes and serve their time
will be let out of jail, usually to return to the very communities in which
they were arrested. And when they return, many will still be users, because
the system does very little to treat the addiction that often led them to
commit the crime in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
If we are to stop the revolving door of incarceration and release and incarceration
once again, the criminal justice system must serve to break the cycle of
substance abuse, not merely to interrupt it. Its objective should be not
simply to punish offenders, but also to use their arrest and incarceration
in a way that maximizes the benefits that can be gained for the community.
To achieve this, the system must recognize and respond to the fact that
addiction is a chronic condition that jailing, alone, will not cure.<BR>
<BR>
Science has come to understand that addiction is a disease of the brain
that weakens the addict's self-control and rationality. Alcohol and drugs
alter the user's brain chemistry in ways that can take years to reverse.
In this sense, addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. Many people mistakenly
believe that the enforced abstinence that results from incarceration will
cure addiction. But this is simply not so. Even after a lengthy abstinence,
the addict can still crave the pleasure of the drug, and the craving can
become even more intense when the addict returns to the community, where
there are many strong reminders of that earlier life. Besides, incarceration
does not equal abstinence; it is a sad fact that prisons and jails are not
drug-free.<BR>
<BR>
But for that window of time that the criminal justice system has the offender
in its grips, it has an unparalleled opportunity to do something about the
addiction. The system should compel offenders who have substance abuse problems
to undergo a program of treatment and rehabilitation. For offenders sentenced
to prison, treatment should be made part of the sentence. For those on probation
or parole, treatment should be a condition of release. Treatment programs
offer a high payoff in reducing crime. <BR>
<BR>
Consider:<BR>
<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A 1994 study conducted by the RAND Corporation1 found that while law enforcement
	efforts to seize illicit drugs do little to reduce supply, treatment measurably
	cuts demand.<BR>

	<LI>A 1994 study by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs2
	(CALDATA) found that illegal activity in the state dropped by 43.3 percent
	after treatment; the longer participants remained in treatment, the greater
	the reduction in criminal activity.<BR>

	<LI>An Illinois study3 which followed ex-offenders for two years after they
	participated in an in-jail treatment program found that they committed significantly
	less crime than other offenders.<BR>

	<LI>In Missouri,4 graduates of a court-supervised treatment program had a
	50 percent lower recidivism rate than a comparable population without treatment.
</UL>

Compelled treatment and rehabilitation should be in addition to, not in
place of, other punishments. Further, treatment must be integrated into
every step of the criminal justice system, not merely its prisons. Police
officers, prosecutors, courts, correction officials and probation/parole
authorities all must work together to push offenders into programs that
will prevent them from returning to drugs and crime. We know that the greatest
cost savings can be realized by providing substance abuse treatment for
addicts within the criminal justice system. But when we carry this concept
a step further, we can also save lives and money by providing treatment
for other people with addictions in our own communities.<BR>

<H2>3. Make prevention of substance abuse an urgent priority in every community.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">All young people are at risk of becoming substance abusers. Therefore, we
must enact an urgent agenda of prevention including strengthened enforcement
of underage alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco laws; targeting of higher-risk
youth; and comprehensive substance abuse education.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
We find ourselves at a critical juncture. At a time when our population
of young people is growing significantly, our commitment to prevention of
substance abuse is declining. Efforts at prevention made great strides in
the 1980s, particularly in the schools, where programs sought to educate
young people about the dangers of drugs. But over the last few years, these
efforts have lost momentum. Many schools are doing less about substance
abuse now than they did ten years ago. Resources have not kept up with need.<BR>
<BR>
As a new generation of young people faces the pressures to use drugs, drink
alcohol and smoke, it faces the possibility of never hearing the message
of prevention. We must begin immediately to enhance existing programs and
develop more effective tactics for the long run. In particular, our strategy
should include these elements:<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Law enforcement</H3>
We must be firm on underage drinking and alcohol use. We must step up enforcement
of laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol and tobacco to minors. Stores that
break these laws and sell to minors should have their licenses revoked.
Adults who sell or serve alcohol to minors should face criminal penalties.
Every jurisdiction should enact laws making it illegal for adolescents to
drive after drinking. A recent Join Together survey shows that 97 percent
of community coalition leaders support such laws. Legal loopholes preventing
or relaxing enforcement of these laws must be closed.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Targeting</H3>

While we should never forget that all kids are at risk, we should nevertheless
make special efforts to target higher-risk populations with enhanced prevention
techniques. Prevention efforts should be, in effect, customized to meet
the specific needs of particular groups of young people. These efforts should
take into account all environmental factors, including schools, peers, community
and family. And, to the extent feasible, they should take into account individual
risk factors; if a parent is arrested for drug possession, for example,
the child should be given special counseling.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Education</H3>
We must develop comprehensive programs to educate young people about drug
and alcohol use. These programs must not be left only to the schools; they
must be integrated throughout the community. Religious and athletic organizations,
the media, families, businesses, police, and other community organizations
all must play a role in prevention. Further, steps must be taken to ensure
the effectiveness of these programs. They should rely not on slogans, but
instead on teaching young people the true nature of addiction. They should
incorporate current knowledge of effective prevention techniques, such as
role playing. Most importantly, prevention programs should strive to involve
young people as partners in the prevention and policy-making process.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond policy, prevention must become a way of life. Most importantly, adults
must see themselves as role models and begin to practice what they preach.
If we do not want our children to drink and drive or use illegal drugs,
then we should not do so ourselves.<BR>

<H2>4. Increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Governments should significantly increase taxes on the sale and use of alcohol and tobacco products, with revenues earmarked for substance abuse treatment and prevention. There is now a wealth of data demonstrating that increases in federal, state and local taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco reduce their consumption and related injuries and deaths, particularly among adolescents. And higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco have the support of 95 percent of community coalition leaders, a Join Together survey shows. </FONT>
<BR><BR>
For example, a 1994 Surgeon General report, "Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People," concluded that price increases at the state and national levels significantly reduced cigarette smoking among youth and adults. And in California, an increase in the tobacco excise tax resulted in a sharp decline in smoking, according to a study conducted by the State Department of Health Services. In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicted that increases in alcoholic beverage prices would lead to substantial reductions both in the frequency of youth alcohol consumption and in heavy drinking among the young. Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Economic Research in a 1993 report found that increased beer taxes could have resulted in a 54 percent reduction in the number of teens killed in motor vehicles between 1975 and 1981.6<BR> <BR>
Revenues from these taxes on alcohol and tobacco should be earmarked to
help fund treatment and prevention programs, thus helping to offset some
of the costs imposed on society as a result of the use of these products.<BR>

<H2>5. Provide media time for counter-advertisements portraying the health
risks associated with alcohol that is equal to the time spent promoting
alcohol.</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Broadcasters who air alcohol advertising should be required to provide equal
air time for advertisements portraying the negative effects of drinking.
Other media should voluntarily provide equal space for such counter-advertising.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Ninety-eight percent of community anti-drug program leaders tell us that
they want alcohol advertising restricted, according to Join Together's latest
survey of community coalitions. The alcohol industry spends over $2 billion
a year promoting its products. One brewer alone spends more each year promoting
its beer than the entire budget of the National Institute on Alcoholism
and Alcohol Abuse. Advertising glamorizes drinking, associating it with
success, sophistication, athletic ability and sex.<BR>
<BR>
Among those most influenced by alcohol advertising are adolescents. Ninety
percent of high school seniors have consumed alcohol, 30 percent within
two weeks of being polled, a recent national survey revealed. A Massachusetts
survey7 found that, of teens aged 16-19, 20 percent typically consumed five
or more drinks at a sitting. Teen drinking has immediate and horrible consequences.
Every year in the U.S., at least 6,000 young people die and countless others
are injured in events linked directly to alcohol - including traffic crashes,
homicides, suicides, drownings and fires.8 Drinking is also a factor in
unprotected sex that results in teen pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases
and HIV infection. In the longer term, teens who drink are more likely to
progress to drug abuse and chronic alcoholism continuing into adulthood.<BR>
<BR>
Although advertising is not solely to blame for teen drinking, it offers
constant reinforcement of the notion that drinking equals the good life.
And, while print and broadcast media are brimming with alcohol advertising,
they offer almost nothing showing the negative effects of alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
In order to level the playing field and give young people a fair shot at
avoiding alcohol use, there should be equal time for counter-advertisements.
Any TV, radio and cable operator who runs advertisements promoting alcohol
should be required to provide equal time for advertisements about the health
risks of alcohol use. Print and other media should voluntarily provide equal
space for such counter-advertisements. <BR>

<H2>A Call For Community Action</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">The policies above can form the core of a local action plan. But every community
is unique; each should thoroughly assess its own particular needs and identify
action steps, policies and strategies appropriate to meeting those needs.
In undertaking this assessment, community leaders should call together as
diverse a gathering of community representatives as possible. They should
perform at least these steps:<BR>
<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Assess the harms substance abuse is causing the community.<BR>
	
	<LI>Determine what is already being done and what else needs to be done.<BR>
	
	<LI>Identify the community groups that are already involved and those that
	<LI>should be involved.<BR>
	
	<LI>Develop a plan allowing the various groups to collaborate in reaching
	<LI>the community's goals.<BR>
</UL>
</FONT>
The plan, of course, is only a beginning. It must be put into effect and
carried through to the end. To ensure that this happens, each community
should designate a local office to facilitate implementation of the plan
and to coordinate related community efforts to fight substance abuse. The
office should also be given responsibility for assessing the progress and
success of community efforts, measured against benchmarks set by the community
as a whole.<BR>
<BR>
It cannot be emphasized enough that local efforts to reduce substance abuse
must truly be community efforts. Join Together's surveys identified more
than 30 types of agencies, organizations and citizens that need to be involved
in efforts to prevent and reduce substance abuse. Yet the bulk of the work
is being left to schools, law-enforcement officials and prevention service
agencies. Among those falling far too short in their involvement are religious
organizations, private businesses, local governments, the media, private
human and health services agencies, courts, and civic organizations. Get
them involved. Everyone can play a role.<BR>
<BR>
The time to act is now, before you or someone you love becomes the next
victim. The place to act is right where you are, in your home, your schools,
your church, your community. It is up to you and your neighbors to put these
policies into action. These are the building blocks, but only you can make
something happen. Do it now, before it is too late. <BR>

<H2>Action Steps</H2>

<FONT SIZE="+1">1. Use this report as a reason to schedule a meeting with every current
elected and appointed official in your community, as well as with candidates
running for local offices. Tell them what you would like them to do to reduce
substance abuse. Leave a copy of the report with them.<BR>
<BR>
2. Circulate this report to others in your community concerned about substance
abuse.<BR>
<BR>
3. Use this report to reach out to new groups, such as fraternal and civic
organizations, schools, businesses, physicians, law enforcement agents,
district attorneys and others, and work toward common goals.<BR>
<BR>
4. Convene a town meeting to discuss the issues raised in this report. Ask
participants what they want done about substance abuse in your community.
Ask your local cable companies to broadcast the meeting so residents who
were unable to attend can still benefit from the content.<BR>
<BR>
5. Schedule editorial board meetings with your local newspaper. Brief them
on how substance abuse is affecting your community. Make recommendations
for change.<BR>
<BR>
6. Meet with junior high and high school students. Ask them what they think
should be done to reduce and prevent alcohol, illicit drug and tobacco use
among youth.<BR>
<BR>
7. Connect with Join Together Online. (<A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">http://www.jointogether.org</A>)<BR></FONT>

<H2>Sample Letter to The Editor</H2>
</CENTER>
<I>You can tailor the following Letter to the Editor with local statistics and send it to the editorial page editor of your local newspaper.

</I><BR><BR>

Dear Editor:
<BR><BR>
Our kids are buying alcohol, despite the fact that the legal drinking age is 21. This is particularly alarming when you consider that alcohol is a leading cause of death among young people.
<BR><BR>
April is Alcohol Awareness Month and this is an opportune time to call attention to the serious problem of underage drinking in our community. Consider the following facts:<BR>
<BR>
--Bars and stores do sell alcohol to minors.
<BR>
--High school students consume 31 million gallons of wine coolers and 102 million gallons of beer each year.
<BR>
--Nearly half of all college students who have been the victim of a crime had been drinking when it occurred.
<BR>
--Most students do not know that if they drink too much too quickly, they can die of an alcohol overdose.
<BR>
--Drinking is associated with other causes of death among youth -- including car crashes, murders and suicides.
<BR><BR>
It is time our community comes together to reduce and prevent underage drinking. We must get the message out in our schools, our homes and in our businesses that we will not tolerate sales of alcohol to minors. This is an important step in keeping our kids safe.

<P>For more information on how you can help make a difference, contact (INSERT YOUR NAME) at (INSERT YOUR PHONE NUMBER).
<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR><BR>

Your Name
<BR>Your Organization

<B>Washington, Sept. 25</B> - More than one in four high school seniors (26.5%) used an illicit drug once a month or more often during the past school year, and when they used drugs they got more intoxicated than ever. Nearly one in five 12th graders (18.3%) used an illicit drug weekly or more. Almost one in ten (8.4%) used daily. More than a quarter admitted weekly alcohol use (25.8%). In addition, 7.1% used cocaine in the past year; 11.6% used uppers; 12.1% used hallucinogens, and 3.5% used heroin.<BR><BR>

In its ninth annual survey of students in grades 6-12, PRIDE (National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education) reported that annual use of most drugs was at the highest level since the survey began in 1987-88. Record percentages of use were reported for the following drug categories: cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, uppers, downers, inhalants, and hallucinogens.<BR><BR>


Only three drug categories have ever shown higher levels of use in the PRIDE Survey: beer, wine coolers, and liquor. (Heroin was added as a drug category in 1995-96.) Overall, for grades 6-12, PRIDE found that 29.5% of all students surveyed reported annual use of at least one illicit drug, compared with 18.6% in 1987-88, an increase of 58.6%. Annual use of any illicit drug increased from 24.0% in 1994-95 to 29.5% 1995-96, a one-year increase of 22.9%. On a monthly basis, use of any illicit drug by students in grades 6-12 rose from 10.6% in 1987-88 to 18.3% in 1995-96, an increase of 72.6%.<BR><BR>


<B>Fewer Students Than Ever Say Parents Warn Them</B><BR>


Despite these alarming statistics, the percentage of students who said their parents talk to them often or a lot about the problems of alcohol and other drugs plunged to the lowest level in the six years that the question has appeared on the survey instrument (29.6% in 1995-96 vs. 40.3% in 1990-91, a drop of 26.6%).<BR><BR>


Nor are students receiving drug warnings from their peers. Only 11.7% said their friends talk to them regularly about the problems of drugs, compared to 10.7% in 1990-91, a slight improvement. By contrast, 88.9% said their teachers have taught them about drug dangers.<BR><BR>


When parents warn their children about drugs, use is lower. For example, among students who said they never hear from their parents on the subject of drugs, 35.5% reported using an illicit drug in the past year. That number fell to 26.6% for those whose parents spoke "a lot."<BR><BR>


<B>Schools Are Least Likely Place of Drug Use</B><BR>

Compounding the problem that fewer parents talk to their children about drugs than before, is the fact that most drug use occurs when and where parents are in charge.<BR><BR>


Among five choices (home, friend's home, car, other place, and school), students said a school building is the last place they use drugs. For example, among 6-12th graders, 16.8% said they smoked marijuana at a friend's home, 13.9% said they smoked at some other place in the community; 10.3% said they smoked in a car; 8.2% said in their own home; and 4.2% said in school. Students said they used drugs mostly at night and on weekends, again when parents are in charge.<BR><BR>


"Students are getting more guidance about drugs from their teachers than from their parents and friends, and they are using drugs far more often at home, in cars, and at places in the community other than schools. School is the most drug-preventive, drug-free place in town," said Thomas J. Gleaton, president of PRIDE.<BR><BR>


<B>When They use, Students Are getting Higher Than Ever</B><BR>

Besides more students using drugs more frequently, more students in 1995-96 reported getting "very high, bombed, or stoned" when they used drugs. Nearly three-fourths of seniors (73.6%) said they get very high when they smoke marijuana, versus 62.8% who responded the same way in 1987-88. Users of beer, cocaine, uppers, inhalants, and hallucinogens also said they were getting higher today than nine years ago.<BR><BR>


"This is not so-called 'recreational' use. This is marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and amphetamines. This is not experimentation. This is monthly, weekly, and daily use. This is a human tragedy," said Doug Hall, executive director of PRIDE.<BR><BR>


Today's report marks the fifth straight year of rising drug use reported by PRIDE. The PRIDE Survey has been reported annually since the 1987-88 school year. The responses of 129,560 students in 26 states from New York to California were included in the survey, making it the largest student survey in the nation, and the first to report drug use for the 1995-96 school year.<BR><BR>


<B>Marijuana Users Deeply Involved In Other Drugs</B><BR>

Among all students studied 29.5% said they used an illicit drug in the past year, and 24.8% said they smoked marijuana. However, most marijuana users in the study also drank alcohol, and used other dangerous drugs at very high rates. Among monthly marijuana users, 69% also drank liquor monthly versus 7.4% of non-marijuana users; 13% used cocaine monthly versus one-tenth of a percent of non-users; and 19% used hallucinogens monthly versus two-tenths of a percent for non-users.<BR><BR>


In the past year, the sharpest increase came in junior high marijuana use (grades 6-8) which rose from 9.5% annual use in 1994-95 to 13.6% in 1995-96, a 43% increase. Nearly a tenth of the junior high (8.1%) said they used marijuana on a monthly basis or more, up from 5.7% in the previous year. Among high school students (grades 9-12), marijuana annual use climbed from 28.2% to 34%, a 20.6% increase. One out of five in high school (22.3%) smoked monthly or more, versus 18.5% the year before. Use was highest in the senior class with 37.9% smoking marijuana on an annual basis, 24.3% monthly or more, 16.6% weekly or more, and 7.3% daily.<BR><BR>


"One stunning consequence of marijuana use is that a fifth of the Class of '96 who smoke marijuana weekly will find it difficult, if not impossible, to pass a pre-employment drug test," Hall said. "And that says nothing about the negative health consequences of this drug use."<BR><BR>


One reason for rising marijuana use may be a lack of belief by students that marijuana is harmful to their health. Among sixth graders, 85.5% said marijuana was "very harmful" to their health. But among 12th graders, only 43.6% said the same. Students also found marijuana easy to obtain, with 73.3% of 12th graders saying it is easy to get.<BR><BR>


<B>Cigarette Use At Nine-Year High</B><BR>

Nearly a half of all students in grades 9-12 smoked cigarettes in the past year (48.2%) and a third of them smoked monthly or more often (33.4%). That compares with 36.1% who used annually in 1987-88, a 33.5% increase, and 23.6% who smoked monthly, a 41.5% increase. Daily smoking in grades 9-12 rose from 12.3% in 1987-88 to 18.4% in 1995-96, a 49.6% increase.<BR><BR>


<B>Mixed Success In Curbing Teen Violence</B><BR>

The percentage of students who said they carried a gun to school last year dropped slightly (from 4.9% the year before to 4.5%) as did the percentage saying they joined a gang (from 13.8% to 12.4%). However, the number who said they threatened to harm someone rose (from 31.8% to 42.1%) as did the percentage of those who got in trouble with the police (from 24.7% to 25.2%).<BR><BR>


Drug use was more common among students who carried a gun to school, joined a gang, got in trouble with the police, or experienced other negative behaviors. <BR><BR>


<B>Methodology</B><BR>

The study was conducted during the 1995-96 school year and involved 129,560 students from 26 states. The PRIDE Survey represents data from sixth through twelfth grade students conducted between September and June of the school year. Participating schools are sent the PRIDE Questionnaire with explicit instructions for administering the anonymous, self report instrument. Schools that administer the PRIDE Questionnaire do so voluntarily, or in compliance with a school district or state request.<BR><BR>


The PRIDE Survey is consistent with other national studies, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Monitoring the Future Survey. Information from the PRIDE Survey is found in the President's National Drug Control Strategy and the Bureau of Justice Statistics Sourcebook. It is also used by the United States Congress as an indicator of student drug use.<BR><BR>


Results from the 1995-96 PRIDE Survey were announced at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington. Participating were Thomas J. Gleaton, Ed.D., president of PRIDE, and co-author of the survey, J. Douglas Hall, executive director of PRIDE, and Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey (Ret.), director of the Office of National Drug Control Strategy. States represented in the 1995-96 PRIDE Survey: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

<H2>What You Can Do</H2>
</CENTER>
Here are some suggestions you might want to use during Alcohol Awareness Month or any other time of the year when you
would like to devise solutions to alcohol problems in your community.
<UL>
<LI>Ask grocery stores to provide quantities of grocery bags to schools and ask students to illustrate these bags with
Alcohol Awareness Month messages. Return the illustrated bags to the stores for use with customers during April. 

<LI>Use liners in school cafeteria trays to promote Alcohol Awareness Month.

<LI>Establish a "homework place" for middle school students whose parents work during the day. Having a place to go
with adult supervision can help kids resist peer pressure. High-school students can serve as mentors, and
corporations can donate equipment like computers and arts and crafts supplies.

<LI>Enlist local parents to pledge that they will not serve alcohol to minors in their homes.

<LI>Review school rules regarding use of alcohol and see if they are adequately enforced.

<LI>Organize an alcohol awareness rally or parade.

<LI>Enlist local artists to paint murals illustrating alcohol-related issues that are of specific concern to your
community.

<LI>Offer public recognition to young people who lead drug-free lifestyles.

<LI>Insert a list of self-help groups and local resources with public utility bills.

<LI>Sponsor an essay/poster contest to address the question: "Is alcohol affecting the quality of life of our young
people?"

<LI>Ask churches and temples to integrate alcohol issues into their ongoing religious classes for young people.

<LI>Ask religious groups and recreation centers to assemble an Alcohol Awareness Month bulletin board. Ask people to
bring in news clippings of alcohol-related incidents in your community. Tell them to look for mentions of alcohol
particularly in crime stories.

<H2><CENTER>Warning Signs of Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
You may want to send the following list to your local newspaper and ask
the editor to run this to educate readers about the signs of inhalant abuse.
You can also create a poster or flier from this list and distribute to parents,
teachers and youth in your community, and post it in local schools, grocery
stores, churches and recreation centers. <BR>
<BR>
It is important for parents, teachers and young people to know some of the
signs of inhalant abuse, so they can recognize when someone is using household
products to get high. Some effects of inhalants are short-term, and they
vary greatly from product to product.<BR>
 <BR>
Some of the following symptoms listed below, provided by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, are warning signs that someone may be using inhalants: 
<UL>
<LI>Red, runny eyes or nose 
<LI>Sores around the mouth 
<LI>Chemical breath 
<LI>Drunk, dazed appearance 
<LI>Nausea 
<LI>Loss of appetite 
<LI>Anxiety or irritability 
<LI>Paint or stains on the body or clothing 
<LI>Chronic inhalant abusers are also anxious, easily excited, irritable
and restless. 
<LI>Inhalant withdrawal symptoms include hand tremors, headaches, nervousness
and sweating.

</CENTER>
Consider these facts:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of death among youth. This is because drinking is often linked to fatal car
crashes, homicides and suicides. (Centers for Disease Control, 1990.)

<LI>Youngsters typically try their first alcoholic drink around the age of 13. (US Department of Health and Human
Service, 1990.)

<LI>Junior high and high school students drink more than a third of all wine coolers sold in the United States. (HHS)

<LI>The legal age to purchase alcohol in all 50 states is 21. Yet teens have easy access to alcoholic beverages in our
communities. (Office of the Inspector General)

<LI>Two-thirds of all youth who drink say they can buy their own beer (OIG)

<H3>Binge Drinking on Campuses</H3>
<H2>THE FACT IS.. .</CENTER>
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Nearly half of all college students binge drink. (Binge drinking is
defined as five or more drinks at a time for men, four of more drinks for
women.) On a national scale, this is about three million students. (Footnote
1) 
<LI>On campuses where binge drinking is rampant (where more than 70 percent
of the student body binge drinks) the vast majority of college students
&oacute; 87 percent &oacute; have experienced one or more problems as a
result of their peers' binge drinking. These problems include physical assault,
sexual harassment and impaired sleep and study time.(Footnote 2) 
<LI>As many as 360,000 of the nation's 12 million undergraduates will ultimately
die from alcohol-related causes while in school. This is more than the number
who will get MAs and PhDs combined. (Footnote 3) 
<LI>Alcohol on college campuses is a factor in 40 percent of all academic
problems and 28 percent of all dropouts. (Footnote 4) 
<LI>College students drink an estimated four billion cans of beer each year.
And the total amount of alcohol consumed by them annually is 430 million
gallons, which is enough for each college and university in the United States
to fill an Olympic-sized pool. (Footnote 5) 
<LI>Each year, college students spend $5.5 billion on alcohol (mostly beer).
This is more than they spend on books, soda, coffee, juice and milk combined.
On a typical campus, the average amount a student spends on alcohol is $466
a year. (Footnote 6) 
<LI>Students at schools with high levels of binge drinking are three times
more likely to report being hit, pushed, sexually assaulted or experience
unwanted sexual advances by other students who had been drinking than their
counterparts who reside at schools with less drinking. (Footnote 7) 
<LI>The number of college women who drink to get drunk has more than tripled
in the past 10 years &oacute; rising from 10 percent to 35 percent. (Footnote
8) 
<LI>Nearly one-third of college students surveyed said they wished alcohol
was not readily available at campus events. (Footnote 9) 
<LI>Beer brewers spend an estimated $15-20 million annually to promote their
products to college students. (Footnote 10)

<H3>Binge Drinking on College Campuses</CENTER>
</H3>
<br>
<H2><CENTER>What Community Leaders Can Do: Finding the Local Angle </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
The statistics provided in this Join Together Monthly Action Kit show the
scope of binge drinking on college campuses nationwide. With the start of
school right around the corner, many reporters might want to take an in-depth
look at this trend. However, to make the information even more valuable
to your community paper, you can supplement the national picture with statistics
and anecdotes about what is happening on the local level. We all like to
read about what is happening in our own neighborhoods and in our own communities.
And local stories that have a national context are even more valuable to
reporters, because they show how their community compares to others around
the country. <BR>
<BR>
To localize the information in their kit on binge drinking, you may want
to consider the following ideas: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Talk to students on your organization's youth advisory board and find
out their perceptions about college drinking. 
<LI>Convene a focus group of college students and share these national statistics
with them and get their reaction. See how accurate they think these statistics
describe what is going on in your area. Invite a reporter to attend this
session. 
<LI>Check with the administrators of local colleges to find out how prevalent
binge drinking is in your area. Find out what types of alcohol policies
are in place. Do they have restrictions on fraternity and sorority parties?
Have these rules gotten stricter in the last year or two? If so, why? 
<LI>Even if there are no colleges or universities in your town, you can
talk to parents of college students to find out what is happening with their
children. 
<LI>Find out if there are server training programs in place in your community,
especially in bars and liquor stores that college students frequent. Are
sanctions enforced? 
<LI>Call health clinics at colleges and/or in your town and find out what
the relationship is between alcohol and rapes, violence and sexually-transmitted
diseases. Ask what treatment options are available. You can also check with
employees at your local hospital and with campus and/or community police
to find out the connection between alcohol and other problems. 
<LI>Find out if there are student groups sponsoring alcohol-free activities.
If so, suggest that a reporter contact these groups to learn more about
them. 
<LI>Suggest a reporter go visit local campuses (or if there are none, then
places where college students home for the summer hang out) and interview
students about their drinking habits and those of their peers. 
</UL>
<HR>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>COMMUNITY ACTION STEPS </CENTER>
</H2>
<H3><CENTER>What Students Can Do </CENTER>
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>--Come together and define the drinking problem on their campuses. Have
them suggest solutions. 
<LI>--If there are no alcohol-free dorms on campuses, form a committee to
implement one. 
<LI>--Find out if there is an alcohol-policy on their campus. If not, suggest
the school start one. 
<LI>--Suggest fraternities and sororities sponsor alcohol-free events. 
<LI>--Get petitions signed to eliminate advertising of beer specials and
happy hours on campus. 
<LI>--Start free ride services so students don't drive drunk. 
<LI>--Find out if there are any organized groups of students against alcohol
abuse like Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD). If not, students may want
to start one. 
<LI>--Ask the college newspaper to do an expose on drinking on campus and
the problems that result. 
<LI>--Suggest students work to change policies in your community or state.
For instance, if your state does not currently have zero tolerance laws,
students can work to get laws implemented making it illegal for minors to
drive with any alcohol in their bodies; support a ban on alcohol advertising
and promotion on college campuses; and propose increased taxes on alcohol
products. 
<LI>--Bring together college officials and local activists with local owners
of liquor stores and bars to find common solutions to underage drinking.
<LI>--Post facts about substance abuse in dorms, bathrooms, common areas
and health centers. 
<LI>--Sponsor alcohol-free events &oacute;like dances, bands, speakers,
readings&oacute; that give students things to do besides drinking. 
<LI>--Make sure AA and other treatment options are available to help those
already having alcohol problems. 
</UL>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
You may want to use these ideas as is, or adapt them to fit your community,
and:
<UL>
<LI>Send them to administrators and health centers at local colleges and
high schools 
<LI>Include them in your organization's newsletter 
<LI>Post them at community pools or recreation centers 
<LI>Provide them to youth groups &oacute;Give them to students to hang in
their dorms 
<LI>Put them up at grocery stores, churches, temples and libraries. <BR>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br>Contact: Kellie Foster, 1-800-54-CADCA<br><br>Wednesday, October 23, 1996<br><br><b>Congressional and Senate Candidates Focus on Prevention over Interdiction and Law Enforcement</b><br><br>
<b><A HREF="/jto/news/press/cadca/summary1.html">Go to Results Graphs & Data</a></b><BR><BR>

WASHINGTON, DC (October 23, 1996) -- CADCA released telling results of a survey -- more than 1,000 candidates for House and Senate seats were polled -- that revealed a majority (65 percent) ranked prevention programs higher than domestic supply reduction, interdiction or law enforcement in solving our nation's drug crisis.  Recent national attention, including the rhetoric of the Presidential candidates, has focused on interdiction not prevention.  Taking action as a result of the survey results, CADCA has created a 1996 Voter's Guide which will be distributed to its 4,000 members this week.<br><br>"The candidates overwhelming supported prevention above treatment, interdiction and law enforcement as the most effective means of dealing with our current drug crisis," said James E. Copple, President and CEO of CADCA the largest anti-drug coalition in the US.  "The message, however, has been lost in the current Presidential Campaign and lost in the Congressional budget debates on this vital and controversial issue.  What had been perceived as "pork" in the debates about the Crime Bill is now being supported as a viable strategy.  This is a major shift in thinking."<br><br>Among the survey's other findings:<br> <br><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>Eighty eight percent supported federal funding for community based substance abuse prevention program;<br>	<LI>Thirteen percent of the candidates, including six incumbents, supported some type of legalization;  <br>	<LI>More than seventy percent supported federal funding of 			treatment for women and adolescents; <br>	<LI>Eighty five percent supported maintaining the age 21 as he national legal drinking age; <br>	<LI>Sixty six percent supported a federal tax incentive to 			encourage businesses to establish drug-free workplace programs.<br>  	<br></UL>In a Gallup Poll released in December of 1995, Americans placed prevention and education as the most cost-effective means of reducing substance abuse.  The release of Household Survey data by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in late August caught most policy makers by surprise.  That data pointed to an alarming 78 percent increase in the use of drugs amongst youth in the past four years.  Following the release of this data, former Senator Bob Dole attacked President Clinton for being AWOL on the drug issue and President Clinton responded with law enforcement-style strategies such as drug testing to all teens as a condition of getting a dirver's license.<br><br>"Ironically, neither campaign bothered to look at the facts, nor did they look at what American people believed to be the real solution," said Copple.  "Interdiction and law enforcement efforts and approaches to seal off our borders from the flow of drugs into this country have done little or nothing about the price of drugs on the streets.  The street price for cocaine, heroine and marijuana have remained the same for the past ten years.  Unfortunately, interdiction approaches have had little or no impact on supply."<br><br>CADCA, a nonpartisan, privately funded non-profit organization of 4,000 community-based anti-drug coalitions conducted a survey of Congressional candidates for the purpose of issuing a voter guide.  The survey, which is part of a larger campaign by CADCA to raise awareness among national leaders, policy makers and the voting public about the drug issue, revealed that an overwhelming 97 percent of the candidates responding would be willing to get involved personally in their own district.<br><br>Congressman Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who has been working with CADCA since August of 1995, has created an anti-drug coalition in the 2nd Congressional District of Ohio.  This Congressional Coalition is structured to bring together key influentials in the community with grassroots leaders to construct a broad-based plan with programs and strategies for reducing drug abuse.  Rep. Portman has also worked with CADCA to conduct a day-long coalition building training session for close to 40 Republican Congressional staff members.  Both the House of Republican Conference and the Democratic Caucus have passed unanimous resolutions endorsing anti-drug coalitions as an effective strategy in combating illegal drugs in their communities.<br><br>"Since the release of the Household Survey, approximately 100,000+ kids have experimented with drugs for the first time and another 2,000 have died as a result of their use and/or addiction," said Copple.  "We cannot afford to trivialize this debate any longer.  Discussions or debates about what aide to what candidates used drugs in the sixties is counter productive.  America's youth are smarter than that and they deserve substantive responses to their concerns."<br><br>The 1996 Voter's Guide is being distributed to CADCA's network of more than 4,000 community-based coalitions this week.  The guide will provide local coalitions with a tool to work with their local policy makers leading up to the November election and beyond.<br><br>Founded in 1992, CADCA currently represents more than 4,000 coalitions members in the US including grassroots coalitions, educators, law enforcement, drug demand reduction coordinators and many others fighting substance abuse and drug-related violence.  CADCA's mission is to promote and facilitate comprehensive responses to the nation's problems of drugs and drug-related violence.<br><br>Jim Copple is available for interviews.<br><br>

<H2><CENTER>SAMPLE PITCH LETTER </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
You may want to send the following sample pitch letter (with local examples)
to an editor or reporter at your local newspaper. <BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
Dear Editor: <BR>
<BR>
Did you know that college students drink an estimated FOUR BILLION cans
of beer each year? This is a total of 430 million gallons -- enough to fill
an Olympic-sized pool at every college and university in the country. And
students spend $5.5 billion on alcohol annually (or an average of $466 per
student), which is more than they spend on books, coffee, soda, juice and
milk combined. <BR>
<BR>
Movies, television shows and beer commercials often portray youthful drinking
as an acceptable way for students to fit in and be popular. But for some,
along with this &quot;popularity&quot; comes many hazards. <BR>
<BR>
The fact is that as many as 360,000 of the nation's 12 million undergraduates
will die as a result of alcohol abus. This is more than the number who will
get MAs and PhDs combined. And alcohol abuse is also a major factor in other
campus problems, such as violent crimes, rapes and sexually-transmitted
diseases, including AIDS, despite the fact that it is illegal for anyone
under 21 to drink. <BR>
<BR>
As the summer draws to a close and students start heading back to campus,
you may want to take an in-depth look at the scope of college drinking in
our community and some of the problems that result. I can put you in touch
with some local students to find out about their drinking habits, what alternatives
exist, what they think should be done to curb student drinking and how aware
they are of the risks. I can also connect you with some local experts who
can give you more insight on the problem and suggest some fun college activities
that do not involve alcohol that you can spotlight. <BR>
<BR>
As I'm sure you are aware, this is an important topic and one that ultimately
affects us all. By shining the spotlight on this issue, you can help make
this a safer year for students and the whole community. <BR>
<BR>
You can reach me at <SAMP>(YOUR PHONE NUMBER)</SAMP>. I'll call you next
week to follow up. <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>What Are Inhalants?</CENTER>
</H2>
Today, more than 1,000 legal and useful household, school and office products
are being used--primarily by youth--to get high. This practice is commonly
known as inhalant abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Inhalants are divided into the following four categories: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Volatile gases and solvents -- lighter fluid, barbecue grill gas, spray
paint, paint thinner and glue. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Aerosols -- hair spray, deodorants and other pressurized products that
are used more for the propellant capability than for the contents inside
the can. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nitrates -- Butyl nitrites, which are often known by the trade names
of Rush, Locker Room, Bolt and Climax and are used as room odorizers; and
amyl nitrates, which are packaged in capsules known as poppers and snappers
and were originally created for heart patients. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Anesthetic gases -- Nitrous oxide, which is known as the dentists laughing
gas is also available in small cylinders called whippets, which propel whipped
cream in commercial machines. 
</UL>
<B>These substances are abused in the following ways: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Sniffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the nose. A youngster
may sniff a container of white out, glue, paint thinner or gasoline to inhale
the fumes through the nostrils. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Huffing -- Breathing in the substances vapors through the mouth. A student
can spray paint on a handkerchief and hold it over his or her mouth and
breath in the fumes. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Bagging -- Inhaling the vapors through a bag. A youth can spray fumes
on a cloth or piece of clothing, then insert it into a plastic or paper
bag to increase the concentration of the vapors. Then he or she puts the
bag opening over the mouth or nose and breathes in. Some users may also
place their heads directly inside the bag. 
</UL>

<br><br><br> <H3>Section Two: Coalition Impact</CENTER>
</H3>
In community organizing, as in life, it is not so much what you do, but
rather, what you get done. The third survey explored the actual accomplishments
of community coalitions in preventing and reducing substance abuse in several
ways. Outcome, not process, will validate the movement. Processes such as
strategic planning may improve a community's chances for success, but it
is the results that matter.<BR>
<BR>
To assess the actual results of coalitions' work, we used three sets of
questions. First, we asked if they had been influential in bringing about
the activities communities often engage in to deal with substance abuse
problems. Next, we asked if they had been involved in state or local public
policy changes related to substance abuse. Finally, we asked if they could
report they had a direct impact on reducing substance abuse in their community,
and if so, how they knew. The answers are displayed in <A HREF="gifs/table12.gif">Table
12</A>, <A HREF="gifs/table13.gif">Table 13</A> and <A HREF="gifs/table14.gif">Table
14</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Influence</B><BR>
<BR>
Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the coalitions report that they have been
influential in bringing about better interorganizational collaboration.
Only 7% of the coalitions believe interorganizational collaboration has
not improved at all. Similarly, 88% believe they were influential in increasing
prevention programs, and only 6% think prevention has not increased at all.
More than half (61%) report influencing an increase in citizen participation.
Almost a quarter of respondents (22%) think they have had no effect on increasing
participation, and 17% say it has not occurred at all in their communities.
(See <A HREF="gifs/table12.gif">Table 12</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
Almost half of the coalitions (44%) report influencing an increase in treatment.
An additional 29% report they have no influence on the matter. Another 27%
report that there had not been any increase in treatment in their communities
at all.<BR>
<BR>
Over half (60%) of the coalitions say they have been influential in establishing
or increasing alcohol- or drug-free workplace programs. These programs address
the reality that the majority of illicit drug and alcohol abusers are employed.
They are also used as an appropriate way for coalitions to reach out to
get businesses and labor organizations interested in their work. Business
and labor involvement in coalitions can make a great deal of difference.<BR>
<BR>
Having a job is an essential element of successful recovery for most people
with drug and alcohol problems. Only 21% of the coalitions think they have
had any influence in this area, and 38% think job creation for people in
recovery in their communities has not happened at all. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fighting Drugs Is All In A Day's Work In Tacoma, Wash.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Labor unions are working hard to fight gang violence and drug trafficking
in Tacoma, Wash. These groups mentor high-risk youth and provide them with
apprenticeships, run food drives for the needy and build kids' self-esteem
by displaying their artwork and essays in local businesses. <BR>
<BR>
The unions became involved in these efforts through the Safe Streets Campaign,
a local coalition fighting substance abuse in the community. &quot;We got
these groups involved by meeting them in their own space and around their
own agenda,&quot; says Priscilla Lisicich, director of the Campaign. &quot;We
explained to the union members the impact substance abuse has on their families
and neighborhoods and the kinds of benefits they would get as individuals
by joining with Safe Streets.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For more information, call Lisicich at (206) 272-6824.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Involvement in Public Policy Change</B><BR>
<BR>
Public policy change has a major effect on how successful a community can
be in preventing and reducing substance abuse. Therefore, we asked if there
had been changes in public policy in coalitions' communities and if they
had been involved in these changes. More than half the coalitions report
that there have been changes in drinking and driving laws and tobacco use
regulations in the past two years. One-third report changes in alcohol regulation.
About one-quarter of the coalitions report tobacco tax increases in their
communities, and 14% report alcohol tax increases. <BR>
<BR>
Fewer than half of the coalitions were involved in passing the public policy
changes they report. An average of 44% say they were involved in tobacco,
alcohol and drunk driving changes. Only about a quarter have been involved
in implementing tax increases. (See <A HREF="gifs/table13.gif">Table 13</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
<I>Warning:</I> Even though the economy has been growing for the past four
years, 38% of the coalitions report that nothing has happened to create
new jobs for people with substance abuse problems. The situation is likely
to get worse as new welfare regulations take effect that create barriers
for people with drug and alcohol disabilities from receiving money and other
disability benefits. If our society cannot produce new jobs at a higher
rate than community coalition leaders report in the survey, many people
will slide back into addiction or will never see the hope they need to pull
themselves into sustained recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalitions' Direct Impact on Substance Abuse</B><BR>
<BR>
It is a real challenge for community coalitions to measure the direct impact
of their work against substance abuse. With limited funds, coalitions are
expected to run their programs and &quot;prove&quot; that what they have
done prevented or reduced substance abuse. In many ways, this is an impossible
task because communities are dynamic, with many forces acting in conflicting
directions at the same time. All of these factors affect the civic environment
and, ultimately, the level of substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, it is very hard to &quot;prove&quot; causality for any single
endeavor. Process evaluation - that is, measuring the inputs to a program
- has been a frustrating substitute for understanding the impact of coalitions
and other anti-substance abuse efforts. <BR>
<BR>
In the third survey, we took a more direct approach. We asked the coalitions
to tell us if they thought they were having a direct impact on substance
abuse in their communities. (See <A HREF="gifs/table14.gif">Table 14</A>.)
If they did, we asked them to tell us how they knew. Coalitions responded
to these difficult questions with remarkable candor. <BR>
<BR>
More than half of the coalitions (54%) think they are having a direct impact
on reducing alcohol abuse; 48% think they are reducing illicit drug use;
35% think they are reducing tobacco use; and 30% report an impact on inhalant
use. About 10% report that they are having no impact at all on either alcohol
or illicit drugs. Between 37% and 55% (depending on the specific issue)
told us that they just do not know or cannot document whether they are having
a direct impact on these problems.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Measuring and Reporting Success</B> <BR>
<BR>
The answers we got to our request that coalitions tell us how they measure
success show the wide range of outcome and process measures that coalitions
cobble together to determine how they are doing. The responses are summarized
in <A HREF="gifs/table15.gif">Table 15</A>. We believe it to be an impressive
and important sign of the maturity of the coalitions that so many are able
to report serious efforts to measure their impact.<BR>
<BR>
Some coalitions track changes in objective measures over time. These include
school and community-use surveys, monitoring studies or official statistics
such as crime or emergency room reports. Others report success because there
are new substance abuse prevention or treatment programs in their communities,
which would lead to reductions in substance abuse. Other coalitions rely
on feedback from the community or continued funding as evidence of their
impact on the problem. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A Handbook for Developing Measures of Success</B><BR>
<BR>
Join Together, in conjunction with the Heller School at Brandeis University,
has published a handbook of substance abuse indicators that community coalitions
can use to track their success or failure. It is entitled How Do We Know
We Are Making a Difference? A Community Substance Abuse Indicators Manual.
Communities' experience implementing each of the indicators is being documented
and reported on Join Together Online. The handbook can be ordered by contacting
Join Together. Single copies are free; additional copies are $10 each.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Key Elements in Successful Coalitions</B><BR>
<BR>
Written strategies and equal participation by lay people and professionals
are key markers of coalitions that have been able to report success in their
communities. Common components of coalitions' strategies are displayed in
<A HREF="gifs/table16.gif">Table 16</A> on page 24. There is substantial
evidence from the survey that community coalitions with written strategic
plans to guide their work are more effective in reaching their goals than
are groups that do not have such plans.<BR>
<BR>
Coalitions with written plans are significantly more likely to report involvement
in successful efforts to increase prevention or treatment in their communities;
improve interagency collaboration; or change a policy than are groups operating
without such strategies. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the coalitions that
say they have had a direct impact on reducing substance abuse have written
strategic plans, compared with the 23% of coalitions that have no written
strategic plan but still had an impact. (See <A HREF="gifs/table17.gif">Table
17</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
This finding is given more weight by the fact that the groups with the most
comprehensive strategies report success in the most areas. We ranked the
coalitions by the number of strategic elements they report in their plans,
and also by the number of successful change efforts in which they are involved.
When we compared the rankings, we found a significant positive correlation
between a higher number of strategic elements and reported involvement in
more successful efforts.<BR>
<BR>
To further test the impact of strategic planning, we linked the strategic
plan elements listed in the questionnaire with activities and involvements
coalitions report in other sections of the questionnaire. For example, we
matched the inclusion of a prevention plan in a coalition's plan with extensive
involvement in prevention programs and influence in increasing prevention
programs by that coalition. In 19 of 23 combinations we tested, the coalitions
that included an element in their strategic plan are extensively engaged
in the related activity or report that they have been very influential in
a related policy change.<BR>
<BR>
Although it is clear that strategy makes a difference, it is also important
to recognize that many coalitions are active in their communities without
having written strategies. They, too, report extensive involvement in many
different activities. For example, 69% of the coalitions without plans report
extensive activity in prevention, and 26% said they are extensively involved
in treatment programs.<BR>
<BR>
Further, many groups with strategies engage in activities that are outside
of their plans. For example, two-thirds of the coalitions are extensively
involved in alcohol issues, but fewer than one-third of them have a specific
written plan dealing with alcohol regulation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Is a Strategy Anyway?</B><BR>
<BR>
A strategic plan usually includes: 
<UL>
<LI>Specific goals for the coalition. For example: &quot;The percentage
of kids who try or use marijuana should go down every year.&quot; 
<LI>Programs that are related to achieving established goals. For example:
student and parent marijuana prevention education, anti-marijuana media
spots, youth-run activities, targeted action against sellers of paraphernalia
and cigarette papers, etc. 
<LI>Ways to monitor progress toward the goals. For example: regular school
surveys that measure use of marijuana by young people in the community.
<LI>A regular public report of the progress made and a description of the
process for reviewing current goals and programs and for adjusting them
to changing circumstances. For example: an annual public hearing by the
city council to review the community strategy and discuss the progress report.
</UL>
<B>Written Strategy Helps Lake Tahoe, Calif., Overcome Substance Abuse</B><BR>
<BR>
Identifying risk factors - and developing ways to overcome them - is what
Tahoe Prevention Network's (TPN) written strategy is all about. This strategy,
which focuses on systemwide change, is based on the results of a community
needs assessment conducted in Lake Tahoe, Calif., in 1990. <BR>
<BR>
The assessment identified four areas that TPN focuses on: community, schools,
family and individuals/peers. For each of these areas, TPN develops projects
that build resiliency to lower the risks of substance abuse. <BR>
<BR>
For instance, in the South Lake Tahoe schools, one risk factor is the high
level of student turnover due to the transient nature of the area. TPN tackled
this problem by creating a welcome center that helps new students quickly
assimilate into school and by requiring parents to meet with social service
providers as part of the enrollment process. There are a total of 25 such
projects within TPN's communitywide written plan. <BR>

You and your colleagues knew that tobacco, drug and alcohol use were on
the rise among youth well before the recent national reports alerted the
American public. And you also know that the only real way to reduce substance
abuse is from the ground up - through the community action and collaboration
that result when communities join together.<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton knows this, too. In an address before 800 community anti-drug
coalition leaders on November 2, 1995, the President urged every community
in America to have a coalition to reduce substance abuse &quot;because we
know that we can make a difference.&quot; He told these anti-drug groups
that &quot;it is simply not true that you cannot whip this problem. You
are living evidence of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Join Together's Third National Survey of Communities Fighting Substance
Abuse demonstrates that the President's faith in coalitions is well placed.
You are driving up citizen participation, encouraging other groups in your
community to work together and changing public policies that are making
a difference.<BR>
<BR>
However, despite these solid gains in the coalition movement - from the
ground up - this survey carries a stern warning. Coalition leaders told
us that many of the institutions that have been traditional pillars of community
efforts - particularly elected officials such as governors, state legislators
and Congress - are now walking away from these problems at the very time
when their leadership is needed most.<BR>
<BR>
You also told us that you need more active partnerships from your local
businesses, clergy, parents and the media to prevent the next generation
from falling victim to drugs.<BR>
<BR>
We all need to challenge our leaders to view their prevention role in the
same way that businesses sell their products. Toy manufacturers know that
they have a new market for their products every several years. Drug pushers
and alcohol and tobacco advertisers also know they have a new market for
their products with each new generation of teens. This means that everyone
involved in the battle against substance abuse - from Congress right on
down to our local business leaders - must renew the commitment to combat
this terrible problem that exists in our own backyard.<BR>

<br><br><CENTER>Executive Summary</CENTER>
</H3>
Almost 200 years ago, Alexis deTocqueville (Alexis deTocqueville, Democracy
in America, transl. George Lawrence (Harper &amp; Row, 1966).) wrote that
one of the unique characteristics of Americans was their willingness to
join together with their neighbors to solve community problems. The Third
National Join Together Survey, conducted from July through September 1995,
shows that this tradition continues to thrive. New coalitions to address
substance abuse, violence, tobacco use and HIV/AIDS have been formed in
every state since 1993. Nineteen hundred and ten community coalitions organized
against drugs participated in the third survey, 73% more than participated
in our 1992 and 1993 surveys combined. <BR>
<BR>
This third survey indicates that community coalitions, especially those
with comprehensive strategies, report that they have had a direct impact
on substance abuse in their communities. In hundreds of cities and towns,
the work of community groups, parents and even young people themselves is
preventing youth from experimenting with alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs.
More than 200,000 volunteers are involved in these efforts. That's the good
news.<BR>
<BR>
The bad news is that substance abuse is getting worse in many communities,
yet the leaders of major government institutions are paying LESS attention
and doing a worse job than they did two years ago to address substance abuse
problems. <BR>
<BR>
The third survey findings are a warning to the nation. Elected officials,
business leaders, clergy, law enforcement personnel, school officials and
others must support the work being done by the community leaders and coalitions
or we will lose another generation of kids to drugs. Community mobilization,
prevention and treatment, as well as effective local law enforcement, must
be expanded or there will be even more drug use and crime in five years
than there is today.<BR>
<BR>
In the first National Join Together Survey, <I>Who Is Really Fighting the
War on Drugs</I> (1992), we documented the existence of community coalitions
that fight substance abuse in the majority of American communities. One
year later, the second national survey, Community Leaders Speak Out on Substance
Abuse, showed that the movement had expanded. We were able to describe the
activities undertaken by coalitions, including the adoption of comprehensive
strategies. Now, in the third survey, we can report the impact that coalitions
say they are having on their communities.<BR>
<BR>
There are two striking ironies in this survey. First, the movement can show
it has had an impact, but many of its leaders report that substance abuse
is getting worse in their communities anyway. Even the most effective coalitions
are only one factor among many community dynamics. The second irony is that
the movement is strong and growing, but it continues to depend heavily on
a federal government that is no longer committed to preventing or reducing
substance abuse in communities. As a consequence, federal funding for one
of the best approaches to prevent and reduce substance abuse - community
mobilization - may be cut down at the very time it is needed most.<BR>
<BR>
Additional principal findings, based on the responses of the <BR>
1910 lead coalitions and described more fully in this report, include the
following: 
<UL>
<LI>More than one-third (36%) of the coalition leaders report that substance
abuse is getting worse in their communities. However, 17% of the coalitions
think the problem is getting better. 
<LI>Coalition leaders who report the situation is improving were more likely
to also report increased citizen mobilization and volunteers, improved access
to treatment, expanded local law enforcement and increased prevention programs.
They also engaged in better coordination among agencies, and adopted comprehensive
strategies. These actions were significantly less likely to have occurred
where leaders reported the situation was getting worse. 
<LI>Many key elected officials are paying LESS attention to this problem
than they were two years ago, according to community coalition leaders.
Fifty-four percent (54%) say that Congress is paying less attention, and
37% say that their governors and state-elected officials are paying less
attention to substance abuse than they did two years ago. In contrast, 27%
say that mayors have increased their attention to substance abuse. 
<LI>Business and labor are doing as bad a job as we reported two years ago.
Coalition leaders rated their performance fair or poor by 79% and 88%, respectively.
The media and religious groups also continue to receive fair or poor marks
by 63% and 69% of the coalition leaders, respectively. 
<LI>Community coalition leaders are virtually unanimous in their support
for specific public policy changes to prevent and reduce substance abuse:
98% support restrictions on alcohol and tobacco advertising; 87% call for
lower legal blood alcohol limits for drivers; 94% want mandatory treatment
instead of prison for nonviolent offenders with drug and alcohol problems;
and 96% support immediate access to drug treatment for everyone who needs
it. Further, 79% oppose decriminalization of drug possession. 
<LI>The current survey shows how essential the federal government's role
has been in fostering the community coalition movement. The federal government
has funded new groups that have engaged new people to tackle this problem
and have taken a fresh community-oriented approach. About half of the community
coalitions receive some federal money directly or indirectly. Only 24% of
coalition funds come from state governments. Recognizing the need for longer-term
stability, a growing number (69%) of coalitions have diversified their funding
base, now relying on more than one funding source.

<br><br><CENTER>Section One: Coalitions - a growing and <BR>
important force in communities</CENTER>
</H3>
Join Together has purposely avoided assigning a single, rigid definition
of the term coalition to reflect the reality that various organizational
structures work effectively to reduce substance abuse in different communities.
In our surveys we have let communities determine whether or not they were
working in a coalition by asking: &quot;Does your organization lead, sponsor
or participate in a task force, consortium or coalition that plans and/or
directs alcohol or other drug-related programs, activities, policies and/or
resource allocation?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
We heard from 4177 organizations as of October 31, 1995 that either participate
in or lead community coalitions. Of these, 1910 respondents identified themselves
as leading or sponsoring community coalitions against substance abuse. This
report is based on the responses of these lead coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
Through our surveys and experience working with these groups across the
country, we are constantly struck by the rich diversity of the community
coalitions that have sprung up across America in recent years. In the Austin
district of Chicago, a community coalition has formed as an offshoot of
the police district there. In San Diego, a veterinarian took the lead in
forming a coalition whose purpose is to fight drugs and also educate and
support local parents. In Oswego, N.Y., a traffic crash that took the life
of a popular high school student was the catalyst to bring parents, teachers,
businesses, the media and youth together to build a safe and drug-free community.
And in Miami, a group of business people were convinced by their spouses
that they had a responsibility to help solve the drug problem. Their effort
became the Miami Coalition for a Drug-Free Community. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Types of Coalitions</B><BR>
<BR>
Coalitions participating in the third survey self-selected into different
types according to the way they described their sponsorship and membership.
Some are community action-based; others are located within government agencies;
and another major subset is found within health or social service settings.
In addition, there are coalitions organized around law enforcement agencies
that were not separately identified as a single type. <A HREF="gifs/table1.gif">Table
1</A> displays the relative distribution of the eight different types of
coalitions that participated in this survey. The box on page 10 provides
examples of each type. These differences are significant indicators of their
focus, their activities and their sources of funds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Do Coalitions Do?</B><BR>
<BR>
Coalitions bring different segments of a community together to solve social
problems. They connect individuals and groups with current information,
including success stories from other communities. As a result, issues can
be more effectively addressed than through single agencies working alone.
Coalitions focus on community environments, whereas many organizations that
participate in coalitions focus their energy on providing services to individuals.
Coalitions focus on systemwide change, whereas their members address specific
elements, such as treatment, shelter or youth employment.<BR>
<BR>
In each of our surveys, we have asked community coalitions to describe their
activities. We also asked them to describe the extent of their involvement
in these activities. The responses of coalitions in the third survey are
summarized in <A HREF="gifs/table2.gif">Table 2</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Coalitions are still much more extensively involved in prevention, public
awareness and systemwide planning than in other activities such as treatment/aftercare,
public policy or public safety. They remain about equally concerned about
alcohol and illicit drug use. Since 1993, there has been an increase in
the percentage of coalitions that are extensively involved in tobacco issues,
from 26% to 36%.<BR>
<BR>
To get a better idea of how coalitions have evolved and to learn the direction
their future programs might take, we asked the respondents to tell us how
their involvement in each of these activities had changed in the past two
years. We were curious to know whether it had increased, decreased or stayed
the same. The answers are also displayed in <A HREF="gifs/table2.gif">Table
2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Coalitions are expanding their involvement in a broad range of substance
abuse activities without abandoning their core commitment to prevention,
planning and public awareness. For example, 42% of the coalitions increased
their efforts in prevention, whereas only 5% report a decrease in this area.
At the same time, 25% report increased involvement in treatment/aftercare,
and 35% said they had increased their activities in alcohol and drug-related
crime issues.<BR>
<BR>
Only 23% of the coalitions report extensive involvement in public policy
matters. However, 36% report that they have become more involved in public
policy in the past two years. We believe coalitions will become even more
involved in public policy issues in the future because that may be the most
effective way to alter the community environments that affect substance
abuse.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, <A HREF="gifs/table3.gif">Table 3</A> shows that there is a
relationship between what coalitions do and whether they think the substance
abuse situation is getting better or worse. For example, groups who report
the situation improving are more likely to be guided by a written plan,
report better citizen mobilization, more volunteers and an increase in substance
abuse treatment, police enforcement and prevention than those groups that
say the situation is getting worse.<BR>
The Special Case of CSAP-Sponsored Coalitions<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention has played a major role in fostering
the development of community coalitions. Between 1990 and 1995, the agency
invested more than $500 million in developing community-based partnerships.
Five-year grants were made to more than 250 locally based groups to develop
and implement prevention partnerships and strategies. Additional grants
were made to groups that focus on teen pregnancy or high-risk youths, and
for communicating with special populations. Two hundred and ten (210) organizations
in the third Join Together survey identified themselves as CSAP-sponsored
groups. Thus, we can report how this important set of coalitions compares
to the rest of the movement.<BR>
<BR>
The survey found that community coalitions sponsored by CSAP differ in significant
ways from other coalition types: 
<UL>
<LI>CSAP partnerships are more likely to be found in communities of all
sizes than are other types of coalitions. 
<LI>Membership in CSAP partnerships is more likely to have grown in the
past two years than is true for other groups (68% vs. 53%). 
<LI>CSAP partnerships have significantly more volunteers than do other groups.
Fifty-eight percent (58%) have more than 50 volunteers, whereas only 24%
of other lead coalitions report that many volunteers. 
<LI>CSAP partnerships spend twice the amount of money working with other
service agencies than do other community substance abuse groups. Sixty-five
percent (65%) of CSAP coalitions report influencing interorganizational
collaboration versus 47% of other lead coalitions. 
<LI>CSAP partnerships are younger than other groups leading community substance
abuse efforts. 
<LI>Almost half of all CSAP partnerships (46%) are extensively involved
in systemwide planning of substance abuse programs, compared to 40% of other
coalitions. 
<LI>CSAP partnerships are more likely to have a written strategy for their
work than are other groups (76% vs. 70%). 
</UL>
<BR>
The items included in <A HREF="gifs/table4.gif">Table 4</A> suggest two
distinct patterns of coalition activity. The CSAP groups and government
executive coalitions focus on changing community environments and policies,
whereas the government health and not-for-profit led coalitions focus more
on improving services within the existing policy framework.<BR>
<BR>
Although CSAP partnerships are extensively involved in public policy change
at about the same level as other groups leading community efforts (23%),
CSAP coalitions are more likely to have increased their involvement in this
area in the past two years than are other groups (51% vs. 36%). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Funding</B> <BR>
<BR>
Some coalitions have had enormous budget growth, whereas others have lost
core funding, from CSAP or another agency, that has not been replaced. On
average, coalition budgets have not grown since 1993. (See <A HREF="gifs/table5.gif">Table
5</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
The message on funding that comes through clearly from the third survey
is that the coalitions are being asked to accept enormous burdens with small
resource bases. Thirty-five percent (35%) spend less than $50,000 per year;
another 28% spend between $50,001 and $250,000; 15% spend between $250,001
and $500,000; and only 22% spend more than $500,000, and most of these are
government agency coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
Most coalitions are public-private partnerships, but they rely heavily on
government funding. In fact, 79% of them receive at least some funding from
a federal, state or local government agency. (See <A HREF="gifs/table6.gif">Table
6</A> for a description of where the different types of coalitions get their
money.) The federal government's role has been particularly important as
a catalyst for new coalitions. Forty-three percent (43%) of coalitions receive
money from the federal government. The coalitions receiving federal support
are younger and involve more volunteers than those that are more dependent
on state governments or other sources.<BR>
<BR>
This is a disturbing fact when considering that federal funding for substance
abuse prevention has been decreasing. <A HREF="gifs/table7.gif">Table 7</A>,
reprinted with permission of Drug Abuse Update, shows that as annual federal
drug prevention funds have decreased, the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco
by youth has increased.<BR>
<BR>
State governments are the second most important source of funds. Twenty-four
percent (24%) of coalitions receive support from their state government.
Some of this funding comes through grants and contracts for services to
agencies for prevention and treatment, and some of it is in the form of
payments for treatment services provided to individuals with Medicaid coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Local governments are still not a major source of funding for coalitions.
However, they are playing a major role in some coalitions. Twelve percent
(12%) get some money from local government. <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="gifs/table8.gif">Table 8</A> shows that a majority of coalitions
(69%) now receive funds from multiple sources. This is particularly true
for coalitions that provide personal treatment services. <BR>
<BR>
Diversified funding is a major element in long-term survival and stability
for coalitions. The third survey results show that coalitions with more
than one source of funds have taken on a broader array of issues than those
with a single funding source. For instance, coalitions with multiple sources
of funds are more likely to participate in other coalitions within their
communities and are more likely to address treatment and aftercare, early
identification and HIV/AIDS.<BR>
<BR>
Coalitions are finding many creative and unusual sources of additional funding.
Join Together Online offers a Funding News Forum for communities to share
ideas about tapping new funding sources. Here is one example from the <A HREF="/jto/funding/funding.html">Funding
News Forum</A>:

<P><CENTER>Gas Bills Add Up to Big Money in Mobile, Ala.</CENTER>
<P>Fighting drugs in Mobile, Ala., is as easy for residents as paying their
gas bill. That's because the Drug Education Council there asks all 85,000
Mobile Gas Company customers in the area to donate money to them by simply
checking off a box on their monthly gas bills. Businesses are asked to donate
$10 a month and residents $2. These small amounts add up quickly for the
Council; it collects about $45,000 a year, about one-third of its annual
budget. Because this campaign has been such a success, the Council is now
looking to start a similar one with the Mobile Area Water Authority. <BR>

<BR>
<B>Membership and Governance Differences Among Coalitions</B><BR>
<BR>
The persistent differences in activity and funding for the various types
of coalitions caused us to closely examine variation in the membership and
governance of coalitions. <A HREF="gifs/table9.gif">Table 9</A> illustrates
that a majority of all coalitions report that their membership includes
equal representation of lay people and professionals. However, there is
significant variation in membership composition and governance, depending
on the type of coalition. For example, CSAP, community action and non-profit
coalitions are more likely to be governed by an equal representation of
professional and lay members than the other types of coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
A full two-thirds (66%) of CSAP coalitions have equal representation of
citizens and professionals. In contrast, only 41% of government health agency
sponsored coalitions have this type of balanced representation. <BR>
<BR>
These differences matter because coalitions with equal representation are
more likely to have written strategic plans, focus on community change,
report increasing citizen participation in their work, and report a direct
impact on reducing illicit drugs and excessive alcohol use than are coalitions
led mostly by professionals and government officials. <A HREF="gifs/table10.gif">Table
10 </A>displays these key differences.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Will Happen If Federal Funding Is Cut Significantly?</B><BR>
<BR>
As this survey was being completed, federal budget bills in both the House
and the Senate reduced support for drug and alcohol programs by between
72% in the House bill and 35% in the Senate bill. Newspaper reports, such
as in the Wall Street Journal (August 14, 1995), said these actions were
influenced by beer industry lobbyists who oppose the work of CSAP.<BR>
<BR>
In a survey in February 1995, Join Together asked community coalition leaders
what they thought would happen in their community if federal funds for crime
and drug prevention are substantially reduced. More than 90% of the 1,250
coalition leaders who participated in that survey predicted that drug- and
alcohol-related crime in their communities would increase if funds were
cut.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalitions of Government Officials</B> <BR>
<BR>
One hundred and six coalitions of various types report that they are composed
mostly of government officials. There is substantial evidence throughout
the survey that these coalitions have a different perspective on their communities
than other coalitions, and that they may work in greater isolation than
their counterparts. For example, they consistently give government agencies,
especially the courts, higher performance ratings than do other coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
We are particularly struck by the finding that government-led coalitions
are less likely to have written strategic plans than are partnership-type
coalitions. Most government agencies are bound by annual appropriation cycles
and existing legislative mandates. Broad strategic planning is beyond the
scope of many specialized public agencies, even when they are working in
coalitions with other agencies. We believe this finding strengthens the
argument that communities should have public-private strategic partnerships.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Multiple Coalitions in Communities</B><BR>
<BR>
It is unrealistic to assume that there will be only one overriding coalition
in each community. Multiple overlapping coalitions are likely to be the
most common pattern, even in relatively small towns. More than one group
identified itself as a coalition against substance abuse in a majority of
communities of all sizes in the third national survey. In fact, 86% of all
coalitions in the survey report that they participate in other community
coalitions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Multiple Coalitions Are Found in Some Communities</B><BR>
<BR>
In communities where there are several community coalitions working on substance
abuse, these groups often have different memberships and purposes. For example,
in Dothan, Ala., a city of 55,000 people, two groups identified themselves
as lead coalitions in the third survey. One was a school-based coalition
and the other was a community-based group working out of the Boys' Club.
In Brooklyn, N.Y., we heard from eight lead coalitions. Most of them cover
a specific neighborhood, but others are school, religious or health-based
coalitions that operate throughout the community. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalitions Have Become a More Common Way to Address Social Issues</B><BR>
<BR>
We have always believed that communities that had successfully fought substance
abuse through the efforts of a coalition would also form additional coalitions
to address other important issues. We asked survey participants if they
knew about the emergence of any new coalitions in their communities to address
substance abuse, tobacco use, violence or HIV/AIDS. The response was overwhelming.
(See <A HREF="gifs/table11.gif">Table 11</A>.) During the past two years,
new community coalitions to address major social problems have been established
in every state in the nation.

<H3>
<br><br><CENTER>Section Three: Community Report Card - <BR>
how coalitions rate the performance of <BR>
major community institutions</CENTER>
</H3>
Although citizens have become more involved and easier to mobilize against
substance abuse in the past two years, the federal and state governments
and local school systems receive significantly lower performance ratings
from the 1910 lead coalitions in our survey. The scores for all other institutions
remain unchanged from their ratings in earlier surveys. The national picture,
however, masks considerable change within specific communities. <BR>
<BR>
All community institutions must be involved if permanent progress against
substance abuse is to occur. Therefore, we have asked community coalition
leaders, in each of our surveys, to assess the current efforts of major
institutions in addressing substance abuse in their communities. Respondents
could give a grade of poor, fair, good or excellent. Table 18 summarizes
the key responses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Elected Officials Can Make a Difference</B><BR>
<BR>
Elected officials are reported to have increased their attention to substance
abuse issues in those communities where the situation is reported to be
getting better. Conversely, elected officials are more likely to have decreased
their attention in communities where the situation is reported as getting
worse. <BR>
<BR>
Local law enforcement and schools continue to get the highest marks in the
survey, despite the decline in the positive ratings for the schools. The
results suggest that community leaders give their local schools credit for
remaining involved in substance abuse but are critical because substance
use among teens is increasing in most communities. It is also true that
most school systems have had less money to spend on drug and alcohol prevention
in the past two years. Community leaders see and report the deterioration
in the number of programs. <BR>
<BR>
Business, labor, religious, civic and fraternal organizations get the same
poor ratings they received in our past surveys. Fewer than 6% of community
coalition leaders believe these groups are doing an excellent job in their
towns, whereas up to 43% give these groups a poor rating. <BR>
<BR>
In past surveys, however, government institutions received more excellent
than poor ratings. That has now reversed for the state and federal governments,
as well as the courts. For example, 8% of coalition leaders in this latest
survey give the federal government an excellent rating, whereas 17% think
its performance has been poor. <BR>
<BR>
The trend among government agencies toward poor performance against substance
abuse is confirmed by another set of questions in this survey. We asked
if certain elected officials are more or less interested in substance abuse
issues now than two years ago. More than half (54%) of the coalition leaders
believe Congress is less interested and more than one-third (37%) think
state elected officials are less interested now than two years ago. Also,
37% think their governors are less interested in substance abuse now than
in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
As a final check on this disturbing finding, we compare the ratings provided
by the 652 coalitions that participated in both the 1993 survey and this
latest survey. These coalitions also give lower ratings to the state and
federal governments and the schools this time. <BR>
<BR>
The national picture described above masks considerable change over the
past two years within specific communities. An analysis of the ratings provided
by the coalitions in both the second and third surveys shows that local
action in some communities has improved although it has deteriorated in
others. For example, 16% of these 652 coalitions improve the ratings by
two or more categories they give to local law enforcement, whereas 24% have
lowered the score by two or more categories. The lesson is clear. Leadership
and participation must continually be renewed. If an especially active (or
difficult) official leaves, coalitions have an opportunity to get the new
official fully committed.<BR>
<BR>
More than half (54%) of the coalition leaders believe Congress is less interested
and more than one-third (37%) think state elected officials are less interested
in substance abuse now than two years ago.

<br><BR><CENTER>Section Four: Public Policy <BR>
Views of Coalition Leaders</CENTER>
</H3>
The leaders of the nation's movement against substance abuse have a clear
and sometimes unanimous view of the policies they need in order to be more
effective. The answers they give to the public policy choices listed in
the third survey show they believe a broad-based approach is needed. They
do not believe that a policy focusing on only one element will work. They
want their own prevention work supported by strong regulatory policies.
They favor expanded local law enforcement, and even stronger illicit drug
and alcohol laws. However, these leaders are just as firmly committed to
providing treatment to people with drug and alcohol problems. Finally, they
are willing to accept additional responsibility for reducing substance abuse
in their communities, and they urge the federal government to revamp its
spending priorities to make that possible. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Policies to Support Prevention</B><BR>
<BR>
Community coalition leaders believe their prevention work must be supported
by public policies that send strong and consistent social messages against
illicit drugs and excessive alcohol use. Ninety-eight percent (98%) favor
additional restrictions on alcohol and tobacco advertising. They do not
believe industry claims that marketing is not aimed at young people. Ninety-five
percent (95%) want increased taxes on alcohol because higher prices will
reduce use by young people. Low beer prices sometimes make it cheaper for
teens to drink beer than soft drinks, and this may be a subtle message of
encouragement that higher taxes will counteract. Eighty percent (80%) support
random drug testing in the workplace. This is important because a majority
of drug users are employed. Fear of losing a job is a strong social message
that drug use and drinking at work are unacceptable. A majority (70%) support
similar drug testing in the schools to send the same message. <A HREF="gifs/table19.gif">Table
19 </A>on the next page highlights the policy changes coalition leaders
support.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Law Enforcement Policies</B><BR>
<BR>
Community coalition leaders firmly oppose legalizing drugs. A full 95% support
increased local police enforcement of drug, alcohol and tobacco laws; 79%
oppose decriminalizing possession and 87% oppose decriminalizing sales of
currently illicit drugs; 82% favor increased penalties for sales of illicit
drugs; and 73% want stronger penalties for possession. <A HREF="gifs/table20.gif">Table
20</A> shows policies coalitions oppose.<BR>
<BR>
Ninety-seven percent (97%) support legislation to make it illegal for adolescents
to drive after drinking. Twenty-eight states have already enacted this law,
and a federal law has now been adopted that will force the rest of the states
to enact similar limits. Eighty-seven percent (87%) also favor lowering
legal blood alcohol limits for adults. Thirteen states have lowered the
legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) standard from .10% to .08% - the
equivalent of four drinks in an hour on an empty stomach for a 155-pound
man. No state has yet to adopt the .05% standard used in Australia, New
Zealand and several European countries.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Policies to Support Treatment</B><BR>
<BR>
Coalition leaders' support for strong law enforcement should not be seen
as a &quot;lock them up and throw away the key&quot; approach. In fact,
support for access to drug and alcohol treatment is stronger in the third
survey than in earlier surveys. Fifty five percent (55%) of the community
coalition leaders strongly support that &quot;treatment be available for
everyone who needs it, immediately.&quot; This is up from 47% in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
Ninety-four percent (94%) also believe that treatment should be mandatory
for non-violent offenders who have drug or alcohol problems. They know that
drug offenders will be returning to the community and they want them back
- treated. Community coalition leaders know that offenders who receive treatment
are far less likely to return to crime than are those who go through the
criminal justice system without getting substance abuse treatment. <BR>
<BR>
Sixty-eight percent (68%) of community coalition leaders also favor &quot;needle
exchange&quot; programs for street addicts to prevent the spread of HIV.
They do not see support for this as contradicting their strong enforcement
preferences or their opposition to legalization.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Accepting Responsibility</B><BR>
<BR>
Over half (54%) of the community coalition leaders are willing to work with
others in their communities in a new youth development block grant proposed
by Congress that would replace current categorical prevention programs.
If such a program is adopted, 79% believe it should go directly to communities,
not to state or local government agencies exclusively.<BR>
<BR>
If community coalition leaders were in charge of the fight against substance
abuse, they would spend the money differently. We asked coalition leaders
how they would spend the federal anti-drug budget. They would make a dramatic
shift away from international interdiction toward prevention, treatment
and support for local law enforcement. <A HREF="gifs/table21.gif">Tables
21</A> and <A HREF="gifs/table2.gif">22</A> clearly show these differences
by comparing the fiscal year 1995 federal budget allocation with the budget
allocation preferred by community coalition leaders.

The findings of this third survey carry several important messages: 
<UL>
<LI>First, they tell funders of community-based substance abuse coalitions
how important it is to require these groups to have written strategies.
<LI>Second, the results should serve to remind coalitions to take an active
role in shaping public policy on the local, state and federal levels. 
<LI>Third, it is clear that government officials - particularly members
of Congress, governors and state elected officials - need to take a much
more active role in listening - and responding - to coalition leaders. 
<LI>Finally, our findings are a call to action to businesses, the media
and clergy to get more involved in anti-substance abuse coalition efforts
in their communities. Their participation matters. It really can make a
difference.

</H3>
The methodology for Join Together's Third National Survey was similar to
that of our 1992 and 1993 surveys. We replicated our initial efforts at
attempting to identify every community coalition in the nation by contacting
the following agencies and organizations in every state. We asked them to
provide us with a list of all task forces, coalitions, consortia, partnerships
and citizen action groups that they work with to address substance abuse
problems. They include: 
<UL>
<LI>State alcohol and drug agencies 
<LI>State Departments of Public Safety 
<LI>State juvenile justice agencies 
<LI>State education agencies 
<LI>State Departments of Mental Health and Mental Retardation 
<LI>State health and social services agencies 
<LI>State alcohol and drug services 
<LI>State Highway Safety Agencies 
<LI>National groups, such as MADD and NHTSA 
</UL>
<BR>
In July 1995, we mailed 31,500 surveys to organizations that were identified
by these agencies and the Join Together database of community coalitions.
One follow-up mailing was done for the cohort that participated in both
previous surveys to increase their response rate and to provide us with
an opportunity to denote trends. See the next page for a copy of the questionnaire.<BR>
<BR>
This report, however, is based primarily on the 1910 agencies that report
leading or sponsoring anti-substance abuse coalitions as opposed to agencies
that participate in coalitions headed by other groups. <BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Join Together Resources as of December 1995</B></CENTER>
<P>Join Together has a number of resources available to assist coalitions
and other community-based efforts to prevent and reduce substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<B>General Coalition Information</B><BR>
<BR>
Working from your own desk, Join Together Online (available on the Internet)
will help you identify and work with other communities fighting substance
abuse across the nation. Through Join Together Online you can access daily
summaries of major newspaper and wire service articles about substance abuse;
find facts, coalition stories and ideas for strengthening your organization
and measuring its success; and join a discussion group to exchange ideas
and get answers to questions from other coalitions and experts in the field.<BR>
A National Events Calendar will let you search for events locally or nationally
or contribute your own. You can also search our database of over 60,000
people to find others in your town, state or anywhere in the United States
with whom you can collaborate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Funding Information</B><BR>
<BR>
Join Together Online has a special section devoted to <A HREF="/jto/funding/funding.html">Funding
News</A>. Updated daily, it gives you access to the full text of Federal
Register announcements, foundation profiles and tips on finding grants.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Impact</B><BR>
<BR>
How Do We Know We Are Making a Difference? A Community Substance Abuse Indicators
Handbook provides measures for communities to assess substance abuse problems.
These indicators can be powerful tools in local efforts to reduce substance
abuse. The first copy of this 86-page manual is free; additional copies
are $10 each.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Public Policy Materials</B><BR>
<BR>
Join Together has convened five national panels to examine how public policies
can be improved to support community-based efforts to reduce substance abuse.
Copies of the reports outlining recommendations made by these panels and
action steps that communities can take are available. Your community may
want to adopt a similar format to address your own policy issues. 
<UL>
<LI>Save Lives! Report, Recommendations and Action Steps of the Join Together
Public Policy on Underage Access to Alcohol-updated in 1995 
<LI>Health Reform for Communities: Recommendations on Financing Substance
Abuse Services 
<LI>Alcohol and Drug Abuse in America: Policies for Prevention and Community
Action Guide 
</UL>
Two other reports are being prepared as this survey is being published.
The first outlines recommendations and action steps that communities can
implement to make policies pertaining to the criminal justice system more
supportive of efforts to reduce substance abuse. The second report details
suggested policy changes and related action steps to make block grant policies
more supportive of community anti-substance abuse initiatives. Both reports
will be available for distribution in early 1996.

You and your colleagues knew that tobacco, drug and alcohol use were on
the rise among youth well before the recent national reports alerted the
American public. And you also know that the only real way to reduce substance
abuse is from the ground up - through the community action and collaboration
that result when communities join together.<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton knows this, too. In an address before 800 community anti-drug
coalition leaders on November 2, 1995, the President urged every community
in America to have a coalition to reduce substance abuse &quot;because we
know that we can make a difference.&quot; He told these anti-drug groups
that &quot;it is simply not true that you cannot whip this problem. You
are living evidence of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Join Together's Third National Survey of Communities Fighting Substance
Abuse demonstrates that the President's faith in coalitions is well placed.
You are driving up citizen participation, encouraging other groups in your
community to work together and changing public policies that are making
a difference.<BR>
<BR>
However, despite these solid gains in the coalition movement - from the
ground up - this survey carries a stern warning. Coalition leaders told
us that many of the institutions that have been traditional pillars of community
efforts - particularly elected officials such as governors, state legislators
and Congress - are now walking away from these problems at the very time
when their leadership is needed most.<BR>
<BR>
You also told us that you need more active partnerships from your local
businesses, clergy, parents and the media to prevent the next generation
from falling victim to drugs.<BR>
<BR>
We all need to challenge our leaders to view their prevention role in the
same way that businesses sell their products. Toy manufacturers know that
they have a new market for their products every several years. Drug pushers
and alcohol and tobacco advertisers also know they have a new market for
their products with each new generation of teens. This means that everyone
involved in the battle against substance abuse - from Congress right on
down to our local business leaders - must renew the commitment to combat
this terrible problem that exists in our own backyard.<BR>

<H2>Sample Op-Ed</H2>
</CENTER>

<I>You can ask your Editorial Page Editor at your local newspaper to run the following Op-Ed -- either as is or tailored to fit your community.</I>

<CENTER><H3>Joe Camel vs. the Budweiser Frogs</H3></CENTER>

Last summer you couldn't watch television or read a newspaper without hearing about the rising number of teenage smokers. And when the executive branch of the federal government decided to launch an all-out attack on the problem --complete with a presidential press conference-- regulating tobacco advertising was one of the first measures the Clinton administration proposed.<BR>

<BR>
Does anyone believe that the Budweiser frogs appeal to kids any less than Joe Camel?
<BR><BR>
Yet the silence is deafening when it comes to the equally obvious links between alcohol advertising and underage drinking, despite the fact that nearly 30 percent of our high school seniors have had five or more drinks in a row in just the last few weeks. That's about the same percentage as say they smoked a cigarette within the past month.
<BR><BR>
Beer ads may be even more problematic because they're still broadcast through television and seen by kids more likely to channel surf than thumb through a magazine. Congress, however, couldn't care less; it has twice killed legislation that would have balanced the glamorous appeal of beer advertising with public health messages.
<BR><BR>
Tobacco advertising makes a less controversial target for regulation because there is probably not an American alive who does not admit that smoking can be dangerous to your health. Plus, Congress already acknowledged the role advertising played in hooking citizens of all ages on nicotine when it banned cigarette commercials on television nearly 30 years ago.
<BR><BR>
So why is the federal government so far behind the learning curve when it comes to alcohol? For one thing, the alcohol beverage industry has a powerful lobby in Washington. When the House of Representatives passed legislation late last year to reduce funding for the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, the Wall Street Journal reported that key players on Capitol Hill received "thank you six packs" from the National Beer Wholesaler's Association, as well as from Coors Brewing.
<BR><BR>
Just as significant, the alcoholic beverage industry has been extremely skillful in manipulating public attitudes about drinking. Public Health advocates who express statistically supported concerns about alcohol abuse are denounced as "neoprohibitionists" who want to end the sale of alcohol when saving lives and preventing alcohol-related problems such as fatal car crashes and family violence are their real agenda.
<BR><BR>
Nor has the alcoholic beverage industry been hesitant to use advertising to try to persuade the American public that its product is for adults only. But does the industry mean what it says? Sales figures speak much more loudly than words and images crafted by public relations professionals : junior and senior high school students drink more than a billion cans of beer every year and they buy 35 percent of all wine coolers!
<BR><BR>
(INSERT NAME OF YOUR ORGANIZATION) is not suggesting that kids drinking should be taken more seriously than their smoking, but consider this startling fact from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: the most likely cause of death for a 16-year-old in this country is alcohol.

<br><br><br> <H3>Section Two: Coalition Impact</CENTER>
</H3>
In community organizing, as in life, it is not so much what you do, but
rather, what you get done. The third survey explored the actual accomplishments
of community coalitions in preventing and reducing substance abuse in several
ways. Outcome, not process, will validate the movement. Processes such as
strategic planning may improve a community's chances for success, but it
is the results that matter.<BR>
<BR>
To assess the actual results of coalitions' work, we used three sets of
questions. First, we asked if they had been influential in bringing about
the activities communities often engage in to deal with substance abuse
problems. Next, we asked if they had been involved in state or local public
policy changes related to substance abuse. Finally, we asked if they could
report they had a direct impact on reducing substance abuse in their community,
and if so, how they knew. The answers are displayed in <A HREF="gifs/table12.gif">Table
12</A>, <A HREF="gifs/table13.gif">Table 13</A> and <A HREF="gifs/table14.gif">Table
14</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Influence</B><BR>
<BR>
Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the coalitions report that they have been
influential in bringing about better interorganizational collaboration.
Only 7% of the coalitions believe interorganizational collaboration has
not improved at all. Similarly, 88% believe they were influential in increasing
prevention programs, and only 6% think prevention has not increased at all.
More than half (61%) report influencing an increase in citizen participation.
Almost a quarter of respondents (22%) think they have had no effect on increasing
participation, and 17% say it has not occurred at all in their communities.
(See <A HREF="gifs/table12.gif">Table 12</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
Almost half of the coalitions (44%) report influencing an increase in treatment.
An additional 29% report they have no influence on the matter. Another 27%
report that there had not been any increase in treatment in their communities
at all.<BR>
<BR>
Over half (60%) of the coalitions say they have been influential in establishing
or increasing alcohol- or drug-free workplace programs. These programs address
the reality that the majority of illicit drug and alcohol abusers are employed.
They are also used as an appropriate way for coalitions to reach out to
get businesses and labor organizations interested in their work. Business
and labor involvement in coalitions can make a great deal of difference.<BR>
<BR>
Having a job is an essential element of successful recovery for most people
with drug and alcohol problems. Only 21% of the coalitions think they have
had any influence in this area, and 38% think job creation for people in
recovery in their communities has not happened at all. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fighting Drugs Is All In A Day's Work In Tacoma, Wash.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Labor unions are working hard to fight gang violence and drug trafficking
in Tacoma, Wash. These groups mentor high-risk youth and provide them with
apprenticeships, run food drives for the needy and build kids' self-esteem
by displaying their artwork and essays in local businesses. <BR>
<BR>
The unions became involved in these efforts through the Safe Streets Campaign,
a local coalition fighting substance abuse in the community. &quot;We got
these groups involved by meeting them in their own space and around their
own agenda,&quot; says Priscilla Lisicich, director of the Campaign. &quot;We
explained to the union members the impact substance abuse has on their families
and neighborhoods and the kinds of benefits they would get as individuals
by joining with Safe Streets.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For more information, call Lisicich at (206) 272-6824.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Involvement in Public Policy Change</B><BR>
<BR>
Public policy change has a major effect on how successful a community can
be in preventing and reducing substance abuse. Therefore, we asked if there
had been changes in public policy in coalitions' communities and if they
had been involved in these changes. More than half the coalitions report
that there have been changes in drinking and driving laws and tobacco use
regulations in the past two years. One-third report changes in alcohol regulation.
About one-quarter of the coalitions report tobacco tax increases in their
communities, and 14% report alcohol tax increases. <BR>
<BR>
Fewer than half of the coalitions were involved in passing the public policy
changes they report. An average of 44% say they were involved in tobacco,
alcohol and drunk driving changes. Only about a quarter have been involved
in implementing tax increases. (See <A HREF="gifs/table13.gif">Table 13</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
<I>Warning:</I> Even though the economy has been growing for the past four
years, 38% of the coalitions report that nothing has happened to create
new jobs for people with substance abuse problems. The situation is likely
to get worse as new welfare regulations take effect that create barriers
for people with drug and alcohol disabilities from receiving money and other
disability benefits. If our society cannot produce new jobs at a higher
rate than community coalition leaders report in the survey, many people
will slide back into addiction or will never see the hope they need to pull
themselves into sustained recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalitions' Direct Impact on Substance Abuse</B><BR>
<BR>
It is a real challenge for community coalitions to measure the direct impact
of their work against substance abuse. With limited funds, coalitions are
expected to run their programs and &quot;prove&quot; that what they have
done prevented or reduced substance abuse. In many ways, this is an impossible
task because communities are dynamic, with many forces acting in conflicting
directions at the same time. All of these factors affect the civic environment
and, ultimately, the level of substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, it is very hard to &quot;prove&quot; causality for any single
endeavor. Process evaluation - that is, measuring the inputs to a program
- has been a frustrating substitute for understanding the impact of coalitions
and other anti-substance abuse efforts. <BR>
<BR>
In the third survey, we took a more direct approach. We asked the coalitions
to tell us if they thought they were having a direct impact on substance
abuse in their communities. (See <A HREF="gifs/table14.gif">Table 14</A>.)
If they did, we asked them to tell us how they knew. Coalitions responded
to these difficult questions with remarkable candor. <BR>
<BR>
More than half of the coalitions (54%) think they are having a direct impact
on reducing alcohol abuse; 48% think they are reducing illicit drug use;
35% think they are reducing tobacco use; and 30% report an impact on inhalant
use. About 10% report that they are having no impact at all on either alcohol
or illicit drugs. Between 37% and 55% (depending on the specific issue)
told us that they just do not know or cannot document whether they are having
a direct impact on these problems.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Measuring and Reporting Success</B> <BR>
<BR>
The answers we got to our request that coalitions tell us how they measure
success show the wide range of outcome and process measures that coalitions
cobble together to determine how they are doing. The responses are summarized
in <A HREF="gifs/table15.gif">Table 15</A>. We believe it to be an impressive
and important sign of the maturity of the coalitions that so many are able
to report serious efforts to measure their impact.<BR>
<BR>
Some coalitions track changes in objective measures over time. These include
school and community-use surveys, monitoring studies or official statistics
such as crime or emergency room reports. Others report success because there
are new substance abuse prevention or treatment programs in their communities,
which would lead to reductions in substance abuse. Other coalitions rely
on feedback from the community or continued funding as evidence of their
impact on the problem. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A Handbook for Developing Measures of Success</B><BR>
<BR>
Join Together, in conjunction with the Heller School at Brandeis University,
has published a handbook of substance abuse indicators that community coalitions
can use to track their success or failure. It is entitled How Do We Know
We Are Making a Difference? A Community Substance Abuse Indicators Manual.
Communities' experience implementing each of the indicators is being documented
and reported on Join Together Online. The handbook can be ordered by contacting
Join Together. Single copies are free; additional copies are $10 each.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Key Elements in Successful Coalitions</B><BR>
<BR>
Written strategies and equal participation by lay people and professionals
are key markers of coalitions that have been able to report success in their
communities. Common components of coalitions' strategies are displayed in
<A HREF="gifs/table16.gif">Table 16</A> on page 24. There is substantial
evidence from the survey that community coalitions with written strategic
plans to guide their work are more effective in reaching their goals than
are groups that do not have such plans.<BR>
<BR>
Coalitions with written plans are significantly more likely to report involvement
in successful efforts to increase prevention or treatment in their communities;
improve interagency collaboration; or change a policy than are groups operating
without such strategies. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the coalitions that
say they have had a direct impact on reducing substance abuse have written
strategic plans, compared with the 23% of coalitions that have no written
strategic plan but still had an impact. (See <A HREF="gifs/table17.gif">Table
17</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
This finding is given more weight by the fact that the groups with the most
comprehensive strategies report success in the most areas. We ranked the
coalitions by the number of strategic elements they report in their plans,
and also by the number of successful change efforts in which they are involved.
When we compared the rankings, we found a significant positive correlation
between a higher number of strategic elements and reported involvement in
more successful efforts.<BR>
<BR>
To further test the impact of strategic planning, we linked the strategic
plan elements listed in the questionnaire with activities and involvements
coalitions report in other sections of the questionnaire. For example, we
matched the inclusion of a prevention plan in a coalition's plan with extensive
involvement in prevention programs and influence in increasing prevention
programs by that coalition. In 19 of 23 combinations we tested, the coalitions
that included an element in their strategic plan are extensively engaged
in the related activity or report that they have been very influential in
a related policy change.<BR>
<BR>
Although it is clear that strategy makes a difference, it is also important
to recognize that many coalitions are active in their communities without
having written strategies. They, too, report extensive involvement in many
different activities. For example, 69% of the coalitions without plans report
extensive activity in prevention, and 26% said they are extensively involved
in treatment programs.<BR>
<BR>
Further, many groups with strategies engage in activities that are outside
of their plans. For example, two-thirds of the coalitions are extensively
involved in alcohol issues, but fewer than one-third of them have a specific
written plan dealing with alcohol regulation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Is a Strategy Anyway?</B><BR>
<BR>
A strategic plan usually includes: 
<UL>
<LI>Specific goals for the coalition. For example: &quot;The percentage
of kids who try or use marijuana should go down every year.&quot; 
<LI>Programs that are related to achieving established goals. For example:
student and parent marijuana prevention education, anti-marijuana media
spots, youth-run activities, targeted action against sellers of paraphernalia
and cigarette papers, etc. 
<LI>Ways to monitor progress toward the goals. For example: regular school
surveys that measure use of marijuana by young people in the community.
<LI>A regular public report of the progress made and a description of the
process for reviewing current goals and programs and for adjusting them
to changing circumstances. For example: an annual public hearing by the
city council to review the community strategy and discuss the progress report.
</UL>
<B>Written Strategy Helps Lake Tahoe, Calif., Overcome Substance Abuse</B><BR>
<BR>
Identifying risk factors - and developing ways to overcome them - is what
Tahoe Prevention Network's (TPN) written strategy is all about. This strategy,
which focuses on systemwide change, is based on the results of a community
needs assessment conducted in Lake Tahoe, Calif., in 1990. <BR>
<BR>
The assessment identified four areas that TPN focuses on: community, schools,
family and individuals/peers. For each of these areas, TPN develops projects
that build resiliency to lower the risks of substance abuse. <BR>
<BR>
For instance, in the South Lake Tahoe schools, one risk factor is the high
level of student turnover due to the transient nature of the area. TPN tackled
this problem by creating a welcome center that helps new students quickly
assimilate into school and by requiring parents to meet with social service
providers as part of the enrollment process. There are a total of 25 such
projects within TPN's communitywide written plan. <BR>

You and your colleagues knew that tobacco, drug and alcohol use were on
the rise among youth well before the recent national reports alerted the
American public. And you also know that the only real way to reduce substance
abuse is from the ground up - through the community action and collaboration
that result when communities join together.<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton knows this, too. In an address before 800 community anti-drug
coalition leaders on November 2, 1995, the President urged every community
in America to have a coalition to reduce substance abuse &quot;because we
know that we can make a difference.&quot; He told these anti-drug groups
that &quot;it is simply not true that you cannot whip this problem. You
are living evidence of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Join Together's Third National Survey of Communities Fighting Substance
Abuse demonstrates that the President's faith in coalitions is well placed.
You are driving up citizen participation, encouraging other groups in your
community to work together and changing public policies that are making
a difference.<BR>
<BR>
However, despite these solid gains in the coalition movement - from the
ground up - this survey carries a stern warning. Coalition leaders told
us that many of the institutions that have been traditional pillars of community
efforts - particularly elected officials such as governors, state legislators
and Congress - are now walking away from these problems at the very time
when their leadership is needed most.<BR>
<BR>
You also told us that you need more active partnerships from your local
businesses, clergy, parents and the media to prevent the next generation
from falling victim to drugs.<BR>
<BR>
We all need to challenge our leaders to view their prevention role in the
same way that businesses sell their products. Toy manufacturers know that
they have a new market for their products every several years. Drug pushers
and alcohol and tobacco advertisers also know they have a new market for
their products with each new generation of teens. This means that everyone
involved in the battle against substance abuse - from Congress right on
down to our local business leaders - must renew the commitment to combat
this terrible problem that exists in our own backyard.<BR>

<br><br><CENTER>Executive Summary</CENTER>
</H3>
Almost 200 years ago, Alexis deTocqueville (Alexis deTocqueville, Democracy
in America, transl. George Lawrence (Harper &amp; Row, 1966).) wrote that
one of the unique characteristics of Americans was their willingness to
join together with their neighbors to solve community problems. The Third
National Join Together Survey, conducted from July through September 1995,
shows that this tradition continues to thrive. New coalitions to address
substance abuse, violence, tobacco use and HIV/AIDS have been formed in
every state since 1993. Nineteen hundred and ten community coalitions organized
against drugs participated in the third survey, 73% more than participated
in our 1992 and 1993 surveys combined. <BR>
<BR>
This third survey indicates that community coalitions, especially those
with comprehensive strategies, report that they have had a direct impact
on substance abuse in their communities. In hundreds of cities and towns,
the work of community groups, parents and even young people themselves is
preventing youth from experimenting with alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs.
More than 200,000 volunteers are involved in these efforts. That's the good
news.<BR>
<BR>
The bad news is that substance abuse is getting worse in many communities,
yet the leaders of major government institutions are paying LESS attention
and doing a worse job than they did two years ago to address substance abuse
problems. <BR>
<BR>
The third survey findings are a warning to the nation. Elected officials,
business leaders, clergy, law enforcement personnel, school officials and
others must support the work being done by the community leaders and coalitions
or we will lose another generation of kids to drugs. Community mobilization,
prevention and treatment, as well as effective local law enforcement, must
be expanded or there will be even more drug use and crime in five years
than there is today.<BR>
<BR>
In the first National Join Together Survey, <I>Who Is Really Fighting the
War on Drugs</I> (1992), we documented the existence of community coalitions
that fight substance abuse in the majority of American communities. One
year later, the second national survey, Community Leaders Speak Out on Substance
Abuse, showed that the movement had expanded. We were able to describe the
activities undertaken by coalitions, including the adoption of comprehensive
strategies. Now, in the third survey, we can report the impact that coalitions
say they are having on their communities.<BR>
<BR>
There are two striking ironies in this survey. First, the movement can show
it has had an impact, but many of its leaders report that substance abuse
is getting worse in their communities anyway. Even the most effective coalitions
are only one factor among many community dynamics. The second irony is that
the movement is strong and growing, but it continues to depend heavily on
a federal government that is no longer committed to preventing or reducing
substance abuse in communities. As a consequence, federal funding for one
of the best approaches to prevent and reduce substance abuse - community
mobilization - may be cut down at the very time it is needed most.<BR>
<BR>
Additional principal findings, based on the responses of the <BR>
1910 lead coalitions and described more fully in this report, include the
following: 
<UL>
<LI>More than one-third (36%) of the coalition leaders report that substance
abuse is getting worse in their communities. However, 17% of the coalitions
think the problem is getting better. 
<LI>Coalition leaders who report the situation is improving were more likely
to also report increased citizen mobilization and volunteers, improved access
to treatment, expanded local law enforcement and increased prevention programs.
They also engaged in better coordination among agencies, and adopted comprehensive
strategies. These actions were significantly less likely to have occurred
where leaders reported the situation was getting worse. 
<LI>Many key elected officials are paying LESS attention to this problem
than they were two years ago, according to community coalition leaders.
Fifty-four percent (54%) say that Congress is paying less attention, and
37% say that their governors and state-elected officials are paying less
attention to substance abuse than they did two years ago. In contrast, 27%
say that mayors have increased their attention to substance abuse. 
<LI>Business and labor are doing as bad a job as we reported two years ago.
Coalition leaders rated their performance fair or poor by 79% and 88%, respectively.
The media and religious groups also continue to receive fair or poor marks
by 63% and 69% of the coalition leaders, respectively. 
<LI>Community coalition leaders are virtually unanimous in their support
for specific public policy changes to prevent and reduce substance abuse:
98% support restrictions on alcohol and tobacco advertising; 87% call for
lower legal blood alcohol limits for drivers; 94% want mandatory treatment
instead of prison for nonviolent offenders with drug and alcohol problems;
and 96% support immediate access to drug treatment for everyone who needs
it. Further, 79% oppose decriminalization of drug possession. 
<LI>The current survey shows how essential the federal government's role
has been in fostering the community coalition movement. The federal government
has funded new groups that have engaged new people to tackle this problem
and have taken a fresh community-oriented approach. About half of the community
coalitions receive some federal money directly or indirectly. Only 24% of
coalition funds come from state governments. Recognizing the need for longer-term
stability, a growing number (69%) of coalitions have diversified their funding
base, now relying on more than one funding source.

<br><br><CENTER>Section One: Coalitions - a growing and <BR>
important force in communities</CENTER>
</H3>
Join Together has purposely avoided assigning a single, rigid definition
of the term coalition to reflect the reality that various organizational
structures work effectively to reduce substance abuse in different communities.
In our surveys we have let communities determine whether or not they were
working in a coalition by asking: &quot;Does your organization lead, sponsor
or participate in a task force, consortium or coalition that plans and/or
directs alcohol or other drug-related programs, activities, policies and/or
resource allocation?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
We heard from 4177 organizations as of October 31, 1995 that either participate
in or lead community coalitions. Of these, 1910 respondents identified themselves
as leading or sponsoring community coalitions against substance abuse. This
report is based on the responses of these lead coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
Through our surveys and experience working with these groups across the
country, we are constantly struck by the rich diversity of the community
coalitions that have sprung up across America in recent years. In the Austin
district of Chicago, a community coalition has formed as an offshoot of
the police district there. In San Diego, a veterinarian took the lead in
forming a coalition whose purpose is to fight drugs and also educate and
support local parents. In Oswego, N.Y., a traffic crash that took the life
of a popular high school student was the catalyst to bring parents, teachers,
businesses, the media and youth together to build a safe and drug-free community.
And in Miami, a group of business people were convinced by their spouses
that they had a responsibility to help solve the drug problem. Their effort
became the Miami Coalition for a Drug-Free Community. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Types of Coalitions</B><BR>
<BR>
Coalitions participating in the third survey self-selected into different
types according to the way they described their sponsorship and membership.
Some are community action-based; others are located within government agencies;
and another major subset is found within health or social service settings.
In addition, there are coalitions organized around law enforcement agencies
that were not separately identified as a single type. <A HREF="gifs/table1.gif">Table
1</A> displays the relative distribution of the eight different types of
coalitions that participated in this survey. The box on page 10 provides
examples of each type. These differences are significant indicators of their
focus, their activities and their sources of funds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Do Coalitions Do?</B><BR>
<BR>
Coalitions bring different segments of a community together to solve social
problems. They connect individuals and groups with current information,
including success stories from other communities. As a result, issues can
be more effectively addressed than through single agencies working alone.
Coalitions focus on community environments, whereas many organizations that
participate in coalitions focus their energy on providing services to individuals.
Coalitions focus on systemwide change, whereas their members address specific
elements, such as treatment, shelter or youth employment.<BR>
<BR>
In each of our surveys, we have asked community coalitions to describe their
activities. We also asked them to describe the extent of their involvement
in these activities. The responses of coalitions in the third survey are
summarized in <A HREF="gifs/table2.gif">Table 2</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Coalitions are still much more extensively involved in prevention, public
awareness and systemwide planning than in other activities such as treatment/aftercare,
public policy or public safety. They remain about equally concerned about
alcohol and illicit drug use. Since 1993, there has been an increase in
the percentage of coalitions that are extensively involved in tobacco issues,
from 26% to 36%.<BR>
<BR>
To get a better idea of how coalitions have evolved and to learn the direction
their future programs might take, we asked the respondents to tell us how
their involvement in each of these activities had changed in the past two
years. We were curious to know whether it had increased, decreased or stayed
the same. The answers are also displayed in <A HREF="gifs/table2.gif">Table
2</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Coalitions are expanding their involvement in a broad range of substance
abuse activities without abandoning their core commitment to prevention,
planning and public awareness. For example, 42% of the coalitions increased
their efforts in prevention, whereas only 5% report a decrease in this area.
At the same time, 25% report increased involvement in treatment/aftercare,
and 35% said they had increased their activities in alcohol and drug-related
crime issues.<BR>
<BR>
Only 23% of the coalitions report extensive involvement in public policy
matters. However, 36% report that they have become more involved in public
policy in the past two years. We believe coalitions will become even more
involved in public policy issues in the future because that may be the most
effective way to alter the community environments that affect substance
abuse.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, <A HREF="gifs/table3.gif">Table 3</A> shows that there is a
relationship between what coalitions do and whether they think the substance
abuse situation is getting better or worse. For example, groups who report
the situation improving are more likely to be guided by a written plan,
report better citizen mobilization, more volunteers and an increase in substance
abuse treatment, police enforcement and prevention than those groups that
say the situation is getting worse.<BR>
The Special Case of CSAP-Sponsored Coalitions<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention has played a major role in fostering
the development of community coalitions. Between 1990 and 1995, the agency
invested more than $500 million in developing community-based partnerships.
Five-year grants were made to more than 250 locally based groups to develop
and implement prevention partnerships and strategies. Additional grants
were made to groups that focus on teen pregnancy or high-risk youths, and
for communicating with special populations. Two hundred and ten (210) organizations
in the third Join Together survey identified themselves as CSAP-sponsored
groups. Thus, we can report how this important set of coalitions compares
to the rest of the movement.<BR>
<BR>
The survey found that community coalitions sponsored by CSAP differ in significant
ways from other coalition types: 
<UL>
<LI>CSAP partnerships are more likely to be found in communities of all
sizes than are other types of coalitions. 
<LI>Membership in CSAP partnerships is more likely to have grown in the
past two years than is true for other groups (68% vs. 53%). 
<LI>CSAP partnerships have significantly more volunteers than do other groups.
Fifty-eight percent (58%) have more than 50 volunteers, whereas only 24%
of other lead coalitions report that many volunteers. 
<LI>CSAP partnerships spend twice the amount of money working with other
service agencies than do other community substance abuse groups. Sixty-five
percent (65%) of CSAP coalitions report influencing interorganizational
collaboration versus 47% of other lead coalitions. 
<LI>CSAP partnerships are younger than other groups leading community substance
abuse efforts. 
<LI>Almost half of all CSAP partnerships (46%) are extensively involved
in systemwide planning of substance abuse programs, compared to 40% of other
coalitions. 
<LI>CSAP partnerships are more likely to have a written strategy for their
work than are other groups (76% vs. 70%). 
</UL>
<BR>
The items included in <A HREF="gifs/table4.gif">Table 4</A> suggest two
distinct patterns of coalition activity. The CSAP groups and government
executive coalitions focus on changing community environments and policies,
whereas the government health and not-for-profit led coalitions focus more
on improving services within the existing policy framework.<BR>
<BR>
Although CSAP partnerships are extensively involved in public policy change
at about the same level as other groups leading community efforts (23%),
CSAP coalitions are more likely to have increased their involvement in this
area in the past two years than are other groups (51% vs. 36%). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Funding</B> <BR>
<BR>
Some coalitions have had enormous budget growth, whereas others have lost
core funding, from CSAP or another agency, that has not been replaced. On
average, coalition budgets have not grown since 1993. (See <A HREF="gifs/table5.gif">Table
5</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
The message on funding that comes through clearly from the third survey
is that the coalitions are being asked to accept enormous burdens with small
resource bases. Thirty-five percent (35%) spend less than $50,000 per year;
another 28% spend between $50,001 and $250,000; 15% spend between $250,001
and $500,000; and only 22% spend more than $500,000, and most of these are
government agency coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
Most coalitions are public-private partnerships, but they rely heavily on
government funding. In fact, 79% of them receive at least some funding from
a federal, state or local government agency. (See <A HREF="gifs/table6.gif">Table
6</A> for a description of where the different types of coalitions get their
money.) The federal government's role has been particularly important as
a catalyst for new coalitions. Forty-three percent (43%) of coalitions receive
money from the federal government. The coalitions receiving federal support
are younger and involve more volunteers than those that are more dependent
on state governments or other sources.<BR>
<BR>
This is a disturbing fact when considering that federal funding for substance
abuse prevention has been decreasing. <A HREF="gifs/table7.gif">Table 7</A>,
reprinted with permission of Drug Abuse Update, shows that as annual federal
drug prevention funds have decreased, the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco
by youth has increased.<BR>
<BR>
State governments are the second most important source of funds. Twenty-four
percent (24%) of coalitions receive support from their state government.
Some of this funding comes through grants and contracts for services to
agencies for prevention and treatment, and some of it is in the form of
payments for treatment services provided to individuals with Medicaid coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Local governments are still not a major source of funding for coalitions.
However, they are playing a major role in some coalitions. Twelve percent
(12%) get some money from local government. <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="gifs/table8.gif">Table 8</A> shows that a majority of coalitions
(69%) now receive funds from multiple sources. This is particularly true
for coalitions that provide personal treatment services. <BR>
<BR>
Diversified funding is a major element in long-term survival and stability
for coalitions. The third survey results show that coalitions with more
than one source of funds have taken on a broader array of issues than those
with a single funding source. For instance, coalitions with multiple sources
of funds are more likely to participate in other coalitions within their
communities and are more likely to address treatment and aftercare, early
identification and HIV/AIDS.<BR>
<BR>
Coalitions are finding many creative and unusual sources of additional funding.
Join Together Online offers a Funding News Forum for communities to share
ideas about tapping new funding sources. Here is one example from the <A HREF="/jto/funding/funding.html">Funding
News Forum</A>:

<P><CENTER>Gas Bills Add Up to Big Money in Mobile, Ala.</CENTER>
<P>Fighting drugs in Mobile, Ala., is as easy for residents as paying their
gas bill. That's because the Drug Education Council there asks all 85,000
Mobile Gas Company customers in the area to donate money to them by simply
checking off a box on their monthly gas bills. Businesses are asked to donate
$10 a month and residents $2. These small amounts add up quickly for the
Council; it collects about $45,000 a year, about one-third of its annual
budget. Because this campaign has been such a success, the Council is now
looking to start a similar one with the Mobile Area Water Authority. <BR>

<BR>
<B>Membership and Governance Differences Among Coalitions</B><BR>
<BR>
The persistent differences in activity and funding for the various types
of coalitions caused us to closely examine variation in the membership and
governance of coalitions. <A HREF="gifs/table9.gif">Table 9</A> illustrates
that a majority of all coalitions report that their membership includes
equal representation of lay people and professionals. However, there is
significant variation in membership composition and governance, depending
on the type of coalition. For example, CSAP, community action and non-profit
coalitions are more likely to be governed by an equal representation of
professional and lay members than the other types of coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
A full two-thirds (66%) of CSAP coalitions have equal representation of
citizens and professionals. In contrast, only 41% of government health agency
sponsored coalitions have this type of balanced representation. <BR>
<BR>
These differences matter because coalitions with equal representation are
more likely to have written strategic plans, focus on community change,
report increasing citizen participation in their work, and report a direct
impact on reducing illicit drugs and excessive alcohol use than are coalitions
led mostly by professionals and government officials. <A HREF="gifs/table10.gif">Table
10 </A>displays these key differences.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Will Happen If Federal Funding Is Cut Significantly?</B><BR>
<BR>
As this survey was being completed, federal budget bills in both the House
and the Senate reduced support for drug and alcohol programs by between
72% in the House bill and 35% in the Senate bill. Newspaper reports, such
as in the Wall Street Journal (August 14, 1995), said these actions were
influenced by beer industry lobbyists who oppose the work of CSAP.<BR>
<BR>
In a survey in February 1995, Join Together asked community coalition leaders
what they thought would happen in their community if federal funds for crime
and drug prevention are substantially reduced. More than 90% of the 1,250
coalition leaders who participated in that survey predicted that drug- and
alcohol-related crime in their communities would increase if funds were
cut.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalitions of Government Officials</B> <BR>
<BR>
One hundred and six coalitions of various types report that they are composed
mostly of government officials. There is substantial evidence throughout
the survey that these coalitions have a different perspective on their communities
than other coalitions, and that they may work in greater isolation than
their counterparts. For example, they consistently give government agencies,
especially the courts, higher performance ratings than do other coalitions.<BR>
<BR>
We are particularly struck by the finding that government-led coalitions
are less likely to have written strategic plans than are partnership-type
coalitions. Most government agencies are bound by annual appropriation cycles
and existing legislative mandates. Broad strategic planning is beyond the
scope of many specialized public agencies, even when they are working in
coalitions with other agencies. We believe this finding strengthens the
argument that communities should have public-private strategic partnerships.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Multiple Coalitions in Communities</B><BR>
<BR>
It is unrealistic to assume that there will be only one overriding coalition
in each community. Multiple overlapping coalitions are likely to be the
most common pattern, even in relatively small towns. More than one group
identified itself as a coalition against substance abuse in a majority of
communities of all sizes in the third national survey. In fact, 86% of all
coalitions in the survey report that they participate in other community
coalitions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Multiple Coalitions Are Found in Some Communities</B><BR>
<BR>
In communities where there are several community coalitions working on substance
abuse, these groups often have different memberships and purposes. For example,
in Dothan, Ala., a city of 55,000 people, two groups identified themselves
as lead coalitions in the third survey. One was a school-based coalition
and the other was a community-based group working out of the Boys' Club.
In Brooklyn, N.Y., we heard from eight lead coalitions. Most of them cover
a specific neighborhood, but others are school, religious or health-based
coalitions that operate throughout the community. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalitions Have Become a More Common Way to Address Social Issues</B><BR>
<BR>
We have always believed that communities that had successfully fought substance
abuse through the efforts of a coalition would also form additional coalitions
to address other important issues. We asked survey participants if they
knew about the emergence of any new coalitions in their communities to address
substance abuse, tobacco use, violence or HIV/AIDS. The response was overwhelming.
(See <A HREF="gifs/table11.gif">Table 11</A>.) During the past two years,
new community coalitions to address major social problems have been established
in every state in the nation.

<H3>
<br><br><CENTER>Section Three: Community Report Card - <BR>
how coalitions rate the performance of <BR>
major community institutions</CENTER>
</H3>
Although citizens have become more involved and easier to mobilize against
substance abuse in the past two years, the federal and state governments
and local school systems receive significantly lower performance ratings
from the 1910 lead coalitions in our survey. The scores for all other institutions
remain unchanged from their ratings in earlier surveys. The national picture,
however, masks considerable change within specific communities. <BR>
<BR>
All community institutions must be involved if permanent progress against
substance abuse is to occur. Therefore, we have asked community coalition
leaders, in each of our surveys, to assess the current efforts of major
institutions in addressing substance abuse in their communities. Respondents
could give a grade of poor, fair, good or excellent. Table 18 summarizes
the key responses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Elected Officials Can Make a Difference</B><BR>
<BR>
Elected officials are reported to have increased their attention to substance
abuse issues in those communities where the situation is reported to be
getting better. Conversely, elected officials are more likely to have decreased
their attention in communities where the situation is reported as getting
worse. <BR>
<BR>
Local law enforcement and schools continue to get the highest marks in the
survey, despite the decline in the positive ratings for the schools. The
results suggest that community leaders give their local schools credit for
remaining involved in substance abuse but are critical because substance
use among teens is increasing in most communities. It is also true that
most school systems have had less money to spend on drug and alcohol prevention
in the past two years. Community leaders see and report the deterioration
in the number of programs. <BR>
<BR>
Business, labor, religious, civic and fraternal organizations get the same
poor ratings they received in our past surveys. Fewer than 6% of community
coalition leaders believe these groups are doing an excellent job in their
towns, whereas up to 43% give these groups a poor rating. <BR>
<BR>
In past surveys, however, government institutions received more excellent
than poor ratings. That has now reversed for the state and federal governments,
as well as the courts. For example, 8% of coalition leaders in this latest
survey give the federal government an excellent rating, whereas 17% think
its performance has been poor. <BR>
<BR>
The trend among government agencies toward poor performance against substance
abuse is confirmed by another set of questions in this survey. We asked
if certain elected officials are more or less interested in substance abuse
issues now than two years ago. More than half (54%) of the coalition leaders
believe Congress is less interested and more than one-third (37%) think
state elected officials are less interested now than two years ago. Also,
37% think their governors are less interested in substance abuse now than
in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
As a final check on this disturbing finding, we compare the ratings provided
by the 652 coalitions that participated in both the 1993 survey and this
latest survey. These coalitions also give lower ratings to the state and
federal governments and the schools this time. <BR>
<BR>
The national picture described above masks considerable change over the
past two years within specific communities. An analysis of the ratings provided
by the coalitions in both the second and third surveys shows that local
action in some communities has improved although it has deteriorated in
others. For example, 16% of these 652 coalitions improve the ratings by
two or more categories they give to local law enforcement, whereas 24% have
lowered the score by two or more categories. The lesson is clear. Leadership
and participation must continually be renewed. If an especially active (or
difficult) official leaves, coalitions have an opportunity to get the new
official fully committed.<BR>
<BR>
More than half (54%) of the coalition leaders believe Congress is less interested
and more than one-third (37%) think state elected officials are less interested
in substance abuse now than two years ago.

<H3>
<br><BR><CENTER>Section Four: Public Policy <BR>
Views of Coalition Leaders</CENTER>
</H3>
The leaders of the nation's movement against substance abuse have a clear
and sometimes unanimous view of the policies they need in order to be more
effective. The answers they give to the public policy choices listed in
the third survey show they believe a broad-based approach is needed. They
do not believe that a policy focusing on only one element will work. They
want their own prevention work supported by strong regulatory policies.
They favor expanded local law enforcement, and even stronger illicit drug
and alcohol laws. However, these leaders are just as firmly committed to
providing treatment to people with drug and alcohol problems. Finally, they
are willing to accept additional responsibility for reducing substance abuse
in their communities, and they urge the federal government to revamp its
spending priorities to make that possible. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Policies to Support Prevention</B><BR>
<BR>
Community coalition leaders believe their prevention work must be supported
by public policies that send strong and consistent social messages against
illicit drugs and excessive alcohol use. Ninety-eight percent (98%) favor
additional restrictions on alcohol and tobacco advertising. They do not
believe industry claims that marketing is not aimed at young people. Ninety-five
percent (95%) want increased taxes on alcohol because higher prices will
reduce use by young people. Low beer prices sometimes make it cheaper for
teens to drink beer than soft drinks, and this may be a subtle message of
encouragement that higher taxes will counteract. Eighty percent (80%) support
random drug testing in the workplace. This is important because a majority
of drug users are employed. Fear of losing a job is a strong social message
that drug use and drinking at work are unacceptable. A majority (70%) support
similar drug testing in the schools to send the same message. <A HREF="gifs/table19.gif">Table
19 </A>on the next page highlights the policy changes coalition leaders
support.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Law Enforcement Policies</B><BR>
<BR>
Community coalition leaders firmly oppose legalizing drugs. A full 95% support
increased local police enforcement of drug, alcohol and tobacco laws; 79%
oppose decriminalizing possession and 87% oppose decriminalizing sales of
currently illicit drugs; 82% favor increased penalties for sales of illicit
drugs; and 73% want stronger penalties for possession. <A HREF="gifs/table20.gif">Table
20</A> shows policies coalitions oppose.<BR>
<BR>
Ninety-seven percent (97%) support legislation to make it illegal for adolescents
to drive after drinking. Twenty-eight states have already enacted this law,
and a federal law has now been adopted that will force the rest of the states
to enact similar limits. Eighty-seven percent (87%) also favor lowering
legal blood alcohol limits for adults. Thirteen states have lowered the
legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) standard from .10% to .08% - the
equivalent of four drinks in an hour on an empty stomach for a 155-pound
man. No state has yet to adopt the .05% standard used in Australia, New
Zealand and several European countries.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Policies to Support Treatment</B><BR>
<BR>
Coalition leaders' support for strong law enforcement should not be seen
as a &quot;lock them up and throw away the key&quot; approach. In fact,
support for access to drug and alcohol treatment is stronger in the third
survey than in earlier surveys. Fifty five percent (55%) of the community
coalition leaders strongly support that &quot;treatment be available for
everyone who needs it, immediately.&quot; This is up from 47% in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
Ninety-four percent (94%) also believe that treatment should be mandatory
for non-violent offenders who have drug or alcohol problems. They know that
drug offenders will be returning to the community and they want them back
- treated. Community coalition leaders know that offenders who receive treatment
are far less likely to return to crime than are those who go through the
criminal justice system without getting substance abuse treatment. <BR>
<BR>
Sixty-eight percent (68%) of community coalition leaders also favor &quot;needle
exchange&quot; programs for street addicts to prevent the spread of HIV.
They do not see support for this as contradicting their strong enforcement
preferences or their opposition to legalization.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Accepting Responsibility</B><BR>
<BR>
Over half (54%) of the community coalition leaders are willing to work with
others in their communities in a new youth development block grant proposed
by Congress that would replace current categorical prevention programs.
If such a program is adopted, 79% believe it should go directly to communities,
not to state or local government agencies exclusively.<BR>
<BR>
If community coalition leaders were in charge of the fight against substance
abuse, they would spend the money differently. We asked coalition leaders
how they would spend the federal anti-drug budget. They would make a dramatic
shift away from international interdiction toward prevention, treatment
and support for local law enforcement. <A HREF="gifs/table21.gif">Tables
21</A> and <A HREF="gifs/table2.gif">22</A> clearly show these differences
by comparing the fiscal year 1995 federal budget allocation with the budget
allocation preferred by community coalition leaders.

The findings of this third survey carry several important messages: 
<UL>
<LI>First, they tell funders of community-based substance abuse coalitions
how important it is to require these groups to have written strategies.
<LI>Second, the results should serve to remind coalitions to take an active
role in shaping public policy on the local, state and federal levels. 
<LI>Third, it is clear that government officials - particularly members
of Congress, governors and state elected officials - need to take a much
more active role in listening - and responding - to coalition leaders. 
<LI>Finally, our findings are a call to action to businesses, the media
and clergy to get more involved in anti-substance abuse coalition efforts
in their communities. Their participation matters. It really can make a
difference.

The methodology for Join Together's Third National Survey was similar to
that of our 1992 and 1993 surveys. We replicated our initial efforts at
attempting to identify every community coalition in the nation by contacting
the following agencies and organizations in every state. We asked them to
provide us with a list of all task forces, coalitions, consortia, partnerships
and citizen action groups that they work with to address substance abuse
problems. They include: 
<UL>
<LI>State alcohol and drug agencies 
<LI>State Departments of Public Safety 
<LI>State juvenile justice agencies 
<LI>State education agencies 
<LI>State Departments of Mental Health and Mental Retardation 
<LI>State health and social services agencies 
<LI>State alcohol and drug services 
<LI>State Highway Safety Agencies 
<LI>National groups, such as MADD and NHTSA 
</UL>
<BR>
In July 1995, we mailed 31,500 surveys to organizations that were identified
by these agencies and the Join Together database of community coalitions.
One follow-up mailing was done for the cohort that participated in both
previous surveys to increase their response rate and to provide us with
an opportunity to denote trends. See the next page for a copy of the questionnaire.<BR>
<BR>
This report, however, is based primarily on the 1910 agencies that report
leading or sponsoring anti-substance abuse coalitions as opposed to agencies
that participate in coalitions headed by other groups. <BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Join Together Resources as of December 1995</B></CENTER>
<P>Join Together has a number of resources available to assist coalitions
and other community-based efforts to prevent and reduce substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<B>General Coalition Information</B><BR>
<BR>
Working from your own desk, Join Together Online (available on the Internet)
will help you identify and work with other communities fighting substance
abuse across the nation. Through Join Together Online you can access daily
summaries of major newspaper and wire service articles about substance abuse;
find facts, coalition stories and ideas for strengthening your organization
and measuring its success; and join a discussion group to exchange ideas
and get answers to questions from other coalitions and experts in the field.<BR>
A National Events Calendar will let you search for events locally or nationally
or contribute your own. You can also search our database of over 60,000
people to find others in your town, state or anywhere in the United States
with whom you can collaborate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Funding Information</B><BR>
<BR>
Join Together Online has a special section devoted to <A HREF="/jto/funding/funding.html">Funding
News</A>. Updated daily, it gives you access to the full text of Federal
Register announcements, foundation profiles and tips on finding grants.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Coalition Impact</B><BR>
<BR>
How Do We Know We Are Making a Difference? A Community Substance Abuse Indicators
Handbook provides measures for communities to assess substance abuse problems.
These indicators can be powerful tools in local efforts to reduce substance
abuse. The first copy of this 86-page manual is free; additional copies
are $10 each.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Public Policy Materials</B><BR>
<BR>
Join Together has convened five national panels to examine how public policies
can be improved to support community-based efforts to reduce substance abuse.
Copies of the reports outlining recommendations made by these panels and
action steps that communities can take are available. Your community may
want to adopt a similar format to address your own policy issues. 
<UL>
<LI>Save Lives! Report, Recommendations and Action Steps of the Join Together
Public Policy on Underage Access to Alcohol-updated in 1995 
<LI>Health Reform for Communities: Recommendations on Financing Substance
Abuse Services 
<LI>Alcohol and Drug Abuse in America: Policies for Prevention and Community
Action Guide 
</UL>
Two other reports are being prepared as this survey is being published.
The first outlines recommendations and action steps that communities can
implement to make policies pertaining to the criminal justice system more
supportive of efforts to reduce substance abuse. The second report details
suggested policy changes and related action steps to make block grant policies
more supportive of community anti-substance abuse initiatives. Both reports
will be available for distribution in early 1996.

You and your colleagues knew that tobacco, drug and alcohol use were on
the rise among youth well before the recent national reports alerted the
American public. And you also know that the only real way to reduce substance
abuse is from the ground up - through the community action and collaboration
that result when communities join together.<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton knows this, too. In an address before 800 community anti-drug
coalition leaders on November 2, 1995, the President urged every community
in America to have a coalition to reduce substance abuse &quot;because we
know that we can make a difference.&quot; He told these anti-drug groups
that &quot;it is simply not true that you cannot whip this problem. You
are living evidence of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Join Together's Third National Survey of Communities Fighting Substance
Abuse demonstrates that the President's faith in coalitions is well placed.
You are driving up citizen participation, encouraging other groups in your
community to work together and changing public policies that are making
a difference.<BR>
<BR>
However, despite these solid gains in the coalition movement - from the
ground up - this survey carries a stern warning. Coalition leaders told
us that many of the institutions that have been traditional pillars of community
efforts - particularly elected officials such as governors, state legislators
and Congress - are now walking away from these problems at the very time
when their leadership is needed most.<BR>
<BR>
You also told us that you need more active partnerships from your local
businesses, clergy, parents and the media to prevent the next generation
from falling victim to drugs.<BR>
<BR>
We all need to challenge our leaders to view their prevention role in the
same way that businesses sell their products. Toy manufacturers know that
they have a new market for their products every several years. Drug pushers
and alcohol and tobacco advertisers also know they have a new market for
their products with each new generation of teens. This means that everyone
involved in the battle against substance abuse - from Congress right on
down to our local business leaders - must renew the commitment to combat
this terrible problem that exists in our own backyard.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>SAMPLE OP-ED</CENTER>
</H3>
You can tailor the following op-ed with local examples and statistics and
send it to newspapers in your area. <BR>
<BR>
KEY INSTITUTIONS NEED TO JOIN ANTI-SUBSTANCE ABUSE EFFORTS        <BR>
<BR>
Missing in action: that's the status of elected officials, businesses, labor,
media and religious groups in the nation's war against drugs.        <BR>
<BR>
This finding comes from a recent national survey of 4,200 community coalitions
fighting substance abuse. When asked to rate the performance of such key
institutions, respondents said they are NOT as involved in anti-substance
abuse efforts as they could be.        <BR>
<BR>
This is alarming news; especially since alcohol and drug problems are on
the rise in communities like ours across the country.        <BR>
<BR>
In Stamford (replace with your community's name),  many programs are hard
at work battling substance abuse and related problems -- such as violent
crime, fatal car crashes, domestic violence, homelessness and HIV infection.
But these programs can not win this battle without support from other groups.
        <BR>
<BR>
Some of the ways you can help: ask your company to start a drug-free workplace
program; help schools bring kids and parents together to talk openly about
alcohol and drugs; write to legislators demanding they make substance abuse
problems a priority; ask your church or temple to sponsor events to raise
money for substance abuse programs; brainstorm with neighbors about ways
to keep your street drug-free; ask the media to recognize outstanding people
in the communitywho are making a difference; or volunteer a few hours a
week to help a local substance abuse organization.        <BR>
For more information about how to get involved in local efforts, call the
Stamford Substance Abuse Coalition at  (203) 555-1234. (Replace with your
organization's name and number).<BR>

<B>RESPONSIBLE DRIVERS ARE KEY TO HIGHWAY SAFETY THIS HOLIDAY SEASON</B>
	

<P>	The holidays are a time of joy for most people -- but for the relatives of people killed in fatal drunk driving crashes, this time of year is tinged with sorrow.<p>

Last year, 17,461 Americans died as a result of alcohol and drug-related drunk driving crashes, and 5,000 of them were under the age of 25, according to the National Highway Safety Administration.<p>

What makes these deaths especially tragic is the fact that many of them could have been prevented. Research has shown that states with tougher drunk driving laws have a lower death rate due to alcohol-related car crashes than states that do not crack down as hard on drunk drivers. <p>

In fact, a study published in the November-December issue of Public Health Reports, called &quot;Lower Legal Blood Alcohol Limits for Young Drivers,&quot; found that 375 fatal car crashes could be avoided each year if all states adopted laws making it illegal for people under the age of 21 to drive after drinking. <p>

The study found that the proportion of single vehicle fatal crashes at night declined by 20 percent in states that had lowered their legal Blood Alcohol Content limit (the amount of alcohol a person can legally have in his or her body when driving) to .00 or .02 for drivers under age 21 (Zero Tolerance Laws).<p>

Alcohol-related car crashes cost the nation $46 billion annually, according to NHTSA. These costs are associated with lost productivity, medical costs and property damage.<p>

And there is no way to put a dollar amount on the lifetime trauma endured by the family members of victims killed or injured in alcohol-related car crashes.<p>

That's why it is so important that residents urge their legislators to implement tougher BAC laws for all drivers in our state. <p>

In addition, there are several other steps that residents can take to prevent any unnecessary deaths in our community this holiday season.<p>

First, people should educate themselves and others about the risks of drinking and driving. They should also be responsible party hosts and offer non-alcoholic beverages to drivers. In addition, they should prevent any intoxicated guests from getting behind the wheel of a car. Finally, parents should not serve alcohol to minors, and should come up with an arrangement for their children to call home if they -- or someone else who is driving them -- has been drinking.<p>

If everyone makes the effort to be a responsible driver and host, we can significantly reduce the risk of deaths from drunk driving accidents in our community this holiday season.<p>

<P>
Dear <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Reporter" VALUE="Editor" SIZE=35>:<p>


<P>Each holiday season, lives are tragically lost as the result of fatal drunk driving crashes.
You can help prevent more residents of our community from becoming a statistic by helping to raise public awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving.


<P>Enclosed is an Op-Ed alerting readers to the problem of drinking and driving and to urge them to support lower legal Blood Alcohol Content levels in our state, which have been proven to save lives. In addition, the Op-Ed provides them with some concrete steps they can take -- such as educating themselves and others about the dangers of drunk driving, becoming responsible drivers and responsible party hosts, and encouraging parents not to provide alcohol to minors. 


<P>Please feel free to call me at <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Phone" VALUE="Phone number"> if you need help getting in touch with some local prevention programs.<p>

<P>Thank you for helping to make our streets and highways safer for everyone.

<P>Sincerely,
<p>

<center><H3>Tobacco and Youth</H3>
<P><H2>THE FACT IS. . .</H2> <BR></center>
<BR>
--Each day, three thousand youth in the United States become regular smokers
- that's more than 1 million each year. Many of these youth will die prematurely
from smoking-related illnesses. 1 <BR>
<BR>
--Smoking among eighth graders increased by 30% between 1991 - 1994. 2 <BR>
<BR>
--Although it is now illegal in all states to sell cigarettes to persons
under age 18, kids have easy access to tobacco products. It has been estimated
that underage youth can purchase cigarettes successfully 70%-80% of the
time over the counter, and 90%-100% of the time through vending machines.
3 <BR>
<BR>
--Each year, merchants illegally sell minors 947 million packs of cigarettes
and 26 million containers of spitting tobacco. These products are worth
$1.26 billion, and they generate $221 million in tobacco industry profits.
4 <BR>
<BR>
--About 80 percent of adolescent smokers report having at least one close
friend who smokes. And about half of adolescent smokers have parents who
smoke. 5 <BR>
<BR>
--Cigarettes are seen as a &quot;gateway drug&quot; meaning cigarette use
is likely to precede the use of alcohol or illegal drugs. One recent study
found that current youth smokers, aged 12-21 years, were three times more
likely to have used alcohol within the past 30 days, and were thirteen times
more likely to have used marijuana than youth who had never smoked. 6 <BR>
<BR>
--Among young people, those with poorer grades and lower self images are
most likely to start using tobacco. 7 <BR>
<BR>
--Most young people who have smoked as few as 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
are addicted to nicotine and report that they want to quit but are unable
to do so. 8 <BR>
<BR>
--Since the start of the &quot;Old Joe&quot; campaign in 1988, Camel's share
of the illegal children's market has increased from 0.5% to 32.8%, representing
about $476 million in annual sales in 1991. (R.J. Reynolds spends an estimated
$22 million a year on Camel ads.) 9 <BR>

Dear 
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Reporter" VALUE="Reporter's Name" SIZE=35>
:<br>


<P>In recent months, you may have heard about several national and state 
studies that show that providing alcohol and drug treatment is an effective 
way to reduce health care costs and crime in our communities.


<P>As the holiday season approaches, alcohol and drug problems are often 
exacerbated for many people. Knowing that treatment does work -- and 
knowing where to find it -- is an important first step for many of your 
readers who have alcohol or drug problems.


<P>This is a great time for you to do a feature or even a series on various 
alcohol and drug treatment options available in the area and show how they 
help people to get their lives back on track.


<P>Some angles you might take include looking at the difference between public 
and private treatment services and/or inpatient and outpatient services. 
You might also speak with people who have completed treatment to see the 
impact it had on their lives, as well as with business owners and human 
resource specialists who refer employees with addiction to treatment. (You 
can add or substitute other story ideas here.)


<P>I can help you with these and other facets of stories you may want to 
write. Enclosed is a fact sheet with some key findings from the recent 
studies I mentioned.  I will contact you next week to follow up.


<P>Sincerely,


<P>

<TITLE>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OLDER AMERICANS: SAMPLE OP-ED</TITLE>

<H3>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OLDER AMERICANS</H3>
<H2>SAMPLE OP-ED</H2>
</center>

<P><I>You can submit the following Op-Ed as is to your community newspaper or localize it with examples and statistics of substance abuse among the elderly in your city or town. You can sign this with your name or ask one of your board members to sign it.</I>

<hr>

<P><H3>SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS DON'T DISCRIMINATE BY AGE</H3>
		Many Americans look forward to their "golden years" -- that time when they can retire from work and concentrate on leisure activities. But for some, those years are lost in an alcohol or prescription-drug induced blur.<br>
	People over age 65 make up about 12 percent of the United States population, but this age group consumes more than 30 of all prescription drugs and 70 percent of over-the-counter remedies. And the risk of becoming dependent on some of these medications is high. Changes in absorption, distribution and metabolism as people age can alter a body's reaction to such substances.<br>
	The same is true with alcohol. Diminished liver function means that older adults get higher blood alcohol levels than younger counterparts who consume the same amount of alcohol. And people with untreated alcohol addictions will carry these addictions into old age. In addition, experts say that at least 15 percent of older Americans will develop a drinking problem when they retire or when a spouse dies.<br>
	Such addictions prove costly to the United States. Medicare spends more than $230 million a year for alcohol-related problems. And a typical hospital stay for alcohol abuse costs more than $4,500 a year, according to Medicare figures. Overall, 23 percent of Medicare costs are attributable to alcohol, drugs or tobacco addictions. And a recent study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York estimates that more than $1 trillion will be drained from the Medicare system by problems related to substance abuse.<br>
	While taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for such costs, older addicts also suffer by having a severely reduced quality of life. This is why it is essential we help treat these addictions, rather than just paying the price for them. We need to ensure that substance abuse treatment is available for every person who needs it -- whether it is a 16-year-old daughter or a 75-year-old grandfather.<br>
	People must take the opportunity to let their legislators know that providing substance abuse treatment for all Americans -- including older Americans -- is a crucial component of health care.<br>

<H2><CENTER>Youth Acces to Tobacco<BR>
SAMPLE PITCH LETTER </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Dear Editor: <BR>
<BR>
As you know, it is illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase tobacco. Nonetheless,
kids in our community are increasingly beginning to smoke cigarettes by
the ages of 12 and 13. And cigarette smoking is on the rise among kids in
communities like ours across the nation. In fact, a recent University of
Michigan study recently found that smoking by eighth graders has increased
by 30 percent over the past three years. This finding tells us that we need
to do a better job of raising public awareness about the dangers of tobacco
use and in discouraging retailers from illegally selling to youth. <BR>
<BR>
To determine just how available tobacco products are in our neighborhoods,
citizens will be coming together on Saturday, Oct. 7, to count the number
of outlets (stores, gas stations, vending machines, etc.) that sell tobacco
within a quarter-mile radius of Kendall Middle School. (REPLACE WITH YOUR
OWN DETAILS.) Many of these places are easily accessible to kids on their
way to and from school. <BR>
<BR>
We invite you and a photographer from your newspaper to join our efforts.
We will be meeting in front of Kendall at 10 a.m. (REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN
DETAILS.) Our findings will be of great interest to your readers, many of
whom have children and grandchildren in our community. We need your help
in getting the message out that smoking is dangerous to our youth. We also
encourage you to call on retailers to take steps to prevent kids from being
able to buy tobacco products. <BR>
<BR>
I can also put you in touch with some students, parents, former smokers
and health care workers if you are interested in doing a feature or a series
on kids who smoke and why, as well as the risks of such behavior. <BR>
<BR>
We will be I will contact you next week to follow up on this. In the meantime,
if you have any questions, you can call me at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER). <BR>
<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>PROVIDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IS COST EFFECTIVE</B>



<P>Every single day, our televisions and newspapers are filled with the 
details of brutal murders, fatal car crashes, incidents of domestic 
violence and child abuse, babies born addicted to crack, and increasing 
numbers of people infected with the deadly HIV.   


<P>While most people are shocked and saddened by these tragedies, few ever 
stop to consider their underlying cause.


<P>Yet, my colleagues and I working in the substance abuse field know all too 
well that the roots of these and other equally devastating social ills can 
often be linked to alcohol and drug addictions.


<P>Today, more than 18 million alcohol abusers and five million drug abusers 
in the United States need treatment, according to a study done last year by 
Brandeis University. And this abuse dramatically affects us all -- in lives 
needlessly lost, gang violence in our neighborhoods, decreased productivity 
in our workplaces, drunk driving crashes on our roads, more hospital 
emergency room visits in our communities and higher health care costs that 
we ultimately pay for out of our own pockets.


<P>This problem, indeed, belongs to each of us!


<P>Over the past year, the nation has been engaged in a debate over health 
care reform and we have heard many people say that we can't afford to pay 
for treatment of alcohol and drug addictions under a national health plan.


<P>But the truth is -- we can't afford NOT to pay for these services.


<P>Several credible studies have been released to illustrate that providing 
substance abuse treatment actually costs LESS than paying for the related 
social problems that result when addictions are ignored.


<P>In fact, a study of California alcohol and drug treatment services found 
that for every dollar invested in treatment, taxpayers save $7.14 in future 
costs, primarily due to a decrease in crime.
        

<P>Nationally, the cost of untreated addiction runs as high as $172 billion a 
year, yet dollars directed to prevention and treatment equal less than one 
percent of this amount, according to researchers at Rutgers University. And 
these researchers estimate that untreated alcoholics incur health care 
costs that are 100 percent higher than those of nonalcoholics. 


<P>And as the addiction progresses, this number keeps rising. In fact, in the 
last 12 months before an alcoholic seeks treatment, his or her health care 
costs tend to be close to 300 percent higher than that of someone without a 
substance abuse problem.


<P>That's why treating the addiction proves to be so cost-effective. The 
Rutgers study found that providing treatment results in a number of 
cost-savings in the health care and work arenas-- including a significant 
reduction in sick-claim benefits, and a decrease of more than 50 percent in 
both absenteeism and in days lost to disability.


<P>For instance, Minnesota estimates that it saves $22 million in annual 
health care costs by providing treatment for drug addicts. And in Ohio, 
providing treatment decreased worker absenteeism by 89 percent, tardiness 
by 92 percent and on-the-job injuries by 57 percent.


<P>These successes -- and others like them in other states throughout the 
country-- are compiled in a report released earlier this fall by the 
National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Directors called Invest in 
Treatment: It Works! 


<P>In every example included in this report, the outcome was the same: 
investing in alcohol and drug treatment dramatically saves money.


<P>We can use these successes from other states to encourage our legislators 
to take a closer look at the public treatment system and ensure it is 
accessible to all Americans who need it.  It is clear that our money is 
better spent on expanding substance abuse services than on paying for the 
crime, violence, cirrhosis, HIV and other health and social costs that 
often result.


<P>Maybe then there would be more room for positive stories on the 6 o'clock 
news and in the daily paper.

<H2>Myths And Truths About Alcohol And Driving</H2></center>


<P>
Myths and misconceptions about alcohol and its effects on safe driving are widespread. Knowing the truth could mean the difference between life and death this holiday season. You may want to distribute the following information through your media campaign, organizational newsletter and church bulletins to better educate the public about the effects of alcohol. Your local newspaper may also be interested in running this information.
<hr>

<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Myth:</B> 	Alcohol is a stimulant.<br>
<B>Fact: </B>		Alcohol is a depressant. It acts on the central nervous system like an anesthetic to lower or depress the activity of the brain.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;Drinking coffee sobers me up.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B> 		Coffee can't rid your system of alcohol. It just makes you a nervous, wide-awake drunk. Only time reverses the impairment.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> &quot;I always stay away from the hard stuff.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B> 		Alcohol is alcohol. Beer has the same affect as straight scotch. One 12-ounce  glass of beer has as much alcohol as a 1.5-ounce shot of whiskey or a 5-ounce  glass of wine.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;I'm bigger so I can handle my liquor better than other people.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B> 		Size is only one factor in how much you can drink. Metabolism, amount of rest  and food intake all play a part in how you handle liquor. Impairment in motor  reflexes and judgment can begin with the first drink.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;Once I roll down my car window, I'm okay to drive.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B>		No amount of fresh, chilly air can reverse impairment. You gain nothing by 	 rolling down a window or turning on the air conditioner.<p>


<B>Myth:</B> 	&quot;I just drive slower after drinking.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact: </B>		Many people believe that by driving more slowly, they can compensate for being  impaired. Actually, this can be very dangerous. The truth is, drunk drivers are  dangerous at any speed.<p>


<B>Myth:</B>	&quot;All I have to do is splash my face with cold water.&quot;<br>
<B>Fact:</B>		Cold water or even a cold shower won't sober you up or make you a safer driver.<p>

<H3><CENTER>FACT SHEET: THE NATION'S SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
--Each year, there are more deaths and disabilities from  substance abuse
than from any other preventable cause. Of the two million U.S. deaths each
year, one in four is attributable to alcohol, illicit drug or tobacco use.
(Substance Abuse: The Nation's Number One Health Problem, Brandeis University,
1993.)<BR>
<BR>
--Nearly one of every four Americans is directly affected by the alcohol
or drugdependency of a family member, friend or co-worker. (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
--The latest National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found: 
<UL>
<LI>An estimated 13 million Americans use illegal drugs, and 10 million
use marijuana. 
<LI>13 million Americans had five or more drinks in one sitting on five
ormore occasions in one month. 60 million Americans -- including 4 million
people aged 12 to 17 -- smoke cigarettes. (1994 National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse.)
</UL>
<BR>
--Over a third of all eighth graders have used some illicit drug, including
inhalants, while over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50 percent
of all 12th graders have done so. (Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency
and Prevention, 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
--Fewer youth today than in 1992 believe that marijuana use is harmful to
their health. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
--During the mid-1980s, the public began to understand the devastation of
drug use and addiction. Nationwide, drug prevention efforts came together
in schools,media, the workplace, and communities, resulting in dramatic
shifts in attitudestoward drugs and declines of more than 50 percent in
the number of new triers and non-addicted users in all segments of the population.
(Partnership for a Drug-Free America, 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
--Despite this success, however, diminishing national leadership, public
focus and resource allocation threaten future success. (Partnership for
a Drug-Free America, 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
--The United States spends about $268 billion on alcohol and drug problems
a year -- that's $675 for every man, woman and child in the country. (Lewis,
Ed.D., Social and Health Economic Services, Ltd., 1992)<BR>
<BR>
--The amount this country spends of health care each year could be reduced
by $90.4 billion if alcohol and drug problems were prevented before they
started. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration, 1992.)<BR>
<BR>
--Each day 800,000 people receive services in a special alcohol or drug
program.Nevertheless, only about one-fourth of those needing alcohol or
drug treatment get it. (Substance Abuse: The Nation's Number One Health
Problem, Brandeis University, 1993.)<BR>
<BR>
--Alcohol-related driving crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescentsand
young adults in the United States. In fact, in 1993 approximately three
million people were injured in motor vehicle crashes and close to 40,000
died. (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1994.)<BR>
<BR>
--More than 1.7 million people are the victims of alcohol-related crimes
in the United States each year. And over 4,000 people die as a result of
alcohol-related violence annually. (National Public Research Institute,
1994)<BR>
<BR>
--As many as 83 percent of arrestees in the United States had used illicit
substances within the 48 hours prior to their arrest. (Drug Use Forecasting,
1993.)<BR>
<BR>
--About 70 percent of all illicit drug users are employed. (U.S. Department
of Labor, 1990.)<BR>
<BR>
--Close to 35 percent of all AIDS cases are associated with drug injection.
In addition, more than 80 percent of all HIV-positive women inject drugs
or have sexual partners who do. (Center for Disease Control, 1992.)<BR>

<H3>Youth Access to Tobacco</H3>
<H2>SAMPLE OP-ED</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>You can tailor the following Op-Ed with your findings about tobacco availability in your community and submit it to your local newspaper. Sign this with your name or ask an influential board members to author it.
<hr><br>

<P>TOBACCO PRODUCTS MAY BE TOO AVAILABLE TO YOUTH


<P>What is it about smoker's breath, nicotine-stained teeth and a hacking cough that draws more than one million kids each year to start smoking? 
	

<P>Perhaps it is the easy availability of tobacco in places near our schools that makes it easy for teens to try cigarettes. Consider the alarming fact that in the quarter-mile radius around Kendall Middle School there are 12 stores and vending machines selling tobacco. (REPLACE WITH YOUR LOCAL DATA.) This sends a subtle message to our youth that smoking for them is socially acceptable. And many of those who smoke will die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses.
	

<P>It is illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase tobacco, yet studies have found that this law is rarely a deterrent to keep youth from buying. The fact is that youth can purchase cigarettes successfully 70%-80% of the time over the counter, and 90%-100% of the time through vending machines. And each year merchants illegally sell 947 million packs of cigarettes to minors and 26 million containers of spitting tobacco. These products are worth $1.26 billion, and they generate $221 million in tobacco industry profits.
	

<P>The latest Monitoring the Future Study (released by the University of Michigan in July) found that smoking has increased by 30 percent among eighth graders over the past four years. This sends a clear signal that we need to reinvigorate our efforts to educate youth about the dangers of tobacco use and also to make sure that it is less available to them.
	

<P>Some of the ways we can do this include: "stings" -- sending youth under cover to find out which stores will sell them cigarettes; seeing if stores use displays that appeal to kids; providing tobacco retailer training for store owners and youth; counting cigarette advertisements near schools, including signs, posters, billboards and promotional giveaways; asking the city council to ban vending machines in our community; and asking store owners to partner with others to prevent kids from smoking in our community.
	

<P>We can keep kids from smoking -- and putting themselves in danger of premature death from cigarette-related illnesses -- if we all work together. 
	

<P>If you are interested in joining a communitywide effort to reduce the availability of cigarettes to kids, please contact (YOUR ORGANIZATION) at (YOUR PHONE NUMBER).


<P>Sincerely,<br>

<H3>Treatment Works &amp; We Can Prove It</H3>
<H2>The Fact Is. . .</H2>

</center>
<B>Here are some key findings from recent surveys that illustrate how substance abuse
treatment saves money and leads to healthier communities:
</B>
<hr>
<P><H3>RECOVERY SERVICES: THE CALIFORNIA DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT ASSESSMENT 
(CALDATA).</H3>
The largest and most rigorous study done in California released in August surveyed 3,000 providers and participants in four types of treatment programs in the state between October 1991, and September 1992. In a second followup phase of the study, 1,850 treatment recipients were interviewed 15 months after treatment.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> <B>FINDINGS</B>

<P><B>Cost benefits to taxpayers</B>. 
<p>For every dollar invested in treatment, taxpayers save $7.14 in future costs. The cost of treating approximately 150,000 participants represented in the CALDATA study in 1992 was $209 million, while the benefits received during  treatment and the first year afterwards were worth approximately $1.5 billion in cost savings to taxpayers  primarily through the avoidance of crime.


<P><B>Decline in criminal activities</B>. 
<p>Following treatment, the level of crime declined by two-thirds. The greater the length of time spent in treatment, the greater the reduction in criminal activities.


<P><B>Improvements in health and hospitalizations.</B> 
<p>Emergency room admissions were reduced by one third following treatment. A one-third reduction in hospitalizations was reported following treatment.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>


<P><H3>NASADAD: INVEST IN TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG PROBLEMS: IT PAYS:</H3>


<P>The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors gathered studies conducted by 14 state alcohol and drug abuse agencies on the effectiveness of treatment for alcohol and drug problems. These studies were submitted by state directors from 14 states.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Crime</B>
<p>Maine's Office of Substance Abuse compared client outcome status of 180 clients admitted to treatment programs between September, 1990, and October 1991 to determine their outcome status at least one year following treatment. The state found that 79 percent of clients who received substance abuse treatment were not arrested one year after the treatment. People who resumed drinking since treatment had a 31 percent arrest rate versus 8 percent for those who did not drink.


<P><B>Health Care</B> 
<p>Ohio did a one-year followup of 668 clients who had completed treatment, and found they had a 66 percent decrease in hospital admissions (from 32 percent to 11 percent) and a 41 decrease in emergency room visits (from 34 percent to 20 percent).


<P>Minnesota's State AOD Authority, which operates the Consolidated Chemical Dependency Treatment Fund to provide treatment services to more than 17,000 clients, has done an extensive evaluation of its programs and reports that these services have resulted in an abstinence rate of 64 percent for clients six months after treatment. For chemical dependency clients, the state estimates that it saves $22 million in annual health care costs by providing treatment.


<P>Iowa measured health-related outcomes for over 1,400 clients by comparing the number of hospitilizations a client had in the six months prior to treatment admission with the six month period before the followup assessment date. The results showed that clients who completed treatment had a 12 percent less hospitalization rate than their counterparts who did not treatment.


<P><B>Employment</B> 
<p>Ohio's Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services contracted with New Standards, Inc. to conduct a Comprehensive Assessment Treatment Outcomes Registry (CATOR) analysis of 668 residents one year after completing treatment. The findings include a decrease in worker absenteeism by 89 percent, tardiness by 92 percent and on-the-job injuries by 57 percent.


<P>Colorado compared clients status at treatment admission with clients status nine to 23 months following discharge. For fiscal years 1990 and 1991, over 26,000 treatment admissions were represented in a stratified random sample of 868 clients. The state found the income of clients following treatment increased by an average of $2,760 a year. The percentage of clients employed also improved by 70 percent.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><H3><B>THE RUTGERS STUDY: SOCIOECONOMIC EVALUATIONS OF ADDICTIONS TREATMENT</B></H3>
 In the fall of 1992, researchers at Rutgers University were asked by the President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws to review existing scientific literature on the cost-offsets of providing addiction treatment in the United States. Five populations were examined  Blue Cross/Blue Shield and private insurance eligibles, Medicare/Medicaid eligibles, employee groups, criminal justice populations and pregnant women. Information was derived from a series of computerized and hand literature searches, as well as from materials provided by HMOs, employee assistance programs, major insurance carriers, and officials in state health departments and federal government. The report pulls together a number of points from all the literature in an integrated review.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>FINDINGS:</B>


<P><B>Health care</B> 
<p>The average alcoholic or other drug addict is conservatively estimated to be using more than 20 times the medical services of a non-addict.


<P>On the average, untreated alcoholics generally incur general health care costs that are at least 100 percent higher than those of nonalcoholics. In the last 12 months before treatment, the alcoholics costs are close to 300 percent higher.


<P><B>Business</B>


<P>Untreated addictions cost American businesses from $50 billion to $100 billion each year in increased medical claims and disability costs from illnesses and injuries, theft, absenteeism and decreased productivity.


<P>Treatment results in a reduction in sick-claim benefits, a better than 50 percent reduction in absenteeism and a similar reduction in days on disability.


<P>After treatment, reduction in days lost due to illness, sickness claims and hospitalization dropped by around 50 percent.


<P><B>Cost Savings</B>


<P>Treatment has projected returns of anywhere from $2 to $10 for every dollar spent on treatment.


<P>Although estimates of the cost of untreated addiction run as high as $172 billion annually, dollars directed to supporting prevention and treatment amount to less than one percent of the annual cost of untreated addiction.


<P> Two reports published by the RAND Drug Policy Research Center, Modeling the Demand for Cocaine and Controlling Cocaine: Supply Versus Demand Programs, make the case that providing treatment is cost-effective. The research provided in the reports was sponsored by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the U.S. Army, and RAND's Social Policy Department.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>

			<LI>Alcohol-related highway crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents 	and young adults in the United States. (From the <A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</A>'s 3-D Campaign)


			<LI>About two in every five Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash at 	some time in their lives. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, Traffic Safety Facts 1993 - Alcohol)


			<LI>Approximately 17,461 Americans died in alcohol-related crashes in 1993, and about one-third of them under the age of 25. This figure accounts for 44 percent 	of all traffic fatalities that occurred that year. (NHTSA 3-D)


		<LI>Among young people (aged 15 to 20), 5,905 died in motor vehicle crashes in 	1993. Forty percent (2,364) of these crashes were alcohol-related.  (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, 	Youth Fatal Crash and Alcohol Facts 1993)


		<LI>Alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes cost the nation $46 billion annually in lost 	productivity (63.4%), medical costs (12%), property damage (18%), and other 	direct expenditures (6.6%). Over $5 billion of these costs are for health care. 	(<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A> 3-D)


			<LI>Many young people report riding with a driver who had been drinking, says the 	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, 11.3 percent of 12 to 13-	year-olds said they had been driven by someone who had been drinking in the 	past month; the same was true of 21.7 percent of 14 to 17-year-olds; and 34.5 	percent of 18 to 21-year-olds. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A> 3-D)


			<LI>Even when they haven't been drinking, young drivers (age 15 - 20) have a higher 	crash risk than other drivers -- this risk increases more with each drink than for 	drivers age 21 and older. (Zador, P., Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 1991 )
</UL>


<P><H3>PREVENTION WORKS TO SAVE LIVES</H3>


<UL>
	<LI>The number of alcohol-related car crashes has declined by 26 percent in the last 	decade. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, Traffic Safety Facts) 


	<LI>All states and the District of Columbia now have a minimum drinking age of 21. 	These laws have reduced fatal car crashes involving drivers age 18 to 20 by 13 	percent and have saved an estimated 13,968 lives since 1975. (<A HREF="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">NHTSA</A>, Traffic Safety Facts) 


	<LI>If all states adopted .00 or .02 legal Blood Alcohol Content limits for drivers 	under 21 (Zero Tolerance Laws), each year 375 fatal car crashes would be 	prevented. However, 26 states still have not adopted zero tolerance laws (From a study called &quot;Lower Legal Blood Alcohol Limits for Young Drivers,&quot; 	published in the November-December 1994  issue of Public Health Reports)

<H3><CENTER>SAMPLE PITCH LETTER</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Dear Editor:<BR>
<BR>
Drug use -- and related crime, HIV infections and homelessness -- is on
the risein Stamford, (replace with your community's name) as it is in other
communities around the nation. We issue a call to action to influential
people in our city, particularly elected officials, business leaders and
citizens, to support substance abuse efforts. <BR>
<BR>
A national study conducted by Join Together, a resource center helping communities
fight substance abuse, found that elected officials and business andreligious
leaders received poor marks from more than 4,000 anti-drug groups around
the country for their lack of involvement fighting alcohol and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
I have enclosed some of the survey highlights, which I think will greatly
interest you. As you well know, alcohol and drug-related crime stories often
runon the front page of your newspaper. And hospital and shelter records
in our community detail the frightening scope of AIDS and domestic violence.
<BR>
<BR>
I urge you to take a close look at substance abuse here in Stamford (replace
with your community's name) and see how the problem -- and the commitment
of keyleaders to fight it -- here compares with the rest of the nation.
<BR>
<BR>
You may want to interview youth, parents, teachers and community groups
about their perception of local alcohol and drug abuse problems and ask
them what solutions they suggest. Then you could talk to business leaders
and elected officials and ask them if they are involved in efforts to fight
such problems. Ican suggest some people you can talk with. I can also give
you suggestions of ways more people in the community can help make a difference.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>Annual Survey Shows Increases in Tobacco and Drug Use by Youth</H2>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today released the 21st annual <A HREF="../../policy/Surveys/monitorFUTUREsum.html">Monitoring
the Future Survey</A>, which surveys the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit
drugs by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.<BR>
<BR>
According to this year's survey, 48.4 percent of high school seniors had
used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetimes, an unacceptably high
level, but still far below the peak of 65.6 percent in 1981. Rates of cigarette
smoking increased among high school seniors, with 64.2 percent reporting
lifetime use of cigarettes, up from 62 percent in 1994. Rates of lifetime
alcohol use among seniors remained high at 80.7 percent.<BR>
<BR>
In reporting the survey findings, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
E. Shalala noted that December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Month
and challenged parents and all caring adults to open a dialogue with young
people about drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Secretary Shalala said, &quot;We
have a generation at risk -- a generation that needs to hear clear and consistent
messages from all adults that using drugs, alcohol, and tobacco can ruin
their lives. This holiday season, parents should make a special effort to
set their children straight about the dangers of smoking, drinking and using
drugs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Secretary Shalala said, &quot;The Clinton administration is fighting for
our children. That is why we have proposed a powerful new initiative to
prevent young people from using tobacco. That is why we have developed a
tough, comprehensive anti-drug strategy. And that is why the President will
hold a White House conference on youth drug use and violence in January,
1996. These are strong steps for keeping young Americans healthy and drug-free
-- and they make a lot more sense than the reckless budget cuts in services
for children and families that the Congress has proposed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lee Brown, Ph.D., Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said, &quot;We need all Americans to lock arms and send a clear and consistent
message to all young people: Drugs are illegal, dangerous, unhealthy and
wrong. When my daughter was a teenager, I told her that I would check her
room to make sure there were no illegal substances. I also waited up for
her while she was out with her friends. She told me that these actions annoyed
her, but I did them because she was precious to me. Now she is married and
a successful adult. This is an example of the kind of 'tough love' that
parents need to do more of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Deputy Secretary of Education Madeleine Kunin said that the survey shows
&quot;this certainly is no time to cut funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools
by 60 percent, as Congress has proposed. But schools can only be part of
the solution. This is a tragedy among our nation's youth that requires immediate
attention from schools, communities, governments and -- most importantly
-- parents. Parents must have high expectations for their children, be involved
in their lives and education, and send the message that young people cannot
compete and succeed if they use drugs. That is why we have made family involvement
the cornerstone of our agenda.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This year's survey showed significant increases in smoking among 10th and
12th graders. Rates of cigarette smoking among 12th graders increased for
lifetime, current use (at least once in the 30 days prior to the survey),
and daily prevalence measures between 1994 and 1995. For 10th graders, current
and daily use of cigarettes increased, while at the same time, there was
a decrease in the percentage of 10th graders believing there is great risk
in smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day. Among African American
10th graders, there has been a significant increase in those who have smoked
in the past 30 days, from 6.6 percent in 1992 to 11.5 percent in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Use of marijuana climbed in 1995. Between 1994 and 1995, lifetime and past
year use of this drug increased among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.<BR>
<BR>
This was the third consecutive increase in lifetime and past year use among
10th and 12th graders and the fourth for 8th graders. Despite the increase,
rates in 1995 are still far below the peak year, 1979, when 60.4 percent
of high school seniors had used marijuana at least once.<BR>
<BR>
The increases in use are tied to decreases in students' perceptions about
the dangers of drug use. The 1995 survey shows decreases in the percentage
of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders believing there is &quot;great risk&quot;
in occasionally smoking marijuana. As with tobacco, there was also a decrease
in the percentage of 10th and 12th graders perceiving &quot;great risk&quot;
in using marijuana regularly.<BR>
<BR>
Secretary Shalala said, &quot;We know that there continues to be a glorification
of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use in popular culture. All of us -- parents,
teachers, caregivers, government officials, and members of the media --
must work harder to spread the word to young Americans that drugs, tobacco,
and alcohol are not healthy and not 'cool'.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other survey findings include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Overall the proportion of 8th graders taking any illicit drug in the
12 months prior to the survey reached 21.4 percent in this year's survey.
The comparable figure was 33.3 percent for 10th graders and 39.0 percent
for 12th graders. 
<BR>
<LI>Lifetime use of marijuana increased by over 3 percentage points from
1994 to 1995 for each of the three grades surveyed. In 1995, 19.9 percent
of 8th graders, 34.1 percent of 10th graders, and 41.7 percent of 12th graders
reported having used marijuana at least once in their lives. The survey
also found that 34.7 percent of high school seniors, 28.7 percent of 10th
graders, and 15.8 percent of 8th graders had used marijuana in the past
year, up from 30.7, 25.2, and 13.0 percent in 1994, respectively. 
<BR>
<LI>While overall rates are low, there was a significant increase in annual
and current use of LSD among 10th and 12th graders. The percentage of 10th
graders reporting use of LSD in the past year increased from 5.2 percent
to 6.5 percent and among 12th graders, annual use increased from 6.9 percent
to 8.4 percent. 
<BR>
<LI>Use of inhalants remains high, especially among 8th graders. The percentage
of 8th graders reporting having used inhalants at least once in their lifetime
rose from 19.9 percent in 1994 to 21.6 percent in 1995. For 8th graders,
lifetime rates of inhalant use are higher than rates of marijuana use. In
addition, use of inhalants has been consistently higher among 8th graders
than among 12th graders. 
<BR>
<LI>Rates for lifetime, annual, and 30 day prevalence of alcohol use remained
level between 1994 and 1995. Daily drinking among 12th graders increased
from 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent, but among 8th graders, daily alcohol use
decreased from 1.0 percent in 1994 to 0.7 percent in 1995. 
<BR>
<LI>The percentage of 12th graders reporting current use of cigarettes increased
from 31.2 percent in 1994 to 33.5 percent in 1995 and daily smoking increased
from 19.4 percent to 21.6 percent. Among 10th graders, current use increased
from 25.4 percent to 27.9 percent and daily use increased from 14.6 percent
to 16.3 percent between 1994 and 1995. 
</UL>
There were continued decreases in both beliefs about the harmfulness of
the various drugs and in peer disapproval of drug use.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>There was a decrease in the percentage of students in all grades reporting
&quot;great risk&quot; in trying crack once or twice. 
<BR>
<LI>There was a continuing decrease in the percentage of 8th graders who
disapprove of people who try marijuana or LSD once or twice or who take
LSD regularly. 
<BR>
<LI>There was an increase in the percentage of students at each grade level
reporting their perception that it is fairly or very easy to get marijuana.
<BR>
<LI>The survey also found increases in the proportion of 8th graders reporting
that they believed it would be fairly easy or very easy to get marijuana,
LSD, crack, heroin, and amphetamines. 
</UL>
The Monitoring the Future Survey is conducted under a NIDA grant to the
University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Under the direction
of Dr. Lloyd Johnston, the survey was administered in the spring of 1995
to a national probability sample of 15,876 high school seniors, 17,285 10th
graders and 17,929 8th graders in public and private schools. The study
has been conducted annually since 1975, with 1995 representing the 21st
annual survey of high school seniors and the 5th year data have been collected
on 8th and 10th grade students.<BR>

<HR><BR>
Between 1994 and 1995 use of cigarettes and most illicit drugs increased
among students in all three grades surveyed. In addition, fewer students
expressed negative perceptions of drug use. In most cases, these changes
continued recent trends that began in the early 1990's and reversed a decade
or more of decreases in drug use. All changes noted below are statistically
significant. 
<H2>Cigarette Use</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Between 1994 and 1995, past month (30 days) cigarette use increased
from 25.4 to 27.9 percent among 10th graders and from 31.2 to 33.5 percent
among seniors. Similarly, daily smoking increased from 14.6 to 16.3 percent
for 10th graders and from 19.4 to 21.6 percent for seniors. 
<LI>Since 1991, past month smoking has increased from 14.4 to 19.1 percent
for 8th graders, 20.8 to 27.9 percent for 10th graders, and 28.3 to 33.5
percent for 12th graders. 
<LI>Although African American students continue to have the lowest rates
of smoking, rates are going up for students in all racial/ethnic groups.
Current cigarette use increased from 1992 to 1995 among white and black
students in all three grades and among white, black, and Hispanic 8th graders.
</UL>
<H2>Illicit Drug Use</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Use of marijuana/hashish continued to climb. Between 1994 and 1995,
lifetime and past year marijuana use increased among 8th, 10th, and 12th
graders, and past month use increased among 8th and 12th graders. This was
the third consecutive increase in lifetime and past year marijuana use among
10th and 12th graders and the fourth for 8th graders. Among seniors, marijuana
use in 1995 was the highest since 1989 for lifetime use, 1987 for past year
use, and 1986 for past month use. In addition, daily marijuana use, an index
of very high-risk use, increased for 10th and 12th graders. 
<LI>Driven in large part by the rise of marijuana, lifetime, past year,
and past month use of any illicit drug increased among 8th and 10th graders.
Past year use of any illicit drug increased among seniors. 
<LI>Past year use of hallucinogens, including LSD, increased among 8th,
10th, and 12th graders between 1994 and 1995, and past month use of these
drugs increased for 10th and 12th graders. 
<LI>Past month use of cocaine in any form increased for 10th graders; this
increase was primarily due to crack, which showed increases in lifetime,
past year, and past month use among 10th graders. 
<LI>Heroin use in the lifetime, past year, and past month increased among
seniors, and past month heroin use increased for 10th graders. For seniors,
lifetime heroin use was at 1.2 percent in 1994 and at 1.6 percent in 1995.
These increases appear mainly to reflect use of heroin in noninjectable
forms. 
<LI>Use of stimulants increased among 10th graders for all three levels
of recency of use. 
</UL>
<H2>Perceived Harmfulness and Availability</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The perceived risk of drug use continued to decrease. The percentage
of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders reporting &quot;great risk&quot; in trying
marijuana once or twice or in smoking the drug occasionally decreased. Among
seniors, the percent of seniors reporting &quot;great risk&quot; in regular
marijuana use has decreased steadily from 78.6 percent in 1991 to 60.8 percent
in 1995. 
<LI>The percent reporting &quot;great risk&quot; in trying crack or cocaine
powder or in using these drugs occasionally decreased among 8th and 10th
graders. 
<LI>The perceived risk of smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day decreased
among 10th graders. 
<LI>The percentage reporting that marijuana was &quot;fairly easy&quot;
or &quot;very easy&quot; to get increased among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.
The perceived availability of LSD increased for 8th and 10th graders. 
</UL>
<H2>Alcohol Use</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol use continued at unacceptably high levels. Notably, however,
daily drinking increased among 12th graders, and more 10th graders reported
having &quot;been drunk&quot; daily in the past month.

<H2><CENTER>ACTION STEPS: </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Once you have documented the availability of tobacco near a public school
in your community, you may want to mobilize other groups to team up with
you to take some of the following steps: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>--Initiate sting operations to pinpoint which stores actually sell tobacco
products to youth under age 18 (which is illegal); 
<LI>--Look at the placement and advertising of tobacco products in stores
to see if they are displayed in places that appeal to youth; 
<LI>--See if stores have proper warnings posted to remind consumers that
it is illegal to sell cigarettes to youth; 
<LI>--Consider providing tobacco retailer training; 
<LI>--Count cigarette advertisements near schools, including posters, billboards
and promotional giveaways; 
<LI>--Ask retailers to sign a pledge promising not to illegally sell cigarettes
to youth; 
<LI>--Ask your city council to ban vending machines; 
<LI>--Get youth involved in all of your efforts.

Gloucester Prevention Network, Stop Using Nicotine (SUN) Coalition

Cigarette vending machines are banned in the sea-side town of Gloucester, Massachusetts, thanks to the efforts of four seventh grade girls there.  The girls, who wanted to keep their peers from smoking, circulated a petition among residents to get support for keeping vending machines out of the community. Then, with the help of the SUN Coalition, they submitted the petition to the city council and got them to pass a local ordinance. Now the neighboring town of Salem is also considering following Gloucester's lead. For more information, contact Phillip Salzman, Program Director of the Gloucester Prevention Network, or Pamela Dungan, Tobacco Control Coordinator, 96 Main Street, Gloucester, MA  01930.

<P> "GROSS" -- Get Rid of Second Hand Smoke

Recognizing that illegal single cigarette sales lure youth to smoke, GROSS initiated a major letter writing campaign to state and federal agencies asking them to crack down on the problem.  The organization also sent copies of state laws to outlets that illegally sold single cigarettes, in an attempt to get them to stop. This campaign did successfully discourage many retailers from selling single cigarettes. For more information, contact Rob Perry or Joe Perry, Co-Chairmen, P.O. Box 765, Kiefer, OK  74041.  (918) 321-5077.





<P>The Uptown Coalition for Tobacco Control and Public Health.

A cigarette test-marketing campaign aimed at African American youth galvanized Philadelphia residents to action. Refusing to let their youngsters risk their health to sample the Uptown cigarettes, parents got together through the Uptown Coalition for Tobacco Control and Public Health and demanded the tobacco company  remove this product from their city. Supporting this effort were numerous local, state and national organizations. The coalition's efforts were ultimately successful: R.J. Reynolds finally agreed to remove Uptown cigarettes from the market.  For more information, contact Reverend Jesse Brown at (215) 225-5232.  





<P> "HORA" -- Hispanics On the Rise Again

The large number of cigarette advertisements on billboards in a Hispanic neighborhood in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, prompted a 17-year-old youth there to action. With the support of a group called HORA, he counted the number of cigarette billboards in his neighborhood and then went to the city council and asked them to replace these ads with ones that would send a more positive message to kids.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health,  March 1994.

<H2><CENTER>What You Can Do About Inhalant Abuse</CENTER>
</H2>
Inhalant abuse is a widespread--and serious--problem among youth today.
In fact, as many as one in five students abuses regular household substances--such
as glue, hair spray, lighter fluid and paint thinner--to get high. And unlike
alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, these products are easy for kids to obtain
and do not make adults suspicious if they see a child using them.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, these products can lead to a number of serious side affects
for users, including sudden death. And the problem is not getting better.
The rate of inhalant users continues to rise in states across the country,
prompting some schools to educate kids and parents about the dangers. But
unfortunately, many young inhalant users have dropped out of school or do
not attend classes. Therefore, these young people do not know the possible
consequences of their behavior. That's why it is crucial that we find ways
to warn them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Here are some steps you can take:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Involve a wide variety of local groups in your public education efforts.
You may want to include doctors, nurses, pharmacists, politicians, school
drug-education coordinators, law enforcement officers, teachers, youth,
parents, business owners, media representatives and clergy. Brainstorm together
ways to reach high-risk youth in your community. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Put up posters warning about the dangers of inhalant abuse in places
young people frequent, such as recreation centers, record stores, fast food
restaurants, pizza places, ice cream parlors, candy stores, movie theaters
and supermarkets. Be sure to list resources people can turn to for help.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local radio stations that play music that appeals to youth to run
public service announcements about inhalant abuse and the associated risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local movie theaters to run a public service announcement about
inhalant abuse before each movie. See if a local corporation or business
that caters to youth will donate the money to produce the PSA. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local newspaper to run a full-page advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse to warn parents and young people about the risks.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>See if your local cable station will run an advertisement about the
dangers of inhalant abuse. Ask local students to write, direct, produce
and act in the ad. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask your local grocery stores to stuff fact sheets about inhalant abuse--and
how to get help--in customers bags. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask local businesses--such as the gas or phone company--to include bill
stuffers about the dangers of inhalant abuse.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Ask manufacturers of products that youth inhale to work with you to
find ways to reduce this abuse. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Plan ahead for &quot;National Inhalants &amp; Poisons Awareness Week,&quot;
which is sponsored by the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition/Texas Prevention
Partnership and is held the third week in March. Ask your mayor or city
council to sign a proclamation recognizing this week in your city or town
and plan some events to call attention to this serious problem. (For more
information about this week, see <A HREF="others.html">What Others Have
Done</A>.) <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Call the photo editor at your local newspaper and offer to set up a
photograph of some of the products that can be misused as inhalants. This
can help to alert parents that some &quot;innocent-looking&quot; household
products can actually be deadly.

<H2>Annual Survey Shows Increases in Tobacco and Drug Use by Youth</H2>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today released the 21st annual <A HREF="../../policy/Surveys/monitorFUTUREsum.html">Monitoring
the Future Survey</A>, which surveys the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit
drugs by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.<BR>
<BR>
According to this year's survey, 48.4 percent of high school seniors had
used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetimes, an unacceptably high
level, but still far below the peak of 65.6 percent in 1981. Rates of cigarette
smoking increased among high school seniors, with 64.2 percent reporting
lifetime use of cigarettes, up from 62 percent in 1994. Rates of lifetime
alcohol use among seniors remained high at 80.7 percent.<BR>
<BR>
In reporting the survey findings, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
E. Shalala noted that December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Month
and challenged parents and all caring adults to open a dialogue with young
people about drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Secretary Shalala said, &quot;We
have a generation at risk -- a generation that needs to hear clear and consistent
messages from all adults that using drugs, alcohol, and tobacco can ruin
their lives. This holiday season, parents should make a special effort to
set their children straight about the dangers of smoking, drinking and using
drugs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Secretary Shalala said, &quot;The Clinton administration is fighting for
our children. That is why we have proposed a powerful new initiative to
prevent young people from using tobacco. That is why we have developed a
tough, comprehensive anti-drug strategy. And that is why the President will
hold a White House conference on youth drug use and violence in January,
1996. These are strong steps for keeping young Americans healthy and drug-free
-- and they make a lot more sense than the reckless budget cuts in services
for children and families that the Congress has proposed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lee Brown, Ph.D., Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said, &quot;We need all Americans to lock arms and send a clear and consistent
message to all young people: Drugs are illegal, dangerous, unhealthy and
wrong. When my daughter was a teenager, I told her that I would check her
room to make sure there were no illegal substances. I also waited up for
her while she was out with her friends. She told me that these actions annoyed
her, but I did them because she was precious to me. Now she is married and
a successful adult. This is an example of the kind of 'tough love' that
parents need to do more of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Deputy Secretary of Education Madeleine Kunin said that the survey shows
&quot;this certainly is no time to cut funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools
by 60 percent, as Congress has proposed. But schools can only be part of
the solution. This is a tragedy among our nation's youth that requires immediate
attention from schools, communities, governments and -- most importantly
-- parents. Parents must have high expectations for their children, be involved
in their lives and education, and send the message that young people cannot
compete and succeed if they use drugs. That is why we have made family involvement
the cornerstone of our agenda.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This year's survey showed significant increases in smoking among 10th and
12th graders. Rates of cigarette smoking among 12th graders increased for
lifetime, current use (at least once in the 30 days prior to the survey),
and daily prevalence measures between 1994 and 1995. For 10th graders, current
and daily use of cigarettes increased, while at the same time, there was
a decrease in the percentage of 10th graders believing there is great risk
in smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day. Among African American
10th graders, there has been a significant increase in those who have smoked
in the past 30 days, from 6.6 percent in 1992 to 11.5 percent in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Use of marijuana climbed in 1995. Between 1994 and 1995, lifetime and past
year use of this drug increased among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.<BR>
<BR>
This was the third consecutive increase in lifetime and past year use among
10th and 12th graders and the fourth for 8th graders. Despite the increase,
rates in 1995 are still far below the peak year, 1979, when 60.4 percent
of high school seniors had used marijuana at least once.<BR>
<BR>
The increases in use are tied to decreases in students' perceptions about
the dangers of drug use. The 1995 survey shows decreases in the percentage
of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders believing there is &quot;great risk&quot;
in occasionally smoking marijuana. As with tobacco, there was also a decrease
in the percentage of 10th and 12th graders perceiving &quot;great risk&quot;
in using marijuana regularly.<BR>
<BR>
Secretary Shalala said, &quot;We know that there continues to be a glorification
of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use in popular culture. All of us -- parents,
teachers, caregivers, government officials, and members of the media --
must work harder to spread the word to young Americans that drugs, tobacco,
and alcohol are not healthy and not 'cool'.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other survey findings include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Overall the proportion of 8th graders taking any illicit drug in the
12 months prior to the survey reached 21.4 percent in this year's survey.
The comparable figure was 33.3 percent for 10th graders and 39.0 percent
for 12th graders. 
<BR>
<LI>Lifetime use of marijuana increased by over 3 percentage points from
1994 to 1995 for each of the three grades surveyed. In 1995, 19.9 percent
of 8th graders, 34.1 percent of 10th graders, and 41.7 percent of 12th graders
reported having used marijuana at least once in their lives. The survey
also found that 34.7 percent of high school seniors, 28.7 percent of 10th
graders, and 15.8 percent of 8th graders had used marijuana in the past
year, up from 30.7, 25.2, and 13.0 percent in 1994, respectively. 
<BR>
<LI>While overall rates are low, there was a significant increase in annual
and current use of LSD among 10th and 12th graders. The percentage of 10th
graders reporting use of LSD in the past year increased from 5.2 percent
to 6.5 percent and among 12th graders, annual use increased from 6.9 percent
to 8.4 percent. 
<BR>
<LI>Use of inhalants remains high, especially among 8th graders. The percentage
of 8th graders reporting having used inhalants at least once in their lifetime
rose from 19.9 percent in 1994 to 21.6 percent in 1995. For 8th graders,
lifetime rates of inhalant use are higher than rates of marijuana use. In
addition, use of inhalants has been consistently higher among 8th graders
than among 12th graders. 
<BR>
<LI>Rates for lifetime, annual, and 30 day prevalence of alcohol use remained
level between 1994 and 1995. Daily drinking among 12th graders increased
from 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent, but among 8th graders, daily alcohol use
decreased from 1.0 percent in 1994 to 0.7 percent in 1995. 
<BR>
<LI>The percentage of 12th graders reporting current use of cigarettes increased
from 31.2 percent in 1994 to 33.5 percent in 1995 and daily smoking increased
from 19.4 percent to 21.6 percent. Among 10th graders, current use increased
from 25.4 percent to 27.9 percent and daily use increased from 14.6 percent
to 16.3 percent between 1994 and 1995. 
</UL>
There were continued decreases in both beliefs about the harmfulness of
the various drugs and in peer disapproval of drug use.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>There was a decrease in the percentage of students in all grades reporting
&quot;great risk&quot; in trying crack once or twice. 
<BR>
<LI>There was a continuing decrease in the percentage of 8th graders who
disapprove of people who try marijuana or LSD once or twice or who take
LSD regularly. 
<BR>
<LI>There was an increase in the percentage of students at each grade level
reporting their perception that it is fairly or very easy to get marijuana.
<BR>
<LI>The survey also found increases in the proportion of 8th graders reporting
that they believed it would be fairly easy or very easy to get marijuana,
LSD, crack, heroin, and amphetamines. 
</UL>
The Monitoring the Future Survey is conducted under a NIDA grant to the
University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Under the direction
of Dr. Lloyd Johnston, the survey was administered in the spring of 1995
to a national probability sample of 15,876 high school seniors, 17,285 10th
graders and 17,929 8th graders in public and private schools. The study
has been conducted annually since 1975, with 1995 representing the 21st
annual survey of high school seniors and the 5th year data have been collected
on 8th and 10th grade students.<BR>

<HR><BR>
Between 1994 and 1995 use of cigarettes and most illicit drugs increased
among students in all three grades surveyed. In addition, fewer students
expressed negative perceptions of drug use. In most cases, these changes
continued recent trends that began in the early 1990's and reversed a decade
or more of decreases in drug use. All changes noted below are statistically
significant. 
<H2>Cigarette Use</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Between 1994 and 1995, past month (30 days) cigarette use increased
from 25.4 to 27.9 percent among 10th graders and from 31.2 to 33.5 percent
among seniors. Similarly, daily smoking increased from 14.6 to 16.3 percent
for 10th graders and from 19.4 to 21.6 percent for seniors. 
<LI>Since 1991, past month smoking has increased from 14.4 to 19.1 percent
for 8th graders, 20.8 to 27.9 percent for 10th graders, and 28.3 to 33.5
percent for 12th graders. 
<LI>Although African American students continue to have the lowest rates
of smoking, rates are going up for students in all racial/ethnic groups.
Current cigarette use increased from 1992 to 1995 among white and black
students in all three grades and among white, black, and Hispanic 8th graders.
</UL>
<H2>Illicit Drug Use</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Use of marijuana/hashish continued to climb. Between 1994 and 1995,
lifetime and past year marijuana use increased among 8th, 10th, and 12th
graders, and past month use increased among 8th and 12th graders. This was
the third consecutive increase in lifetime and past year marijuana use among
10th and 12th graders and the fourth for 8th graders. Among seniors, marijuana
use in 1995 was the highest since 1989 for lifetime use, 1987 for past year
use, and 1986 for past month use. In addition, daily marijuana use, an index
of very high-risk use, increased for 10th and 12th graders. 
<LI>Driven in large part by the rise of marijuana, lifetime, past year,
and past month use of any illicit drug increased among 8th and 10th graders.
Past year use of any illicit drug increased among seniors. 
<LI>Past year use of hallucinogens, including LSD, increased among 8th,
10th, and 12th graders between 1994 and 1995, and past month use of these
drugs increased for 10th and 12th graders. 
<LI>Past month use of cocaine in any form increased for 10th graders; this
increase was primarily due to crack, which showed increases in lifetime,
past year, and past month use among 10th graders. 
<LI>Heroin use in the lifetime, past year, and past month increased among
seniors, and past month heroin use increased for 10th graders. For seniors,
lifetime heroin use was at 1.2 percent in 1994 and at 1.6 percent in 1995.
These increases appear mainly to reflect use of heroin in noninjectable
forms. 
<LI>Use of stimulants increased among 10th graders for all three levels
of recency of use. 
</UL>
<H2>Perceived Harmfulness and Availability</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The perceived risk of drug use continued to decrease. The percentage
of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders reporting &quot;great risk&quot; in trying
marijuana once or twice or in smoking the drug occasionally decreased. Among
seniors, the percent of seniors reporting &quot;great risk&quot; in regular
marijuana use has decreased steadily from 78.6 percent in 1991 to 60.8 percent
in 1995. 
<LI>The percent reporting &quot;great risk&quot; in trying crack or cocaine
powder or in using these drugs occasionally decreased among 8th and 10th
graders. 
<LI>The perceived risk of smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day decreased
among 10th graders. 
<LI>The percentage reporting that marijuana was &quot;fairly easy&quot;
or &quot;very easy&quot; to get increased among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.
The perceived availability of LSD increased for 8th and 10th graders. 
</UL>
<H2>Alcohol Use</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol use continued at unacceptably high levels. Notably, however,
daily drinking increased among 12th graders, and more 10th graders reported
having &quot;been drunk&quot; daily in the past month.

<H3><CENTER>SAMPLE PRESS RELEASE</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
You can localize the following press release with some examples of substance
abuse problems -- and solutions -- at work in your community. Send this
release along with a  copy of the key findings from the national survey
to the editor atyour local newspaper.<BR>
<BR>
MORE LOCAL GROUPS NEED TO JOIN IN ANTI-SUBSTANCE ABUSE EFFORTS<BR>
<BR>
STAMFORD, Conn.--Beer. Wine Coolers. Marijuana: These are some of the drugs
of choice for the kids who live in our community.  <BR>
<BR>
The fact is that substance abuse is on the rise among youth -- not only
here in Stamford (replace with your community's name) but also across the
country.   And just at a time when we need them the most, many key leaders
and institutionswhose support is crucial to successful anti-drug efforts
have been withdrawing from the fight.        <BR>
<BR>
A recent national survey documents this alarming trend and sends out a warning
call for these groups to rejoin the effort.  The survey, conducted by Join
Together, a national resource center helping communities fight substance
abuse, found that critical participation from some groups -- including politicians,
business leaders, labor, churches and the media--is lacking.        <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We will be losing another generation of our kids to alcohol and drugs
if these and other key groups do not help us get the message out about all
the dangers associated with substance abuse,&quot; said Michael Smith, head
of the local Anti-Substance Abuse Coalition, which is run through the Mayor's
Office (replace with your organization's name). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Perhaps some of these groups assumed that the war on drugs was won
when abuse levels dropped in the 1980s, but the reality is that the problem
is increasing again among our children and we need everyone in the community
to take an activerole in our anti-substance abuse efforts to make them truly
effective,&quot; Smith said.<BR>
<BR>
Some groups in Stamford that are heavily involved in local efforts to reduce
alcohol and drug abuse have been able to accomplish great things. For instance
. . . .  (give some examples here of effective anti-substance abuse efforts
taken on by local business, recreation groups, clergy, etc.)         To
find out how you can help fight alcohol and drugs in Stamford (replace with
your community's name), call (your organization's name) at (your phone number).#

HR 233 states:<DL><DD>(a) GENERAL RULE - An organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which engages in lobbying activities or affiliated organizations shall not be eligible for the receipt of Federal funds constituting an award, grant or loan.</DL>(B) DEFINITION - For purposes of subsection (a), any 2 organizations shall be considered to be affiliated organizations if the organizations meet anyone or more of the following criteria:<DL><DD>(1) The governing instrument of one such organization requires it to be bound by decisions of the other organization on legislative issues.<br><br>(2) The governing board of one such organization includes persons who-<br>(A) are specifically designated representatives of the other such organization or are members of the governing board, officers, or paid executive staff members of such other organization; and<br>(B) by aggregating their votes, have significant voting power to cause or prevent action on political advocacy issues by the other such organization.<br><br>(3) The organizations - <br>(A) either use the same name or trademark, or represent themselves as being affiliated; and<br>(B) coordinate their lobbying activities or political advocacy.</DL>This bill takes the Simpson Amendment on the Lobbying Disclosure Act to its extreme. The Simpson Amendment prohibits 501(c)(4)'s that receive federal grants from lobbying. However, the Simpson Amendment allows 501(c)(4)'s that receive federal funds to affiliate with organizations that lobby. Specifically, Senator Simpson said on the floor of the Senate that organizations could bifurcate, creating an entity that receives federal funds and another that lobbies. This new bill would prevent this from occurring by prohibiting lobbying by any organizations (such as 501(c)(3)s) affiliated with a 501(c)(4) that receives federal grants.<br><br>Because this bill proposes to amend the Lobbying Disclosure Act it has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee. This is a different Committee than the one Congressman McIntosh sits on and used as a forum for Istook proposals. It is also not the Appropriations Committee where we saw the bulk of the Istook activity in the last Congress.<br><br>At this point, it is not clear that this bill will move, particularly because it would have to go through the Judiciary Committee, which is less than fertile ground for Istook proposals. When we have more information, we will be sure to pass it on.  Until then, if you have any questions, please contact: Deborah Lewis, Bob Smucker or Gary Bass.

DISCUS (Distilled Spirits Council of the US) followed Seagram's unilateral action last October by officially ending their participation in the voluntary ban. The national broadcasters continue to observe the ban but local affiliate and independent stations have begun to air liquor ads in several markets.<br><br>Both the President and FCC chairman Reed Hundt asked Seagram's to remove their ads. Congressman Joe Kennedy (D-Mass) introduced a bill to make the previously voluntary ban mandatory. Numerous public health and prevention organizations including MADD, CSPI, and the American Academy of Pediatrics publicly oppose broadcast liquor ads. The NCADD Board voted to propose counter ads rather than directly dispute liquor ads on TV and radio.<br><br>DISCUS has launched a major public relations campaign defending their right to advertise using the broadcast media. Broadcasters assert that the FCC has no authority and have blasted Reed Hundt for speaking out on the issue. The FTC announced an inquiry into the new liquor ads and a Stroh's malt liquor commercial that aired during "My So-Called Life", a popular children's show on MTV.<br><br>Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch tried to slink quietly off MTV on Christmas eve. One week later, both AdAge and The Wall Street Journal (January 6) published a one week analyses of current audience demographics for some TV beer ads. AdAge revealed that 40 early and prime time beer ads (including 27 Budweiser ads) aired on MTV when the underage audience was as high as 56%. The Wall Street Journal showed that beer ads shown on MTV, E! and BET reached audiences as high as 69% underage (Beavis and Butthead).<br><br><b>An Opportunity for Action</b><br><br>Aggressive promotion of alcoholic beverages to children is nothing new. Liquor makers' recent move to add liquor commercials to the broadcast media has raised the issue for public debate. Public health advocates can use this opportunity to advance a rational policy that will protect children from all alcohol ads on TV and radio. Our first goal should be to maintain the status quo, that is, keep liquor ads off. Then public health advocates should demand full disclosure of how broadcast alcohol ads already reach underage viewers. Broadcasters use detailed audience demographic data to price their advertising time. Advertisers use the same type of information to select audiences for their commercials. Policy-makers need this information to make appropriate policy decisions.<br><br><b>Senate Hearings Scheduled for February 25</b><br><br>The Subcommittee on Communications of the Senate Commerce Committee will hold hearings to discuss alcoholic beverage ads on TV and radio on February 25, 1997. Campaign contributions are pouring into Congress from broadcasters, liquor makers, brewers and beer wholesalers. Donations guarantee these business interests access to policy makers, most will be represented at the hearing. Only two public health advocates are invited to testify. Your calls and letters can force the Senate to do more than pretend to consider the public health impacts of unchecked alcohol advertising on our broadcast media.<br><br><b>WHAT YOU CAN DO</b><br><br>Call or write your Senators and ask them to:<UL><LI>Support keeping liquor ads off TV and radio. Demand that the liquor industry go back to its long-standing voluntary ban and ask broadcasters to refuse liquor ads.<LI>Support full disclosure of the current audience for all alcohol ads on TV and radio. Support expanded inquiries by the Federal Trade and Federal Communications Commissions.</UL>###<br><br><b>See also:</b>

Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>Survey Results:</H3>
<BR>
There were <B>over 1,200 tobacco retail outlets</B> found within a quarter-mile
radius of these 222 schools. Just seven percent (7%) of the total number
of schools surveyed reported that there were no outlets within the quarter
mile radius! This represents an average of approximately 6 outlets located
near each school. As the chart below indicates, convenience and grocery
stores which sell tobacco were most commonly found near schools. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Type of Outlet | Number | Percentag</B>e
<UL>
<LI>Convenience Store | 300 | 24%<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
* On the survey form, teams recorded &quot;other&quot; tobacco outlets.
Some of these other tobacco retail outlets listed included <B>laundromats,
candy stores, card stores, bowling </B>alleys, paper stores, take-out pizza
/ deli establishments, and thrift stores. Clearly, children frequent these
types of establishments, and sell products which appeal to children. Among
youths aged 12-17 years who usually bought their own cigarettes in 1989,
about 85% often or sometimes bought them from a small store, 50% from a
large store, and 15% from a vending machine.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Surveys: <BR>
Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<B>November 9, 1995 </B>
<H3>Hundreds of Volunteers Canvas<BR>
Neighborhoods Near Schools and <BR>
Find Over 1,000 Tobacco Outlets</H3>
<BR>
Join Together, a national resource for communities fighting substance abuse
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, recently conducted a nationwide
survey on underage access to tobacco. Community volunteers acted individually,
or formed teams, and canvassed their neighborhoods to measure the extent
of cigarette availability within a quarter-mile radius of schools. They
counted the number of tobacco sales locations in convenience, grocery and
liquor stores, gas stations, restaurants, and vending machines. Community
teams recorded results on a summary sheet, and sent them back to Join Together
for analysis and development of this report. <BR>
<BR>
The importance of tobacco control projects centers around the fact that
each day, more than 3,000 young people begin to smoke-or more than 1 million
each year, and that number is on the rise. The Surgeon General has stated
that most effective preventive programs to reduce youth smoking are communitywide
ones that combine education and public policy approaches. The placement
of tobacco retail outlets near schools (proximity and advertising), especially
elementary schools, has potentially harmful implications for youth, since
these factors interact to encourage youth to take up the habit. This Join
Together project is a first step in raising the level of awareness as to
youth access to tobacco among community citizens and youth, as well as setting
the stage for further communitywide public policy action. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>Surveys: <BR>
Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>Participants:</H3>
In twenty seven states, more than 500 volunteers (402 youth; 124 adults)
were involved in counting tobacco outlets within a quarter-mile radius of
over 200 schools. These schools represented over 100 communities from across
the country. Communities as diverse as Anchorage, Alaska, Winner, South
Dakota, Ellsworth, Maine, and Jupiter, Florida, representing all four corners
of the U.S., submitted results to Join Together. <BR>
<BR>
This tobacco outlet counting project generated a great deal of interest,
enthusiasm, and participation among concerned citizens. For example: 
<UL>
<LI>75 youth, accompanied by 3 adults surveyed Boyne City Public Schools
in Boyne City, MI; 
<LI>64 youth on their own surveyed a middle school in Creston, OH; 
<LI>35 youth and 3 adults in Passaic, NJ surveyed an elementary school in
their community; 
<LI>25 youth and 4 adults surveyed a high school in Monroe, LA. 
<LI>A single volunteer in Laredo, TX surveyed 27 schools in his area; while
another one surveyed 22 schools in Leominster, MA; 
<LI>A team of two adult volunteers in Martinsburg, WV surveyed 20 schools.
</UL>
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION:<BR>
<BR>
Community teams selected a total of 222 schools for this project, approximately
half (45%) of which were elementary schools. Middle schools represented
30%, while high schools comprised 25% of the total number of schools surveyed.<BR>
<BR>
Half (49%) of the areas surveyed surrounding schools were classified as
rural, while 28% of areas were classified as urban; the remaining areas,
23%, were classified as suburban. This means that youth access to tobacco
is not just a big city problem--it affects rural communities all across
the country! <BR>
<BR>
Almost two-thirds of communities described the area in which the school
is located as mixed commercial &amp; residential; one-third indicated the
areas were residential.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Surveys: <BR>
Tobacco Retail Outlet Counting Project</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>Interesting Stories:</H3>
<BR>
The community teams we worked with presented us with some interesting stories
and comments. Here are just a few: 
<UL>
<LI>At a convenience store in Newport, NH, a team of seven students reported
that &quot;individual packs on a rack in the store were readily <B>accessible
to teens</B>, and that they could easily be shoplifted.&quot; The team leader,
a school nurse, and the student team brought this problem to the attention
of the store employees, and the rack was moved behind the counter. The team
confirmed that this is a store where their friends and other students would
go to purchase cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In Boone, Iowa, the team reported that <B>almost all establishments</B>
(which sold tobacco products)<B> had in-store single pack displays in front
of the counter</B>. Again, the implication is that underage youth could
easily steal the packs. When a team member (who happened to be a local sheriff)
brought this fact to the attention of a store employee, he replied &quot;What
do I care? The tobacco industry pays for this display, so any loss due to
shoplifting doesn't come out of our pocket.&quot; This team plans to release
its findings to the two local newspapers, and to the local radio station.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>While some rural communities indicated that none to few tobacco outlets
exist within a quarter-mile radius of schools, others, like the team from
Passaic, NJ indicated that there were a total of <B>76 tobacco outlets surrounding
one school, including candy </B>stores! The Director of the Passaic Alliance
for the Prevention of Substance Abuse told us that this project was very
enlightening for the kids who conducted the survey. &quot;The kids were
shocked to find this incredibly high number of tobacco outlets on the streets
surrounding their school! Also noteworthy, many of the stores which sold
cigarettes were mom &amp; pop-type stores, which often sell candy and items
that appeal to youth.&quot; Additionally, the Director plans to submit the
survey results to the local newspaper, in order to increase citizens' awareness.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Several communities, such as Mount Vernon, OH indicated that they had
previously conducted sting operations, whereby minors attempt to purchase
tobacco products. The team from Mount Vernon has reported that during the
first sting, tobacco retailers illegally sold tobacco products to minors
44% of the time; during the second sting, the percentage dropped to 33%.
By having conducted the tobacco retail outlet counting project, other communities
may decide to follow-up with a sting operation as well. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>A high school football coach in Oshkosh, WI conducted a survey in his
community, polling 6 schools. The coach reported that &quot;students admitted
that it is easier to purchase cigarettes during certain hours...the kids
know who is working during certain shifts (friends or lenient store employees),
and will go to those stores during those times.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In New Haven, CT, the team found that in many of the tobacco retail
outlets, &quot;loosies&quot; or single cigarettes were being sold. The youth
team confirmed to one of the adults who worked with them that &quot;it is
<B>much easier for underage kids to buy </B>loosies.&quot; In this community,
the adult volunteer stated, &quot;single cigarette sales is a huge problem.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In Fayetteville, NC, an adult volunteer reported that, &quot;the availability
of tobacco near schools in their community is immense, as is advertising
for tobacco products. But more surprising is the fact that there were zero
vending machines--efforts should therefore focus on convenience stores and
gas stations.&quot; Volunteers plan to address these issues when planning
follow-up steps. <BR>

<H3>Homelessness and Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>FACTS ABOUT HOMELESSNESS</H2></center>


<P><B>The fact is. . .</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>--As many as 7 million people in the United States today are 
homeless, according to estimates by the federal government.


<P>--Half of all homeless adults--that is 3.5 million Americans--have 
a drug or alcohol problem, cites the National Coalition for the 
Homeless (NCH).


<P>--There are not enough alcohol and drug treatment services 
available for homeless people with addictions -- 80 percent of 
local treatment programs surveyed by the NCH were forced to turn 
people away. (What is the treatment capacity versus the need in 
your area?)


<P>--Homeless people with untreated substance abuse problems are at a 
higher risk for HIV infection and are more likely to have serious 
health problems and severe mental illness, reports NCH. Homeless 
people are more likely to be arrested, to be victimized on the 
streets or to suffer an early death.


<P>Many homeless people who undergo treatment for their addictions are 
able to move off the streets into temporary or permanent housing.  
For instance:


<P>--The Harbor House, a Salvation Army shelter in St. Louis, 
Missouri, provides two treatment programs for homeless people with 
substance abuse problems. Seventy-five percent of graduates from 
both programs go on to secure stable jobs and housing.


<P>--Clean and Sober Streets, a Washington. D.C.-based drug and 
alcohol treatment and rehabilitation community serving homeless 
people, said at least 70 percent of their graduates stay clean 
after graduating from the program and move into their own houses.


<P>--At the O'Hara Outreach Program for homeless men in Chicago, 95 
percent of the clients have diagnosable substance abuse problems. 
About half of these men receive treatment and of them, 75 percent 
successfully graduate and go on to obtain housing.

<P>PROVIDING ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT REDUCES HOMELESSNESS


<P>BOSTON--Paul Smith makes his home on the streets. Most nights he can be found on a park bench, huddled beneath a 
tattered blanket with a whiskey bottle clutched close to his chest. 
(Replace with an example of homelessness in your area.)


<P>Although this is a lonely situation, Paul is far from alone. Close 
to seven million single adults in the United States today are 
homeless, according to statistics released by the federal 
government. And half--or about 3.5 million--of these men and women 
have alcohol and drug addictions, reports the National Coalition 
for the Homeless.


<P>But despite these high numbers, treatment options are very limited 
for people who can't afford to pay. And those programs that do 
exist can not begin to handle the pressing need for their services. 
In fact, a survey of homeless treatment programs conducted by the 
National Coalition found that fully 80 percent of them were forced 
to turn people away.


<P>This means that for a lot of homeless people, their chances of 
breaking the cycle of addiction and getting into permanent homes 
look bleak.  But for those men and women who are fortunate enough 
to get into a treatment program, their odds of getting off the 
streets greatly improve.


<P>For instance, 70 percent of the graduates of Clean and Sober 
Streets, a drug and alcohol treatment community for disadvantaged 


<P>people in Washington, D.C., kick their addictions and move into 
permanent housing. And the Harbor House, a Salvation Army homeless 
shelter in St. Louis. Missouri, has a 75 percent success rate for 
graduates of its two treatment programs.


<P>&quot;We know that treatment is effective in getting homeless people 
with addictions clean and into their own homes,&quot; said William 
Arena, director of Green's Shelter for Men in Boston. &quot;The problem 
is, many Americans say they don't want to pay to provide such 
services for the homeless. What they fail to realize is that they 
are paying for the problem anyway -- just in health care and 
disability,&quot; he said. (Replace with quote from director of your 
local shelter.)


<P>&quot;If we are going to tackle homelessness and other social problems 
facing our country today, people have to wake up and realize that 
now--as the country moves to develop a national health plan--we 
must ensure that substance abuse treatment services are available 
for all who need them,&quot; Green said.

The text of the rule reads as follows:<DL><DD>"(4) Each committee shall, to the greatest extent practicable, require witnesses who appear before it to submit in advance written statements of proposed testimony and to limit their initial oral presentations to the committee to brief summaries thereof. In the case of a witness appearing in a non-governmental capacity, a written statement of proposed testimony shall include a curriculum vitae and a disclosure of the amount and source (by agency and program) of any Federal grant (or subgrant thereof) or contract (or subcontract thereof) received during the current fiscal year or either of the two previous fiscal years by the witness or by an entity represented by the witness."</DL>This rule only applies to witnesses testifying in person. It does not apply to the submission of written testimony. This language, while not changed from the draft that we recently posted, should be read in light of an explanatory paragraph attached to the resolution. The explanatory paragraph states:<DL><DD>Information Required of Public Witnesses: Committees shall require to the greatest extent practicable, that non-governmental witnesses include as part of their written testimony that is already required by House Rules to be submitted in advance, both a curriculum vitae and a disclosure by source and amount of Federal grants and contracts received by them and any organizations they represent at that hearing in the current and preceding two fiscal years, to the extent that such information is relevant to the subject matter of, and the witness' representational capacity at, that hearing. The purpose of these requirements is to give committee members, the public, and the press a more detailed context in which to consider a witness' testimony in terms of their education, experience, and the extent to which they or the organizations being represented have benefited from Federal grants and contracts related to their appearance. It is not the intention of this section, for instance, to require individuals to disclose the amounts of Federal entitlements they have received, such as from Medicare or Social Security or other income support payments or individual benefits, or to require farmers to disclose amounts received in crop or commodity price support payments. Instead, the disclosure requirement is designed to elicit information from those who have received Federal grants or contracts for the purpose of providing the government or other individuals or entities with specified goods, services, or information. While failure to comply fully with the requirement would not give rise to a point of order against the witness testifying, it could result in an objection to including the witness' written testimony [in]? the hearing record in absence of such disclosure.</DL>This explanatory paragraph, while not included in the text of the rule itself, appears to limit a witness' written obligation to include only those federal funds that are "relevant to the subject matter of...that hearing."<br><br>The Alliance will work to promote the narrowest interpretation of the rule, and will keep you posted on our efforts. We would like to hear your comments and thoughts.<br><br>The Alliance for Justice's web page <www.afj.org> will also be up to date on the developments of this alert.<br><br>

<H2><CENTER>JOIN TOGETHER TOBACCO PROJECT DESCRIPTION </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Purpose Of This Project: For communities to count the number of outlets
(i.e. convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, gas stations and
vending machines, etc.) that sell cigarettes within a quarter-mile radius
of a public school. You can then use this information to determine the underage
tobacco policies and priorities of these stores. 
<H3>Why You Should Participate:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>To measure the extent of cigarette availability near schools in your
community. 
<LI>To release this information to the press. 
<LI>To raise public awareness in your community about underage smoking.
</OL>
<H3>HOW TO GET STARTED: </H3>
<OL>
<LI>Use the FACT SHEET, the PROJECT DESCRIPTION and the suggestions on HOW
TO ORGANIZE LOCAL GROUPS to alert residents to the problem of youth access
to tobacco and get them to join up with you to assess the extent of the
problem locally. Be sure to include youth in your efforts! 
<LI>Select a school (elementary, middle or high school) in your community
that will be your base. Pick a day and distribute copies of the WORKSHEET
we've provided to participants. Ask them to go out and count the number
of stores and vending machines within a quarter-mile radius of that school
that sell tobacco products and record their results of these worksheets.
Tally the results from all the worksheets onto the RESULTS FORM for the
scope of tobacco availability in this area. Disseminate the results to the
media and other interested groups and also fax a copy back to Join Together.
<LI>Use the SAMPLE PITCH LETTER to interest your local media in coming along
with you to compile this data. This could make a good news story in your
local paper or on a local television station. Suggest a newspaper photographer
accompany you as well. 
<LI>Arrange an editorial board meeting with the editorial editor of your
local newspaper and use the national statistics from the fact sheet, as
well as your local findings, as talking points. Ask the newspaper to run
an editorial suggesting ACTION STEPS the community can take to reduce the
problem. For instance, the editorial might urge retailers to remove cigarette
displays that appeal to youth and to place tobacco products behind counters
to make them less available. Tailor the SAMPLE OP-ED with your findings
and ask the newspaper to run it to encourage residents to get involved in
local efforts to reduce youth access to tobacco. 
<LI>Use the examples of WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE for suggestions on how to
tackle the availability of tobacco in your area. Use the RESOURCES and FURTHER
READING to develop your own communitywide strategy.

HOW TO ORGANIZE LOCAL GROUPS </CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
It is easier to bring about lasting change when you have the support of
a cross-section of organizations and people representing your community.
That's why it is important to try to involve as many groups of people as
possible in your efforts to count the number of stores and outlets that
sell tobacco within a quarter-mile of a local public school. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to helping you with this project, these groups can also offer
valuable resources to help your organization be more successful. <BR>
<BR>
Some groups that can assist your efforts: 
<UL>
<LI>Students 
<LI>Parents 
<LI>Teachers 
<LI>Parent/Teacher Organizations 
<LI>Teachers' Unions 
<LI>Highway Safety Agencies 
<LI>Insurance Companies 
<LI>Health Care Workers 
<LI>Public Health Care Officials 
<LI>Police 
<LI>Media 
<LI>MADD 
<LI>SADD 
<LI>Neighborhood groups 
<LI>Civic organizations 
<LI>Chamber of Commerce 
<LI>Local legislators 
<LI>Religious groups 
<LI>Senior Citizens 
</UL>
Some ways to get these groups to join you: 
<OL>
<LI>Publicize your event in the calendar section of your local newspaper
and ask your local radio station to mention it on the air. 
<LI>Call representatives from these groups and extend a personal invitation.
<LI>Send a written announcement in the mail. 
<LI>Put up posters in schools, grocery stores and churches 
<LI>Announce this project in your organization's newsletter, in the school
newspaper, and through a mailing to parents and the media.

<FORM method=POST action="/JTO/issues/Homeless/Homeless_SampleOutput.nclk">
<P><B>ALCOHOL AND DRUG Treatment is Crucial TO REDUCE  HOMELESSNESS</B>


<P>For seven million Americans today, home is a cardboard box or a park bench or the back seat of an abandoned car. Or if they are lucky, a bed in an emergency shelter.Homelessness is sweeping the nation, as more and more people find it increasingly difficult to find affordable housing. And about half--or 3.5 million--of these men and women suffer from alcohol or drug addictions, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless, making it hard for them to hold down a job.


<P>Those with substance abuse problems who do make it into temporary shelters are steered by staff into detox programs, but severely limited space in these programs means that not everyone gets the services they need. In fact, a survey of treatment programs that serve homeless persons by NCH found that 80 percent of them are forced to turn people away.


<P>This means that for a lot of homeless people, their chances of breaking the cycle of addiction look bleak.  This is tragic, since many programs treating homeless alcoholics and addicts have been successful in getting them off the streets and into permanent homes.


<P>For instance, The Harbor House, a Salvation Army shelter in St. Louis, Missouri, provides two treatment programs for homeless people with substance abuse problems. Seventy-five percent of graduates from both programs go on to secure stable jobs and housing. And Clean and Sober Streets, a Washington. D.C.-based drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation community serving homeless people, said at least 70 percent of their graduates stay clean after graduating from the program and move into their own homes.


<P>But the waiting lists for programs like as these are long. And for those addicts who live on the streets, every day can feel like an eternity.


<P>That's why as the nation undertakes health care reform, we must make sure that adequate alcohol and drug treatment services are available for all Americans. You can help educate your public officials about the link between substance abuse problems and homelessness. The fact is, we all ay for substance abuse problems -- the choice is whether to pay to treat these problems and help people go on to lead productive lives and get permanent homes or whether we would rather pay for the disability and health care costs for men and women who remain homeless due to untreated addictions.

<TITLE>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OLDER AMERICANS: WARNING SIGNS</TITLE>

<H3>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OLDER AMERICANS</H3>

<H2>WARNING SIGNS THAT DRINKING MAY BE A PROBLEM</H2>
</center>

<P>Many older people who drink do so because they are lonely or bored with their lives. The problem could get worse with time if the person does not receive help. Health care experts say the following warning signs indicate when drinking could be a problem. You may want to repackage this list to include your organization's newsletter; post it at senior centers, your local library or supermarkets; or ask your community newspaper to run it along with a list of local resources people can call for help.


<UL>
<LI>Do you neglect your personal appearance when you drink?


<LI>Do you drink so much you forget to feed your pets and clean your house?


<LI>Do you drink in the middle of the day?


<LI>Do you suffer injuries as a result of your drinking?


<LI>Do you become defensive if someone mentions your drinking?


<LI>Do you seek out people with whom you can drink?


<LI>Do you avoid places where no drinking takes place?


<LI>Do you experience:

<UL>
<LI>a flushed face?
<LI>trembling?
<LI>gaps in memory?
<LI>depression?
<LI>fatigue?
<LI>weight loss?
<LI>aggression?
</UL>


</UL>


<P>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, you may want to:

<UL>
<LI>Talk to a family member or a friend about this problem.
<LI>Call your doctor or local addiction center for help.
<LI>Attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting or seek out another self-help group.
<LI>Get help as soon as you can. The problem will only get worse with time.
</UL>


<P>If you would like more information about older people and alcohol, call the American Association of Retired Persons at (202) 434-2200.

<H2><CENTER>Some Facts About Inhalants</CENTER>
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Inhalants -- including glue, paint and other regular household products
-- are the third most abused substances among 12 to 14-year-olds, after
alcohol and tobacco.<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">1 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>As many as one in every five students in the United States has sniffed
or huffed (inhaled through the mouth) such products as markers, gasoline
and air fresheners by the time they reach seventh grade.<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">2
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Inhalant use is on the rise. The number of 8th graders reporting having
used inhalants at least once in their lifetime rose from 20 percent in 1994
to 22 percent in 1995. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">3</A> <BR>
<BR>
<LI>One of the greatest dangers is that while many youth admit to sniffing
some toxic items, they do not consider this to be inhalant abuse. These
products are easily available, free or inexpensive, legal and may give a
pleasurable effect by depressing the central nervous system. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">4
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Today, young people and adults abuse more than 1,000 common products.
These inhalants are dangerous chemicals that are not intended for human
consumption, and they do irreversible damage to the human body when misused.
<A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">5 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>People who abuse inhalants on a regular basis put themselves at risk
for permanent and severe brain damage. This is because the human brain is
composed of about one-third fatty tissue. Inhalant vapors react with these
fatty tissues by literally dissolving them. Therefore, chronic inhalant
abusers may permanently lose the ability to perform everyday tasks like
walking, talking and thinking. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">6</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Sudden Sniffing Death syndrome frequently occurs when someone inhales
high concentration aerosol sprays, model airplane glue and spot removers.
These items emit especially toxic fumes absorbed by the brain cells, kidneys,
liver and bone marrow. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">7</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Inhalant use often leads to other illicit drug use. Youngsters may try
inhalants first because they are legal, easy to get, inexpensive and difficult
to detect. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">8 </A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Because the chemicals in inhalants enter the lungs in such high concentrations,
they can have a more toxic affect than any other type of abused drug. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">9
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Each year, hundreds of children die from inhalant use, yet many parents
and educators remain ignorant of this silent epidemic. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">10
</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Nearly nine out of 10 parents say they would be very surprised if they
found out their children were using inhalants. <A HREF="Inhalant_Sources.html">11

Tony Knowles announced today the State of Alaska has been sued by four tobacco companies in an attempt to prevent the state from recovering millions of dollars in state and Medicaid funds spent providing for Alaskans seriously and fatally injured by cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The four firms -- Philip Morris; Brown & Williamson; Lorillard; and R. J. Reynolds -- filed suit against Attorney General Bruce Botelho in federal district court in Anchorage on Wednesday.<br><br>"I hope this proves to be the straw that breaks Joe Camel's back," Knowles said. "This lawsuit is the tobacco industry's attempt to avoid financial responsibility for the injuries its products have caused Alaskans. The industry has targeted Alaska children, deliberately withheld safer products and has misled the public about the addiction and danger of smoking. It's outrageous that the tobacco industry would try to silence the state just because we were thinking about filing a suit, but now that they've fired the first shot, I'll gladly go into the battle."<br><br>The lawsuit comes as an apparent preemptive strike to prevent Alaska from joining other states that have filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry. Knowles has been considering a suit to recover the state's costs to treat smoking related illnesses and in December, Attorney General Botelho wrote selected law firms experienced in complex litigation, seeking proposals to undertake such litigation on a contingency fee basis.<br><br>In its lawsuit, the tobacco companies seek to block any such state action. Among other claims, the tobacco companies argue that warning labels on cigarette packs exempt the companies from any responsibility for harm caused by their product, that a state lawsuit would violate the tobacco companies First Amendment right to say that nicotine is not addictive, and that a state lawsuit would "severely and adversely impact interstate commerce in the sale of cigarettes."<br><br>"The tobacco industry has filed similar preemptive lawsuits against other states and has never won," said Attorney General Bruce Botelho. "We also expect to prevail in this lawsuit which will pave the way for recovering monetary damages from the tobacco industry for injuries their products have caused and the costs to the state Medicaid system. This litigation is also important because it entitles the State of Alaska to participate in any global resolution of nationwide tobacco litigation that is now pending."<br><br>"This lawsuit is important to every Alaskan," Knowles said. "As state revenues become scarce, we cannot stand by and allow an industry to market dangerous products that cause millions of dollars in damages which have to be paid for with state Medicaid funds and by every employer and employee that contributes to a medical plan. The industry cannot be allowed to continue to prey on Alaska children by marketing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco directly to them."<br><br>Knowles cited several statistics on the effect of smoking in Alaska:<UL><LI>72 percent of Alaska high school students report having tried smoking, resulting in 21.1 percent becoming frequent cigarette users. The national average among high school students is 13.8 percent;<LI>Tobacco use among Alaska adults, 28.9 percent, is the second highest in the nation;<LI>Smoking-related illnesses result in the deaths of 470 Alaskans a year, and direct medical care costs estimated at $96.5 million annually.<LI>When indirect costs such as lost earnings and productivity are included, the total estimated economic impact of smoking on Alaska is estimated at $300 million annually.<LI>Cigarette smoking caused more deaths in Alaska from 1992 to 1994 than AIDS, alcohol, airplane crashes, falls, fires, firearms, and motor vehicle crashes combined.</UL>"Litigation alone will not adequately address the smoking problem in Alaska," Knowles said. "Education comes first in my three step plan. We need to work with schools to educate children about the dangers of smoking and educate communities about the real costs of tobacco. Secondly, the legislature needs to take action on my dollar a pack increase in the state's tobacco tax. This tax is a proven measure which will reduce teen smoking. And then comes litigation to recover the costs that smoking and smokeless tobacco has incurred on the state treasury."<br><br>Knowles will introduce legislation calling for a dollar a pack increase in the tobacco tax tomorrow, the first day of the 20th Alaska Legislature.<br><br>###<br><br>

Today I want to talk about how to build upon the progress we've made together in working against crime and violence, and especially how we can fight against youth crime.<br><br>Four years ago it seemed to many Americans as if the forces of crime and violence had gained an intractable hold over our country, and law-abiding Americans were afraid that from now on they would just have to put up with the insecurity and loss that goes with rampant crime. I was determined to turn that around, to give people the tools they need to take back their streets and schools and neighborhoods, to reestablish a sense of security and true freedom in our country, and to restore our people's faith in the power of law and order.<br><br>We had a comprehensive plan to fight crime -- to put 100,000 new community police officers on the street and tough penalties on the books; to keep guns away from criminals by passing the Brady Bill and banning assault weapons; to steer young people away from crime, gangs and drugs in the first place. This approach is working.<br><br>This week the FBI reported that serious crime dropped another three percent last year, dropping for the fifth year in a row, the longest decline in more than 25 years. This is great news -- not because it gives us a chance to sit back and rest on our laurels, but because it does show all of us that if we work together we can make a difference.<br><br>Now that we've finally turned the crime on the run, we have to redouble our efforts. We have to drive the forces of violence further and further into retreat. And as we move forward we have to remember  that we're not just fighting against crime, we're fighting for the kind of nation we want to build together for the 21st century. For an America where people feel safe when they walk around the block at night, and untroubled when they kiss their children good-bye in the morning; an America where nobody's grandmother lives across the street from a crackhouse and nobody's child walks to school through a neighborhood overrun by gangs. We're fighting for our children and for their future.<br><br>As I begin my second term as President, the next stage in our fight must center on keeping our children safe and attacking the scourge of juvenile crime and gangs. I want every police officer, prosecutor and citizen in America working together to keep our young people safe and young criminals off the streets. This should be America's top priority in the fight for law and order over the next four years. I pledge it will be mine.<br><br>We must help parents protect their children and bring order and discipline to their lives. That's why I support school uniforms and community-based curfews. That's why we made zero tolerance for guns in schools the law of the land, and passed Megan's Law to demand that states tell a community whenever a dangerous sexual predator enters its midst.<br><br>Now we must do more to give young people something to say yes to -- after school, on weekends and in the summer. And we must finish the job of putting 100,000 police on our streets.<br><br>At the same time, young people must understand that if they break the law they will be punished; and if they commit violent crimes they will be punished severely. I am determined to break the backs of criminal gangs that have ruined too many lives and stolen too many futures by bringing the full force of the law against them.<br><br>One of the most difficult problems facing law enforcement in this fight is the power of gang members to thwart the criminal justice system by threatening and intimidating the witnesses against them. Too many people in too many communities will not testify about gang crimes because they are afraid of violent reprisal. We must not allow the voice of justice to be frightened into silence by the violent threats of gangs.<br><br>Today the Justice Department is releasing a report called, "Preventing Gang and Drug-Related Witness Intimidation." This report is a handbook for police officers, prosecutors and judges, to help them overcome the dangerous obstacle witness intimidation poses to the steady march of justice. It details the problems they face and helps to provide a blueprint for them to follow that will significantly help state and local gang investigation and prosecution. Starting today, the Justice Department will distribute this report to thousands of police departments, prosecutors and judges across America.<br><br>In the coming weeks, I will submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to combat youth violence and drug abuse. Together with all our other efforts against youth violence, this will be the top crime fighting priority of my second term. I've asked the Attorney General to closely examine the growing threat of witness intimidation by gangs and to recommend strong measures to stop it that can be included in this legislation. We must not allow the very gangs we're fighting to grind the wheels of justice to a halt.<br><br>Over the past four years we've shown that we can roll back crime and violence. Now is no time to let up. There is still too much of it. But if we continue to work together, to stand up for what is right, to work with our community police officers, to take responsibility for ourselves and our families and the other children in our communities who need a guiding hand and an encouraging word -- if we'll do all these things, we can keep the crime rate coming down and we can build the future our children deserve.<br><br>Thanks for listening.<br><br>END<br><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>01/13/1997</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><I>Distributed by <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</I></P>    <P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif"WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle  ISMAP></A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY>

McCaffrey has reacted strongly to the action of a Colombian court in leniently sentencing the notorious Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, leaders of the powerful Cali drug cartel. These minimal sentences based upon sentence reduction provisions of Colombian law, mean that Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and his brother Miguel, already in pre-sentence confinement, could serve as little as three to five years additional incarceration for their convictions on drug trafficking charges.<br><br>Director McCaffrey stated: "Illegal drugs have killed 100,000 Americans and cost us $300 billion over the last decade. Colombia's people, police, armed forces, and news media have suffered incredibly from this criminal activity. These artificial sentences for the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers are indicative of inadequate support for the brave efforts of Colombia's law enforcement officials and the international community, and they are wholly out of line with the seriousness of their crimes."<br><br>The United States has urged support for a justice system that would protect Colombians and Americans alike from the menace of the drug cartels. These light sentences demonstrate the urgent need for Colombia to pass sentencing reform legislation as soon as possible. The Cali cartel has continued to exert strong influence throughout government. Even when they have been convicted, drug lords have been imprisoned in facilities from which they were allowed to continue running their criminal empire.<br><br>In further demonstration of our intent to confront the power of Colombian drug gangs, the Department of Treasury&#146;s U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, working together with the Department of Justice, this week released the names of another 78 Colombian businesses and individuals that front for drug trafficking organizations, bringing to 359 the total identified to date.

<P><B>ALCOHOL AND DRUG Treatment is Crucial TO REDUCE  HOMELESSNESS</B>


<P>For many men, their homes are their castles. But for many women in the United States, these &quot;castles&quot; are filled with pain and fear. These women are the victims of domestic violence and most of them feel far from secure in their homes, knowing their spouses could strike at any time. While the attacks of battering are often unpredictable, many women know that when their husbands abuse alcohol and drugs, the beatings will be worse. In fact, alcohol and drugs are involved in up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases.


<P>Experts says that some men use these substances to give themselves permission to be more violent. Therefore, it is no surprise that such attacks are all the more severe.  Domestic violence actually accounts for almost 100,000 days of hospitalizations in this nation, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 doctors appointments each year, according to a national crime victimization survey done by the Department of Justice. Yet until recently, many victims have felt they could not tell medical personnel the truth behind their injuries, fearing for their own safety and for their children.  But today, more and more domestic violence victims are beginning to speak out -- and the country is beginning to listen. The brutal murder of domestic-violence victim Nicole Brown Simpson has made it impossible for people to look the other way anymore.


<P>While this growing attention to this issue is crucial, that alone is not enough. As a nation it is important that we not only create avenues for women to voice their ordeals, we need to respond with viable escapes from their ongoing nightmares. We can do this by treating batterers -- both for their violent patterns and for their substance abuse addictions. As the country reforms its health care system, we must ensure that proper substance abuse services are available to all who need them.

<b>Marijuana and Tobacco Use Still Rising Among 8th and 10th Graders</b><br><br>

Marijuana and tobacco use increased among eighth and tenth graders between 1995 and 1996, while use of these substances remained generally level among twelfth graders, according to the 22nd annual "Monitoring the Future" survey, released today by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The survey also showed an increase in the use of alcohol by eighth graders. 
<br><br>
The survey showed increases in lifetime, annual, current (use within the past 30 days) and daily use of marijuana by eighth and tenth graders, continuing a trend that began in the early 1990s. Among twelfth graders, rates of marijuana use remained high and increased for lifetime use, but for the first time since 1993, showed no significant change in annual, current or daily use.
<br><br>
Cigarette smoking also continued to rise among eighth and tenth graders and remained high among twelfth graders, although there were no statistically significant changes in the high school seniors' cigarette use.
<br><br>
Daily use of alcohol increased for eighth graders, while remaining level for tenth and twelfth graders, although at high rates.
<br><br>
The findings were released at a press conference by HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala, National Drug Control Policy Director Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey (Ret.), Education Secretary Richard Riley and Transportation Secretary Frederico Pena.
<br><br>
The clear increase in use of marijuana among younger high school students stood in contrast with mixed and overall unchanged measures for other drugs. Secretary Shalala noted in particular that this year's survey shows an increasing problem with perceptions of the dangers posed by marijuana. Among eighth and tenth graders, the perceived risk of using marijuana continued to decline, while perceived risk of using other drugs either increased or remained level. 
<br><br>
"Everyone needs to give our young people the clear and unambiguous message that drugs are illegal, dangerous and wrong," Secretary Shalala said. "Marijuana today poses an increasingly serious drug abuse problem, and our children need to know that. In particular, I ask all American parents to talk with their children about drugs, and especially to talk about marijuana."
<br><br>
Five months ago, HHS launched its "Reality Check" public information campaign aimed at helping parents discuss marijuana with their children. Free materials are available from 1-800-729 6686. HHS also sponsored the first national conference on marijuana in July 1995, and is funding and disseminating findings from research on the effects of the drug. In addition, the Clinton Administration has launched a major initiative to prevent smoking by minors. FDA regulations affecting retail sales to minors and the advertising of tobacco products begin to go into effect in 1997.
<br><br>
"Increased use among students in eighth and tenth grades is a wake-up call for America," said General McCaffrey. "Because marijuana use by youth is highly correlated with future use of addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin, we must step up our efforts to prevent drug abuse among children of all ages. All adults must accept responsibility for leading and protecting our youth. Parents, educators, community and religious leaders, and the media have the power and the authority to lead our children to make healthy life choices. We must all renew our commitment, so clearly laid out in the National Drug Control Strategy, that keeping our children drug-free is our number-one priority."
<br><br>
<b>Marijuana:</b>
<br><br>
The 1996 Monitoring the Future Study found that 23.1 percent of eighth graders had tried marijuana at least once in their lifetime, compared to 19.9 percent in 1995. Among tenth graders, lifetime marijuana use increased from 34.1 percent in 1995 to 39.8 percent in 1996. Current use of marijuana among eighth graders increased from 9.1 percent in 1995 to 11.3 percent in 1996 and increased among tenth graders from 17.2 percent in 1995 to 20.4 percent in 1996.
<br><br>
Among high school seniors, there were no statistically significant increases or decreases in annual, current or daily use of marijuana from 1995 to 1996, although the percentage of seniors who had used marijuana at least once in their lifetime increased from 41.7 percent in 1995 to 44.9 percent in 1996. This is well below the peak level reported in 1979, when 60.4 percent had used marijuana at least once in their lifetime.
<br><br>
Dr. Alan I. Leshner, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the agency that funded the survey, said, "It is important that young people understand the harm and danger caused by illicit drug use. Through continuing years of objective, scientific research, this risk has become ever clearer, and not just for drugs such as cocaine and heroin but also for marijuana."
<br><br>
Research shows that marijuana is harmful to the brain, heart, lungs and immune system. It limits learning, memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills like those needed to drive a vehicle. It has been shown to damage motivation and interest in one's goals and activities. Marijuana cigarette smoke typically contains over 400 carcinogenic compounds. In addition, new evidence suggests that marijuana may be addictive and that, among heavy users, its harmful short term effects on alertness and attention span last more than 24 hours.
<br><br>
<b>Tobacco:</b>
<br><br>
Cigarette smoking continued to rise among eighth and tenth graders and remained at high levels among twelfth graders, although there were no statistically significant changes in seniors' use. Between 1995 and 1996, use of cigarettes in the past month increased from 19.1 to 21.0 percent among eighth graders and from 27.9 to 30.4 percent among tenth graders. About one-third of twelfth graders (34.0 percent) used cigarettes in the past month.
<br><br>
In 1996, the percentage of tenth graders who smoked a half pack of cigarettes or more daily, increased from 8.3 percent in 1995 to 9.4 percent in 1996. Current use of cigarettes among tenth graders increased between 1995 and 1996 for both males and females. 
<br><br>
<b>Alcohol:</b>
<br><br>
Between 1995 and 1996, the percentage of eighth graders reporting daily use of alcohol increased from 0.7 percent to 1.0 percent. In addition, the percentage of eighth graders reporting having "been drunk" in the past month increased from 8.3 percent in 1995 to 9.6 percent in 1996. Alcohol use among tenth and twelfth graders remained level but at high rates, with 21.3 percent of tenth graders and 31.3 percent of twelfth graders reporting having been drunk in the past month. 
<br><br>
<b>Other survey findings include:</b>
<UL><LI>Current use of hallucinogens decreased among twelfth graders from 4.4 percent in 1995 to 3.5 percent in 1996. Current use of LSD among tenth graders decreased from 3.0 percent in 1995 to 2.4 percent in 1996 and among twelfth graders from 4.0 percent to 2.5 percent.<LI>Current use of PCP among twelfth graders increased from 0.6 percent in 1995 to 1.3 percent in 1996.<LI>Current use of inhalants decreased among twelfth graders from 3.2 percent in 1995 to 2.5 percent in 1996. Use of inhalants among eighth and tenth graders remained stable.<LI>The survey found increases in the non-medical use of tranquilizers among eighth and tenth graders. Lifetime, annual and past month use increased among eighth graders and lifetime use increased among tenth graders from 6.0 percent in 1995 to 7.1 percent in 1996. In addition, daily use increased among seniors.<LI>Past year use of cocaine (including crack) increased among twelfth graders from 4.0 percent in 1995 to 4.9 percent in 1996. There was an increase in the percentage of tenth graders who had tried cocaine at least once in their lifetime, rising from 5.0 percent in 1995 to 6.5 percent in 1996.<LI>This is the first year that a question regarding the use of MDMA (Ecstasy) was added to the questionnaire for all three grades. Only senior data on friends' use and availability of MDMA were collected previously. In 1996, 6 percent of twelfth graders, 5.6 percent of tenth graders and 3.4 percent of eighth graders had used MDMA at least once in their lifetime.
</UL>
The 1996 Monitoring the Future Survey was conducted under a NIDA grant to the University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research. Under the direction of Dr. Lloyd Johnston, the survey was administered in the spring of 1996 to a national probability sample of 14,824 high school seniors, 15,873 tenth graders and 18,368 eighth graders in public and private schools. The study has been conducted annually since 1975, with 1996 representing the 22nd annual survey of high school seniors and the sixth year data have been collected on eighth and tenth graders. NIDA, a component of the National Institutes of Health, supports over 85 percent of the world's research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. The Institute also carries out a large variety of programs to ensure the rapid dissemination of research information and its implementation in policy and practice.

The groups, selected by the American Medical Association and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, will combine -- and build upon -- hundreds of smaller organizations, to change the environment in which young people learn about drinking.<br><br>The new campaigns -- around policies, alcohol advertising and public attitudes -- will focus on various segments of the public and, to a degree not tried before, will involve young people and broader sections of American communities.<br><br>"With the launch of this new program, we are finally taking decisive action against a major public health crisis that has taken a huge toll in the lives and futures of young Americans," said Percy Wootton, M.D., AMA president-elect. "These are powerful groups with innovative plans that can put a cork into underage drinking."<br><br>"For each of the 11 projects, an impressive number of diverse organizations have come together to collaborate and coordinate their efforts," said Steven A. Schroeder, M.D., president of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "The common goal for these newly formed coalitions is to decrease the number of health, safety, and social problems caused by underage alcohol use."<br><br>The coalitions plan actions as diverse as reducing the marketing, sales and accessibility of alcohol to young people, increasing surveillance of young drivers, educating police and judges, and creating a corps of youth leaders to influence adults and peers.<br><br>The program, entitled "Reducing Underage Drinking Through Coalitions," complements a major university high-risk drinking program announced by the AMA in October. Both programs, funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), of Princeton, N J, are directed by the American Medical Association.<br><br>Alcohol is a major cause of premature deaths in the United States, implicated in at least one-third of fatal car accidents -- the leading cause of death for teenagers. It poses risks for assault, rape, drowning, recreational injury and sexually transmitted disease, and -- though most high school and college students cannot purchase alcohol legally -- studies show that 25% of 8th graders, 51% of 12th graders and 68% of college students drink.<br><br>The 11 coalitions selected to participate in the $10.2 million, four-year program are:<UL><LI>Aspira, Inc. of Puerto Rico<LI>DC Community Prevention Partnership, Inc.<LI>Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon<LI>Governors Institute on Alcohol and Substance Abuse, Inc.

Each will receive up to $946,000 over a four-year period. None of the coalitions had worked together before as presently constituted, and none has addressed alcohol abuse with a broad, environmental focus. For half of them, this is the first time that youth will play a major role. The new program will be administered by the AMA's Office of Alcohol and Other Substances and evaluated under an independent university contract. Richard Yoast, Ph.D. is director of the AMA office.

<P>ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT HELPS REDUCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE


<P>BOSTON -- &quot;When my husband gets drunk, he slaps me around,&quot; says Ruth, a soft-spoken woman in her late 40's, with visible bruises on her arms and her neck. &quot;He gets into these rages and you never know where they will lead,&quot; she says, her voice quivering as she speaks. &quot;Like last week, he went out drinking with his friends and when he came home, he punched me so hard that I fell to the floor and I couldn't get up.&quot;


<P>Every 12 seconds in the United States a woman is battered by her mate, according to Women's Work, a public arts program run by the women's clothing manufacturer, Liz Claiborne, Inc. And many of these incidents are related to alcohol and drug abuse.  But until recently, many women were afraid to talk about their ordeals -- fearing for their safety or that of their children.  The recent brutal murder of Nicole Simpson, the ex-wife of athlete and sportscaster O.J. Simpson, brought the issue of domestic violence into the national spotlight. O.J. has been charged with Nicole's death.


<P>&quot;How many people have to die to get this country to recognize and do something about the very real problem of domestic violence?&quot; asks Lila Brown, director of the local Coalition Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse. &quot;We know that more than 2.5 million women are victims of violence in this country every year, and that alcohol and drugs are associated with up to 50 percent of all spousal attacks. Isn't it time we woke up and did something about this?&quot;


<P>While not all batterers consume alcohol, studies have shown that for those who drink, alcohol increases the chance and severity of an attack.  And it is of no surprise that the most severe batterers tend to be the heaviest drinkers. Experts explain that men who batter women drink to give themselves permission to be violent.  Medical expenses for domestic violence total from $3 to $5 billion each year, according to the Colorado Domestic Violence Coalition. And businesses lose another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and reduced productivity related to domestic violence.  In fact, a survey by the Department of Justice found that domestic violence accounts for 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 doctors appointments a year.


<P>&quot;The fact is, we can't afford not to treat substance abuse and the related domestic violence that so often results against women,&quot; Brown says. She points out that for substance abusers, treatment for domestic violence alone will not be effective without simultaneously providing treatment for the alcohol and/or drug addictions.  &quot;It is cost-effective to treat the substance abuse problem, rather than just paying for the damage that results,&quot; Brown says, adding that the damage is measured not only in money but also in lives. &quot;That's why as the nation looks to implement a new health plan, it is absolutely essential that substance abuse treatment be included in this plan for all those who need it.&quot;<p>

Califano, Jr., Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Carter Administration and President Lyndon B. Johnson's top aide for domestic affairs, today addressed The Heritage Foundation, and urged Democratic and Republican lawmakers to end their denial of the impact of substance abuse on the cost of federal entitlement programs. In his speech, "The Hunt for a Drug Free America: Look Under Every Rock -- and in the Mirror," Califano released preliminary figures showing that spending on Medicare and other federal entitlement programs linked to drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse equals about $70 billion -- more than half the projected $124 billion budget deficit for fiscal 1997.<br><br>"Tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse slips its hands deep in the taxpayers' pockets, while our lawmakers look the other way," said Califano, president of The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA)*. The CASA study on federal entitlements and substance abuse, which will be released in its entirety this spring, finds that:<UL><LI>Spending on federal entitlement programs linked to drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse will be about $70 billion in 1997.<LI>Medicare alone will spend at least $30 billion in 1997 to treat injuries due to substance abuse, largely smoking.<LI>Social security disability will write more than $5 billion in checks to individuals disabled by tobacco, alcohol and drugs (80 percent due to tobacco).<LI>At least 20 percent of welfare recipients -- about one million mothers -- have drug and alcohol problems severe enough to require treatment before they will be able to benefit from literacy and job training, or hold a job.</UL>"Yet neither the Clinton Administration nor the Republican Congress provides any funds in their reform packages to treat these women that are to be moved off the welfare rolls," Califano said. "Cutting off their benefits without offering them treatment will only scatter more homeless individuals on our streets and produce more crime and more abused and neglected children."<br><br>The CASA study on federal entitlement programs will assess the cost of substance abuse to Medicare; Medicaid; Veterans, Federal employee, and other health programs; Social Security Disability Insurance; Temporary Assistance to Needy Families; Food Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income for indigent individuals who are aged, blind or disabled.<br><br>Califano, who as President Johnson's chief domestic policy advisor was an architect of the Great Society program, said that government alone will never solve the problem of substance abuse and addiction. "Indeed I believe that government's responsibility, significant as it is, is not paramount here."<br><br>"The road to a drug free America lies not in the executive agencies, congressional committees and government programs, but in our children and their parents; in their trust in God and in each other; in their acceptance of the moral and spiritual values that should guide their lives," said Califano. "There's a lot of work that needs to be done on that road. And most of that work is a mom and pop operation," he added.<br><br>The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University is the only national organization that brings together under one roof all the professional disciplines needed to study and combat all types of substance abuse as they affect all aspects of society. CASA's goals are: to inform Americans of the economic and social costs of substance abuse and its impact on their lives; to assess what works in prevention, treatment and law enforcement; and to encourage individuals and institutions to take responsibility to combat substance abuse and addiction.<br><br>For more information, visit <A HREF="http://www.casacolumbia.org">CASA's website</A>.<br><br>* The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University is neither affiliated with, nor sponsored by, the National Court Appointed Special Advocate Association (also known as "CASA") or any of its member organizations, or any other organization with the name of "CASA".<br><br>###<br><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>02/05/1997</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><I>Distributed by <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</I></P>    <P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif"WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle  ISMAP></A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY>
