<h2><a name="Business"><a href="http://www.manhattan.edu/business/buspage.html">Business</a></a></h2>

<h3>Historical Note</h3>
In September, 1926, a two-year program of courses in business was offered to qualified students
who had completed two years in Arts and Sciences. The success of this program prompted the
establishment of Business in the spring of 1927. Degrees of Bachelor of Science in Business were
awarded to the first graduates of the program in June, 1928. During the next two years the
program of professional subjects was again revised and extended to a four year curriculum of
business and cultural courses. The first class to complete this curriculum conducted totally within
Business was graduated in 1932. In 1933 the degree designation was changed to Bachelor of
Business Administration. In 1970, as a result of an extensive curriculum revision which
emphasizes a balance of humanities, science, social sciences, and professional business courses,
the degree was changed to the Bachelor of Science (Business Administration). At the same time,
the baccalaureate degree program in the Evening Session was merged into Business.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Mission Statement">Mission Statement</a></h3>
The mission of the Manhattan College School of Business is to develop in its students the
communication, critical thinking, creative problem solving, professional and interpersonal skills
and ethical behavior which are essential to lifelong career success in a rapidly changing
environment of technological advancement, shifting social patterns, and increasing global
interdependence. 

<p>The mission is realized by (1) offering undergraduate programs that integrate a broad liberal
education with majors in Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Economics, Finance,
Management and Marketing, singly, or in combination, or with an International Business
concentration; and (2) nurturing a pluralistic, caring campus community.

<p>The School of Business also offers Masters programs in Accounting and Finance for those
wishing to further develop their technical ability in these fields and has a general Masters of
Business Administration degree, with concentration in Management Information Systems or
Human Resources Management, for those non-business baccalaureate graduates who desire to
advance or change their career.

<p>The Masters program enhances the undergraduate program by providing faculty members more
opportunity to pursue scholarship and maintain currency with business practice. Both are
enhanced by the College's network of recognized alumni and its location on the edge of New
York City, the world's global marketplace.

<p>Faculty are committed primarily to excellence in teaching and service to their students and the
academic community and also to scholarship and consulting requisite to being contemporary with
global business practice and theory.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Curriculum and Programs">Curriculum and Programs</a></h3>
In order to accomplish the mission of Business, the curriculum is structured to achieve a balance
of liberal arts courses, and professional business courses thus bringing together liberal education
and professional business preparation. The program in liberal arts is divided among the areas of
humanities, sciences, and social sciences. The professional business program, which includes core
courses required of all students and the study of a major field, offers the student a balanced
approach to the two aspects of the various business disciplines--theory and application to
practical problems. This practical/theoretical approach heightens the ability of the student to
reason and analyze a situation in the context of a given environment thus developing in him or her
a practical outlook that reflects business reality. In addition, the School provides its students with
an exposure to the world of business. The societal considerations of the firm and the behavioral
aspects of the managerial function are interwoven throughout the business curriculum. The focus
in the professional area is on executive action in both business and non-business organizations.

<p>The program of liberal arts courses, which comprises approximately one-half of the total
curriculum, blends humanistic knowledge with professional career preparation. The sequence of
general business related courses examines the fundamentals which underlie the practice of
business. The sequence includes courses in accounting and mathematics relating to the use of
quantitative data in decision-making and control. Other courses in this sequence are economics,
law, management, marketing and behavioral sciences. In each of these courses emphasis is placed
on essential analytical tools and their use in business problems of a specific area and prepares the
student to enter a career in a functional field or undertake graduate study. The major fields are
accounting, computer information systems, economics, finance, management, and marketing.

<p>Business offers a graduate program in business administration whose primary objective is to
develop professional managers and prepare prospective managers to function actively in positions
of broad administrative responsibility in business, government, education, health, religion, and
other complex organizations. The program leads to a Master of Business Administration (MBA)
degree in any one of the following areas of concentration: accounting, finance, management,
management information systems, and marketing.  Global Business studies may be taken as a
second or co-major.

<p>The Master of Business Administration Program is a nontraditional part time program offered by
Business through the Graduate Division. It consists of 18 credits of prerequisite undergraduate
courses and 39 credits of graduate courses. Most of the course offerings are given on Saturdays.
Students from the other undergraduate programs at Manhattan College who take the minor in
business will have completed most of the prerequisite credits required for entry into Manhattan's
Master of Business Administration program. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Major Fields">Major Fields</a></h3>
<strong>Accounting</strong>. The concentration in accounting centers around financial and operational
communications for business and governmental units. The program prepares for careers in public
accounting, industrial or private accounting, governmental and institutional accounting, or for a
general business career. Accounting education provides a sound basis for advancement to
managerial positions and is a desirable background for certain non-business professions, such as
law.

<p><strong>Computer Information Systems.</strong> This area of concentration enables a student to determine the
informational needs of an organization and identify the patterns of information flow which satisfy
those needs. The program includes studies in computer hardware and software, programming,
computer decision systems, file and communication systems, operations analysis and simulation,
management information systems, and the analysis and design of information systems. The CIS
major will find excellent career opportunities in systems analysis and management information
systems. By combining CIS with such functional areas as accounting, finance, marketing, or
management, the CIS graduate will be able to participate more effectively in system development.

<p><strong>Economics.</strong> A concentration in business economics is designed for those students whose primary
interest is oriented towards an examination of economic relationships. Students seeking a broad
global economic background for government, industry, or law should select this program.

<p><strong>Finance. </strong>The concentration in finance enables the student to examine the tasks and techniques of
financial management within business and government units and to study the elaborate structure
of financial institutions and the broad range of financial instruments which are utilized in the
global economic system. The program stresses financial analysis and decision-making and is
interdisciplinary.

<p><strong>Global Business Studies.</strong> This program develops in the student a thorough and rigorous global
perspective and understanding of the international environment and markets. Such understanding
is essential for any American business person who competes domestically and in the international
arena. This field is interdisciplinary in nature and includes studies in economics, finance,
marketing, management and government. Students who are interested in pursuing careers in the
international phase of business or government may pursue it only as a second major. Proficiency
in a foreign language is strongly recommended.

<p><strong>Management.</strong> Programs which include a concentration in management foster an understanding of
the role of management in today's global organizations. The program examines various theories
of management; explains the skills and activities used by management in fulfilling managerial
functions; explores the possibility of instituting new techniques in management and seeks to
arouse interest in management as a growing field. The major emphasis is on behavioral aspects of
organizations and administrative actions, in both business and non-commercial organizations.
Special attention is given to the social responsibilities of the business executive and the role of the
modern corporation in society.

<p><strong>Marketing.</strong> This field of study encompasses those functions involved in determining consumer
needs and wants, developing products and services, and communicating with and delivering these
goods to the consumer. The program emphasizes a managerial approach; is globally oriented; and
is aimed at the development of marketing managers. The curriculum stresses analysis and
decision-making in the marketing process and is interdisciplinary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Double Majors">Double Majors</a></h3>
The business curriculum provides seven major fields of study from which the student can elect one
or more for in-depth study. A student who opts to major in two areas of concentration should
utilize the business and free electives in such a way as to satisfy the requirements for the second
major which consist of fifteen credits. However, accounting majors who wish to major in a second
area of concentration will be required to complete nine extra credits in addition to 120 credits
required for graduation due to the reduced number of business and free electives available to
them. Liberal arts electives cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of any business major or
minor.
<a name="Minor Programs">
<p><strong>Minor Programs</a>.</strong> In order to provide an opportunity for the student to broaden his/her
educational experiences, students in Business are able to minor in a discipline other than their
major field. Through special arrangements with Arts and Sciences, a student may take a minor
program consisting of approximately 15 credits in the humanities, sciences, or social sciences. A
student may take a minor in any of the major fields offered by Business. This program consists of
9 credits. Details of these programs may be found under the heading "Minor Fields" in the pages
to follow.

<p>All major and minor credits must be taken at Manhattan College. A minimum grade of C is
necessary to receive major or minor credit. Also all 300 and 400 level Business courses must be
taken at Manhattan College.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><strong><a name="Guidance Program">Guidance Program</a></strong></h3>
The guidance and advisory program for students in Business is conducted by an Academic
Advisor in conjunction with the Department Chairpersons. The Academic Advisor counsels all
freshmen, sophomores, and transfer students, as well as any juniors and seniors when necessary.
All freshmen take the First-Year Seminar (BUSN 111), a mandatory nine week course designed
to assist students in acquiring the skills necessary for academic success.  All students select their
major at the end of their sophomore year. Programs of study for freshmen, sophomores, and
transfer students, as well as co-approval of athletes, basic studies, and validation students are
approved by the Academic Advisor. Programs of study for juniors and seniors are approved by
the Department Chairpersons who act as advisors to the students in selecting a major. Each
Department Chairperson is responsible for advising students majoring in his/her area. They are
closely associated with professional business organizations and industrial groups carrying out
related activities,  thus assuring maximum service to the student in preparing to meet the
requirements for the degree, for advanced professional study, and for placement. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="Prelegal Advisory Committee">
<p><strong>Prelegal Advisory Committee</a>.</strong> Business students who plan to enter law should avail themselves
of the services of this Faculty Committee, page 69.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Cooperative Education for Credit">Cooperative Education for Credit</a></h3>
Students who are participating in a Cooperative Education internship who may wish to integrate
their field learning with that in the classroom in a formal way, may apply for Cooperative
Education for credit. Such students will be required first to seek a faculty member in an
appropriate department who is willing to supervise their project and present to him/her a detailed
proposal outlining the educational objectives to be achieved, the relevant activities to be
undertaken, resources to be used, methods of research, reading assignments, interviews, etc.
These details along with other requirements for completing the course must be worked out and
finalized with the supervising faculty and approved by the Department Chairperson and Dean
prior to registering for the appropriate course (Coop Education 402/403). Students in Business
will be permitted to enroll in Cooperative Education for credit only if the participating firm has
agreed to pay the student a salary for the student's work.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Tutorial/Reading and Research">Tutorial/Reading and Research</a></h3>
Under very special circumstances and with the approval of the Dean, students may register for a
specific course on a tutorial basis or may submit a proposal and ask a faculty member in an
appropriate department to supervise a well defined course of study that involves reading and
research in a specific discipline. Topics, projects, methods of research and course requirements,
e.g., term papers, quizzes, exams, etc., must be worked out with the supervising professor and
approved by the department chairperson. Students wishing to pursue a course on a tutorial basis
must register for a specific course while students pursuing reading and research must register for
departmental course No. 470. No more than three credits may be completed on this basis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Student Organizations">Student Organizations</a></h3>
Organizations of special interest to the students in Business include: The Society of Accountants;
American Marketing Association, Student Chapter (Marketing Club); Delta Mu Delta, National
Honor Society in Business; Computer Information Systems (CIS) Club; Alpha Iota Delta, The
National Honor society for Computer Information Systems and Decision Sciences, Delta Chi

<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>Historical Note</h3>
Teacher preparation began at Manhattan College in 1921 with programs for the preparation of
Sisters and Brothers of the Christian Schools. In 1935, areas of preparation were extended by the
establishment of the Department of Physical Education within the School of Arts and Sciences.
By 1964, a distinct Division of Teacher Preparation was needed to devote more attention to
programs leading to teacher certification. The School of Teacher Preparation was founded in
1970 and expanded to include Health Education with teaching or community health service
options the next year. In the early 1980's, the Physical Education curriculum was modified to
include concentrations in Pre-physical Therapy and Exercise Science. The year 1983 brought the
inclusion of Special Education as an area of certification. The Radiological and Health Sciences
Program joined the School in 1984. During the same year, the title School of Education and
Human Services was adopted to reflect the broad diversity of programs offered within the School.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Objectives</h3>
In the tradition of Saint John Baptist de La Salle, the "Patron of all Teachers," Education prepares
dedicated professionals for careers in teaching and allied health services. A strong liberal
education emphasizes effective communication, scientific literacy, and multi-cultural awareness.
Course work and practical experiences in Education provide those skills necessary for work in a
school or a clinical setting. Education seeks to develop broadly educated teachers and health
service professionals who possess competencies necessary for certification in their area of study
or for continued study through graduate course work, who understand current issues and trends,
and possess dedication to service for others.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Curricula</h3>
A strong core of liberal arts and sciences courses underlies all programs in Education. Students
seeking teacher certification complete the state required courses through their education major.
Future preschool, elementary, middle and secondary and dually certified school teachers must also
concentrate in one science or arts area for certification. Physical, Health, and Special Education
and Radiological and Health Science programs include those courses that provide necessary
professional expertise. All students in Education complete the cumulating experience of student
teaching, professional practicum, or clinical internship where they are expected to display the
ability to apply knowledge gained through previous course work and field experiences.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Requirements for student teaching, professional practicum, clinical internship. </strong>To register
for student teaching, professional practicum, or clinical internship, a student must meet the
following school requirements:

<p>1. Enrollment in the School;

<p>2. Cumulative index of 2.50 or better;

<p>3. Major and academic concentration (Education students only) index of 2.5 or        better; and

<p>4. Recommendation by the Chair of the Department or the Program Director. Additionally, senior
status is required to register for student teaching or professional practicum.

<p>Additional requirements may be imposed by the students major department.  Students already
graduated from the School may not register for undergraduate student teaching  

<p>professional practicum or clinical internship.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Guidance, Enrichment, and Honors">Guidance, Enrichment, and Honors</a></h3>
The Academic Advisor of the School oversees course registration and compliance with program,
academic, and certification requirements for all students in Education. Faculty members meet with
students regularly for advisement on course selection, professional and field experiences, and
general academic or professional concerns.

<p>Success in health service and education areas depends in great measure on cultural awareness,
knowledge in subject content, and skills in communication. Future professionals are urged to take
advantage of campus activities of a religious, cultural, and academic nature. Participation in
opportunities for self expression such as forums, dramatics, public speaking, and publications,
particularly in Vistas, the Journal of the School of Education and Human Services, is also
encouraged.

<p>Students who maintain a 3.50 or better index may, after their first semester, be invited to
participate in the Honors Program of the Schools of Arts, Education, and Science. This program
offers additional cultural and intellectual experiences to the outstanding student.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Honors">Honors</a></h3>
Besides the scholastic honors offered by the College, students in Education are eligible for
membership in national honor societies. Students pursuing teacher certification are eligible as
juniors or seniors for selection into the Mu Sigma Chapter of Kappa Delta Pi if they meet the
criteria established by society. Students in the department of Physical Education may be invited to
join the Alpha Eta Chapter of Phi Epsilon Kappa during their sophomore year. Students in the
Radiological and Health Sciences program may qualify for admission to Alpha Beta Gamma after
their junior year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Programs of Study</h3>

<h3><a name="The Academic Teachers Curriculum">Teachers of Academic Subjects 7-12, and PreK-6</a> </h3>
<h3>(Elementary Curriculum)</h3>
The freshman year emphasizes courses in the liberal arts and sciences. Advisement sessions are
offered by faculty members to help first year students in the evaluation of their abilities and
interests in preparation for teaching. Students are required to maintain satisfactory scholastic
performance and to carefully consider physical, mental, speech, language and other standards
established for professionals in teaching.

<p>The remaining three years of the program are arranged according to the subject area students are
preparing to teach. Requirements for the education major and for teacher certifications are
satisfied within this time.

<p><strong>Concentrations.</strong> Students concentrate in the subject they intend to teach such as English, history,
Social Studies, foreign language, science, or mathematics. The concentration provides multiple
options for allied careers should a student ultimately choose a profession outside teaching. Each
course in the student's concentration must be passed with a minimum grade of C. Depending on
ability and selected program, some students pursue a double concentration or strength in a second
area that could be called a minor. With permission of the Chair of Education, it is possible to
minor in Business, Science, or Arts. These minors are outlined in the appropriate sections of the
catalog.

<h3><a name="The Physical Education Curriculum">The Physical Education Curriculum</a></h3>
This curriculum is structured to provide students with a breadth of experience in liberal and
professional subjects. Religious studies and philosophy requirements seek to present the values
expected of a person preparing for a professional career. Every effort is made in the professional
courses to correlate the theory of general education as it applies to physical education.

<p>The curriculum provides a suitable foundation for continued study in graduate schools in such
areas as teaching in specific content areas, special education, motor development, health,
physical/occupational therapy, adult fitness and cardiac rehabilitation, administration and
supervision, and recreation specializations for multiple agencies.

<p>The following three programs are offered:

<p><strong>Physical Education Teacher K-12:</strong> This program prepares students to become competent
teachers of physical education. It enables the student to meet academic requirements for initial
New York State Teaching certificate of license; license in the allied field of recreation in the New
York City system. State certification in Physical Education also covers certification in coaching.

<p>Under advisement students can choose courses and field experiences that would enable them to
learn the theory and skills for teaching physical education to handicapped persons in the
mainstream of schooling, in special education sections, or institutional or industrial settings.

<p>Furthermore, the physical education major can specialize within the program in aquatics, outdoor
education, recreational or corrective therapy, adult fitness and cardiac rehabilitation--all with
career opportunities in a variety of non-school agencies.

<p><strong>Pre-Physical Therapy:</strong> The program in Pre-Physical Therapy seeks to provide students with the
necessary background in science and a strong concentration in the theory and practice of physical
exercise. Admission to graduate program depends on student achievement and graduate school
selectivity, as is the case of any "pre" program. This instruction and training is placed in the larger
context of a liberal education.  Students may also use this program to prepare for graduate study
in other health science areas.

<p><strong>Exercise Science/Sports Medicine/Cardiac Rehabilitation:</strong> Building on the scientific
foundation of physical exercise, students may specialize in Exercise Science/Sports Medicine.
Students are expected to put in extensive hours in internships in corporate fitness and health and
cardiac rehabilitation centers. A graduating senior is encouraged to take the American College of
Sports Medicine National exam for certification as an exercise specialist.

<h3><a name="The Radiological and Health Sciences Curriculum">The Radiological and Health Sciences Curriculum</a></h3>
Technologist Training Programs

<p>The Bachelor of Science degree program in Radiological and Health Sciences with a major in Nuclear Medicine
Technology (NMT) or a major in Radiation Therapy Technology (RTT) is a four-year program conducted in
affiliation with hospital/medical centers. The NMT program is accredited by the Joint Review Committee on
Educational Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology and the RTT program is pending approval by the Joint
Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology.  To satisfy the degree requirements in these programs
students must fulfill all the academic and clinical hours which are specified by national and state agencies for
professional certification, registration and licensing.

<p>This program also includes concentrations in Health Care Administration or Radiological Science or a Pre-Medical
school track (please see Preparation for Medicine and Dentistry on page 73) to help expand career possibilities.<strong></strong>

<p><strong></strong>

<p><strong>Advanced Standing Program</strong>

<p>The Bachelor of Science degree program in Radiological and Health Sciences is an  advanced standing program
designed for the professional development of licensed and/or registered radiological technologists in radiography,
radiation therapy, nuclear medicine, ultrasound and allied fields. The program can be completed part-time evenings
or as a full-time student.  This program is interdisciplinary in structure with courses in Radiological Sciences,
Liberal Arts and a field of concentration in Health Care Administration or Radiological Science. A Pre-Medical
School track could be followed replacing the Health Care Administration or Radiological Science tracks, however,
attendance in some day-time courses would be required (please see Preparation for Medicine and Dentistry pg. 73
).

<p>Licensed or registered radiological technologists, who are graduates from an accredited two-year hospital
radiological program, may receive up to sixty (60) transfer credits towards the Bachelor of Science degree
depending on the evaluation of the hospital training transcript. Additional transfer credits may be granted for
courses taken at accredited collegiate institutions. Associate degree applicants can receive up to 66 transfer credits.
The maximum number of credits that can be transferred for both hospital and college courses is 66 credits.

<p>

Dear Alumni and Friends:<p>

<p>

	Many hikers know the feeling.  Knapsacks loaded, you and your companions decide to set out for an
unfamiliar stretch of countryside.  The path is bound to pose challenges -- some foreseen, others
unknown.  But you have come prepared.  Thinking ahead, your group has secured a guide who can
impart the skills and knowledge you will need for a successful journey.<p>

<p>

	The scenario offers an apt symbol for the adventure now facing our society.  The world of the 21st
Century will be dramatically different from that of our parents and grandparents.  Information
technology is bringing even the most far-flung nations together.  The global market fosters increased
competition and diversity.  To make its way in this Brave New World, our nation relies on its own
guides -- our colleges and universities, which prepare tomorrow's leaders for the challenges ahead.<p>

<p>

	Manhattan College is a superb example.  Manhattan's continuing success couples its traditional strengths
with a gift for efficient and timely innovation.  As a Catholic college of high academic quality, we
provide a liberal education with strong moral values.  At the same time, we constantly adapt to change,
integrating technological and curricular advances with existing programs.  The result: a synergistic and
truly contemporary academic experience for tomorrow's leaders.<p>

<p>

	In this, my annual report to you, I am delighted to share news of alma mater's academic progress.  This
year, we welcome a distinguished new Provost.  We witnessed the continuing success of young
programs that expand upon our widely respected curriculum.  And we extended our computer network to
the entire campus, giving all students and faculty access to the resources of Cyberspace.  I believe you
will be impressed by our efforts; certainly, you deserve a great deal of the credit.  At a time of rising
costs, your support makes our success possible.<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2><i>A Living Heritage of Excellence</h2>
</i><p>

	In an ever changing world, the central purpose of academic life remains constant: to offer  young
minds the knowledge, values, and habits of thought on which civilization is based.  Manhattan, like
other Catholic colleges, excels at this mission because we are sure of our identity.  We are, as always,
a Lasallian institution, dedicated to the proposition that teaching is a sacred ministry.  <p>

<p>

	The venue we choose is a broad liberal arts education founded on strong values, along with
preprofessional programs receptive to changing realities.  Our approach is validated by the success of
our students and alumni.  For example, our graduates earn admission to leading professional and
graduate schools.  And the sports fans among you will be glad to know that Manhattan dominates the
Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) in the number of All-Academic team members.   <p>

<p>

	That tradition is in excellent hands.  I am delighted to introduce our new Provost, Dr. Weldon
Jackson, who assumed the post on June 30th.  Our former Provost, Dr. Walter Emge, returns to the
Philosophy classroom after eleven years of exemplary service.  With a B.A. degree from Morehouse
College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University, Dr. Jackson
has distinguished himself as a professor of political science and as a leader in faculty and curricular
development.  We heartily welcome him as Manhattan's chief academic officer.<p>

<p>

	The new Provost joins our faculty in guiding Manhattan's acclaimed academic programs.  There are
more than 60 majors in five Schools:  Arts, Business, Education and Health Sciences, Engineering,
and Sciences.  Recognizing our high academic quality, <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> last year again
ranked Manhattan among the top eight regional colleges and universities in the Northeast.<p>

<p>

	Now I would like to discuss three new programs that illustrate our emphasis on innovation that is
synergistic with our programs and resources.  This fall we welcome the first senior class in our
Undergraduate Program in Environmental Engineering.  These 20 gifted young people began studying
for their major when the program began three years ago.  The major draws on the resources and
faculty of our renowned Graduate Program in Environmental Engineering.  The undergraduate major
will prepare future generations of engineers to protect and replenish our nation's ecosystem.<p>

<p>

	Our Catholic Studies Program also is new.  Formed three years ago, it is a concentration within our
Religious Studies Department.  Religious Studies serves both as a major and as the source of the
religion courses all our students are required to take.  I am able to report that the number of students
enrolled in Religious Studies is growing.  There are now 15 majors and 42 minors in the program;
and a number of other students have taken more than the required number of courses.<p>

<p>

	The third program takes Manhattan into a significant new direction.  Across the country, the number
of "nontraditional" -- that is, adult -- students is growing.  Many who went to community colleges or
attended a four-year college part-time now find that the increasingly competitive workplace requires a
baccalaureate degree for advancement.  So we created our Baccalaureate Degree Completion Program
in Organizational Management.  Courses cover such topics as organizational ethics, managerial
economics, marketing in a global economy, strategic planning, even accounting for managers. 
Graduates will possess the knowledge and skills needed to manage in a global market. <p>

<p>

<h2><i>A Fully "Wired" Campus</h2>
</i><p>

	E-mail and "home pages," on-line libraries and electronic magazines -- the Internet is an increasingly
important way to communicate and conduct business.  Not surprisingly, young people -- and their
parents -- view computers and on-line services as important factors in selecting a college.  <p>

<p>

	Manhattan has joined the front-ranks of technologically sophisticated colleges and universities.  This
summer, we connected every room in each student residence hall to our expanded, campus-wide
computer network -- or, as we have dubbed it, "JasperNet."  From the comfort of their rooms,
students can use their own laptops or PC's to send E-mail, access library collections, and use the
College's advanced, file server-based  applications.  Across campus, connectivity is also provided at
seven computer labs and the Cardinal Hayes Library.<p>

<p>

	This expansion is part of Manhattan's ongoing efforts to integrate computer technology with existing
curricula.  For example, our faculty teach calculus with the sophisticated MAPLE software package,
one of many curriculum-related applications on JasperNet.  Business students do many of their
assignments on our various spreadsheet applications.  Humanities students go on-line to use
WordPerfect to prepare their papers.  Future engineers use sophisticated design programs.  And ever
more professors accept homework via E-mail.<p>

<p>

	The technological updates do not end there.  Each resident student now has voice mail and full
telephone service through our campus telephone system.  In addition, each room has a cable television
jack, so students can plug in their own televisions for access to local and satellite programming. 
Without question, these advances make Manhattan more attractive to prospective students.  And,
implemented together, they were achieved in a fiscally responsible way -- no small point, given our
sense of accountability to our supportive alumni.<p>

<h2><i>Staying the Course</i></h2>
	A century and a half is a long time to follow an ideal.  Manhattan, just seven years short of its 150th
Anniversary, has done exactly that.  We pursue a philosophy of education that is as relevant today as
in 1853, the year of our founding.  In these few pages you have seen why: Manhattan applies the
enduring values of liberal arts excellence to the needs and challenges of a new age.<p>

<p>

	Our success speaks well not only for Manhattan, but for American higher education in general.  I am
confident that our colleges and universities are in much better shape than the pundits would have us
believe.  Today too many self-proclaimed experts are denouncing our institutions of higher education. 
The Academy, they say, is rife with "Political Correctness" and riddled with waste.  <p>

<p>

	The pundits have missed the mark by miles.  Anyone who reads the newspapers is aware of some of
the more bizarre results of excess and the "P.C." wars.  Yet these cases represent a minute segment
of higher education.  Something wonderful is being overlooked.  Our nation leads the world toward
the marvels of the 21st Century; our universities are a big reason why.  The primacy of the liberal
arts curriculum and the skills associated with it -- the ability to reason, to analyze, to weigh ethical
issues, and to communicate clearly -- remain central and strong.<p>

<p>

	Manhattan College is a superb example.  We believe that it is useful, constructive, and morally right
to include diverse cultures and world views in the Academy.  We must prepare our students to lead in
the global marketplace and the diverse workplace which is already here, especially in New York City,
the capital of the world.  We have added this to our curriculum without diluting the importance of the
liberal arts.  At the same time, we hold fast to our conviction -- less widely shared -- that religious
values are the legitimate engine of our educational goals.  <p>

<p>

	As for accountability, the pundits too often miss the mark there, too.  For example, some critics
would measure the "return" on a college's academic program in terms of its graduates' starting
salaries.  Any narrow, solely quantifiable measures hide far more than they reveal.  Consider our own
Elementary Education Program.  It is arguably one of our most important programs, for it trains those
who will teach our nation's children.  Yet Elementary Education graduates have relatively low
starting salaries.  If we eliminated the program we would raise the average starting salaries of our
graduates and improve our grade on this measure.  But such a move is unthinkable, since it would
compromise our commitment to preparing citizens who genuinely contribute to our society.<p>

<p>

	More than 143 years have passed since four Christian Brothers founded the academy that would
become Manhattan College.  Today, through its dual commitment to tradition <i>and</i> change, Manhattan
is educating the leaders of the 21st Century.  We owe our success to you.  Your support helps keep
our programs strong, while permitting the technological and curricular advances expected of a fine
private college.  With your continued support, we will stay the course set for us so long ago.<p>

<title>Manhattan College News Release -
New Telephone Numbers</title>

<h2><center>NEWS RELEASE</h2>
</center>
<p>

<h2><center>Manhattan College Has New Telephone Number</h2>
</center>
<p>

Beginning July 1, 1996, Manhattan College's main telephone number will change from 920-0100
to <b>862-8000</b>.  Our (718) area code will remain the same.<p>

<p>

Also on that date, all existing College extensions being dialed from outside the campus will use the
number 862-7XXX, where the last three digits are the same as the current three-digit extension
number.<p>

<p>

Within the campus, dialing from extension to extension for existing telephones will require using
four digits, the number "7", and the same three digits now being used.  The new student telephones
in the Residence Halls will use either a "6" or an "8" as the first digit.<p>

<p>

Callers from outside the campus who dial the old number for any extension after July 1 will receive
a message that the number has changed, and they will be given the new number as 862-8000.  In
several College areas that have high public contact, we will pay a fee to have callers to an old
number advised of the number change, be given the new four-digit extension number and, in some
cases, be automatically connected to the new number.  The voice message and the automatic referrals
will be in place for six months to one year.<p>

<p>

Fax numbers that begin with 920-0 will be converted to 862-7.  Callers dialing the old number will
be given the voice referral to 862-8000, which will cause the fax transmission to fail.  Senders who
follow up with a telephone call can be told of the number change.  Fax and modem numbers that
begin with numbers other than 920 will not be impacted by the telephone system number changes;
however, these numbers will be migrated on a case-by-case basis into the 862 number system due
to the high cost of separate lines and the high cost of the individual telephone calls compared to the
rates available on the College's network.  The letterhead revision required by the telephone number
change affords the opportunity to change the off-network fax numbers also.<p>

<p>

The expansion of the voice mail system to include the resident students and the conversion to new
numbers will cause all passwords, greetings, and stored messages to be erased.  Passwords and
greetings must be reinstalled by each user on or after July 1.  The same Audix commands that are
now used will work on the new system.  Note that any messages that have not been retrieved when
the system is converted will be lost!  Instructions for setting up voice mail boxes again will be
distributed.<p>

<p>

The conversion of the telephone switch and the installation of the new numbers will require that the
entire College telephone system be totally shut down for a period of four to six hours on Friday
evening, June 28.  Additional announcements including the time of the shutdown and reminders of
the date will be distributed as the event becomes closer.<p>

<p>

Please begin immediately noting your new telephone number on all correspondence and other
communications.  An insert clipped to your correspondence is an effective and visible notification
means of distributing your new number.<p>

<h1>Message From Dean John J. Brennan</h1>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<p>

	As we prepare students for life and work in  the 21st century, we are in awe of
the new technologies available to our students and the new frontiers that will lead to
vast opportunities.  At Manhattan College, we are firm believers in the need to embrace
the information revolution and explore this new frontier;  Manhattan remains dedicated
to our original mission- To provide a contemporary, person-centered educational
experience, characterized by high academic standards, reflection on values and
principles, and preparation for a life-long career.  <p>

	Manhattan College was founded in 1853, by the Brothers of the Christian
Schools (De La Salle Christian Brothers) upon the Lasallian Catholic tradition of
excellence in teaching, respect for individual dignity, and commitment to social justice,
inspired by the innovator of modern pedagogy, John Baptist de La Salle. <p>

	As we embrace the Lasallian tradition, Manhattan has excelled as a mid-sized,
comprehensive college with chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Ki, and Tau Beta Pi. 
Our offerings within the Schools of Arts, Science, Business, Education, and
Engineering along with a rich geographic, ethnic, racial, and religious diversity, only
enhances the educational and learning experiences of our students.  Our location in
the suburban setting of Riverdale, within New York City affords our students an array of
opportunities, both in and out of the classroom, that cannot be matched elsewhere.  <p>

	Why do I feel it's so important to stress the aspects of a Lasallian Education? 
Because as the Dean of Admissions here for the last twelve years, I have seen &amp; felt
it's effects.  I've witnessed students flourish in the this tradition and felt their sincerity as
they've returned to thank the professors and administrators who impacted their life
forever. <p>

	Our dedicated and caring campus community of scholars and students enables
the college to offer a thriving learning tradition.  You, the person, will not be lost at
Manhattan.  As we compile the richness of our past, with the technological advances of
the future, the results will demonstrate that new innovation serves to strengthen the
effectiveness of the Lasallian education we provide for people of all ethnic, religous,
and racial backgrounds.<p>

	We look forward to welcoming you to the Manhattan family and to becoming an
integral part of our illustrious alumni group.<p>

<h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<h3><a name="The Mission of Manhattan College">The Mission of Manhattan College</a></h3>
At its quarterly meeting of October 23, 1990, The Board of Trustees of Manhattan College adopted the following statement of
Mission:<p>

Manhattan College, overlooking Van Cortlandt Park in Riverdale, is a private, independent Institution of higher learning which
embraces qualified men and women of all faiths, races and ethnic backgrounds. Established in 1853, the College is founded upon
the Lasallian Catholic tradition of excellence in teaching, respect for individual dignity, and commitment to social justice, inspired
by the innovator of modern pedagogy, John Baptist de La Salle.<p>

The mission of Manhattan College is to provide a contemporary, person-centered educational experience characterized by high
academic standards, reflection on values and principles, and preparation for a life-long career. This is achieved in two ways:  by
offering students programs which integrate a broad liberal education with concentration in specific disciplines in the arts and
sciences or with professional preparation in business, education and engineering; and by nurturing a caring, pluralistic campus
community.<p>

The learning experience at Manhattan College is enriched by cooperative programs with other institutions, by postgraduate
professional programs, and by capitalizing on its location on the edge of the cultural center and global marketplace that is New
York City. <p>

<h3><center><a name="HISTORICAL NOTE">HISTORICAL NOTE</a></h3>
</center>
 Manhattan College dates its foundation from May 1853 when the school, originally established by the Brothers of the Christian
Schools in 1848, moved from Canal Street in lower Manhattan to what was then known as the Manhattanville section of New York
City at 131st Street and Broadway. In the ten years from 1853 to 1863, the school changed rapidly, adding college-level courses in
1859 and first using the name Manhattan College in 1861. A Board of Trustees composed of ten laymen and eight Brothers of the
Christian Schools was assembled in 1862 to petition the Board of Regents and the Legislature of the State of New York to charter
a collegiate institution named Manhattan College. The charter to establish Manhattan College was approved by the Legislature and
issued by the Board of Regents on April 2, 1863. The first catalog of the newly chartered College stated its goals as follows:<p>

<blockquote><i>The object of this institution is to afford the youth of our country the means of acquiring the highest grade of
education attained in the best American universities or colleges. While the conductors mean that the classical
languages shall be thoroughly studied, they have resolved to give a prominence to the higher mathematics and
natural sciences not hitherto received in any similar institution in this country; thus combining the advantages of a
first-class College and Polytechnic Institute.
</blockquote>
</i>Thus, in its origins, Manhattan College was an unusual institution. It combined in its sponsoring Board of Trustees both secular
independent members and representatives of the religious teaching Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. It also combined
in a single collegiate institution excellence in the traditional liberal arts and sciences and excellence in professional and technical
education. <p>

In 1923, the College moved to its present location in the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City, bordered by the Hudson River and Van
Cortlandt Park where it is able to offer access to the cultural, educational, business and entertainment opportunities of the City as well as
a self-contained campus environment.<p>

The College continues to realize the objectives stated in its first catalog by maintaining a full range of programs in the liberal arts and
sciences joined with professional programs in engineering, business, education and human services. The quality of the undergraduate
programs has been demonstrated by the College's record as one of the nation's leading undergraduate sources of doctorates in the
arts, sciences, engineering and education, and recognized by the establishment of chapters of such prestigious honor societies as <b>Phi
Beta Kappa</b>, <b>Sigma Xi </b>and <b>Tau Beta Pi</b>. Similarly, Standard &amp; Poors ranks the Manhattan College School of Business among the leading
undergraduate sources of managerial and financial leadership in the nation.<p>

Although the master degree in course was conferred by Manhattan College as early as 1869, a formally organized unit for graduate
study was not set up until the 1920s. In 1939 this Graduate Department of the Extension Division of Manhattan College, as it was
then called, received approval of the New York State Education Department to grant the master degree in six areas of
concentration: classical languages, education, English, French, history and mathematics. For the next twenty years the curricula in
these departments were restricted to members of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. In 1951 the name of the unit was
changed to Division for Religious, Program of Graduate Studies, and admitted members of all other religious orders and Catholic
clergy.<p>

 In 1959 the present title, Graduate Division, was adopted and registered with the University of the State of New York. At the same time
the State Education Department gave authorization to open the courses to all qualified students. The division at present has more than six
hundred students matriculating for different master degrees.<p>

Subsequently, graduate programs were added in Religious Studies, Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering. In September 1974,
Manhattan College received approval from the State Education Department to begin a Master of Science Program in Management. Two
new programs in Engineering--Civil and Electrical--were begun in September 1975 with the necessary approval of the State Education
Department. In 1977, a program leading to the master degree in Mechanical Engineering was initiated. Beginning with the 1979 fall
semester, the Master of Science in Management program was changed to the Master in Business Administration with seven areas of
concentration.<p>

In 1980, the master degree programs in English, History and Religious Studies were terminated. Beginning in the 1982 fall semester, a
Master of Science program in Computer Engineering was established, emphasizing the hardware aspects of computers. In 1989 a Master
of Science program in Biotechnology was established.<p>

From its beginning, Manhattan College paid particular attention to educating first-generation college students, and was an early proponent
of access to minority students, establishing special scholarship funds for minority students as early as 1938. <p>

The College became coeducational and accepted its first women undergraduate students in 1973. Prior to that date, the College has
established a cooperative program with the neighboring College of Mount Saint Vincent which permitted cross-registration and the
merging of academic departments. <p>

With the opening of the East Hill Residence Hall in 1990, the College is able to maintain a balance between residential and commuting
students.<p>

Currently, the College has a student body of approximately 3,350:  2,750 undergraduates, 2,500 full-time and 250 part-time; and 600
graduate students. The student-faculty ratio is fifteen to one.<p>

<h3><center><a name="RECOGNITION AND MEMBERSHIP">RECOGNITION AND MEMBERSHIP</a></h3>
</center>
Manhattan College is chartered and empowered to confer academic degrees by the University of the State of New York. It is accredited by
the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The College is approved by the American Chemical Society for the professional
training of chemists and by the Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation of the American Medical Association for the
professional training of nuclear medicine technologists. Undergraduate curricula in engineering and the master degree program in
Environmental Engineering are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. (A.B.E.T. does not accredit the
master degree programs if the undergraduate degree programs in the same institution have been accredited.) The College is a member of
the Association of American Colleges, the American Council on Education, the Institute of International Education, the National Catholic
Educational Association, the Association of Urban Universities, the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, the
American Association of University Women, the American Society for Engineering Education, Middle Atlantic Association of Colleges of
Business Administration, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Association of Continuing Higher Education, the
National Association of College and University Summer Sessions, American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, and the College
Entrance Examination Board.<p>

<h3><center><a name="PURPOSE">PURPOSE</a></h3>
</center>
The Graduate Division of Manhattan College has for its primary purpose the offering of programs leading to academic and professional
degrees through a coherent series of courses, discussions, seminars and independent studies or investigations, assisting the student to
acquire an introduction into the mastery of knowledge, creative scholarship and basic research in a specific discipline.<p>

The Graduate Division seeks to serve the American and International community by offering programs in professional areas,
affording men and women the opportunity of acquiring a broader and deeper acquaintance with one field of knowledge, of learning
the methods of productive scholarship, and of advanced study in their professions.<p>

The Graduate Division seeks to provide the academic and professional needs for those who are already engaged in a profession -
teachers, engineers, business persons - or those who having completed their undergraduate preparation desire to enter immediately into
advanced study.<p>

Because many of its students are pursuing a profession, the Graduate Division provides the opportunity of achieving the master degree on
a part-time basis. It is possible to pursue full-time graduate study in most programs. The courses are generally conducted in the late
afternoons, early evenings and Saturday mornings during the fall and spring sessions. The schedule will vary with the degree program. In
general, Education courses are offered in the late afternoon, Engineering courses in the evenings and Business Administration courses on
Saturday mornings and during the summer session.<p>

<h3><center>ORGANIZATION</h3>
</center>
The Graduate Division operates as an integral unit of the College under the oversight of the Provost of the College and the Deans of the
Schools of Business, Education and Engineering. Each graduate program is managed by a Chairperson or a Director who reports to the
Dean of the School in which the program is housed. The Graduate Council is responsible for general policies affecting all graduate
programs. The Provost and the Deans of the Schools housing graduate programs constitute the Executive Committee of the Graduate
Council. The Graduate Council includes, in addition to the members of the Executive Committee, all chairpersons or directors responsible
for managing graduate programs. <p>

The following degree programs have been approved and are registered with the Bureau of Evaluation, New York State Higher Education
Department, under the HEGIS number listed:<p>

<h3><a name="APPLICATION PROCEDURES"><center>APPLICATION PROCEDURES</a></h3>
</center>
Application forms for admission to all programs may be obtained from the Office of Admissions. The completed form accompanied
by the application fee (non-refundable) must be submitted to the Office of Admissions. Applicants for admission are responsible
for having official transcripts of all undergraduate and graduate courses mailed directly to the Office of Admissions, paying the
application fee, submitting letters of recommendation if required for a specific program, and submitting required standardized test
scores.<p>

Official transcripts (not student copies) of all undergraduate and graduate records must be sent to the Office of Admissions by the
institutions issuing them. Applicants who file an application before the baccalaureate degree has been conferred  may be accepted
pending the successful completion of their undergraduate work. A final transcript must be received in the Office of Admissions
before they may register for graduate courses.<p>

Graduates of Manhattan College should write to the Office of the Registrar requesting that an official transcript be sent to the Office
of Admissions.<p>

An application is not complete until all the necessary materials and application fee have been received by the Office of Admissions.
Incomplete applications cannot be processed. Students who file an application and whose official transcripts arrive after the deadline
date cannot be assured that their application will be processed in time for the semester for which they are applying.<p>

The filing should be completed before May 1 for summer session application; August 10 for fall session applicants and January 7 for spring
session applicants. Students seeking admission into the full-time Engineering programs must have their application for the fall session
completed by March 1 if they are applying for a fellowship or scholarship for the fall semester.<p>

A committee of the program for which a person is applying reviews the application and supportive documents and forwards a
recommendation to the Office of Admissions. The office informs the applicant of the decision. Those who have been accepted will receive
the instructions for registration at the beginning of the session for which they have been accepted.<p>

The documents submitted in support of application cannot be returned to the applicant nor can they be duplicated for any purpose. All
documents received are part of the records of the Office of Admissions.<p>

<h3><center><a name="ADMISSION">ADMISSION</a></h3>
</center>
Applicants for admission into all graduate programs must hold, before beginning graduate courses, a baccalaureate degree from an
accredited college or institution acceptable to Manhattan College. They must meet the specific undergraduate course requirements as stated
in the introduction to the respective programs. Normally, an undergraduate grade point average of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale is required, although
other factors will be considered in the decision for admission, such as years of professional experience, high average in major field, scores
on required standardized tests, or academic development beyond the baccalaureate degree. Applicants may be requested to take the
Graduate Record Examination for certain programs.<p>

Admission will be granted either as a matriculated student, one seeking to fulfill the requirements for a degree, or as a non-matriculated
student, one earning graduate credit for specific courses but not for the degree. For special reasons an applicant may be admitted as an
auditor. Tuition and fees for auditors are the same as that of other students.<p>

A student who lacks undergraduate prerequisites for a specific program may be admitted as a non-matriculated student for the required
undergraduate courses. When these courses are completed with the specified grades, the student may be admitted to matriculation.<p>

Students accepted for non-matriculated status for graduate courses must have the necessary prerequisites for courses. Students may not
register for more than 12 credits as a non-matriculated student without the permission of the Dean of the School in which the student is
enrolled. In the M.B.A. Program, students accepted as applicants for matriculation without GMAT scores may not register for more than
two courses, graduate or undergraduate, without being accepted as matriculated students.<p>

Students who enroll in graduate courses on a non-matriculated basis and apply thereafter for matriculated status will be informed at the
time of acceptance which courses may be applied to the degree program. The beginning date of matriculation for such students will be
retroactive to the semester within which they have earned the first credits accepted towards the degree.<p>

Students who have earned a master's degree or who are pursuing a master's degree in one program from Manhattan College and desire
to seek admission into another program must file a new application with the Office of Admissions.<p>

All documents of applicants who have been accepted and who for extenuating circumstances cannot register for courses during the session
for which they were admitted will be kept on file for two years. The documents will be destroyed if the applicant does not register for
courses within that period.<p>

<h3><center><a name="VISITING STUDENTS">VISITING STUDENTS</a></h3>
</center>
Students who are matriculated in a graduate program at another institution and who wish to take a course or courses at the College will
be accepted as non-matriculated students for individual courses for which they have the prerequisites. Such students need to provide the
Office of Admissions with a completed application and a statement from their home institution that they have permission to take the
course(s).<p>

<h3><center><a name="PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT">PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</a></h3>
</center>
Students wishing to take courses for professional development must present evidence of graduation from a baccalaureate program and have
prerequisites for the courses to be taken. Students enrolled for professional development courses are non-matriculated students.<p>

<h3><center><a name="LATE APPLICANTS">LATE APPLICANTS</a></h3>
</center>
In the event a student's application cannot be processed prior to the beginning of a regular semester or summer term, the student may
be admitted as a non-matriculated student for one semester. Students must present evidence that they meet the requirements for admission
described in the departmental descriptions. <p>

<h3><center><a name="APPLICANTS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES">APPLICANTS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES</a> </h3>
</center>
The Graduate Division of Manhattan accepts students from foreign countries for its full-time programs. It cannot accept students into its
part-time programs. The student who is accepted and receives a student visa must be enrolled in each term of the academic year for 12
credits or in special cases a minimum of 9 credits. Such students must complete the program within a year and a half.<p>

  Applicants from foreign countries should submit their admission application, official transcripts and the admission fee four months before
the beginning of the session they wish to enter. In addition, they must submit a notarized statement that they have sufficient funds to
finance their education and their maintenance. Many of the sources of financial assistance are limited to the students of the United States.<p>

All students applying from foreign countries must take the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) and have the test results sent
to the Office of Admissions. A minimum TOEFL score of 550 is required for admission and issuance of the I-20 form. Students with TOEFL
scores below 550 will be required to complete successfully <b>ENGL 095</b>, <b>English As A Second Language </b>at Manhattan College, or its
equivalent elsewhere.<p>

Foreign students applying to the M.B.A. Program are required to present a minimum score of 550 on the TOEFL, and a minimum score
of 500 on the GMAT. <p>

Foreign students graduating from an ABET accredited program in the United States will not be subject to the TOEFL requirement. <p>

A student from another country who is informed of acceptance must deposit $200 which will be credited towards tuition. This fee is
non-refundable if the student does not register but will be credited to his/her account for two years. When the $200 is received, the student
will be sent an I-20 form which must be presented to the United States authority to arrange for a F-1 student visa. If students from other
countries are accepted and have requested campus residence, a non-refundable deposit of $200 must be made. The deposit is not refunded
if the student does not reside on campus for a minimum of one semester.<p>

<h3><center><a name="TRANSFER CREDIT">TRANSFER CREDIT</a></h3>
</center>
A maximum of six credits for graduate courses completed at another institution prior to matriculation at Manhattan College may be granted
if the courses are equivalent to those required at Manhattan College. The courses must have been taken within the five year period prior
to acceptance as a matriculated student and have been awarded the grade of B or better. Request for such transfer credit must be made
at the time of filing the application for admission. Credits which have been used to earn one graduate degree may not be applied to the
degree requirements of another degree. The request for transfer credit must be submitted to the Office of Admissions. Courses accepted
for transfer credit will be noted on the Manhattan College academic record. However, the grades will not be counted in the Manhattan
College grade point average.<p>

<h3><center><a name="OFF-CAMPUS CREDIT">OFF-CAMPUS CREDIT</a></h3>
</center>
It is understood that all courses for the degree must be taken at Manhattan College. For compelling reasons and in rare instances, however,
a student may secure permission to earn a maximum of six transfer graduate credits at another institution transferable to the Manhattan
College record. Written permission to take such work must be obtained by the student in advance from the Chairperson or Director and
the Dean of the School. When such a course is completed, the student must arrange for an official transcript to be mailed directly by the
institution where the course was taken to the Office of the Program Director or the Dean of the School in which the student is enrolled and
must pay the "Off-Campus Courses" fee of $75 per course before the course is entered on his/her academic record by the Office of the
Registrar. Only courses which have earned a B grade or better are transferable. A student who was granted six transfer credits on admission
is not eligible for any further transfer of credits during his/her matriculation.<p>

<h3><center><a name="REGISTRATION">REGISTRATION</a></h3>
</center>
Students are required to register each session for which they will be in attendance. The dates and places of registration for each session
are indicated on the schedule of courses published in advance by the Office of the Registrar.<p>

Before the actual registration, students must have each of the courses approved by the department. Students may register in person or
by mail by sending the approved registration form with a check for tuition and fees to the Office of the Bursar.<p>

Newly accepted students may register by mail on a form provided by the Office of the Registrar if their admission has been granted at an
early enough date and if they have received approval from the department.<p>

Students are registered when their Registration Form is left in the Office of the Registrar and receive an approved schedule and Bursar's
receipt.<p>

Students who are in attendance during the term preceding the one for which they wish to register will receive a registration form during
one of their classes. Students not in attendance during the preceding term will receive the registration material by mail. Students not in
attendance for more than one semester must request the material from the Office of the Registrar.<p>

There is no late registration for already accepted students after the first scheduled class in the fall and spring and after the first two days
in the summer session.<p>

<h3><center><a name="COURSE CHANGES">COURSE CHANGES</a> </h3>
</center>
Adds and Drops of courses for which a student has registered must be accomplished in the Office of the Registrar. There are no Adds and
Drops of courses after the second scheduled class. Students who drop a course without adding a course are subject to the refund policy
as stated in the catalogue.<p>

<h3><center><a name="GRADES">GRADES</a></h3>
</center>
The following grade system is employed in graduate courses: <b>A</b> is Excellent and represents an outstanding performance; <b>B+</b> is Very Good
and represents a highly creditable performance; <b>B</b> is Good and represents a creditable performance; <b>C</b> is Passing but below the level
expected of graduate students; <b>F</b> is Failure for not having substantially fulfilled the requirements of the course or withdrawing from a course
without permission of the Chairperson or Program Director; <b>W</b> indicates Withdrawal from the course with permission. <b>I</b> is Incomplete and
is assigned to a student who was absent from the final examination or whose course work on the last day of class is incomplete but
satisfactory as far as completed. <b>T</b> is assigned to a Master's Project or Thesis that is not completed by the end of the semester in which
the student registers for it. <b>Au</b> is used for enrolled Auditors.<p>

<h3><center><a name="ACADEMIC STANDING">ACADEMIC STANDING</a></h3>
</center>
When students receive a second failure in their course of study, they will be eligible for dismissal. When students receive a grade less than
B in a second course, it will be necessary to meet with the chairperson/director of the program to discuss their academic standing. Such
students will be considered in good standing as long as they maintain a B average.<p>

To improve his/her index, a student who has earned a grade of "C" or "F" in a course may repeat the course. For this purpose the
course must be repeated at Manhattan College. Grades of all attempts will appear on the student's academic record. However, only the
grade of the last attempt will be used in calculating the student's grade point average for academic standing and graduation. Credit for
the course will apply only once toward meeting degree requirements.<p>

<h3><center><a name="SCHOLARSHIP INDEX">SCHOLARSHIP INDEX</a></h3>
</center>
In determining scholarship index, four quality points are given for each credit rated A; 3.5 for each credit of B+; 3.0 for each credit of B;
and 2.0 for each credit of C. W and T grades are not computed in the students index. F grades receive no quality points. <p>

<h3><center><a name="500-LEVEL COURSES  ">500-LEVEL COURSES  </a></h3>
</center>
Advanced undergraduates and graduate students may enroll in 500-level courses. A graduate student may receive credit for no more than
three 500-level courses toward a degree program.<p>

<h3><center><a name="WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSE">WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSE</a> </h3>
</center>
Students who find it necessary to withdraw from courses must effect the official withdrawal with the Office of the Registrar. The W grade
will not be given if the student withdraws after the published date for withdrawal. The withdrawal is dated when the Office of the Registrar
has been informed by the student. No refund is given if a student withdraws from a course after the third scheduled class.<p>

<h3><center><a name="INCOMPLETE COURSE WORK">INCOMPLETE COURSE WORK</a></h3>
</center>
In extraordinary instances, when some requirement of a course has not been completed before the final examination, a student may be
assigned the temporary grade of I (Incomplete Course Work), if, in the judgement of the teacher, a passing grade may be attained with the
completion of the requirement. The I grade will be removed and a permanent grade assigned if the requirement is completed satisfactorily.
If the requirement is not completed by the date specified in the academic calendar, generally the last day of the fourth week of the following
Fall or Spring semester, the I grade will be automatically changed to F. An Incomplete grade in a Summer Session must be completed
during the following Fall semester. Students are responsible for making arrangements with the teacher to complete the requirement within
the time permitted. For  certain projects, Independent Study prerequisites, internships and other non-course work (which carry academic
credit), students may have an additional session to complete the required work with the permission of the Dean of the School.<p>

Students who fail to complete their Master's Thesis/Project by the end of the semester in which they are registered for it will be issued
the temporary grade of T. The T grade will be changed to a letter grade when the Thesis/Project is completed. The T grade is not assigned
any quality points and is not computed in the student's grade point average.<p>

<p>

<h3><a name="SEMESTER HOUR OF CREDIT"><center>SEMESTER HOUR OF CREDIT</a> </h3>
</center>
Many three credit graduate courses meet for two hours of lecture once a week. To comply with the regulation of the Commissioner of Higher
Education that there be fifteen hours of instruction for each semester hour or the equivalent, a third credit is granted for the successful
completion of a course paper, an independent reading list, or some suitable project assigned by the professor. In addition to the two hours
of lecture, the professor will be available during a third hour to assist and direct the student. The student's final grade for the three credits
will reflect the response of the student to this third hour requirement.<p>

<h3><center><a name="RECORDS">RECORDS</a></h3>
</center>
A report of all course grades is sent to the student at the end of each session by the Registrar of Manhattan College. Official transcripts
of record are obtained from the Office of the Registrar and bear the seal of Manhattan College. Unofficial transcripts do not bear the seal
of the College and may be issued to the student. However, Manhattan College accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of such transcripts
after they have been issued.<p>

Official and unofficial transcripts should be requested from the Office of the Registrar, either in person or by mail. The Office of the
Registrar cannot comply with telephone requests. All obligations to the College must be fulfilled before transcripts will be issued.<p>

<h3><center><a name="REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE">REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE</a></h3>
</center>
The requirements for a master degree for each of the programs are listed in the departmental sections. All requirements must be completed
within the degree time limit.<p>

Students admitted prior to January 1, 1989 must present a minimum of 24 credits of B or better grades in the graduate courses for the
degree and meet any other requirements specified by the department, or students who receive more than six credits of C grades may meet
the requirements for the degree if they present an average of B (3.0 index) for all courses to be credited toward the master degree.
Students who do not achieve this requirement within the specified departmental credits needed for the degree may take additional courses
with the permission of the department chairperson or director of the program to achieve the 3.0 index.<p>

Students who began graduate studies after January 1, 1989 must present a minimum grade point average of 3.0. <p>

<h3><center><a name="COURSES">COURSES</a></h3>
</center>
To be awarded a master degree, a student must successfully complete a minimum of 30 to 42 credits of graduate course work,
depending upon the course requirements of the specific program. Most graduate programs are part-time programs and courses are
offered in a cycle. It is the responsibility of the student to register for courses in the sequence in which they are offered and to make
the necessary progress to complete all the requirements within the five year time period.<p>

<h3><center><a name="DEGREE TIME LIMITS">DEGREE TIME LIMITS</a> </h3>
</center>
All requirements (courses, paper, projects, thesis) must be completed within the maximum of five years from the beginning of the
semester of matriculation. The beginning semester of matriculation is the semester within which the candidate is awarded the first
credits towards the degree whether they were earned as a non-matriculated or matriculated student. Candidates should plan their
five year program to assure the completion of all requirements within the five year period. Foreign students must be full-time
students. They must complete the requirements for the degree in two years.<p>

<h3><center><a name="TERMINATION OF MATRICULATION">TERMINATION OF MATRICULATION</a> </h3>
</center>
The Dean of the School, on the recommendation of the Chairperson/Director may terminate the matriculation of any student who
fails to make sufficient progress towards the degree or to cancel a student's registration if he/she is registered for courses for
which he/she does not have the prerequisites.<p>

Candidates for the degree not in attendance for two calendar years will have their matriculation terminated. To reactivate their
matriculation, these candidates must receive permission from the Dean of the School. Such candidates, if readmitted, are required
to meet all degree requirements within the five year period from the beginning of the semester of matriculation. If this is not
possible, the candidate may have to complete additional courses and current degree requirements.<p>

<h3><center><a name="CONFERRING OF DEGREES">CONFERRING OF DEGREES</a></h3>
</center>
Degrees are conferred three times a year; September 1, February 1 and at the annual Commencement Exercises. Students who have
completed their programs in September or February will receive their degrees at the February Commencement. Students who
complete their programs in May will receive their degrees at the Graduate Commencement in May.<p>

<h3><center><a name="VETERANS">VETERANS</a> </h3>
</center>
The Vice President of Student Life, located in Memorial Hall, is responsible for certifying any V.A. benefits. Veterans should bring
a copy of their DD 214 to the office with their letter of acceptance into the Graduate Division. The eligibility for the V.A. benefits
is for the semester or session for which they are in attendance. To continue to be eligible for these benefits in subsequent
semesters after having registered, veterans must report to the Vice President of Student Life to renew the certification of attendance
at the beginning of each semester for which they are registered.<p>

<i><b>The following information is important</b></i>:<p>

a) Veterans are paid benefits for actual credit hours in attendance. Nine semester hours is considered full-time for V.A. benefits
in Graduate School.<p>

b) Veterans who have not registered for any credit hours but are completing papers, writing a thesis, preparing for comprehensive, or
completing a project, are not considered in attendance. Veterans are entitled to benefits  for projects and thesis that have credit hours
assigned, but only for the semester in which they have registered. Veterans whose project or thesis takes more than one semester are not
entitled to benefits beyond the semester in which they have registered for it.<p>

c) Veterans are reminded that an I grade is not acceptable by the Veterans Administration.<p>

d) Any change of status - withdrawal from a course, non-attendance in a particular semester, failure to register in a subsequent
semester - must be reported to the Vice President of Student Life.<p>

<h3><center><a name="FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE">FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</a> </h3>
</center>
The objective of the Manhattan College Financial Aid Office is to provide the maximum financial aid available to qualified students. Since
the majority of students in the graduate programs at Manhattan College are attending part time, financial assistance is limited.<p>

To be eligible for any financial assistance, a student must be matriculated and attending at least 1/2 time (6 credits a semester). Each
student must complete a Manhattan College Financial Aid Application and the Free Application for Federal Student Assistance <b>(FAFSA)</b>.
<b><i>Most graduate students take advantage of the following:<p>

</i>Federal Stafford Student Loan:</b>  Under this program a graduate student may borrow up to $8,500 per year at 6.2% interest. The borrower
must show need as determined by the <b>FAF</b> to qualify for this loan. Interest and repayment begin six months after graduation or withdrawal
from the program. In the fifth year of repayment the interest rate increases to 10%.<p>

<b>Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Student Loan:</b>  Under this program a graduate student may borrow up to $8,500 per year at 6.2% interest.
The borrower must show need as determined by <b>FAFSA </b>to qualify for this loan. Borrower is responsible for interest that accrues while
attending school. Repayment begins six months after graduation or withdrawal from program. In the fifth year of repayment, interest rate
increases to 10%. Open to all students who may not qualify for a subsidized loan.<p>

<b>Federal Supplementary Loan for Students:</b>  A graduate independent student may borrow $10,000 per year from this program. The interest
rate is 3.75% over the prime and cannot exceed 12%. The interest begins to accrue immediately and a student may pay the interest while
attending graduate school or the interest may capitalize until the student graduates.<p>

<b>New York State Tuition Assistance Program:</b>  A New York State resident attending graduate school in New York State on a full-time
basis may be eligible for TAP. The maximum <b>TAP </b>grant for a graduate student is $2,000 per year. Please check with the Financial Aid
Office for income guidelines.<p>

Students are urged to begin the process of filing applications at least six months prior to the start of the semester for which aid is sought.<p>

<h2><center>M.B.A. PROGRAM</h2>
</center>
<h3><center>CHARLES E. BRUNNER, Ph.D.</h3>
</center>
<h3><center>Director, M.B.A. Program</h3>
</center>
<h3><center>OBJECTIVES </h3>
</center>
The educational objectives of the M.B.A. Program are: 1) to develop professional managers and prepare
prospective managers for positions of broad administrative responsibility in business, government,
education, health, religion and other complex organizations; 2) to impart a knowledge and understanding
of professional management and of the environments in which managers function; 3) to give the student
the opportunity to develop a functional specialization in accordance with his/her talents and interests; <b>and
</b>4) to prepare students for doctoral study leading to careers in teaching and research. <p>

The <b>M.B.A. Core</b> is structured around the following areas of competence; 1) Organizational
Environments; 2) Organizational Dynamics; 3) Management Analysis and Decision Systems; 4) Management
Operating and Control Systems and 5) Management Planning and Policy Making. <p>

The program offers concentrations in Accounting, Finance, International Business Management, Management
Information Systems, and Engineering and Technology Management. Additional concentrations include
Marketing and Health Care. Students can customize a cross-functional concentration to fit individual needs
through consultation with the Director.<p>

<h3><center>PREPARATION </h3>
</center>
The policy of admission adheres to the standards set by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of
Business. Applicants must possess a bachelor degree from an accredited college and a satisfactory grade point
average.<p>

All applicants must take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) and have their scores sent to the
Director of the M.B.A. Program. Students may be accepted as Applicant for Matriculation pending satisfactory
completion of the GMAT. However, no more than six graduate credits may be taken without a satisfactory
completion of the GMAT requirement.<p>

<h3><center>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </h3>
</center>
Students with satisfactory undergraduate foundation prerequisites in business must earn 39 credits in graduate
courses, by including 27 credits in Advanced Core courses, 9 credits in a Concentration, and 3 credits from an
elective course or an Independent Masters Project. <p>

The M.B.A. Program requires students to be competent in foundation core areas. These areas, which include
accounting, computer concepts, economics, finance, marketing, and statistics, are required of undergraduate
business majors in most AACSB-accredited schools. Most graduate courses are designed with an assumption of
knowledge in the particular foundation core area. Hence, the areas are prerequisites for advanced graduate core
courses.<p>

<p>

<p>

	Following a very successful 1994-95 sports year at Manhattan College, there was much expectation to repeat
those accolades during the 1995-96 campaign.  Those expectations were realized as Manhattan brought forth a new
set of champions while maintaining a high standard of consistency.  During the <b>FALL SEASON</b>, a cross-country
runner dominated the schedule en route to her second straight MAAC crown, while the volleyball team proved that
they can rank among the nation's best.  During the <b>WINTER SEASON</b>, Manhattan experienced the first double
post-season in the school's basketball history, while several track &amp; field athletes found themselves on the winner's
stand and in the College record books.  And, during the <b>SPRING SEASON</b>, Manhattan's newest varsity team, men's
lacrosse, made its long-awaited debut.<p>

	During the fall, junior cross-country runner Margaret McParland was the big story.  In the seven races she
entered during the season, McParland won five.  Among those victories were her second straight individual Metro
Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) Championship- the fifth consecutive individual MAAC title that the Lady
Jaspers captured.  McParland also won the Metropolitan Championship and the ECAC University Division
Championship.  To cap an already-phenomenal season, McParland also earned CoSIDA District I Academic All-American honors.<p>

	The men's cross-country team also deemed their 1995 season a success with a third-place team finish in the
MAAC Championships.  Freshman Geoff Howard showed promise for the team's future, recording four individual
top-10 finishes during the season.<p>

	The volleyball team entered the season with many question marks, but ended their campaign as the nation's
best team in service aces.  Junior co-captain Paige Carson helped that effort by ranking seventh in the nation in that
category.  <p>

	The women's soccer team got off to its best start ever, 5-0, en route to an overall 9-7-1 mark.  The Lady J's
received considerable help from their newcomers as freshman goaltender Lori Graham recorded a record-tying eight
victories, while freshman forward Tara Ruzzier ended up tied as the team's scoring leader along with junior Emily
Rogic.  Senior Lisa Margiotta finished her Manhattan career as the team's all-time assists leader and second all-time
points leader.  She also earned District I Academic All-American honors.<p>

	The men's soccer team, despite a difficult season, still had moments to remember.  Sophomore goaltender
Tim Hurley recorded two shutouts and played every minute of every game.  And, six Jaspers were named to the
MAAC All-Academic team, the most of any MAAC school.<p>

	The men's tennis team enjoyed much success during the fall.  After going 4-1 in their head-to-head matches,
the team finished second in the MAAC Championships as freshmen Brian Kritzer and Erick Mendeloff won singles
titles.  Kritzer, who won 12 of his 13 singles matches during the fall season, went on to win the Scott Satran/Queens
College Tournament.<p>

	The women's tennis team also enjoyed success in the fall.  At the MAAC Championships, they found
themselves mired in seventh place after the first day of competition, but went on to win three singles consolation
titles and one doubles consolation championships to post a College-best fourth-place finish.  One week later the
tandem of junior Kerriann McDermott and freshman Gianin Perez captured the J.J. Rooney New York State Doubles
Championship.<p>

	The golf team also recorded a best-ever finish in the MAAC Championships, finishing fourth at the Saratoga
Spa Course in Saratoga Springs.  Freshman Larry Ayers was the Jaspers' top individual finisher, taking fourth place
overall.<p>

	During the <b>WINTER SPORTS</b> season, Manhattan continued to garner the national attention that was
cultivated just one year before.  However, unlike the year before, the spotlight was not limited to men's basketball. 
<p>

	With personnel changes and injuries throughout the season, coach Fran Fraschilla's men's basketball team
often found themselves with an understaffed bench.  Despite the problems and a schedule that included the likes
of eventual NCAA participants Georgia Tech, Monmouth, Eastern Michigan and Colgate, the Jaspers used a
balanced attack to post a 17-12 record, which included a regular-season ending seven-game winning streak. 
Sophomore Heshimu Evans earned First Team All-MAAC honors, while juniors Jeronimo Bucero and Jason
Hoover, as well as sophomore Brendan O'Brien, were named to the MAAC All-Academic Team.  Hoover also
earned CoSIDA District I Academic All-American honors.  However, his absence in the MAAC Tournament led
to a first-round exit against Niagara before Wisconsin ended the Jaspers' season in the National Invitation
Tournament.<p>

	The talk prior to the women's basketball season was how good senior Gina Somma was going to be in 1995-96.  A unanimous selection to the Pre-Season All-MAAC First Team didn't hurt.  What did hurt was the 3-7 start
that coach Michele Sharp's Lady Jaspers went through against the likes of Vanderbilt, Duke, Georgia Tech, Rhode
Island and St. Joseph's.  But after that stretch, a talented supporting cast led the Lady J's to wins in 16 of the next
19 games, including a College-record seven-game winning streak.  They managed to score over 90 points on nine
occasions and a College-record 78.5 points per game in 1995-96.  Despite finishing second in the regular season,
the Lady J's explosive offense led them to the school's third MAAC Championship and an automatic bid to the
NCAA Tournament (a first-round loss at Virginia), the school's first since 1990.<p>

	As for Somma, the 1995-96 season turned out to be an outstanding finale.  Her 1,838 career points are
second most in College history.  Her 819 rebounds rank her fourth all-time in that category.  Her 25.6 points per
game this season not only ranked her third in the nation, but also set a single-season College record.  She earned
MAAC and Metropolitan Player of the Year honors, while the Associated Press voted her Honorable Mention All-American.<p>

	As usual, many personal records and individual victories were compiled during the indoor track and field
season.  In fact, four new women's College records and a pair of new men's College records were set during the
season.  One of those records, a 25'5 1/2" long jump by senior Conroy Daley, was good enough to win the IC4A
indoor long jump championship.  In fact, Daley may have turned in the most memorable single-meet performance
in recent history by winning both the long jump and the triple jump events at the IC4A's.  His performance
catapulted Manhattan to a third-place finish at the meet, which was also bolstered by a 1-2 finish in the 500m event
by seniors Sean James and Michael Williams.  Sophomore Sophia Tasker also provided a highlight for coach Dan
Mecca's squad by winning the women's 55 meter dash at the George Mason Invitational in a College-record time
of 6.93 seconds.<p>

     And, as has become an annual event, the women's swimming team again posted a winning record.  Coach Jack
Carey's squad finished 7-4, their seventh straight winning season.  <p>

     Though the <b>SPRING SEASON</b> contained its share of foul weather, several teams and individuals overcame the
elements to produce winning results.<p>

	On March 23, Manhattan's men's lacrosse team faced off against Mount St. Mary's College of Maryland. 
It marked a new era for Manhattan sports as lacrosse formally became a full-fledged Division I program after 14
years on the club level (a Division I women's program will begin in the spring of 1997).  Of historical note: the
team's first-ever victory came on April 18 vs. N.Y.U., and the team's final record was 2-10.  Freshman midfielder
Larry Ayers was a two-time MAAC Rookie of the Week honoree.<p>

	Coach Paul Mazzei (who retired at the end of the season as the College's winningest softball coach ever)
again led his team to a post-season MAAC Tournament berth as a pair of Lady Jaspers posted remarkable seasons. 
Freshman Jen Fisher earned All-MAAC and MAAC Rookie of the Year honors as she led the MAAC with seven
home runs and led the Lady J's with a .361 batting average.  Senior Jill Picaso ended her Manhattan career by
joining Fisher on the All-MAAC Team with .311 batting average.<p>

	The baseball team accumulated nine wins during the season (their most since 1991), including victories vs.
each of their MAAC South rivals.  The previous season's MAAC Rookie of the Year, shortstop Jeff Rowett, was
this year's All-MAAC South shortstop.  Coach Gary Puccio was named the MAAC South's Co-Coach of the Year. 
<p>

	The transition from the indoor season to the outdoor season didn't changed the streak of fortune for the track
and field team.  In their very first meet of the outdoor season, in Tempe, Arizona, junior hammer thrower Vicki
Rutigliano qualified for the NCAA "B" standard, making it the 17th consecutive year that a Manhattan hammer
thrower (male or female) had qualified for that national standard.  In that same meet, the women's 4x400m relay
team set a College record with a 3:47.80 finish, while the women's 4x200m relay team set yet another College
record with a 1:38.25 finish at the recent Penn Relays.  Not to be outdone, two men (Conroy Daley and Michael
Williams) qualified for the NCAA's in the triple jump and 800m, respectively. Then, following the collegiate season,
junior Dine Potter became Manhattan's first female athlete to compete in the Olympic Games, as she qualified in
the 4x100m and 4x400m for her parent's native country of Antigua.   <p>

	The men's tennis team continued their fall success by recording 7-0 shutout victories in two of their first
three matches and going to record their tenth straight winning season (6-3-1).  Meanwhile, on the links, the men's
golf team finished with a perfect 4-0 record and qualified for the Metropolitan Golf Association Championships. 
Individually, senior Bill Gerondel recorded a fourth-place finish at the Hofstra Open.<p>

	Overall, the accomplishments of Manhattan's 1995-96 sports teams again received the widespread attention
that they deserved, a tribute to all those fine athletes that represented the College so well.  It truly was a year to
remember.<p>

<i><b>What Are The Benefits Of Cooperative Education?</b></i> 
<BR> <img src="greenbal.gif">
Cooperative Education provides an immediate source of highly
 motivated and qualified employees who have a career interest
 in the profession of their placement.<br>
<img src="greenbal.gif">
The employer can evaluate, without long-term commitment 
and in a realistic work environment, potential permanent
  employees and thus cut recruitment and training costs.<br>
<img src="greenbal.gif">
The use of co-op students frees the permanent professional 
staff to maximize its creative contributions.<br>
<img src="greenbal.gif">
Cooperative Education provides talented and enthusiastic 
students for short-term assignments as a cost effective way
 to handle temporary and seasonal  needs.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
Co-op students offer fresh perspectives and stimulating 
ideas, contributing to the growth of an organization.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
Cooperative Education gives employers a creative role
 in preparing young people for full participation in the life
 of the community.<p>
<br><br><b><i>What Is The Role Of The Employer?</i></b>
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
The employer provides the student with a full 
orientation to the policies and procedures of the organization
 and the student's own specific  role and responsibilities.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
The employer offers meaningful supervision throughout the term
 of employment and periodic evaluation of the student's 
job performance.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
The Employer works with Manhattan College 
faculty members and co-op staff to ensure that work assignments
 are sufficiently challenging to broaden and extend the students
 understanding of the subject matter.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
Salaries are appropriate to the nature of the position
 and the educational level of the student.<p><br>
<b><i>How Does Cooperative Education Work?</i></b>
<br>At Manhattan college, students have various options for
 participation in cooperative education internships:
<br><br><img src="greenbal.gif">
<b>Parallel Program</b>- the student combines part-time work 
(15-20 hours per week) with full-time study.  Participation in this
 program must include at least one semester, 
Fall (September - December) or Spring (January - May) and may include 
full-time placement during the Summer (May - August).
<br><img src="greenbal.gif"><b>Full Time Co-op Program</b>
 - the student  works at  a co-op assignment for one year full-time 
 during their senior year.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">Students must complete two co-op
 placements during their stay at Manhattan College, with the
 exception of students participating in the full time program.
<br><img src="greenbal.gif">
In addition, co-op students receive professional career counseling
 and are assisted in developing effective resume writing and 
interview skills.  A Career Development Seminar is open to all
 students considering co-op placement.
<p><br><b><i>How Can My Organization Participate?</i></b>
<br>To find out how your organization can be a cooperative
 education participant call Career Services & Cooperative Education
 at 718-920-0224/421.<BR>

or when it wil be done. As always, we'll try our best to limit down time.

Services Beta Release</B>
<P>
<UL>We are proud to announce the limited beta release of applications services
to Microsoft Windows 95 users participating in the Resident Network Project.
The preparation for this release has been long and hard, however, we are
very optimistic that this release will meet with applauds of joy. It cannot
be understated that the most important part of a beta release is end-user
feedback. I myself can only run so many tests on so many machines...users
must communicate to me their difficulties and/or problems clearly and
with as much <U>detail</U> as possible, so that I may resolve the problems.

<P>
Windows 95 users wishing to install the beta release should consult the
<A HREF="/resnet/win95/index.html">Windows 95 ResNet Hompage</A> for details.

<UL><IMG SRC="/icons/orangeba.gif"> <B>Microsoft Windows v3.11 Beta Release 2</B>
<UL>With the second beta release we've addressed the following problems:
<P>
<UL><LI>Lotus Suite licensing problems (Approach, 1-2-3, Freelance)<BR>
<LI>QEMM v7.x, 8.x compatibility in SYSTEM.INI<BR>
<LI>Virtual memory swap files (temporary & permanent)<BR>
<LI>WS Ping inadvertently omitted from first release<BR>
</UL>
<P>
The student machines should be prompted to download (upgrade) the latest
beta release to their workstations. Please note that this procedure overwrites
all the files in C:\XWINDOWS, thus removing any customizations that you've
completed to this point.
<P>
It is very important that I have CONSTURCTIVE feedback from you, the students.
I can't really fix something if I don't know that it's broken, you should send
me any information you have concerning bug or problems. 
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icons/orangeba.gif"> <B>Microsoft Windows 95 Users Please Note</B>
<UL>Microsoft Windows 95 users should note that they <B>SHOULD NOT</B> use 
either the JasperNet installation diskette, or the Kingston EtherRx diskette
that comes in the Student Connectivity Package. Windows 95 users should follow
the directions outlined in the document entitled <A HREF="/resnet/win95/win95inst.html"><B>Configuring Windows 95 for JasperNet</B></A>. Windows 95 users cannot in
the traditional sense, log on to the network, they can avail themselves of
certain services, however they must install software on their local machine
to take advantage of such services. (Eg. Internet Explorer or Netscape 
Navigator for surfing the Intenet and/or Pegasus Mail for electronic mail).
<P>
Instructions for the above can be found in the latest version of the 
<A HREF="/resnet/win95/win95inst.html"><B>Windows 95 Installation Guide </B></A>,
and in the <A HREF="/resnet/win95/peginst.html"><B>Pegasus Installation Guide</B></A>.

(Networked Student Version)</B>
<UL>I've been finally able to complete the work on a <I>beta</I> release of
Microsoft Windows v3.11 (Networked Student Version). Unfortunately there
have been a great many things drawing my attention away from this ongoing
project, I hope to release an <I>official</I> version in the very near
future. Students that are participating in the Residential Networking Project
should be prompted, while logging into the network from their personal
computers, with instructions and information regarding the <I>beta</I> 
release.<P>
<CENTER>STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMAIL THEIR COMMENTS, PROBLEMS, ETC</CENTER>
<P>
Please send them to me, Michael McNamara (mfm@manhattan.edu). Without your
help it's very difficult to know if things are functioning as designed or
planned... feedback is critical to this stage of development, thanks.

<UL><IMG SRC="/icons/whitebal.gif"> <B>T1 Internet Upgrade Completed</B>
<UL>Manhattan College is now connected to the Internet via a T1 (1MB) circuit.
This circuit offers the equivalent throughput of 1 megabyte per second on 
communications to our ISP (Internet Service Provider). Communications with
some sites will see an improvement in performance, while others will remain
unchanged due to the speed of their circuit. 
</UL></UL>
<P>
<UL><IMG SRC="/icons/whitebal.gif"> <B>A Note about Electronic Mail Addresses</B>
<UL>Please note that all electronic mail addresses for this institution
should take one of the following forms :
<PRE>
		<I>&ltusername&gt</I>@manhattan.edu
		<I>&ltusername&gt</I>@student.manhattan.edu

		<I>&ltusername&gt</I>@manrisc.cc.manhattan.edu
		<I>&ltusername&gt</I>@manvax.cc.manhattan.edu
</PRE>
While several servers and mail hubs provide services to these addresses,
they should not be referenced directly. In the event of failure, mail
that is reference directly will fail to be delivered. However, mail
that is address as above will bounce from server to server until it
finds the mailbox of the user for which the mail is intended. 
<P>
POP mail users should take special notice not to configure their return
mail address incorrectly. The flow of mail is dynamic, and any one of the
currently functioning servers could be down and unavailable, thus mail
will be rerouted and reach it's destination <B>ONLY IF YOU USE THE
CORRECT MAIL ADDRESS</B>.

Kingston EtherRx ODI driver, ODI drivers for other cards should be copied
from the distribution diskette provided by the vendor.
<P>
 This file is only useful to those 
people that are running plain MS-DOS with Microsoft Windows v3.x, it is
useless to anyone running MacOS, OS/2, Windows 95, or Windows NT; since
they have and require their own set of drivers. The drivers can be found

<B>It's been a very busy winter recess for those of us at the Academic
Computer Center.  We've been working literraly around the clock in preparing
for the start of the spring semester.  The serveral heavy snowfalls have
made a significant impact on our maintenance schedule, but we hope to have
everything operational for the first day of classes. During this winter
recess we've focussed specifically on the Novell NetWare Network since it
now spans the campus and has become the platform of choice.</B>

The Academic Computer Center doesn't actually have a techincal support
department or technical support staff for that matter. We do have the
expeirence and leadership of Cindy Duggan, the Academic Support
Administrator, combined with the knowledge and experience of the entire
department.  While we try our best to answer every question that is put
to us, please be aware that we too might not always have the answers.

<p><strong><a name="privileges">BORROWING 
PRIVILEGES</a></strong></p>

<p>     Currently enrolled students, faculty, administrators, staff, and alumni
of Manhattan College and the College of Mount Saint Vincent with valid college
ID cards have borrowing privileges.  Full-time faculty members and administrators
with valid ID cards from WALDO**-member libraries may also borrow books.  Other
persons presenting proof of address may be issued a renewable $50.00-borrower's
card valid for twelve months.  Elementary and high school students do not have
library privileges.<br>  
**Westchester Academic Library Directors Organization</p>

<p>     A valid MC or CMSV ID card is required to check out materials.  Books
circulate to students for four weeks and to faculty members for four months. 
Reference books and periodicals do not circulate.  A book may be renewed at the
circulation desk if no other borrower has requested it.  Renewals may not be made
by mail or telephone.  A hold may be placed on a book that is checked out.  When
the book is returned, it will be held at the circulation desk for one week for
the requestor.  (See also <a href="circ.html">Circulation Policy.)</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="cards">LIBRARY  CARDS</a></strong></p>

<p>     The college ID card becomes the library card when it is barcoded in the
library.</p>

<p><strong><a name="fines">FINES  AND  CHARGES</a></strong></p>

<P>     The fine for overdue books is $.10 per day (with a maximum of $20.00 per
book).  If a book is not returned, the borrower is charged $35.00 ($45.00 for
Engineering Library books) plus any fine.  Although an attempt is made to notify
borrowers of overdue materials, the borrower is responsible for returning them
and for any fines whether or not notification has been received.  Delinquencies
may result in suspension of borrowing privileges and/or withholding of
transcripts.  Students who owe at least three overdue books or $20.00 in fines
are blocked from checking other materials out.  (See also <a href="circ.html">
Circulation Policy.)</a></p>

<p><strong><a name="reserve">RESERVE  MATERIALS</a></strong></p>

<p>     Faculty members sometimes place books, articles, or other materials on
reserve in the library for their classes.  A list of reserve materials may be
consulted at the circulation desk.  The reserve list may also be displayed by
typing the RES command and keywords (such as the professor's name) into the PALS
online catalog.  A valid ID card is required to check out reserve materials.  Use
of reserve materials is generally restricted to two hours in the library or to
overnight use.  Overnight reserve materials must be returned the next day
including weekends.  The fine for overdue overnight reserve materials is $.25 per
hour (with a maximum of $20.00 per item).  (See also <a href="circ.html">
Circulation Policy.)</a></p>

<p><strong><a name="identifying">FINDING  BOOKS  AND
PERIODICALS</a></strong></p>

        Books in the Manhattan College Libraries can be identified by author,
title, or subject in the PALS* online catalog (books database).  The PALS
computers also provide access to several periodical indexes that list articles
by author (AU), title (TT), and subject term (TE).  Periodical titles held by the
Manhattan College Libraries are listed in the PALS online catalog (serials
database) and in printed lists.  PALS also lists the book and periodical holdings
of Mount Saint Vincent, Fordham, and academic and public libraries in
Westchester.  (See also <a HREF= "palsbks.html"> Searching for Books in the PALS
Online Catalog.)</a><br>  
*Public Access Library System</p>

<p>     In the Hayes Library, books acquired since 1980 are arranged according
to the Library of Congress Classification and are located on the upper floors and
decks.  Most books acquired before then are arranged according to the Dewey 
Decimal Classification and are located on the two lower decks.  Current
periodicals (for the last several weeks or months) are located on the third
floor.  Bound periodicals, microfilm, and microfiche are located on the lower
level.  (See also <A HREF="hayesloc.html">Location Guide</a>.)</p>  

<P>     In the Engineering Library, the books and periodicals are shelved on the
same floor.</p>  

<p><strong><a name="reference">REFERENCE  SERVICE</a></strong></p>

<p>     During regular sessions, reference librarians are available to answer
questions in the Hayes Library Sundays through Thursdays until 9:00 P.M. and on
other days until closing.  In the Engineering Library, reference service is
available weekday afternoons while classes are in session.</p>

<p><strong><a name="onlinecomp">ONLINE  COMPUTER  DATABASE 
SEARCHES</a></strong></p>

<p>     Librarians in the Hayes and Engineering libraries provide access to more
than four hundred commercially available databases.  These searches generally
produce a bibliography with abstracts on a topic.  Consult a reference librarian
for more information.  (See also <A HREF="online.html">Online Database
Searches</a>.)</p>

<p><strong><a name="microforms">MICROFORMS</a></strong></p>

<p>     Microfilm and microfiche materials and equipment are located on the lower
level of the Hayes Library and in the Engineering Library. The reader/printers
charge $.10  per page.</p>

<p><strong><a name="av">AUDIOVISUAL  MATERIALS</a></strong></p>

<p>     Audiovisual materials and equipment are located on the lower level of the
Hayes Library.  The Engineering Library also has video-viewing equipment.</p>

<p><strong><a name="ill">INTERLIBRARY  LOANS</a></strong></p>

<p>     Books or photocopies of articles not available in the Manhattan College
Libraries may be requested from other libraries through interlibrary loan. 
Request forms may be picked up at the reference or circulation desks.  Allow from
two to three weeks for delivery.  (See also <a href="ill.html">Interlibrary
Lending</a>.)</p>

<p><strong><a name="dd">DOCUMENT  DELIVERY</a></strong></p>

<p>     Copies of selected periodical articles on many subjects may be ordered
through the document delivery computers located on deck 5.  The system charges
$.30 per page.  The articles arrive at the circulation desk by fax in
approximately 20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong><a name="area">ACCESS  TO  AREA  COLLEGE  AND 
UNIVERSITY
LIBRARIES</a></strong></p>

<p>     Manhattan College students may make on-site use of the WALDO libraries
listed in the PALS online catalog.  Full-time Manhattan College faculty members
and administrators having WALDO stickers on their Manhattan ID cards may borrow
from WALDO libraries.  Limited on-site use of many other area libraries may be
made through use of a METRO* referral card, which can be issued by a Manhattan
College reference librarian.  (See also <a HREF="metro.html"> The METRO Referral
Card </a>.)<br> 
*New York Metropolitan Reference and Research Library Agency</p>

<p><strong><a name="photocopies">PHOTOCOPIERS</a></strong></p>

<p>     The Hayes and Engineering libraries have photocopiers that charge $.10 
per page.  Copy cards are available for purchase, and there is a per copy discount 
for cards with more than $5.00 of value.</p>

<p><strong><a name="suggestions">SUGGESTIONS</a></strong></p>

<p>     Library users are encouraged to make suggestions for the improvement of
library resources and services.   Signed suggestions or complaints deposited in
the suggestion box in the Hayes Library will be answered.  Email comments may be
sent to <a HREF="mailto:toconnor@manvax.cc.mancol.edu">Br. Thomas
O'Connor</a>, Public Services Librarian.  Book order forms are available at the reference

<h2 align=center>Interlibrary Lending</h2>

<p>   The Manhattan College Libraries offer interlibrary lending services to
current faculty and students for materials that are not available in the
Manhattan collections.  Policies governing these services are set by the American
Library Association's National Interlibrary Loan Code.</p>

<p><strong>INTERLIBRARY  LENDING  (ILL)</strong></p>
<p>   If a referral to a local library is not possible or fails to meet a user's
needs, the Manhattan libraries can provide for the interlibrary loan of books
and/or the purchase of journal article photocopies.  Transaction fees may be
levied by the lending library.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS  LENT</strong></p>
<p>   Most libraries will lend materials that ordinarily circulate to their
users.  Rare books, reference works, theses, and dissertations are not usually
lent.  Copies of many dissertations are available for purchase from University
Microfilms International, Inc.</p>

<p><strong>ILL  PROCEDURE</strong></p>
<p>   All requests for loans or photocopies should be submitted on the Libraries'
interlibrary
loan forms.  Forms may be obtained at the reference desk, or you can print out the <a
href="illbook.html">Interlibrary Loan Form for Books</a> or the <a
href="illper.html">Interlibrary Loan Form for Periodical Articles</a>.  A separate form
should be completed for each item requested, and forms can <b>not</b> be submitted
electronically.</p> 

<p>Beginning in 1996, a $1.00 fee must be submitted with each request.  Please provide
accurate and complete information.  Always attach a copy of the citation or give the source
of your citation so that it can be verified, if necessary.  Plan on two or three weeks to
receive the material requested.</p>

<p><strong>LENGTH  OF  LOAN</strong></p>
<p>   This is determined by the lending library, but a two-week minimum is the
general rule.  In certain cases, material may be renewed at the discretion of the
lending library. Renewals should be requested at least five days before the end
of the loan period.  Failure to return borrowed materials on time may result in
the loss of interlibrary loan privileges.</p>

<p><strong>NOTIFICATION  AND  PICK-UP</strong></p>
<p>   The patron will be notified by card through campus or U.S. mail when the
material has arrived. The patron is asked to bring the card to the circulation
desk in the Hayes Library (or the Engineering Library for engineers), where the
material will be available.  Loans must be picked up in person, and any charges
must be paid at that time.</p>

<p><strong>COPYRIGHT</strong></p>
<p>   Copyright rules require that photocopies be made for "private study,
scholarship, or research."  Requestors of copies must sign a compliance with
"fair use."<BR> </p>

             <h2 align=center>Reserve Policy</h2>
<p>      Faculty members sometimes place books, copies of articles, or
audiovisual materials on reserve in the libraries.  To ensure the availability
of the materials when they are needed by the students, faculty members are asked
to observe the following guidelines:</p>
<OL>
<LI>Reserve lists (see the reverse side) should be submitted to the
circulation/reserve desk one week before the first day of class.  This also
applies to any personal copies of books, articles, or audiovisual materials that
are to go on reserve.  (Personal copies will be barcoded for use with the PALS
circulation system.)

<LI>Faculty members are encouraged to come to the library to select the books
to put on reserve.  If a particular book is unavailable, the faculty member may
decide to make a substitution.  If there is more than one copy of a title, the
faculty member may decide how many to put on reserve.

<LI>In accordance with U.S. copyright law, the Manhattan College Libraries will
make one copy of a periodical article or book chapter for class reserves. 
Faculty members may bring their personal copies to place on reserve.

<LI>The faculty member determines the loan-length of the reserve material.  The
PALS circulation system offers 2-hour, 24-hour, and 1-week loan lengths for
reserves.

<LI>Problems can arise when many students are trying to read the same
periodical article in a short period of time.  If the librarians are advised in
time, arrangements can be made to protect the integrity of the collections. 
Sometimes the bound volume of a periodical title is put on reserve in addition
to a copy of the article in question.

<LI>At the end of the term, materials are automatically taken off reserve.  The
libraries have very limited space.

<title>METRO Referral Card, Manhattan College Libraries</title>

<h1 align=center>The Metro Referral Card</h1>

<p>  Questions often arise about Manhattan College Students and faculty using
other libraries in the region.  METRO, a cooperative network of academic and
public libraries, has devised the METRO referral card to permit on-site use of
many area libraries.  The METRO libraries have agreed to the following guidelines
for the use of this card.</p>

<p><strong>1.  THE  YELLOW  METRO  REFERRAL  CARD  (for access to a specific
item)</strong></p>

<p>  a.  The yellow METRO card is intended for a specific referral and not for
general use of another library.  The bearer should need a work that is not
available in his or her college library or in a public library.  The specific
request should be written on the card, which is issued by a reference librarian
at the requestor's library.</p>

<p>  b.  The referral card cannot be issued merely for the personal convenience
of the reader, such as proximity of another academic library to his or her
home.</p>

<p>  c.  Before a referral is made, a reference librarian in the issuing library
determines whether its resources or a public library do not meet the reader's
needs.</p>

<p>  d.  The issuing library calls the host library to verify ownership of the
title needed and to ascertain whether the reader will be admitted.  Access to
another library does not guarantee that materials will be available at a
particular time.</p>

<p>  e.  The host library collects the referral card when it is first presented
and determines the length of time the reader may use the
library.</p>

<p>  f.  The METRO referral card permits only on-site use of the item cited on
the card.  It does not authorize the borrowing of
books from the host library.</p>

<p><strong>2.  THE  BLUE  METRO  REFERRAL  CARD  (for subject
access)</strong></p>

<p>  The blue METRO card provides access to selected area libraries for materials
on a specific subject not covered by the home library or public libraries.  The
guidelines for the blue METRO card are similar to that of the yellow METRO
card.</p>

<p>  THE  COLUMBIA  AND  NEW  YORK  UNIVERSITY  LIBRARIES  HAVE 
RESTRICTIVE  ACCESS  POLICIES.   LIBRARY USERS  SHOULD  DETERMINE 
IF THE  RESEARCH LIBRARIES  OF  THE  NEW  YORK  PUBLIC  LIBRARY 
HAVE WHAT  THEY  NEED  BEFORE  SEEKING  ACCESS  TO  THOSE 
LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>  MANHATTAN  COLLEGE  STUDENTS  AND  FACULTY  MEMBERS  DO 
NOT  NEED  METRO  CARDS  FOR  ON-SITE  USE  OF

                  <h2 align=center>Library Instruction</h2>

<p>   Students need good information skills to succeed in college. 
Manhattan College librarians help students individually at the reference desk,
but it is also helpful sometimes for them to make  presentations to classes on
how to find information in the college libraries.</p>

<p>   Library instruction can take a number of forms:</p>
<UL><LI>    group tours (usually for first-year students), 
<LI>        basic classes on library research methods and reference sources<BR> 
            (also usually for first-year students),
<LI>        more advanced classes on specialized resources for upper division
undergraduates or graduate students.</ul>
<P>   In one of these classes, a librarian may take a sample topic through the
basic steps in library research by explaining how to use the <a href="palsgate.html">
PALS online catalog,</a> reference books, and computer databases.  They may also
describe access to
resources beyond the college libraries.  A good time for such instruction is when
the students are starting work on a term paper.</p>
<p>   Faculty members may request library instruction for their classes by contacting  
<a href="mailto:toconnor@manhattan.edu"> Thomas O'Connor</a> or 
<a href="mailto:spober@manvax.cc.manhattan.edu"> Stacy Pober</a> in the Hayes
Library (718-862-7166) or <A href="mailto:jgormley@manhattan.edu"> John
Gormley</a> in the Engineering Library (718-862-7295).</p>

<title>Manhattan College Libraries Pathfinder for the History of 
the NYC Subway System </title>

<META NAME="keywords" content="Manhattan College Libraries, Manhattan College

NYC subway system at Manhattan College Libraries">

             <h2 align=center>Pathfinder:  History of the New York City Subway
System</h2><p> 

<p>This pathfinder takes a sample topic through several basic steps in library research. 
Call numbers refer to the Cardinal Hayes Library.  This is not intended to be a
comprehensive guide to researching this particular topic, but rather a guide through the
research process.  A similar search strategy may be used for other topics.  Some steps may
be omitted or be done in a different order than is presented here.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Define your topic.</h3>

<p><Strong>IDENTIFY  THE  QUESTION  OR  PROBLEM</strong></P>
     
<p>What impact did the building of the subway system have on the development of New
York City in the early twentieth century?  More specifically, what impact did the building of
the subway system have on the development of the Bronx?  Population?  Housing? 
Employment?  Other factors?</p>

<p><strong>ADJUST  THE  SCOPE  OF  THE  TOPIC</strong>

<p>Is the topic too broad or too narrow?</P>

<p>If your topic is too narrow, you may not find very much research has been published
on such a specific topic.  However, if your topic is overly broad, you may have no particular
focus to your research, and it will be hard to cover the topic with any depth.</p>
     
<p><strong>DEVELOP  A  LIST  OF  SEARCH  TERMS</strong></p>
<DL>
<DD>Subway
<DD>Subways
<DD>Metropolitan Transit Authority
<DD>New York City History
<DD>New York NY History
<DD>Bronx New York
<DD>Bronx NY
<DD>Bronx Borough
</dl>
<h3>Step 2: Gain a general overview.</h3>

<p><strong>CONSULT  ENCYCLOPEDIAS  OR  OTHER  REFERENCE
BOOKS</strong></p>

<p>For reference books on New York City, see the section in Hayes Library stacks with
the call number beginning REF F 128 and deck 5.</p>

<p>For factual information at any point in the library research process, consult other
reference books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, bibliographies, almanacs, statistical
sources, handbooks, or directories.  For help in locating relevant resources, consult one of
the <a href="director.html">librarians</a> at the Reference Desk.</p>  

<h3>Step 3: Locate books.</h3>

<p><strong>CHECK  THE  PALS  ONLINE  CATALOG</strong></p>

<p>Type <code>MENU</CODE> and type the number next to BOOKS in the listing. 
Then press the [ENTER] key. <br> 
You can look up a book by using commands for author (<CODE>AU</code>), title term
(<code>TT</code>), or subject term (<code>TE</code>).</p> 

<p>To search for books at the College of Mount Saint Vincent library, type the command
<code>CHO MSV</code>.  To search for books at other libraries using the PALS
system,
type the command: <code>CHO SYS</code> (For further information, see also <a
href="palsbks.html">Finding Books Using the PALS Online Catalog</a>.)</p>

<p>For help with search terms, see:</p>
<pre>
REF       Library of Congress Subject Headings. 
Z         Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1995.
695.L695  (Shelved in Lobby of Cardinal Hayes Library)
</pre>

<p><strong>FIND  THE  BOOKS  ON  THE  SHELVES</p></strong>

<p>Books acquired by the Manhattan College Libraries since 1980 are arranged according
to the Library of Congress Classification.  Older books are arranged according to
the Dewey Decimal Classification.  To locate a book with a particular call number, check
the signs located near the PALS terminals and on the various floors and decks.  (For more
information, see <a href="hayesloc.html">Locating Books in the Cardinal Hayes
Library</a>.)</p>

<h3>Step 4: Locate articles.</h3>
                                                   
<p><strong>SEARCH  PERIODICAL  AND  NEWSPAPER 
INDEXES</strong></p>

<p>To find a reference to a magazine, newspaper, or journal article on a subject, use the
print or electronic periodical indexes located on the first floor and on deck 5 of the Cardinal
Hayes Library.  These indexes generally provide access to articles by author, title, and
subject.  See,
for example:</p>
<UL type=circle>
<LI>Academic Index  
<DL><dd>- Located on Infotrac Computer in Deck 5 of Hayes Library 
<dd>- Indexes general periodicals
</dl><LI> Periodical Abstracts  
<Dl><dd>- Indexes popular and scholarly periodicals 
<dd>- Available through PALS system at Hayes Library or through other computers at
Manhattan College through the MC Libraries' WWW pages
<dd>- Updated monthly
</dl><LI>ABI-INFORM  
<dl><dd>- Indexes business periodicals 
<dd>- Available through PALS system at Hayes Library or through other computers at
Manhattan College through the MC Libraries' WWW pages
<dd>- Updated monthly
</dl><LI>Newspaper Abstracts  
<dl><dd>- Indexes daily newspapers, including the New York Times, Wall Street
Journal,
and Washington Post 
<dd>- Available through PALS system at Hayes Library or through other computers at
Manhattan College through the MC Libraries' WWW pages
<dd>- Updated monthly
</dl></ul>

<p><strong>CHECK  THE  AVAILABILITY OF THE ARTICLES</strong></p>

<p>When viewing a citation of an articles in the Periodicals Abstracts or ABI-INFORM
databases, using the <code>DA</code> command will produce messages that display
information about the availability of the periodicals at Manhattan College Libraries and
through the electronic Document Delivery system.</p>  

<p>The printed periodicals list, which is located at the reference and circulation desks and
several other places, lists the periodical and newspaper titles owned by either Manhattan
College or by the College of Mount Saint Vincent.  It tells what years they own for each title
and whether the back issues are on microfilm or microfiche.  (When backfiles of journals
exist and no notation is made regarding microforms, the back issues will be bound.)</p>
  
<p>The serials database in PALS also lists the periodical holdings of Manhattan College
and other local libraries (most of them located in Westchester).  To search for a periodical
title (not an individual article) in the PALS system libraries, type the command:
<code>MENU</code> and then choose the number next to the menu item called
SERIALS.   Once in the SERIALS database, type <code>CHO SYS</code> to search all
the libraries in the system.  (For more information, look at <a href="palsser.html">
Searching the Union List of Serials/Periodicals Using PALS</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>FIND  THE  ARTICLES  THEMSELVES.</strong></p>

<p>In the Hayes Library, current periodicals and newspapers (for the past several weeks or
months) are on the Third Floor, bound periodicals are on Deck 3 and in adjoining rooms,
and periodicals and newspapers on microfilm or microfiche are on the Lower Level.</p>  

<p>If neither Manhattan College nor Mount Saint Vincent has a book or article you need,
you may request a copy on interlibrary loan.  Ask for the interlibrary loan forms at the
reference desk.  (For more information, look at <a href="ill.html">Interlibrary Lending,
Manhattan College Libraries.</a>)</p>

<h3>Step 5: Read and take notes.</h3>

<p><strong>EVALUATE  YOUR  SOURCES</strong></p>

<p>Is the work sufficiently complete and current?  Is it biased?  Is it written in a
scholarly or popular style (whichever you need)?   Is the author a recognized authority on
the subject?  Does the author present evidence to support his or her conclusions? 

<p>To locate book reviews, you may use the computer indexes, such as Periodicals
Abstracts, or consult the following printed indexes which are available in the Cardinal
Hayes Library:</p>

<pre>
REF       Book Review Digest.  Monthly.
Index     (in the South Reading Room)
Area

REF       Book Review Index.  Bimonthly.
Index     (in the South Reading Room)
Area
</pre>

<p><strong>USE  A  STYLE  MANUAL</strong></p>

<p>For methods of taking notes and writing footnotes and bibliographies, consult a
standard style manual:</p>
<pre>
on          Gibaldi, Joseph.  MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers. 
reserve     4th ed.  New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1995.

on          American Pscyhological Association.  Publication Manual of the 
reserve     American Psychological Association.  4th ed.  New York:  American
            Psychological Association, 1995.

<h1 align=center>Online Database Searches</h1>
     
<p>  Most areas of research are now covered by indexes and abstracts that
can be searched by computer.  Such searches generally result in a
bibliography of articles on a specific topic.  It is also possible to obtain
statistical data in business or economics through a computer search.</p>

<p>  In addition to the databases available free of charge by means of the
PALS online catalog, the Manhattan College Libraries have online access to
more than four hundred databases through Dialog Information Services,
Inc.</p>

<p>  The cost of searching these commercially available databases depends
upon which databases are selected, the amount of connect time, and the
number and length of the records retrieved.  The library bills academic
departments for faculty searches and pays for the first $15.00 of student
searches.</p>

<p>  To request a database search, you must either fill out the form available in the lobby
of
the Cardinal Hayes Library and turn it in at the reference desk or you may contact <a
href="mailto:spober@manvax.cc.manhattan.edu">Stacy Pober </a> or <a
href="mailto:toconnor@manhattan.edu"> Br. Thomas O'Connor </a> at the
Cardinal Hayes Library or contact <a href="mailto:jgormley@manhattan.edu">John
Gormley</a> at the Engineering Library.  Or phone (718) 862-7166 (Hayes) or (718)
862-7295 (Engineering).  The database searches are often done by appointment.</p>

<h1 align=center>Searching the Union List of Serials on the PALS Online Catalog</h1>

<p>The PALS online catalog lists magazines, newspapers, and scholarly journals in the
Manhattan College Libraries and in <A HREF=#otherlibs>other
local libraries</a> listed on this page.  The Union List of Serials is a guide that will tell you
which, if any, local libraries possess a particular journal or magazine or newspaper.  It is
<b>NOT</b> a periodical article index.  If you need to look up articles by subject, consider
using <a href="palsper.html">Periodicals Abstracts, Newspaper Abstracts</a> or 
<a href="pathfind.html#electronic">other indexes.</a><br>
PALS stands for Public Access Library System.</p>

<p><strong>GETTING  STARTED</strong><br>
        Type the word <code>MENU</code> and then press the enter key.<br>
        Type the number next to <code>SERIALS</code>, and press the enter key.</p>

<p><strong>BASIC  SEARCH  COMMANDS</strong><br>
        Begin each search with one of the following two-letter commands.<br>
        Press the enter key after each command.</p>
<DL>
<DT>TT - <i>Title Term Search  (key title words)</i>
<DD><code>TT  WALL STREET</code>  
<DT>TI - <i> Title Search  (exact title)</i>
<DD><code>TI NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</code><BR>
When using the exact title search, the title is typed in exactly, except in cases where the title
begins with the word "The".  The initial "The" should not be included when searching for
those journal titles.  
</DL>
<p><strong>TRUNCATION</strong><br>
Use a # sign to stand for one or more characters at the end of a word.<br> <code>TT
CONSUMER# REPORT#</code>  (This retrieves consumer or consumers and report or
reports.)</p>
<p>The # symbol can also substitute for an unknown title word in an exact title search.
<code>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF #</code> (This retrieves all journal titles beginning
with those three words.</p>

<p><strong>DISPLAYING  RESULTS</strong><br></p>
<DL>
<DT>DI - <i>Displays a summary of the perioidical titles retrieved. </i>
<DT>DI  1 - <i>Displays the record for the periodical title listed on line
1.</i>
<DT>RE - <i>Recall the previous list of periodical titles.</i>
<DT>NR - <i>Next Record</i>                      
<DT>NS - <i>Next Screen</i>
<DT>PR - <i>Previous Record</i>
<DT>PS - <i>Previous Screen</i>
</DL>
<p><strong>INTERPRETING THE HOLDINGS INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Check the NOTES: field in the record to find out which years of a periodical title are
held by a library.<br>
A notation in the NOTES field of a beginning date with no ending date listed (for example:
<Code>1978 - </code>) indicates that there is a <i>current subscription</i> to that journal
at the library, and that the library holds back issues beginning with 1978.<br>
Please note that there are two significant dates in the record for a periodical title.  There is
the date it began publication, and the date the library began its subscription to the journal. 
For example, a periodical may have begun publication in 1922, but the library's
subscription may have begun in 1984.  In such a case, the older issues (pre-1984) of that
journal will not be available at that library. Remember to check the NOTES: field to see
specific information about the library's holdings.<br>
When in doubt about a citation from SERIALS, you can consult the print guide,
<i>Periodials in the Libraries of Manhattan College and the College of Mount Saint
Vincent</i> or you can <a href="director.html">consult a librarian</a></p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>General Information</H1>

<B>September 19, 1996</B><BR>
<P>
We've just completed creating all the new incoming student's network
accounts. Usernames are comprised of the first letter of your first
name, followed by your last name, up to eight characters long. The
host name is student.manhattan.edu, ie. mmcnamar@student.manhattan.edu.
<P> 
If your name clashes with another student, the computer will randomly
select a single or two digit number, and append it to your username.
You may search the online addressbook, to see if you exist.
<P>
<B>September 12, 1996</B><BR>
<P>
We've just recently upgraded and changed several key information systems
and network components which might effect your electronic mail traffic.
<P>
We've changed our primary domain name from <I>mancol.edu</I> to
<I>manhattan.edu</I>. Please make a note of this change as it effects
every mail system and host name on our network. (ie. merlin.cc.mancol.edu
is now merlin.cc.manhattan.edu, www.mancol.edu is now www.manhattan.edu, 
ftp.mancol.edu is now ftp.manhattan.edu, news.mancol.edu is now 
news.manhattan.edu, nntp.mancol.edu is now nntp.manhattan.edu,etc).
<P>
We've also upgraded our primary network operating system from NetWare v3.12
to NetWare v4.1 NDS. We're currently using Pegasus Mail v2.42a as the client
with Mercury v1.30 NLM servicing the system side. The network, officially
named <I>JasperNet</I>, is composed of ten NetWare servers, dozens of UNIX
workstations and servers, dozens of PowerPC MACs, and hundreds of personal
computers, all networked to the campus backbone.<BR>
<P>
Electronic mail addresses now take the following two forms:<BR>
<P><CENTER>
staff or faculty : &ltusername&gt@manhattan.edu<BR>
students : &ltusername&gt@student.manhattan.edu<BR>
</CENTER><P>


<P>

	Use this E-Mail Query feature to locate an E-Mail address at 
Manhattan College for faculty, staff and students.
<P>
	Manhattan College has several Electronic Mail (E-Mail) systems.
We have traditional mainframe, and UNIX based systems as well as PC
based systems.  The PC based systems are comprised of Novell Netware
servers and PC DOS and Windows clients ( as well as MAC POP clients). For
this we use Pegasus E-mail for both DOS and windows. PC userss have no
hostname prefix.
The traditional
E-mail systems use PINE, plus other mail clients. These systems are
prefixed with either MANVAX, or MANUNIX in their host address field.
Some users have E-Mail addresses on several systems, according to
their personal preferences.

<h3><a name="BIOLOGY">BIOLOGY</a> (BIOL)</h3>
<strong>Professor William A. Tramontano,</strong> Chairperson of the Department<br>
<strong>Professor Sister Mary Edward Zipf,</strong> Associate Chairperson

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Biology is an integrated department with the College of Mount Saint Vincent. All lecture courses
are offered on the College of Mount Saint Vincent campus. In some courses, however, laboratory
and greenhouse work is conducted at the Laboratory of Plant Morphogenesis on the Manhattan
College campus.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The goal of the Department of Biology is to strive for an awareness of the achievements,
methods, potentials, and limitations of the biological sciences. To accomplish this goal, the
department will provide a combination of required and elective courses in biology consistent with
a liberal education and maintain a tradition of strong support for independent study and
undergraduate research. 

<p>Many of the critical problems which the world faces that challenge human values and beliefs are
based on biology principles. Students must possess the educational background to make ethical
decisions, especially with regard to scientific and technological issues. The faculty members of the
joined Department of Biology recognize their responsibility to raise these issues and to foster the
values that are important to the process of free inquiry, the foundation of our discipline.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The department has established a research affiliation with the Animal Health Center of the
NYZS/The Wildlife Conversation Society (Bronx Zoo). A limited number of research assistants at
the Animal Health Center are available to outstanding candidates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Majors:</strong> Every student considering a major in the department must consult the chairperson of the
department, preferably before the end of the freshman year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Major Requirements for the B.S. Degree:</strong> Recognizing the various professional goals of our
students, the department offers groups of courses in several areas of study which contribute
toward reaching a specific career objective. These areas of study include medical, dental, and
graduate school preparation, Biotechnology, Environmental Biology, and Exercise Physiology.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Students who wish to prepare for medical, dental, or graduate school require a minimum of 34
credits in upperclass Biology courses including the following: 217, 223, 225, 301, 303, 319, 320,
404. Students plan an individual program of study with their Biology courses and free electives
after consultation with an advisor of the Biology Department.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Students who wish to pursue Biotechnology are urged to select their Biology electives from the
following list: 302, 310, 316, 321, 322, 324, 360, 375, 401, 410, 426, 460, 475. Biology credit
will also be allotted to Chemistry 429, 430, 454, 456. Chemical Engineering 207 and 325 are
suggested free electives.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Students who wish to pursue Environmental Biology are urged to take the following Biology
electives: 304, 326, 409, 431, 432. Civil Engineering 304 and Mathematics 203 are suggested free
electives.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Students who wish to pursue Exercise Physiology are urged to take their Biology electives from
the following list: 306, 318, 319, 441, 443, 445, 475. Suggested free electives include: Physical
Education 209, 216, 231, 243, 319, 401, 418. Appropriate upperclass Biology courses may
substitute for Chemistry 320 and 324 under certain circumstances. Such changes require
consultation with and approval by the Biology Department Chairperson.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In order to pursue any specific area of study, it is essential that a student plan his/her proposed
course sequence in close consultation with his/her faculty advisor and the Chairperson.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With the approval of the Chairperson, Molecular Biology (Biology 321) may be substituted for
any of the seven required upperclass 3-credit Biology courses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Cognate Requirements:</strong> For all Biology Department B.S. majors: Chemistry 101-102, 319-320,
and 323-324; Mathematics 103-104; and Physics 107-108 are required.

<p><strong>Major requirements for the B.A. degree: </strong>Recognizing that many students have a distinct
interest in Biology, yet possess diverse and non-traditional career goals, the Department offers the
B.A. degree with a relatively large number of electives. Students should use these electives to
either minor or concentrate in any of the humanities, social science or business disciplines. This
program does not prepare students for medical/professional school, graduate studies in Biology,
or physical therapy programs unless other pre-requisites are met. The program is intended to help
students obtain employment in medical and pharmaceutical sales, medical writing, careers in
public health and safety and the insurance industry as it relates to health care.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Minors:</strong> 15 credits in courses above 100 level planned in consultation with the chairperson of the
department.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Grade Requirements:</strong> Majors and minors must attain a minimum grade of C in all required
biology courses. In general, students who do not maintain a minimum average grade of B in
111-112 and 113-114 or equivalent will not be admitted to the major.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Prerequisites for Upper Level Biology Courses:</strong> Biology 111-112 and 113-114 or the
equivalent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Registration for Advanced Courses: Permission of the chairperson of the Biology Department is
required for registration in all courses at the 300 and 400 levels.

<p>The Peace Studies Program is dedicated to the academic and moral search for solutions to the
problems of war and human injustice. To this end, Manhattan College offers Peace Studies as a
major academic field of study leading to the B.A. degree.

<p>Peace Studies is a multidisciplinary program which examines five areas: 1) war, 2) social justice,
3) conflict resolution, 4) nonviolent strategies, and 5) world community.

<p><strong>Requirements. </strong>Thirty credits are required for the major in Peace Studies in three categories:
seminars 201 and 401 (six credits); elective courses (21 credits); field work (3 or 6 credits). In the
senior year a thesis is encouraged through the completion of Peace Studies 421. Students
pursuing trans-national careers are required to complete 12 credits in foreign languages. Fifteen
credits are required for the minor in Peace Studies by advisement of the Director. A Certificate in
Peace Studies (15 credits) is available for those in possession of the bachelor's degree who desire

academic concentration. Students, however, are encouraged to pursue another major in a
traditional academic discipline. A minimum grade of C is required for course credit toward the
major or minor. Note: Consult individual department listings for schedule of particular course

<h2><center> Staking Territory in Cyberspace</h2>
</center>
<b><p>

</b>Connecting our residence halls to "JasperNet" reflects our strong commitment to preparing
students for the challenges of Cyberspace.  The College installed a 10Base T Ethernet data
port for each student.  Instead of modems, these are actually direct, high-speed data links to
the campus network.<p>

<p>

When students connect their lap tops or PC's to these ports, they will be able to run such file
server-based applications as Borland C++, MAPLE, Dbase IV, Freelance Graphics, and
various word processors.  They also will be able to retrieve and send E-mail.  (All students
have their own E-mail accounts.)<p>

<p>

The Web gives our alumni an extra opportunity to stay in contact with alma mater.  As of June
17, Manhattan's new Web address is <b>http://www.manhattan.edu</b>.  I invite all of you Jaspers
who are "on-line" to view our Home Page, and its growing abundance of electronically
published information about the faculty and programs, students and alumni of Manhattan
College!<p>

Thomas J. Scanlan, F.S.C.</I></A><P><IMG SRC="b-scanla.jpg"><BR><P>Br. Thomas J. Scanlan, F.S.C., was appointed president of ManhattanCollege in 1987. Prior to his appointment, Br. Scanlan was vicechancellor and chief executive officer of Bethlehem University,Bethlehem, West Bank, a private, independent institution sponsoredby the Vatican and directed by the Institute of the Brothers ofthe Christian Schools.<P>Since Brother's arrival on the Riverdale campus, his energy andvitality have been far-reaching. In addition to an extensive campusrenovation program, he spearheaded the construction of the EastHill Student Residence, the largest housing facility in ManhattanCollege history. The 730-bed, 11-story structure offers studentsthe most up-to-date features in quality living. Br. Scanlan'sguiding hand can be seen in the rejuvenation of the athletic programas well. Increased funding for scholarships and staff have onceagain brought Manhattan's teams to competitive prominence.<P>In 1987, Brother was awarded the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifici Crossfrom Pope John Paul II for service to the Catholic Church in theHoly Land. A 20-year veteran in the field of education, Br. Scanlanwas director of finance and education for the New York Provinceof the Brothers of the Christian Schools from 1978 to 1981, wherehe presided over the Province's 14 educational institutions. Heserved for eight years at Queen of Peace High School, North Arlington,NJ; first as a member of the faculty, then as vice principal,and from 1972 to 1975, as the principal. During the late '70s,Brother was an instructor in organizational behavior for the ManhattanCollege School of Business.<P>A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Br. Scanlan earned a doctorate inorganizational behavior from Columbia University; a Master's degreefrom New York University, and a bachelor's degree from The CatholicUniversity of America. His many professional affiliations includemembership with the Academy of Management, the Association ofCatholic Colleges and Universities, Chief Administrators of CatholicEducation, Christian Brothers Regional Finance Committee and NewYork Coalition for Responsible Investment.<P>Br. Scanlan served on the boards of Caritas Baby Hospital, Bethlehem,Israel; La Salle Academy, New York; and the Public Library ofNorth Arlington, NJ. <P><A NAME="mission_statement"><B>MISSION STATEMENT</B></A><P>Manhattan College, overlooking Van Cortlandt Park in Riverdale,is a private, independent institution of higher learning whichembraces qualified men and women of all faiths, races, and ethnicbackgrounds. Established in 1853, the College is founded uponthe Lasallian Catholic tradition of excellence in teaching, respectfor individual dignity, and commitment to social justice inspiredby the innovator of modern pedagogy, John Baptist de la Salle.<P>The mission of Manhattan College is to provide a contemporary,person-centered educational experience characterized by high academicstandards, reflection on values and principles, and life-longcareer preparation. This is achieved in two ways: by offeringstudents programs which integrate a broad liberal education withconcentration in specific disciplines in the arts and sciences,or with professional preparation in business, education and engineering;and by nurturing a caring, pluralistic campus community.<P>The learning experience at Manhattan College is enriched by cooperativeprograms with other institutions, by postgraduate professionalprograms and by capitalizing on its location on the edge of thecultural center and global marketplace that is New York City.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="almamater"><B>ALMA MATER</B></A><P>Hail to thee, our Alma Mater! Of Thy fame we sing today;<P>And our hearts exult within us, as this tribute we thee pay.<P>For we love thy sacred precincts, thy fair banners bright andgay;<P>And thy name shall live in honor, Old Manhattan ever more.<P>And thy name shall live in honor, Old Manhattan ever more.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="steeple.gif" ALT="College Logo"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><A NAME="jasper"><B>What's A Jasper?</B></A><P>The unique nickname of the Manhattan College athletic teams, theJaspers, comes from one of the College's most memorable figures,Brother Jasper of Mary, F.S.C., who served at the College in thelate 19th century.<P>One of the greatest achievements of Brother Jasper was that hebrought the then little-known sport of baseball to Manhattan Collegeand became the team's first coach. Since Brother was also thePrefect of Discipline, he supervised the student fans at ManhattanCollege Baseball games while also directing the team itself.<P>During one particularly warm and humid day when Manhattan Collegewas playing a semi-pro baseball team called the Metropolitans,Brother Jasper noticed the Manhattan students were becoming restlessand edgy as Manhattan came to bat in the seventh inning of a closegame. To relieve the tension, Brother Jasper called time-out andtold the students to stand up and stretch for a few minutes untilthe game resumed.<P>Since the College annually played the New York Giants in the late1880s and into the 1890s at the Polo Grounds, the Manhattan Collegepractice of the &quot;seventh inning stretch&quot; spread intothe major leagues, where it has now become a time-honored custompracticed by millions of fans annually. <BR><BR><BR><BR><I>Brother Jasper of Mary, F.S.C.<BR><IMG SRC="b-jaspen.jpg"></I><P><A NAME="tradition"><B>TRADITION<BR></B></A><P><A NAME="manhattan_college_history"><B>Manhattan College History</B></A><P>Manhattan College was founded 141 years ago by the Brothers ofthe Christian Schools. The first Brothers to arrive in the UnitedStates came from France in 1848. These young Frenchmen, four inall, established St. Vincent's Academy on Canal Street in NewYork City and later moved to Manhattanville, a tiny hamlet locatedin the hen rural upper section of Manhattan Island. Occupyinga plot of ground east of Broadway and north of 131st Street, thenew school opened on May 5,1853, and was renamed the Academy ofthe Holy Infancy. In 1861, it became known as Manhattan Academy.By the time the Academy was chartered as Manhattan College in1863, a total of 45 students was enrolled and pursuing courses.<P>The need for a more serene atmosphere in the face of a growingNew York City populace motivated the Brothers to relocate theCollege's campus to its present site in the Riverdale sectionof the Bronx. This move was completed in 1923.<P>Today, Manhattan College has grown to include the diversity offive undergraduate schools: Arts, Sciences, Business, Engineering,and Education and Human Services, as well as a Graduate Division.Full-time undergraduate enrollment is approximately 3,000 studentsin 42 major fields of study. Including graduate and evening sessionstudents, Manhattan College's total enrollment is some 3,500.<P>The College's 47 acres include: the main campus, located on ManhattanCollege Parkway; the engineering campus, located at West 240thand Corlear Avenue; and the West Hill campus, located in the Fieldstonsection of Riverdale.<P><A NAME="quad"><B>The Quadrangle</B></A><P>If there is one place on the campus that can be considered thehome of Jasper tradition, it has to be that small patch of grass,trees and slate known as the Quadrangle. Although often overlookedtoday, it is here that revered customs inspired generations ofstudents.<P>The Senior Walk, the path that splits the Quad, runs from MemorialHall to the steps of the Chapel. Seniors always had the specialright of reserving this walkway for their own use and underclassmenhonored this privilege, patiently waiting for their turn to thisslight eminence.<P>In April, the Quadrangle is the scene of Manhattan's Moving-UpDay ceremonies. On this day, all the classes move up a notch.The ceremonies also include the introduction of the new StudentGovernment officers, the handing over of the deed to Senior Walkto the Senior Class president, and the tapping of new membersof the Pen and Sword Honor Society. All the ceremonies conductedon this day hold a high place in Manhattan tradition.<P><A NAME="student_life_mission_statement"><B>Student Life MissionStatement</B></A><P>The Student Life Division aims to recruit, retain, and throughservice oriented staff and programs, promote adjustment and enhancethe total personal-educational experience of a qualified and pluralisticstudent body.<P>Reflective of the Lasallian tradition of education of the wholeperson, Student Life personnel provide programs, advisement andservices for the educational, financial, emotional, occupational,athletic, physical, social and religious needs of the community.<P>Our mission includes the provision of a caring and safe campusenvironment and an enriched commuter and residential living andlearning experience. Student Life programs reflect the College'scommitment to social justice, moral values and leadership anddevelopment opportunities through moderated student clubs andorganizations. Direction and assistance is provided through disciplinedguidance, and policies and procedure, that engender respect bothfor individual dignity and the rights of others in promoting studentdevelopment. The mission also includes a commitment to serve andto help students develop quality, value based relationships withtheir peers and families as well as with the entire ManhattanCollege community.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="campus_resources"><B>CAMPUS RESOURCES, OFFICES, AND SERVICES<BR><BR></B></A><P><A NAME="advisory_system"><B>Advisory System </B></A><P>Each of the Schools of the College administers a basic programof formal advising to meet students' needs for personalized counselingfrom the time of admission to graduation.

The advisor also makes referralsto the appropriate sources for problems other than academic. <P>Students are urged to meet frequently with their advisors especiallyduring their freshman year. The advisors set appointments or setaside certain hours each week when they are available to see theiradvisees and usually post the hours they are available for consultationin their offices.

The SecurityOffice is also responsible for the &quot;Lost and Found&quot;and parking.<BR><P><B>THE SECURITY EMERGENCY NUMBER IS 7333.<BR></B><P>Since residence halls serve as private residences for a numberof students, security is an important concern. The College maintainsa security force of over thirty members with twenty-four hourcoverage at the Main Campus, the West Hill campus, and Overlook.You are encouraged to observe the following common sense guidelines:<P>(1)Do not prop open fire doors or any door which is a locked entrance.<P>(2)Lock your room door and always carry your key (or your combinationin your head). If a room overlooks a roof, balcony, sidewalk,or ledge, or is otherwise easily accessible, the windows shouldalways be locked before leaving the room.<P>(3)Do not loan keys and do not give out your room combination.Report lost or misplaced keys immediately.<P>(4)Carry your College ID card at all times and please produceit for security officers and Residence Life staff upon request.These requests may seem a nuisance, but your safety is their reasonfor asking.<P>(5)Report strangers or suspicious behavior of persons unfamiliarto you in the building. The College authorizes no one to canvassor peddle in the residence halls. If you suspect such activity,contact a staff member immediately or call Campus Security atExt. 7333.<P>(6)Report incidence of vandalism, theft, or property destructionto the Residence Life Staff immediately. <BR><P>While every effort is made to safeguard the contents of the residents'rooms, the College is not responsible for theft or other lossfrom rooms. We advise you to keep a list of serial numbers ofstereos, etc. In addition, residents should check their familyinsurance policy to determine if stolen property is covered.<P>Personal Safety Tips -Riverdale is not a high crime area, butit is always smart to take precautions.<P>(1)Use public walkways - walk on well lit paths. Avoid short cutsand dark or isolated spots.<P>(2)When walking between the main campus and the West Hill campus,use Waldo Avenue which is patrolled by Fieldston's private securityagency.<P>(3)Don't walk alone - get a friend to walk with you especiallyat night.<P>(4)Look alert - watch for suspicious people. Report any loiterersto Security to protect others.<BR><P>Campus Watch<P>Campus Watch is a student volunteer group which provides the campuswith late night patrols and an escort service. Campus Watch isan integral part of the overall safety program.<BR><P>Parking<P>Any person associated with Manhattan College who parks a motorvehicle on campus grounds must register that vehicle at the CollegeSecurity office, De La Salle Hall, room 105 and obtain a parkingpermit and brochure listing facilities and regulations.<P>There is no student parking on the main campus. Any temporaryexception to the above must be made BEFOREHAND with the Securityoffice. Any unauthorized student vehicle parked in restrictedareas on College property will be ticketed by Campus Securityand its owner will be subject to the assigned penalty.<P>In an emergency situation, e.g., blocked fire lanes, deliverylanes or parking in a restricted area, the College reserves theright to have the vehicle towed away at the owner's expense.<P>A limited number of bike racks are provided in the lower forecourtfor members of the College community.

It provides an opportunity for students to developleadership and responsibility. It serves as a link between theadministration, faculty and students, fostering mutual cooperationand understanding. Members are responsible for the developmentof a varied calendar of events for the College. They also allocateand oversee money for extracurricular activities of the generalstudent body and student organizations under Student Governmentjurisdiction.<P>Any student or group of students shall have the right to a hearingbefore the Student Government executive, legislative, or judicialbranches on any question over which the Student Government hasjurisdiction.<P>On an organizational level Student Government is divided intothree branches: executive, legislative and judicial.<P>Executive Branch<P>Known as the Executive Committee, it is composed of the president,the executive vice president, the administrative vice president,the corresponding secretary, the recording secretary and the treasurer.Its purposes, as defined by the Constitution, are to superviseand coordinate all executive commissions and to take appropriateaction to maintain effective student government. In addition,the Executive Committee is charged with proposing, initiatingand undertaking programs in the student interest with the assistanceand majority approval of the Legislature.<P>Legislative Branch<P>Composed of popularly elected officials including the presidentsof the four class organizations, the Legislature meets at leastevery other week. As the largest body of student representativeson campus, it has the primary responsibility of reflecting studentthought. Each of the five divisions of the College (Arts, Sciences,Business, Engineering, and Education and Human Services) is representedin its membership. Chaired by its speaker, the Legislature legislateson all matters of student concern and amends and gives approvalto all bills including the budget allocations of student organizations,the social calendar and all projects of the Executive commissionsand Committee. The Legislature has three standing committees:Elections, Activities and Rules.<P>Judicial Branch<P>The judicial function of the Student Government is administeredby the Student Court which consists of a chief justice and a maximumof six associate justices. Appointed by the Executive Committeewith the approval of 2/3 of the Legislature, the Court hears andadjudicates all infractions of Student Government regulationsand all those applicable provisions of the Student Handbook.<P><A NAME="cocurriculare"><B>Cocurricular Organizations</B></A><P>One of the more meaningful facets of college life is the co-curricularprogram. It serves as an important supplement to the prescribedcurriculum and in doing so enriches the student's learning andexperience.<P>The co-curricular program extends the formal classroom situationto an informal activity through which the student is exposed toothers who share his or her interests and career goals. In additionthe student has the opportunity to satisfy individual tastes andacademic curiosity.<P>These organizations are funded by their sponsoring departments.The advisor is listed next to the organization.<P>American Chemical Society...........................................Dr. Suzanne Rudnick<P>American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics................Dr. Joseph Augustus<P>American Institute of Biological Sciences...........................Dr. Lance Evans<P>American Institute of Chemical Engineers...........................Dr. Joseph Reynolds<P>American Institute of Plant Engineers................................Dr. P.J.

When a final date is approved, the Directorof Student Activities will sign the form and return a copy tothe organization officer. <P>The deadline for reserving rooms with the Director of StudentActivities is five school days prior to the event. However, toensure that a suitable date is granted, most groups reserve dateswith the Director of Student Activities before the start of thesemester during which the activity is to take place. <P>If food or beverages will be served, Food Service must be contactedpromptly after the room has been reserved. Failure to do so willresult in cancellation of the event. <P>At the time of reserving a room, sufficient funds must be availablein the sponsoring organization's College account to cover allcosts related to an event.

In the case of those studentorganizations that are funded by Student Government, the signatureof the Treasurer of Student Government and the Director of StudentActivities must be obtained before the Controller's Office willhonor the disbursement of funds. <P>The Controller, the Director of Student Activities, and the StudentGovernment Treasurer are authorized to require an audit of anorganization's account at any time. <BR><P><A NAME="purchases"><B>Purchases</B></A><P>A requisition for any and all items or services must be made outand signed by the organization's Treasurer, the Student GovernmentTreasurer and the Director of Student Activities and then submittedto the business office. The Business Manager sends the requisitionto the Controller's Office. The Controller checks the organization'saccount and, if the budget allows, he approves the requisition.It is returned to the Business Office for a purchase order tobe sent to the vendor. It is at this point that the College assumesfinancial responsibility for the item. Anyone who procures ororders any material or service directly from a vendor is personallyresponsible for the cost.<P><A NAME="petty_cash"><B>Petty Cash</B></A><P>Petty Cash vouchers should be used only when absolutely necessary.The reimbursement of these expenditures will be made when pettycash vouchers are submitted with the signature of the organization'sTreasurer and, if funded by Student Government, the signaturesof the Student Government Treasurer and the Director of StudentActivities. <P>The voucher must be accompanied by receipted bills.

No cash disbursements in excessof $25 will be made.<P><A NAME="contracts"><B>Contracts</B></A><P>Contracts entered into by an individual student or by any studentorganization that are not also signed by the Director of StudentActivities are not contracts with Manhattan College. The contractingparties are, therefore, personally responsible in such cases,and the College will not in any way enter into the contractualliability. No organization is legally entitled to commit itselffor more money than it has in its account. Verbal agreements maybe considered legal; therefore Student Organizations should meetwith the Director of Student Activities before contracting withany party.<BR><P><A NAME="membership_lists"><B>Membership Lists</B></A><P>Each organization is responsible for furnishing a list of officersand the names of all members of the club or fraternity to theoffice of the Director of Student Activities.<P><A NAME="recognition_of_new_clubs"><B>Recognition of New Clubs</B></A><P>Students interested in forming a new club on campus should followthese procedures:<P>1. Student organizers must first meet with the Director of StudentActivities or her designee to discuss goals and objectives ofthe new group.<BR><P>2. A constitution must be written stating the purpose and othermatters of the organization. Examples of constitutions are availablein the Director of Student Activities Office.<BR><P>3. The signatures of at least 15 full time undergraduate studentsof the College must be obtained. These students must be in goodacademic and disciplinary standing. These student must be enrolledin an academic program on the campus where the organization isbased. All students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average,but no student may be on academic and/or disciplinary probationregardless of the cumulative grade point average. These studentsmust be willing to join the proposed organization if it is approved.<P>4. The proposed constitution, 15 signatures, and a letter froma faculty member or administrator who is willing to serve as thegroup's advisor is then presented to both the Director of StudentActivities or her designee and the Speaker of the Student GovernmentLegislature. The proposed constitution is then reviewed by theActivities Committee of the Legislature, and a recommendationis made as to the advisability of having such a club on campus.<BR><P>5. If approved by the Legislature, the club is given an orientationperiod which will last for fifteen (15) school weeks beginningwith the date of Legislature approval. Summer and winter intercessionswill not count towards the orientation period. The advisor isofficially appointed by the Director of Student Activities atthis time.<BR><P>6. After approval, the organization's final constitution and clubroster must be provided to the Director of Student Activities,the advisor, and the Speaker of the Legislature. During the orientationperiod, the new organization's leadership must meet with the Directorof Student Activities, their Faculty Advisor, Student GovernmentTreasurer, and the Activities Committee. Organizations are noteligible for Student Government funding during the orientationperiod, but they may fund-raise.<BR><P>7. After an organization is approved, all members must remainin good academic and disciplinary standing in order to maintainactive status. A student who has been placed on academic and/ordisciplinary probation or suspension, regardless of the gradepoint average, may not participate in any activities or hold office.People who are not enrolled as students may not participate inactivities unless they are open to the public. <BR><P>8. If club members comply with the regulations and proceduresdescribed above, the club automatically becomes officially recognizedat the end of the orientation period. All organizations and theirmembers must follow all Student Government and College policiesand procedures to remain in good standing.<P>Students interested in forming a new fraternity or sorority mustfollow all the procedures outlined above and, in addition, theymust submit their proposed constitution to the Chair of the Inter-GreekCouncil. This Chair may make a recommendation to the Student GovernmentLegislature regarding approval of the new Greek organization.After a new Greek organization is approved, the fraternity orsorority must follow all policies of the Interfraternity Council,Student Government, and the College to remain in good standing.<BR><P>The College encourages students to participate in a wide varietyof student organizations. Involvement in student groups and clubsbenefits both the individual and the College. Official recognitionis granted to those organizations whose purposes, goals, activities,and programs are consistent with the educational mission of theCollege. The College reserves the right to deny official recognitionwhen in its judgment a student organization's purposes, goals,activities, and programs are in opposition to the mission of theCollege. If in the course of legitimate activities of a recognizedorganization conflict with the mission of the College arises,care must be taken to ensure that any action be competent andrespectful. Recognition of a student organization does not initself imply that the College endorses the views or actions ofthe organization as a group or of its individual members.<P><A NAME="activity_advisors"><B>Activity Advisors</B></A><P>Advisors are faculty and/or administrative staff members appointedto student groups by the Director of Student Activities. A studentgroup may request that a specific person be appointed as advisorof the group if a new advisor is required.<P>The advisor is expected to see that the organization functionsprudently; however, veto power is not exercised. This power isvested in the Director of Student Activities ordinarily and inthe Vice President for Student Life extraordinarily. Studentsshould realize that the advisor has the right to be consulted,to advise and to warn in all matters concerning the organization'sactivities. Students are expected to conduct the business of theorganization in such a way as to promote mutual respect betweenthe advisor and themselves. The advisor, or duly appointed representative,is expected to be present at any event sponsored by the organization.The advisor should discuss with the Director of Student Activitiesany action proposed by the group that would in the advisor's opinionadversely affect the organization or Manhattan College.<BR><P><A NAME="residence_life"><B>RESIDENCE LIFE<BR></B></A><P><A NAME="office_of"><B>Office of Residence Life</B></A><P>The Office of Residence Life is located in Jasper Hall, Room 222.The Residence Office can be accessed through the North stairsof Jasper Hall during College business hours.

The Area Coordinator directly supervises allResidence Hall staffs and reports directly to the Director ofResidence Life. Area Coordinators are available 24 hours a dayto handle any resident student emergencies and are available duringdaily office hours for any other resident concerns. Area Coordinatoroffices are located in East Hill and Overlook Halls.<P><A NAME="resident_directors"><B>Resident Directors</B></A><P>The Resident Director (RD) of your building or area is the personresponsible for the residence life program in your area.

Please check times with yourResident Assistant.<P><A NAME="resident_assistants"><B>Resident Assistants</B></A><P>Resident Assistants (RAs) are probably the most visible membersof our staff. Since your RA is a student living on your flooror in your area, she/he is attuned to your particular needs. TheRAs are concerned with two main areas of responsibility: first,they are paraprofessionals working at promoting an atmosphereconducive to academic achievement, social growth, and the developmentof personal and group responsibilities; second, they assist residentspersonally or through appropriate referrals with academic, personal,and social problems which confront typical college students.<P>Resident Assistants (RAs) are undergraduate members of the ResidenceLife Staff who have successfully completed an extensive selectionprocess and training program. An RA lives on each floor/sectionof the residence halls and is available to offer peer assistanceand direction to residents when needed. RAs also serve as resourcepersons within the halls, answering questions about the campus,explaining and enforcing college policies, sponsoring floor and/orhall programs and activities, and promoting a sense of communityon the floor and in the building.<P><A NAME="rsa"><B>Resident Student Association (RSA)</B></A><P>All resident students are members of the RSA.

First and foremost,the residence halls are communities of learning. This means thatthe policies, guidelines and resources dedicated to our college-administeredhousing are coordinated to help meet the personal needs of studentsin their quest for academic advancement. We take it as our taskto ensure each students' right to study and live freely, to guaranteean open environment where the exchange of ideas happens easilyand spontaneously, to be an active and powerful force in the developmentof student leaders within the residence hall sphere of influence,and to secure a living/learning environment especially one whichis focused on the formation of a community of individuals.<P><B>Student Programming in Residence Life</B><P>The concept of programming in Resident Life departments is usuallyakin to the kind of programming done by television executives.It means an encompassing, programmatic approach to meeting themultiple (recreational) needs of students while satisfying ourmission to educate and develop each student.<P>Programming then, is the systematic approach to on-campus andin-hall events and activities. These events and activities canrange anywhere from outdoor, Spring Barbecues to athletic competitions,from lectures by visiting professors to presentations on studyskill improvement or resume writing. On a departmental level thereare also a number of specific programs implemented which meetdevelopmental needs of residents while allowing them a close-upview of the administration of their living/learning environment.<P>1.

On requestpush-button door combinations will be changed for a $25.00 fee.<P>Students who fail to return their keys at check-out will be assessedthe cost of replacing the lock (usually $50.00) plus $5 per key.Lost front door keys or key cards are assessed at $25. Keys mustbe returned at check-out even if you are returning to the sameroom in the following year.<P>Unauthorized use of room keys or door combinations is prohibitedand will result in disciplinary action.<P><B>Room Repairs</B><P>When routine repair work is needed in your room, tell your RAso that he/she can file a work request. If the problem is an emergency,call the Office of Residence Life, Ext. 7438, or Physical PlantExt. 7480 during business hours or Security (Ext. 7333) othertimes.<P><A NAME="rules_regs"><B>RULES AND REGULATIONS<BR></B></A><P>The Residence Halls are provided as a service primarily intendedto support and foster the educational experience. It is our intentionas well to provide a positive community atmosphere which willenhance personal and social growth. You are expected to conductyourself in a mature manner with respect for the privacy and rightsof roommates and neighbors. Failure to observe the rules and regulationsstipulated may result in disciplinary action including cancellationof room assignment.<P><B>Absences</B><P>A resident who expects to be absent from the halls for four consecutivedays or more while school is in session is urged to inform his/herRA, giving him/her information where he/she could be reached inan emergency. As a precautionary measure, inquiry is made intoall unreported absences.<P><B>Advertising</B><P>Residents may not use their rooms via the college telephone, themail system, the college computer systems, or other means forany commercial advertising endeavor or response, other than foran approved campus activity.<P>Authorization for canvassing will be given only to Manhattan Collegeorganizations and to Manhattan College students. The canvass mustbe for an activity which is of interest to a large number of residents.Requests for permission to canvass must be submitted to the Directorof Student Activities Office at least two days in advance. Authorizedcanvassing will carry written authorization from the Directorof Student Activities Office, and this will be shown to anyonewho questions them as a matter of security. Any others whetherstudents or not who are unauthorized, will be reported for yourprotection to the RA or to the Security Office (Ext. 7240 or 7333.)<BR><P><B>Cooking</B><P>Cooking is permitted only in those units and/or halls equippedwith kitchens. Cooking in any other residence hall room is strictlyforbidden. Hot plates, toaster ovens, electric skillets, etc.,will be confiscated.<P><B>Credit Hours</B><P>To remain in residence, you must be registered for at least 12credit hours or be involved in a College approved Co-op position.Exceptions are made for students on 12 month housing contracts.Students planning Co-op positions should confirm their residencyarrangements by asking the College Co-op Advisor to inform theOffice of Residence Life of their situation. Students on Co-opleaves are guaranteed housing when they return but they are notguaranteed specific spaces. Requests are honored whenever possible.<BR><P><B>Damages</B><P>The terms of the residency contract clearly state the responsibilitiesof the student for keeping the room or apartment in good order,free from damage, and locked.<P>The cost of repair or replacement of damaged furnishings or residencehall property in a student's room will be charged to the responsibleoccupant or occupants if they can be identified; otherwise allthe residents of the room will be assessed the damage.<P>When damages occur on a particular floor or hall in a public area,the persons responsible will be assessed if they can be identified;otherwise all of the floor or hall residents will be assessed.<P>Damages to public lobby areas will be assessed to the personsresponsible if they are identified; otherwise the repairs willbe charged to the smallest possible group that can be fairly identified.<P><B>Fire Safety</B><P>Fire safety equipment such as smoke detectors, fire extinguishers,fire alarm pull boxes, and emergency exit routing signs have beeninstalled in each residence hall. These items are there to helpsave your life if a fire ever occurs. Hopefully, such a situationwill not happen, but if it does, your life, plus up to hundredsof other lives, could depend on one or more of these devices.Therefore, it is VITAL that these items be in working order atall times.<P>College policy and state law require each residence hall to havethree fire drills each semester. It is a violation of City lawand College policy to stay in the building during a fire drill.Any time the alarm sounds, PLEASE leave your room immediately,closing the door behind you, and follow your specified evacuationroute. DO NOT USE the elevators.<P>Any individual found responsible for issuing a false alarm, ordamaging safety equipment, will be prosecuted by the College judicialprocesses. Penalties including loss of residence, suspension fromthe College, or legal action, may be imposed.<BR><P>The campus Fire Marshal recommends:<P>1.Keep the key to your room on a bedside table.<P>2. Please count how many doors to the firestairs (exit).<P>3. Feel the door and door knob if it is hot, do not open the door.If there is smoke, crawl on your hands and knees to the firestairs(exit). NEVER use the elevator.<P>4. Take your key with you. You may want to get back into yourroom where it is safer.<P>5. Close all doors behind you. Smoke in stairwells is caused byleaving doors open. <P>6. If you are forced to stay in your room, do the following:<UL><LI>a) Open the window for fresh air.<LI>b) Do not break the window.<LI>c) If there is smoke outside, you will need to close the window.<BR></UL><P>Hazards that should be avoided are: <BR><P>1. Smoking in bed.<P>2. Faulty electrical equipment. <P>3. Disposal of cigarettes in waste baskets. <P>4. Throwing objects out of windows. This includes the throwingof lighted cigarettes, cigars or matches as this can easily beblown into a room on a lower floor thereby causing a fire.<P>5. Cooking in rooms is not permitted. <P>6. Electric blankets and space heaters are not permitted.<BR><P>If you have any questions, please call the Physical Plant.<BR><P><B>THE USE OF CANDLES, OIL LAMPS OR OPEN FLAMES OR THE BURNINGOF INCENSE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED IN THE RESIDENCE HALLS.</B><P><A NAME="guest_visitor_policy"><B>GUEST AND VISITOR POLICY</B></A><P>(A guest is defined as anyone who does not reside in the building)<P>The residence hall policy and procedures related to guests andvisitors exist to allow residents to have guests in a manner thatdoes not infringe upon the comfort or rights of other residentsand maintains an appropriate level of safety and security in theresidence halls. The following is the Manhattan College guest/visitorpolicy:<P>1. Regardless of the length of his/her stay, the guest is expectedto abide by all College policies.<P>2. The host is responsible for the actions of his/her guest atall times.<P>3. Residence Life Staff may have a guest removed immediately shouldhe/she fail to abide by College policies.<P>4. Roommates are required to check with one another to confirmthat guests/visitors are not an inconvenience to their livingenvironment at any time.<P>5.

Visitation is limited to 2 guests before 8:00 P.M. during Intersessionand other vacation periods.<P>7. Security and Residence Life Personnel, at their discretion,may deny access to enter a hall to any guest. <BR><P>Overnight Guests in all Residence Halls:<P>Overnight guests/visitors of the opposite sex are not permitted.Visitors of the opposite sex who need to stay overnight shouldhave arrangements made in advance by their host to stay in otherresidence hall accommodations with members of the same sex. Arrangementsare made by completing the &quot;Late Night Early Morning VisitationForm&quot; as described under the Late Night Guest Policy.<BR><P>1. The host must make arrangements in advance with their ResidentDirectors to have their overnight guests registered.<P>2. It is the responsibility of the host to meet his/her guestin the lobby and remain with them at all times during their stay.<P>Overlook and East Hill Procedures for Visitation 8 a.m.-8 p.m.<BR><P>1. Any current Manhattan college student (resident or commuter)may enter the halls by showing their I.D. to Security. If thestudent remains in the building after 8 P.M., he/she must comedown to Security with their host and sign in properly.<P>2. Visitors who do not possess a current Manhattan College I.D.must adhere to the after 8 P.M. policy.<P>Policy for Guests Arriving after 8 p.m.until 11:30 p.m.<BR><P>1. It is the responsibility of the host to meet his/her guestin the lobby and remain with their guest at all times.<P>2. All guests must have the Security Officer register them bysigning the guest registration book at the Security station. Everyguest must leave a valid form of current picture identification(i.e., drivers license, student I.D.).<P>3.

All other visitors regardless of their proposed length of staymust be registered in advance and be in possession of the &quot;LateNight Early Morning Visitation Form.&quot; This form is availableduring regular business hours only and may be obtained from yourResident Director, Area Coordinator or the Office of ResidentLife, Rm 222 Jasper Hall.<P>3. All other after 8 p.m. visitation rules apply.<BR><P><B>Roommate Courtesy</B><P>As members of the Manhattan College community, resident studentsare expected to respect the rights and privacy of their roommates.The needs and rights of all roommates take priority over the rightsof one member of a room or suite to have a visitor in their roomfor any period of time.<P><B>Roommate/Suitemate Agreement:</B><P>Residents should bring to the attention of their roommates situationswhich they feel uncomfortable with including guests, visitorsor any other aspects of sharing a living environment. It is highlyrecommended that residents take the time to complete the Roommate/SuitemateAgreement exercise in this handbook. This exercise will help youto better understand your own needs and the needs of the peopleyou are living with. Residents are expected to adhere to requestsfrom their roommates regarding their concerns on privacy and theuse of their rooms or apartments. Residence Hall staff membersare committed to assisting and enforcing policies related to roommatecourtesy.<P>Any resident student who has difficulties resolving conflictsrelating to the issues of roommate courtesy should contact theirResident Assistant for support in bringing everyone together fora discussion regarding the resolution. Repeated problems shouldbe reported to your Resident Director for follow up. Repeat offenderswill be referred to the College judicial system for sanctioning.<P>The roommate/suitemate agreement is meant to be used as an aidto Manhattan College resident students for clarification and developmentof issues facing people sharing a residence hall space. A ResidentAssistant can facilitate this agreement or roommates /suite-matesmay choose to determine the issues on their own initially.<P>Sharing a room or suite with at least one other person can beone of the major challenges of college life. &quot;Rooming&quot;with other people can be very rewarding, and often college roommatesbecome lifetime friends. However, just as with any other relationship,there must be a high level of trust and clear expectations. Thisform is offered as a guide to help roommates/suitemates establishtheir own needs and the needs of others. It is also recommendedfor returning students who may want to reevaluate their time schedulesor alter previous patterns.<P>Select a mutually convenient time for all involved and agree tocomplete the guide as thoroughly and honestly as possible. Finishthe process as early in the semester as possible. There are noright or wrong answers - only individual preferences.<BR><P>1. Whose and what furniture, wall hangings, plants etc. will bein the room.<P>2. Will the room / suite be divided? (my corner, shelf, your side,closet?)<P>3. How will cleaning tasks be completed? (Take turns or each personis responsible for their own areas.)<P>4. Will we have a phone? If so, whose name will it be in? Howwill costs be shared? Does anyone have special needs or requestsabout message-taking etc.?<P>5. Time schedule? What times are reserved for sleep? study time?relaxation? What times do people wake up and when do people haveclasses? Any special needs or preferences?<P>6. Will we have a refrigerator? If so, who takes responsibilityand how are the payments split?<P>7. What will be the room/suite policy regarding cigarette smoking?For roommates/guests?<P>8. Based on the College guest policy, how will guests be handled?Do roommates request advance notice? If overnight guests are expected,what special arrangements will be made and when?<P>9. Based on the College Alcohol Policy, when and by whom willalcohol be used in the room/suite?<P>10. What articles can roommates feel free to borrow or use, ifany? Stereo, tapes, laundry detergent, food, etc.? What articlesare strictly off-limits?<P>11. Are there any special topics which need to be addressed? Howshould &quot;violations&quot; of these agreements be addressed?<BR><P><B>Quiet Hours</B><P>To maintain an atmosphere conducive to academic achievement thefollowing quiet hours have been established. Sunday through Thursdaystarting at 11pm. Friday and Saturday at 1am. Quiet hours aredefined as not being able to hear any sounds outside of a particularsuite/room.<P>In all halls it is essential that noise be kept to a reasonablelevel so that residents can exercise their rights to study andsleep without disturbance. TV's, radios, and stereos should bekept low enough so that they will not disturb others. This isespecially important on the Main Campus so as not to disturb dayand evening classes.<P>The College fully recognizes the student need for recreationaloutlets, and is cognizant of the role TV's and stereos play inleisure time activities. In line with this awareness, the Collegepermits you to import these things for your use. Those residentstudents, however, who operate these devices in an abusive orirresponsible manner place themselves in jeopardy of forfeitingthe continuance of the permission granted.<P>Residents of Overlook Manor are asked to show consideration forour neighbors. Stereos, musical instruments, etc., are never tobe played on the balconies or fire escapes. You are asked to beaware of, and observe, the City noise ordinances which prohibitnoise of such volume that it interferes with the rights of others,particularly at night. <B>When returning to the residence hallsin the evening, particularly with a group of friends please rememberthat voices carry and disturb others. Please make every effortto avoid yelling and maintain a quiet approach.</B><P><B>Pets</B><P>With the exception of fish in aquariums of 20 gallons or less,no animals are permitted in the residence halls.<P><B>Smoking</B><P>City and state law prohibit smoking in all common areas of theresidence halls.<P><B>Residence Life Office Staff</B><P>Joseph Pirrello, Director of Residence Life &amp; Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs<P>862-7438<P>Gail Dray, Assistant Director for Operations <P>862-7196<P>Eleanor McGrath, Secretary <P>862-7438<P>Chris Taylor, Area Coordinator, East Hill <P>862-7343<P>Karin McClelland, Area Coordinator, Overlook <P>862-7251<BR><P><B>Housekeeping Supervisors</B><P><B>East Hill Residence</B><P>Susan McCarthy <P>862-7801<P><B>Main Campus</B><P>Betty Fallon <P>862-7136<P><B>Overlook Manor</B><P>Pat Hunt <P>862-7107<BR><P><B>College Extensions in The Residence Halls</B><P><B>Chrysostom Hall</B><P>1st Floor <P>862-7592 <P>2nd Floor <P>862-7537 <P>3rd Floor <P>862-7539 <P>4th Floor <P>862-7598<BR><P><B>Jasper Hall</B> <P>1st Floor <P>862-7527<P>2nd Floor <P>862-7531<P>3rd Floor <P>862-7595<P>3rd Floor Wing <P>862-7591<P>4th Floor <P>862-7508<P>4th Floor Wing <P>862-7532<P>5th Floor <P>862-7526<P>5th Floor Wing <P>862-7525<P>6th Floor <P>862-7544<BR><P><B>Pay Phones in the Residence Halls</B><P>Chrysostom Hall <P>Lobby <P>549-9814 <P>549-9676<BR><P>Jasper Hall<P>Lobby<P>548-9515 548-9659<P>549-9758<BR><P><A NAME="calendar_dates"><B>IMPORTANT CALENDAR DATES</B></A><P>1996 - 97 Academic Year<BR><P>August 24<P>First Year Students and Transfer Students Move In<P>Barbecue for dinner meal<P>August 25 <P>Upper classmen Move In/ First Meal Dinner<P>August 26 <P>Classes Begin<P>September 2 <P>Labor Day Holiday - No Classes<P>October 14 <P>Columbus Day Holiday - No Classes<P>October 15 <P>Monday Class Schedule<P>November 28-29 <P>Thanksgiving Holiday - No Classes<P>December 14 <P>Residence Halls close until Jan 21<P>January 21 <P>Residence Halls Open<P>February 2 <P>MC Winter Commencement<P>March 24-31 <P>Spring Break/Easter - No Classes<P>May 6 <P>Last Class<P>May 8-14 <P>Exams<P>May 18 <P>Graduation<BR><P><B>IMPORTANT CALENDAR DATES</B><P>1997 - 98 Academic Year<BR><P>August 23 <P>First Year Students and Transfer Students Move In<P>Barbecue for dinner meal<P>August 24 <P>Upper Classmen Move In/ First Meal Dinner<P>August 25 <P>Classes Begin<P>September 1 <P>Labor Day<P>October 13 <P>Columbus Day <P>October 14 <P>Monday Class Schedule<P>November 27-28 <P>Thanksgiving Holiday<P>December 5 <P>Last Class<P>December 8-13 <P>Exam Week<P>December 15 <P>Break Begins<P>January 20 <P>Classes begin<P>March 16-20 <P>Spring Break<P>April 10-13 <P>Easter Break<P>April 14 <P>Monday Schedule<P>May 5 <P>Last Class<P>May 7-13 <P>Exams<P>May 17 <P>Graduation<BR><P><A NAME="college_policies_and_procedures"><B>COLLEGE POLICIESAND PROCEDURES<BR></B></A><P><A NAME="academic_policies"><B>Academic Policies and Procedures</B></A><P>Students should be aware that official statements of academicpolicies and procedures are published in the Manhattan CollegeCatalog. They are summarized here for the convenience of students.Students are expected to be familiar with these statements.<BR><P><A NAME="attending_classes"><B>Attending Classes</B></A><P>Students are required to attend all classes for which they areregistered. Students are responsible for any absence from classes.Students are responsible for fulfilling all course requirementsand completing all course requirements; they will likewise beheld responsible for the entire content of the course.<P>When a student has four un-excused absences, the teacher willnotify the Dean of the School in which the student is registered.The student will be invited to an interview to discuss the reasonbehind the absences. The Dean may refer the student to formalcounseling to assess the underlying causes, may advise withdrawalfrom a course, or may issue a letter of warning if a student'sscholastic record is endangered.<P>If a student is absent from a test or quiz, the teacher is notrequired to provide a substitute test or quiz. Students who areabsent from a laboratory cannot expect that any special arrangements(e.g., setting up apparatus, etc.) will be made to enable themto complete the laboratory work that they missed.<P><A NAME="final_examinations"><B>Final Examinations</B></A><P>To protect students as they complete course requirements and preparefor final examinations, there is a policy which states that thereshall be no testing in at least the last week of classes. Eachschool should set the policies on the nature and scope of testingin the final exam week.<P>A student should normally take one final exam on any given day.In exceptional circumstances, he/she may have to take two finalexams in one day. If a student has more than two final examinationsscheduled for the same day, he/she may ask the instructor(s) toarrange an alternative date.<P>Members of the senior class who have been inducted into the College'sacademic honor society, Epsilon Sigma Pi, may be excused froma final examination at the discretion of the course instructor.All course instructors are provided a list of members of EpsilonSigma Pi prior to the final examination period in the fall andspring semesters.<P><A NAME="withdrawing_courses"><B>Withdrawing from Courses</B></A><P>The deadline for withdrawing from a course is two weeks beforethe final day of classes during the fall and spring semesters.Permission to withdraw from a course may be granted only by theDean of the School in which the student is registered. It is thenrecorded on the student's transcript.<P>Students should also be aware that withdrawing from a course afterthe Add/Drop period (consult the official calendar in the ManhattanCollege Catalog) will usually mean that they will have to makeup the credits at some other time with an additional tuition charge.<BR><P><A NAME="course_syllabus_grading_methods"><B>Course Syllabus andGrading Methods</B></A><P>Students should be aware that all course instructors are requiredto provide to them, at the beginning of every course, a syllabusfor the course, including all course requirements and a statementof how the final grade will be determined.<P><A NAME="contesting_final_grade_course"><B>Contesting Final Gradein a Course</B></A><P>If a student believes that his/her final grade in a course isnot consistent with the statement provided at the beginning ofthe course of how the final grade will be determined and withthe grades on tests, quizzes, and other assignments graded duringthe course, he/she should first discuss the matter with the courseinstructor. If the student and the instructor cannot resolve thematter in this discussion, the student may discuss the matterwith the department chairperson. Copies of all graded tests, quizzes,and other assignments will be needed.<P>In the event that the student is not satisfied with the outcomeof the discussions with the course instructor and the chairperson,he/she may make a written request within three weeks after thebeginning of the next regular semester to the chairperson fora formal consideration of the problem. Included in the requestwill be an outline of the student's specific complaints. The chairpersonwill make a detailed investigation and will notify the studentand the course instructor in writing of his/her findings.<P>The student may appeal the findings of the chairperson to theDean of the School in which the course was offered. The Dean willrespond to the student in writing and will preserve the documentationof the process.<P>Students should be aware that only the course instructor may changea grade.<P><A NAME="change_of_address"><B>Change of Address</B></A><P>Students are required to keep the College informed of both permanenthome and local address. All changes of address should be reportedto the respective Dean of the student's school as soon as practicable.<P><A NAME="confidentiality_student_records"><B>Confidentiality ofStudent Records</B></A><P>Manhattan College recognizes the need for a carefully consideredpolicy concerning information that should be part of a student'spermanent record and the conditions of its disclosure. As specificallyindicated in the policy statement that follows, the privacy andconfidentiality of all student records shall be preserved. Sincecertain material is necessary for persons within the College tofunction effectively, and since such material is, therefore, guardedlyreleased from absolute confidentiality, members of the administration,the faculty, the staff of the College and the students are boundto respect confidential records on students to which they haveaccess in the course of their official capacity. This policy statementis intended to include all departments of the College. <P>A survey of the kinds of records kept throughout the College indicatesthat the following groupings of records can be made: <BR><P>1. Official academic records are maintained in the Office of theRegistrar and include the completed forms of registration foreach semester in residence, the records of grades and creditsreceived in courses at the College, or accepted here from anotherinstitution, and other documents directly relating to academicprogress and status at this College.<P>2. Disciplinary records are maintained in the Office of the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs and include information about dispositionof charges of infractions against College codes of conduct anddiscipline.<P>3. Financial records are kept in the Bursar's Office.<P>4. Financial aid records are maintained in the Financial Aid Office.<P>5. Student employment records are maintained in the PlacementCenter and are confined to applications for employment and financialaid and supporting letters of reference, notices of action onsuch applications and evaluations of performance and financialaid history of each student.<P>6. Medical and health records are maintained in the College Infirmary.<P>7. Psychological and counseling records are maintained in theCounseling Center. <P>Students have a right to know the information contained in theirofficial academic, disciplinary or placement records, and accessto any of these records is limited only by reasonable regulationsas to time, place and supervision. When the original is shown,examination should be permitted only under conditions that willprevent its alteration or mutilation. <P>If a student challenges the accuracy of the official academicrecord or if the student believes the content is misleading orotherwise in violation of his/her privacy or other rights, he/sheshall request the Registrar to correct or delete any such inaccurate,misleading or otherwise inappropriate data contained therein.The student shall be afforded a full hearing and fair opportunityto present evidence relevant to the issues and may be assistedor represented by individuals of his/her choice who are membersof the College community. Wherever possible, the Registrar willcorrect the record. If there still remains a difference, the student'swritten objection(s) will be included in the record and made anofficial part thereof. <P>In the case of placement records, letters of recommendation datedafter January 1, 1975, may be seen by the student. <P>No entry may be made on a student's official record, academicor disciplinary, and no document or entry may be placed in thoserecords without notice to the student, with the exception of publishedgrades or announcements of honor. A document or entry suppliedby or at the request of a student may be placed in the student'srecord without additional notice to him or her. <P>Information from official academic records may not be releasedto anyone except with the prior written consent of the student,except as stated below, and subject to the right of the studentto bar disclosure to a particular inquirer or class of inquirers.<P>1. Manhattan College considers all students &quot;dependent&quot;unless they specifically inform the institution that they are&quot;independent.&quot; <P>2. Administrative officers and faculty members may have accessto official academic records for internal educational purposesand for research in which anonymity is guaranteed. <P>3. The following data may be given to any inquirer either in person,by mail or telephone:<BR><UL><LI>dates of registered attendance<LI>nature of degree granted<LI>school or division of enrollment<LI>current status<LI>dates of degrees granted and awards received<LI>date of birth may be confirmed<LI>marital status<LI>religious order may be confirmed<LI>campus box number may be confirmed<LI>home address may be confirmed<LI>telephone number may be confirmed </UL><P>Persons from outside the College shall not be permitted accessto a student's records or greater information than provided hereinunless subpoena or other legal process is served on the College.Following such service, the College shall immediately notify thestudent affected. In addition, the College will comply with suchprocess only upon advice of counsel. To fully protect the confidentialityof student records, counsel for the College will be asked to advisea prudent course. <P>No record shall be kept of the political views of students orof student membership in any organization other than academic,honorary, professional or social organizations. In the case ofpolitical organizations, only the names of officers will be recorded.<P><A NAME="financial_obligaitons"><B>Financial Obligations</B></A><P>Tuition charges are paid once each semester and are indicatedin the current catalogue for each of the programs offered in thevarious Schools or Divisions of the College. Tuition charges coverthe total number of credits prescribed in a particular academicyear (fall and spring semesters) for each full-time program listedin the current catalogue. Credits in excess of the total numberprescribed in the College catalogue incur additional tuition chargesat the rates specified in the catalogue. <P>Supplementary bills for such additional charges are issued duringthe spring semester. It is the responsibility of each studentto ascertain whether he/she has registered for more credits thanare allowed in the catalogue. <P>Transfer students whose programs may require them to take creditsin excess of the number specified by the catalogue are requiredto pay extra charges for credits which are in excess. Studentswho repeat courses that they have failed and thereby take creditsin excess of catalogue provisions will, likewise, be requiredto pay supplementary charges. Students in the advanced coursesof AFROTC are not required to pay for credits earned in thesecourses. <P>Students on full or partial scholarships are required to pay supplementarycharges during the spring semester if they take credits in excessof those prescribed in a particular academic year for the regularfull-time program outlined in the catalogue. <P>Tuition charges for the Summer Session are exclusive of chargesfor the academic year and are made on a per-credit-hour basis.<P>The College may, after due consideration, decide to suspend atany time a student whose fees and charges are in arrears.<P><A NAME="id_cards"><B>I.D. Cards</B></A><P>Each student must carry a student identification card (I.D.),which will be issued by the Office of the Director of Campus Eventswhen the student first enters Manhattan College. If a commuterI.D. card is lost, arrangements for replacement may be made inthe Office of the Director of Campus Events. If a resident cardis lost, arrangements for replacement may be made in the FoodService Office. There is a replacement charge for new I.D.s. <P>The l.D. card must be presented to any member of the administrationor faculty, elected members of Student Government, residence lifestaff member, campus security officer, or food service supervisorwho may request it in the performance of assigned duties. <P><A NAME="liability"><B>Liability</B></A><P>The College is not normally responsible for the loss of personalproperty in any building owned by the College. However, any lossshould be reported promptly to the Security Office, De La SalleHall, room 105.<P><A NAME="publicity_posting_procedures"><B>Publicity and PostingProcedures</B></A><P>The Office of the Director of Student Activities and the StudentGovernment require that posting of materials must conform to thefollowing standards: <BR><P>1.

Continued failure to comply with these regulationswill result in sanctions against the organization to be specifiedby the Student Court. <BR><P><A NAME="sales_solicitation"><B>Sales and Solicitations</B></A><P>There shall be no solicitation by outside agents for the saleof goods or services to students on any portion of the propertyof Manhattan College except: <P>1. Display and sale of goods and services to authorized representativesof the College for College purposes. <P>2. Groups or individuals by invitation of authorized College personnelto present proposals for group consideration. <P><A NAME="school_closing"><B>School Closing</B></A><P>Ordinarily, classes will be conducted during inclement weather.When extreme weather or emergency conditions exist, faculty, students,and staff may call 718-862-7103 to obtain information about thecollege closing.<P>It is College policy to reschedule these days when, and if, anexcessive number of class days must be canceled because of inclementweather.<BR><P><A NAME="search_and_seizure_policy"><B>Search and Seizure Policy</B></A><P>Premises occupied by students shall not be searched (as distinguishedfrom ordinary maintenance activities and Residence Life room inspections)except in cases where College officials have a reasonable basisto believe that there is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct.<P>If a room is searched, permission will normally be obtained throughthe Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or the Vice President forStudent Life. In an emergency situation wherein health and safetyare immediate concerns, Residence Life and/or Security personnelmay search a room. A search may include looking into all itemsin, on, or under which the articles sought may be located.<BR><P><A NAME="smoking"><B>Smoking</B></A><P>In compliance with New York City's Indoor Smoking RestrictionLaw, the College designates certain areas as non-smoking. Someareas are divided into smoking and non-smoking portions. Stillother areas may be either smoking or non-smoking depending onthe preferences of those who live or work there.<P>Designated non-smoking areas include but are not limited to cafeterias,classrooms, hallways, labs, libraries, public meeting rooms, restrooms,computer rooms, elevators, the bookstore, and locker rooms.<P>Individual residence hall rooms are areas which are determinedsmoking/non-smoking by the people who live there.<P>For a complete copy of the smoking policy, contact the Human ResourcesOffice.<BR><P><A NAME="speaker_policy"><B>Speaker policy</B></A><P>It is the College's policy to encourage student organizationsto welcome persons of divergent viewpoints who will, within theframework of the stated aims of the College, enrich the academicexperience of the students. To assure its orderly implementation,a formal policy statement has been drafted. The policy is on filein the Office of the Director of Student Activities.<P><A NAME="summary_joing"><B>Summary of Joint Statement on StudentRights and Freedoms</B></A><P>The College approves and subscribes to the content of the JointStatement on the Rights and Freedoms of Students. The statementis not printed here because of its length. Instead, a summaryof the Statement, drawn up by the United States National StudentsAssociation, follows.<BR><P>1. Students should have protection through orderly proceduresagainst prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. <P>2. Information from disciplinary or counseling files should notbe available to unauthorized persons on campus or to any personoff campus without express consent of the student involved exceptunder legal compulsion or in cases where the safety of personor property is involved. <P>3. No records should be kept which reflect the political activitiesor beliefs of students. <P>4. Students should always be free to support causes by orderlymeans which do not disrupt the regular and essential operationof the institution. <P>5. Students should be allowed to invite and to hear any personof their choosing. <P>6. The student press should be free of censorship and advanceapproval of copy, and its editors and managers should be freeto develop their own editorial policies and news coverage. <P>7. Students who violate the law may incur penalties prescribedby civil authorities, but institutional authority should neverbe used to merely duplicate the function of general laws. Onlywhere the institution's interests as an academic community aredistinct and clearly involved should the special authority ofthe institution be asserted. <P>8. Except under extreme emergency circumstances, premises occupiedby students and the personal possessions of students should notbe searched unless appropriate authorization has been obtained.<P>9. The student should be as free as possible from imposed limitationsthat have no direct relevance to his education. Disciplinary proceedingsshould be instituted only for violations of standards of conductformulated with significant student participation and publishedin advance in an available body of institutional regulations.<P>10. In all situations, procedural fair play requires that thestudent be informed of the nature of the charges against him,that he be given a fair opportunity to refute them, that the institutionnot be arbitrary in its action and that there be provision forappeal of a decision.<BR><P><A NAME="codeofconduct"><B>STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT<BR></B></A><P><B>Academic Integrity</B><P>The Manhattan College Catalog indicates that the College is committedto providing its students opportunities for development in allareas: intellectual, moral, artistic, social, and professional.Promotion of academic integrity should, therefore, be a part ofthe duties of the College community including students, faculty,administration and support staff. Each constituency should beaware of its duties and rights in these areas.<P><B>To the Student</B><P>It is the student's responsibility to pursue academic work ina manner consistent with prescribed policies of the College andrequirements of the individual course. All materials submittedto the College or an instructor in fulfillment of course workmust be the student's own work unless permission has been grantedfor team efforts in larger projects. No material, methods or resultsshall be represented as the student's own work if these were obtainedfrom another source. If materials, methods, or results are obtainedfrom other sources, they shall be so identified.<P>All types of academic fraud and misrepresentation, including improperpassage or receipt of information during examinations, use ofunauthorized sources of information during examinations, dishonestpresentation of laboratory data, willful plagiarism in the presentationof reports or computer programs, unauthorized transmittal or receiptof examination material before an examination and tampering withthe grading process after submittal of course material are subjectto academic penalties.<P>Students are expected to be present for all examinations and toturn in assignments on the date due. If students cannot be presentfor an examination or cannot meet an assignment deadline, theyshould inform the instructor as soon as possible and provide legitimatereasons. These reasons shall be bona fide and of sufficient importthat both the instructor and student can agree that the studentshould not be penalized in the final grade. If requested by theinstructor, the student should be able to corroborate the reasons.Dishonest statements or misrepresentations shall be subject tothe same penalties as other forms of academic dishonesty.<P>Students who are witnesses to the cheating of other students havea moral responsibility to report the incident with specifics ofdate, course and instructor to the instructor or the chairpersonof the department or the dean of the school of which the instructoris a member. The individual to whom the report is made will thenfollow the procedure outlined at the end of this policy statement.<P>Students should consider computer files and electronic mail thesame as United States Postal Service mail. The Computer Centerreserves the right to inspect files or mail messages if thereis reason to believe they may be responsible for problems on thecomputer system.<P><B>To the Instructor</B><P>It is the instructor's responsibility to avoid those practicesthat are conducive to acts of academic dishonesty. Certain typesof examinations, such as multiple choice, true or false, shortanswer quizzes without partial credit and take-home projects,are particularly conducive to academic dishonesty and generallyshall be avoided. If they are used, the instructor must administerthese with special care to limit the temptation for student cheating.Practices such as giving the same examinations or assigning thesame projects year after year should also be avoided if possible.The teacher will take special care to detect and punish instancesof plagiarism. Each department will consult, discuss, and takesuch action to enforce academic integrity as is deemed necessaryand proper to that department. Preparation and duplication ofexamination materials should be handled in a confidential mannerto prevent prior circulation. Support staff involved in the preparationof confidential material should be informed as to its nature andinstructed to keep this material inaccessible to unauthorizedpeople.<P>As described in the <I>Faculty Handbook</I>, the instructor shall,within the first two weeks of the semester, inform each classof requirements regarding submission of reports, procedures ofexaminations and quizzes and the basis for assigning grades. Infairness to the students, instructors should proctor their ownexaminations whenever possible. In accordance with the <I>FacultyHandbook</I>, proctors are expected to perform this task withdiligence and close attention to student behavior. Verbal warningsshall be given if the proctor suspects that some students areengaging in cheating. If the instructor believes that a case ofcheating is clearly identifiable, the instructor shall personallydiscuss the charge with the student as soon as possible. The instructorwill investigate student reports of cheating in that instructor'sclass. <P>The instructor shall abide by the decision in any appeal caseinvolving the grade given to the student accused of academic dishonesty.<P><B>To the Administrator</B><P>It is the Provost's responsibility to disseminate this PolicyStatement on Academic Integrity throughout the Manhattan Collegecommunity and to see to its implementation. <P>The Dean of each school and the chairperson of each departmentwill act appropriately upon any student report of academic dishonesty.Each will, within his/her respective area of supervision, takeleadership in enforcing academic integrity by discussion and appropriateaction. Each Dean will maintain a separate file of reported casesof academic dishonesty; no record of the charge shall be maintainedin the Dean's academic files. <BR><P><B>Procedure for Cases of Academic Dishonesty</B><P>Any member of the College community may report in writing to theAssociate Dean of Judicial Affairs an alleged incident of academicdishonesty as defined in the policy on Academic Integrity. Thestudent(s) involved then becomes subject to an investigation andpossible subsequent disciplinary action. <P>The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs will hold a preliminaryhearing to provide the accused student(s) with the opportunityto discuss the facts and circumstances which led to the report.This hearing and all subsequent hearings will be tape recorded.<P>If the student <B>acknowledges</B> guilt, the case may proceedto a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on Student Affairsto determine the <I>sanction</I>, as outlined in the <I>StudentHandbook</I>. If the student <B>denies</B> guilt, the case willproceed to a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on StudentAffairs for a <I>decision and, if appropriate, sanction</I> asoutlined in the <I>Student Handbook</I>.<P>Both the accused student and the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairshave the right of written appeal to the <I>Provost</I> withinthree working days of the notification of the sanction. The appealprocess is outlined in the <I>Student Handbook.<BR></I><P><B>Sanctions</B><P>The penalty for a first offense will ordinarily be an F in thecourse, but different penalties may be determined by the JudiciaryCommittee. For a repeated offense the student will be suspendedor expelled. <P>An especially flagrant violation such as the theft of confidentialinformation from a computer record, the forging or tampering withacademic records either in hard copy or on a computer, or thestealing of copies of an examination may warrant expulsion. <P>The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs will notify the Dean ofthe school in which the student is enrolled of all cases wherea student is found guilty of academic dishonesty. The Dean willdestroy these files upon the student's graduation. <BR><P><A NAME="abuse_misuse"><B>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MISUSE POLICY <BR></B></A><P><B>The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Policy</B><P>Annually, Manhattan College informs students about the Drug-FreeSchools and Communities Act of 1989. This law, with which theCollege intends to comply fully, was designed, in part, to preventthe illicit use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol by students.<P>Failure to comply with the College's regulations and the lawsof the State of New York governing the possession, distribution,and consumption of alcohol constitutes a violation of the Codeof Conduct. The same applies to the unauthorized sale, purchase,production, possession, distribution, or use of controlled substancesof other addictive and illegal drugs on college premises. Violationsare punishable by sanctions which have been imposed pursuant tothe judicial procedures of the College which are set forth inthis handbook. These sanctions include dismissal from the Collegeand students may also be accountable to the appropriate civilauthorities.<P>The laws of New York State contain all relevant statues regardingthe possession, sale, distribution or use of alcohol and otherdrugs. If a student is convicted of a violation under these statues,he/she could face a fine, imprisonment, or the loss of drivingprivileges. If a student under the age of 21 purchases alcoholicbeverages through fraudulent means, they can face additional penaltiesif convicted.<P><B>Alcohol</B><P>Consumption of alcoholic beverages is a custom in American societyand is prevalent at most college campuses. Problems which relateto drinking are also universal and are particularly acute in collegecommunities. Studies indicate that more than one-fourth of individualsin college community have problems caused by immoderate and irresponsibledrinking. The College must have policies, programs and regulationsthat recognize the potential problems resulting from excessiveconsumption and that endeavor to prevent such occurrence.<P>The purpose of the College is twofold. 1. We must provide thebest possible opportunity for learning, and 2. We must createan environment conducive to personal growth. These goals are hinderedby alcohol abuse. Behavior resulting from excessive drinking thatinterferes with the accomplishment of our goals is unacceptableand shall be cause for disciplinary action. The College providesits own educational and counseling programs, as well as referralsources, in order to assist members of the College community indealing with alcohol problems that may develop.<P>College policy permits the use of alcohol in moderation in accordancewith New York State law but opposes excessive consumption. Thosewho drink must remain in control of their behavior; they shallbe responsible for their actions and respect the rights of others.Promotions and publicity that glorify or urge consumption of alcoholare prohibited.<P>Under current New York State law, individuals under 21 years ofage may not possess or consume alcoholic beverages nor may individualsover 21 years of age furnish alcoholic beverages to those under21 years of age.<P>Manhattan is chartered by the State of New York and, as such,it must make every reasonable effort to ensure that State lawis observed on College property. Accordingly, the following Collegepolicies are in effect: <P>(1) Persons under 21 years of age may not possess or consume alcoholicbeverages on College premises. <P>(2) No member of the College community may serve or otherwisefurnish alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age onCollege premises. <P>(3) No person under the age of 21 may present evidence of agewhich is false for the purpose of purchasing alcoholic beverages.<P>Sanctions for violations of this policy are expulsion or suspensionfrom the college or residence halls; probation; fines; communityservice; or revocation of privileges. <BR><P><B>Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs</B><P>The unauthorized selling, purchasing, or possession, or distributionof narcotics, depressants, stimulants, or hallucinogenic drugsis in violation of the Student Code of Conduct and state and federallaws. Manhattan College cannot and will not be a sanctuary fromcivil authorities.<P>Any student distributing or selling drugs on campus will be subjectto dismissal through the College judiciary procedure. Evidenceof distribution or sale of drugs on campus will be reported tothe appropriate law enforcement agency. The College will cooperatewith law enforcement agencies in apprehending specific individualswhose activities such authorities have good reason to suspect.<P>The possession and/or use of such drugs is strictly forbidden.Students violating this restriction are subject to suspension,involuntary leave of absence, referral for a mandatory substanceabuse assessment, parental notification, and other sanctions.<P>The College recognizes the need for counseling and other supportservices for students who have used or are using drugs. The CollegeCounseling Center provides referrals for specialized professionalassessment and treatment as well as for self-help support groups.<BR><P><A NAME="expectations_behavios"><B>COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS ANDBEHAVIOR <BR></B></A><P>At Manhattan College, community is based on the mutual respectof many persons engaged in different aspects of the academic venture.In this cooperative educational experience, the Manhattan communityhas found that certain kinds of behavior defeat the respect webear for one another.<P>Generally, College jurisdiction and discipline shall be limitedto conduct which occurs on College premises (all land, buildings,facilities, and other property used or controlled by the Collegeincluding adjacent streets and sidewalks) and conduct which adverselyaffects the College community and/or the pursuit of its objectives.The College's right to discipline students extends to all offcampus activity which is sponsored by the College including socialfunctions and athletic events. Furthermore, in an effort to providea safe and secure environment for all students and to protectthe public order, the College believes it must hold all studentsaccountable for their behavior at all times. Therefore, the Collegewill confront cases of illegal and/or irresponsible behavior whetherit occurs on or off campus.<P>Inappropriate behavior that is observed by campus officials aswell as information provided by the Police and other local authoritieswill be addressed. The College will sanction such behavior inaccordance with the policies and procedures as outlined in thisHandbook. College authority is not used to duplicate the functionof civil laws. The College will provide counseling and referralsfor students who demonstrate a pattern of irresponsible behaviorincluding alcohol misuse.<P>The following actions are considered violations of the CollegeCode of Conduct and are punishable by sanctions imposed in accordancewith the judicial procedures of the College: <BR><P>1. Vandalism to, or theft of, College property or property belongingto another person while on college property (including, but notlimited to, library materials and computer files). <P>2. Any behavior that is contrary to the order requisite for theeducational community, including but not limited to, conduct whichthreatens or endangers the life, health, safety or well-beingof self or others.<P>3. Unauthorized entry or use of College facilities; unauthorizedpossession, duplication or use of keys to College facilities.<P>4. Tampering with fire-fighting equipment or alarms located onCollege property.<P>5. Unauthorized possession or use of dangerous or lethal weapons,explosives, firecrackers or combustibles. <P>6. Refusal to show identification to administrative, academic,Security or food service personnel or members of Student Governmentwho are performing their assigned duties.<P>7. Physical or verbal abuse of a College official.<P>8. Improper use of or transfer of Manhattan College identification.<P>9. Creating loud noise or other disturbance on the Quadrangle;game playing such as frisbee, football, catch, etc, on the Quadrangle.<P>10. Gambling in any form anywhere on the campus.<P>11. Smoking in restricted areas such as classrooms, cafeterias,corridors and foyers.<P>12. Any evidence of bigotry, racism, or prejudice directed towardanother individual or organization.<P>13. Being in a state of intoxication.<P>14. Any conduct which would violate the criminal codes of anyNew York City, New York State, or federal governmental agency.<P>15. Any sexual intercourse while on campus, and outside the boundsof marriage is behavior that is unacceptable in the universitycommunity. Students involved in activity of this nature will besubject to disciplinary action and/or counseling.<P>16. Any activity in violation of the College Policy Statementspresented in this Handbook or other college publications.<P>17. Failure to comply with the directives of College officialsacting in performance of their duties.<P>18. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior which posesimminent danger of causing substantial harm to self or others,or would cause significant property damage, or would directlyand substantially impede the lawful activities of others, shallbe subject to an involuntary leave of absence.<P>19. Abuse of telecommunications, (telephone, e-mail, cable T.V.),computing and information services privileges will not be toleratedand shall result in appropriate disciplinary action includingbut not limited to revocation of privileges. Students are expectedto comply with all relevant laws and college policies governingaccess to and use of these services, software, equipment and tocomport themselves in an ethical manner with a high degree ofregard for fellow students and others.<P>20. Violations of any other policies outlined in the ResidenceLife section of this Handbook.<BR><P><B>NOTE:</B> Because of the Cooperative Program between the Collegeof Mount Saint Vincent and Manhattan College, students from eitherCollege may be present at the other's events. The actions of studentspresent on either college campus are governed by the Code of Conductof that particular college and can result in suspension of theprivilege of cross-campus participation. However, disciplinaryactions occur on the student's home campus.<BR><P><B>Disruptive Activity</B><P>Manhattan College wishes to reaffirm its role and function asan institution of higher learning where free inquiry and opendiscussion are considered indispensable elements for the achievementof its goal. <P>Dissent is recognized as a means for exposing error or discoveringalternative routes to truth, but the presentation of dissent throughdisruptive action will not be tolerated. Disruptive action includesphysical violence and/or conduct which restrains either the freedomof expression or movement of others or which obstructs normalcollege operation or which causes damage to personal or Collegeproperty, and thereby denies to others the freedom which all areentitled. <P>Therefore, in conformity with recommendations received from representativesof the student body, the faculty, the administration and the Boardof Trustees, the procedures to be followed at Manhattan Collegein case of disruptive action will be: <P>1. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or his/her designeewill apprise all participating parties, directly or through theirrecognized leaders, that failure to discontinue, promptly, obstructionor disruption may result in disciplinary action including , butnot limited to, suspension and/or dismissal following the Collegejudiciary procedures. <P>2. Participating parties may be asked to show their identificationcards to the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or his/her designee.Those who either have no such identification or refuse to showit and are unknown to the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs orhis/her designee will be assumed not to be members of the Collegecommunity and will be subject to legal action. <P>3. If obstruction or disruption continues for a period of timethat makes it obvious in the view of officials of the Collegethat ordinary methods are not sufficient to control the situation,the assistance of municipal law enforcement authorities will berequested. The decision to summon such assistance lies with thePresident of the College. Other members of the administration,faculty and student body may be consulted if there is time inthe opinion of the President. <BR><P><B>Hazing</B><P>Hazing in any form is expressly prohibited at Manhattan College.Hazing is defined as any planned action or created situation,whether on or off campus, that is demeaning to an individual;produces mental or physical duress, harassment or ridicule; orwhich threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person.<P>Such activities and situations include but are not limited to,any action or situation that recklessly or intentionally endangersmental or physical health or involves the forced consumption ofliquor or drugs for the purpose of initiation or affiliation withany organization, paddling in any form, creation of excessivefatigue, physical and psychological shocks, morally degradingor humiliating games or activities, late (post-midnight) worksessions that interfere with scholastic activities and any otheractivities that are not consistent with policies and regulationsat Manhattan College. <P>This policy governs the conduct of students, faculty and otherstaff as well as visitors and other licensees and invitees onManhattan College's campus and property. <P>Violation of the policy will result in the ejection of a violatorfrom College property and possible prosecution; and, in the caseof a student or faculty violator, suspension, expulsion or otherappropriate disciplinary action, according to existing judiciaryprocedures; and, in the case of an organization authorizing suchconduct, rescission of permission for that organization to operateon campus property as a result of having its official recognitionas a student organization withdrawn. Further, such penalties shallbe in addition to any penalty, pursuant to the penal code or anyother chapter to which a violator or organization may be subject.<P>A copy of this policy will be given to all students enrolled atManhattan College and shall be deemed part of the by-laws of allorganizations operating on campus. Additionally, the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs shall review annually such by-laws withindividuals affiliated with such organizations. <P>The foregoing policy statement is intended to comply with Chapter676, Section 6450, of the Education Law of 1980 and with Section120.16 of the New York State Penal Code. <BR><P><B>Sexual Harassment</B><P>Preamble<P>Manhattan College has long been known for the value-centered educationit offers. Among the values the College Community cherishes andimparts is a deep respect for the dignity and integrity of eachperson. Among the responsibilities the Community assumes is theneed to stand firm against all that threatens that dignity andintegrity. <P>Since discrimination of any form vitiates every form of humanrelationship, the College has long stated its intolerance of anydiscriminatory practice based on race, color, religion, nationality,or sex. <P>Knowing that sexual harassment is an insidious form of discrimination,one that demeans the dignity and integrity of the individual,that attacks the College's mission to foster an open learningand working environment, that destroys the good order of society,the College has condemned such harassment in the following policyadopted by the Senate, the President, and the Board of Trusteesin the Fall 1987. In addition, the College adopts the followingformal procedure should any such harassment be reported. <P>Policy<P>It is the policy of Manhattan College that no member of the CollegeCommunity may sexually harass another. <P>For general policy purposes, sexual harassment may be describedas unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, andother physical and expressive behavior of a sexual nature where:<P>1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitlya term or condition of an individual's employment or education:<P>2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individualis used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affectingthe individual; or <P>3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interferingwith an individual's academic or professional performance or creatingan intimidating, hostile, or demeaning employment or educationalenvironment. <BR><P>No College personnel and no office of the College shall condonesexual harassment either actively or by ignoring a complaint bya member of the College community or an obvious attempt to harasssexually another by a member of the College community. <P>No member of the College community may retaliate in any way againsta person for making a claim of sexual harassment or for assistingor acting as witness for a person who makes a claim of sexualharassment. <P>It is in the best interest of the College and of the complainantif the complainant consults with a trusted member of the Collegecommunity at the first instance of what may be perceived as sexualharassment. It is also in both the complainant's and the community'sbest interest if informal procedure is tried before formal chargesare filed. <P>Protection from retaliation in all cases<P>In its policy on sexual harassment, the College has affirmed thatno retaliation may be made against anyone for making a claim ofsexual harassment or for assisting or acting as a witness fora person who makes a formal or informal claim of sexual harassment.Should there be any evidence of retaliation, such shall be documentedin a letter to the Affirmative Action Officer with a copy to thePresident as quickly as possible. The Affirmative Action Officershall investigate all allegations of retaliation immediately.<P>The Hearing Committee<P>If a formal hearing is required to adjudicate charges of sexualharassment, an ad-hoc Hearing Committee will be constituted froma pre-determined list of sixteen persons representing the fourconstituencies of the College community, all of whom will havereceived training in the procedure and guidelines involving sexualharassment cases and are willing to serve on such a panel withutmost confidentiality and impartiality. <P>To develop this list of sixteen, the Affirmative Action Officershall ask the representatives of the four constituencies, StudentGovernment, Faculty Council, Administrators (including professionalstaff), and a Staff Group to name four persons each.* Studentsshall serve for a one-year renewable term. Faculty, staff, andadministrators shall serve for three-year renewable terms.** <P>An ad-hoc Hearing Committee shall be selected randomly from thepre-determined list of sixteen and shall comprise the chairperson(the Affirmative Action Officer), one faculty member, one student,one staff member, and one administrator. To this shall be addedtwo more members from the list, one to be chosen by the complainantand one to be chosen by the alleged harasser. <P>For charges that do not involve a student, the student on thecommittee shall be excused and not replaced by any other persons.<P>Any committee member perceiving a conflict of interest may excusehimself of herself, and the Affirmative Action Officer shall appointa replacement from the same group on the remaining list. The AffirmativeAction Officer may consider and may grant any application to removeand replace a member of the panel because of an alleged conflictof interest. <P>*For the representatives of the Administrators (including professionalstaff), the Vice-Presidents for Facilities Management, StudentServices, Finance, and College Advancement shall ask for volunteersto stand for election from each group. All administrators (includingprofessional staff), shall elect from the total slate, but eachof the four areas must be represented. For staff representation,the Vice-President of Human Resources shall notify all staff,asking for volunteers. The Vice-President of Human Resources shallthen choose four members, making sure that all components of thestaff are represented. Students must be at junior or senior level;all faculty representatives must be tenured. <P>**The first year that the list is drawn up, terms for faculty,staff, and administrators shall be set at one, two, and threeyears randomly to allow for orderly rotation. <BR><P>Alleged harassment involving Members and Non-Members of the CollegeCommunity<P>If a guest of a member of the College community or if an employeeof a service contractor is harassed by a member of the Collegecommunity, the procedures stated herein shall be followed. <P>If the alleged harasser is a member of an agency or company thatserves the College or contracts with the College to perform services,written notice of the alleged incident shall be made as soon aspossible by the complainant to the Affirmative Action Officerand then by the Affirmative Action Officer to the appropriatedean (where there is jurisdiction) or vice president in chargeof supervising the contract. <P>If the alleged harasser is a guest of a member of the Collegecommunity (including service personnel), written notice of thealleged incident shall be made as soon as possible by the complainantto the Affirmative Action Officer and then by the AffirmativeAction Officer to the appropriate dean or vice president. <P>Alleged harassment involving only Students<P>Since there is already in place a Judiciary Committee for adjudicatingcomplaints between students, matters of this nature shall be referredto that Judiciary Committee. Careful procedure shall be workedout in advance, perhaps based on the procedure worked out forother types of sexual harassment hearings. <P>Alleged harassment involving College Personnel or Students andCollege Personnel<BR><P>I. FILING CHARGES<UL><LI>a. It is not necessary that the complainants first try informallyto end the harassment, but is strongly recommended that he orshe do so. <LI>b. The complainant may choose any faculty member, administrator,or staff member to serve as confident(e). But there shall be oneperson to whom and through whom all written charges are made andadjudicated, the Affirmative Action Officer. Should the AffirmativeAction Officer be named in a sexual harassment complaint, theAffirmative Action officer shall immediately turn over all jurisdictionto the Provost. <LI>c. After discussing the situation with the Affirmative ActionOfficer and deciding to initiate formal procedure, the complainantshall file written charges with the Affirmative Action Officerwithin two months after the date of the last incident of allegedsexual harassment complained of or the date of the last attemptto stop the alleged harassment.* <LI>d.

THE SEPARATE MEETINGS<BR><P>Within two weeks of the filing of charges, the Affirmative ActionOfficer shall meet separately with the complainant, and with thealleged harasser to discuss the charges.* At these separate meetings,the complainant and the alleged harasser may each bring one personas support (the confidante or a parent or close friend, a chairpersonor faculty member), but these guests shall have no right to speakpublicly unless asked to by the Affirmative Action Officer. TheAffirmative Action Officer has full authority to push for resolutionat this time.<P>III. THE JOINT CONFERENCE AND THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTING THEHEARING COMMITTEE<UL><LI>a. Within two weeks of the individual meetings,* the AffirmativeAction Officer shall schedule a joint conference, bringing togetherthe complainant and the alleged harasser. Again, the complainantand the alleged harasser may each bring one person as support(the confident[e] or a parent or close friend, a chairperson orfaculty member), but these guests shall have no right to speakpublicly unless asked to by the Affirmative Action Officer. Again,the Affirmative Action Officer has full authority to and shallmake every effort to resolve the problem, especially if the allegedharasser apologizes and promises to cease all such conduct andthe complainant is willing to accept this.<LI>b. At this joint conference, if no such resolution can beaffected quickly, a date within four weeks shall be set for aformal hearing to determine if sexual harassment has indeed occurred,and if so, the severity of the action and the kinds of sanctionswarranted. If the total time of nine weeks from the date of thefiling of the written complaint to the date of the formal hearingcannot be maintained, the party seeking the delay shall explainin writing to all involved why such a delay is necessary.* <BR><LI>c. At this joint conference, in the presence of the complainantand the alleged harasser, the Affirmative Action Officer shalldraw randomly the prescribed number for each category from thelist of sixteen to constitute the Hearing Committee. At this samejoint conference, the complainant and the alleged harasser eachshall nominate a specific candidate as their choice from thosenot already randomly drawn. They may choose from any category.If none on the list of pre-determined panelists is acceptableto either the complainant or the alleged harasser or both, eitherthe complainant or the alleged harasser or both shall nominatea person of his or her choice from within the College community.<LI>d. At this time also, the procedures of testimony and of cross-examinationand the nature of penalties shall be explained.</UL><P>*The Affirmative Action Officer may extend all time limits forgood cause. <P>IV. THE FORMAL HEARING<BR><UL><LI>a. The formal hearing shall be conducted impartially and withcourtesy extended to all parties.<LI>b. The formal hearing shall be recorded and a full transcriptprepared at College expense.<LI>c. The complainant shall testify first; the charged shallfollow.<LI>d.

The Hearing Committee shall issue its conclusions in writingto the President within two weeks of the close of hearings.*<LI>b. If the Hearing Committee concludes that sexual harassmenthas taken place, it shall include in its report the number ofmembers voting for each finding.<LI>c. If a majority concludes that the charged party had engagedin sexual harassment of the complainant, it may recommend thatthe President:<UL><LI>1. consider restitution to the complainant if appropriate;<LI>2. send a letter of warning to the offender;<LI>3. send a letter of reprimand to the offender;<LI>4. require counseling for the offender;<LI>5. suspend the offender for a definite time period;<LI>6. begin procedures to dismiss the offender.</UL><LI>d. If no sexual harassment is found, the Hearing Committeeshall file a full report with the President.<LI>e. Should the panel find the complainant either frivolousor malicious in bringing charges, the Committee may suggest thatthe President do one of the following:<UL><LI>1. send a letter of warning to the complainant;<LI>2. send a letter of reprimand to the complainant;<LI>3. require counseling for the complainant;<LI>4. suspend the complainant for a definite time period;<LI>5. begin procedures to dismiss the complainant.</UL><LI>f.

An appeals committee of three shall be named within twoweeks of the receipt of the registered letter.* This appeals committeeof three shall be constituted from the pre-determined list ofthe sixteen faculty, students, staff, and administrators on thelist, but shall not include any who served on the original HearingCommittee. The Affirmative Action Officer shall name all threemembers and specify the chairperson. <LI>d. This appeals committee shall have the right to all recordsin the case.

The Affirmative Action Officer shall notify the two partiesto pick up copies of the decision in his or her office. <BR></UL><P><A NAME="judiciary_procedures"><B>Judiciary Procedures</B></A><P>Disciplinary authority is vested in the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs. This authority may be exercised by referral to one ofthe following hearing boards: the Judiciary Committee on StudentAffairs, the College Judiciary Council, or the Student Court.At the discretion of the Associate Dean, the President of theCollege or Vice President for Student Life may conduct preliminaryhearings or act as hearing officers. The Judiciary Committee onStudent Affairs and the College Judiciary Council have the authorityto hear cases involving alleged violations of the Student Codeof Conduct when suspension or expulsion from the College may bethe appropriate sanction if charges are substantiated. Other typesof cases may be heard if referred to the Committee by the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs. The Judiciary Committee is composedof three faculty members, chosen on the basis of availabilityfrom those who have been appointed by the College President accordingto the procedures of the Council on Faculty Affairs, and threestudents including the President of Student Government, the Presidentof the Senior Class, the Chief Justice and three student alternatesappointed by the Executive Committee of Student Government andapproved by the Legislature. One faculty member will be chosenby members of the Judiciary Committee to serve as non-voting chairfor a period of one year; one faculty member will be chosen toserve as alternate chair. A full hearing board should be presentto constitute a valid hearing. Exceptions must be agreed uponin writing by the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and the accusedstudent(s). <P>The College Judiciary Council has the authority to hear casesof appeal from the Judiciary Committee on Student Affairs or appealsof administrative decisions by the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs may also assignserious cases of alleged misconduct directly to the College JudiciaryCouncil. The Council is comprised of three administrators and/orfaculty members appointed by the Vice President of Student Life.<P>The Student Court has the authority to hear cases involving allegedviolations of Student Government regulations and College regulationswithin its jurisdiction, as referred by the Associate Dean ofJudicial Affairs. It also adjudicates appeals of campus parkingtickets. The Court is composed of a Chief Justice and six AssociateJustices to be nominated by the Executive Committee and approvedby a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. <BR><P><B>General Statements</B><P>The standard for disciplinary decision making is based on thepreponderance of the evidence. <P>A student may remain silent at a hearing and such silence shouldnot be used against the student. A violation of the Student Codeof Conduct may nevertheless be found based upon the other evidencepresented. <P>The action of the College with respect to any off campus conductshall be made independently of off campus authority. Studentsmay be accountable to both civil authorities and to the Collegefor acts which constitute violations of law and of the StudentCode of Conduct. Disciplinary action at the College will normallyproceed during the pendency of criminal/civil proceedings andwill not be subject to challenge on the ground that criminal/civilcharges involving the same incident have been delayed, reduced,or dismissed.<P><B>Jurisdiction</B><P>Generally, College jurisdiction and discipline shall be limitedto conduct which occurs on College premises (all land, buildings,facilities, and other property used or controlled by the Collegeincluding adjacent streets and sidewalks) and conduct which adverselyaffects the College community and/or the pursuit of its objectives.The College's right to discipline students extends to all offcampus activity which is sponsored by the College including socialfunctions and athletic events. Furthermore, in an effort to providea safe and secure environment for all students and to protectthe public order, the College believes it must hold all studentsaccountable for their behavior at all times. Therefore, the Collegewill confront cases of illegal and/or irresponsible behavior whetherit occurs on or off campus.<P>Inappropriate behavior that is observed by campus officials aswell as information provided by the Police and other local authoritieswill be addressed. The College will sanction such behavior inaccordance with the policies and procedures as outlined in thisHandbook. College authority is not used to duplicate the functionof civil laws. The College will provide counseling and referralsfor students who demonstrate a pattern of irresponsible behaviorincluding alcohol misuse.<P><B>Hearing Procedures </B><P>Notification and preliminary hearing<P>Any member of the College community may report an alleged violationof the Student Code of Conduct to the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs, in writing. The student(s) involved becomes subject toa disciplinary investigation and possible subsequent action. <P>The Associate Dean ofJudicial Affairs will hold a preliminaryhearing to provide the accused student with the opportunity todiscuss the facts and circumstances which led to the report. TheAssociate Dean will clarify the student's rights as defined inthe Student Handbook as well as describe potential sanctions forthe violation in question. Discussion will determine whether thecharges will be handled administratively or by a hearing board.<P>If the student acknowledges the violation, the Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs will decide on the course of action to betaken, which may include determination of the sanction by theAssociate Dean of Judicial Affairs or assignment to a hearingby the Student Court, the College Judiciary Council, or the JudiciaryCommittee on Student Affairs to determine the sanction. The student'spreference will be taken into consideration. <P>If the student denies the charges, the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs will determine whether the case will be assigned to theStudent Court, the College Judiciary Council, or the JudiciaryCommittee on Student Affairs.<P>Procedures for the Judiciary Committee on Student Affairs andthe College Judiciary Council<P>If the case proceeds to a hearing before the Judiciary Committeeon Student Affairs or the College Judiciary Council: <P>1. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs will inform the studentin writing of the specific charge against him/her and of the timeand place of the hearing. <P>2. The accused student shall be given a reasonable time to ensureopportunity to prepare for the hearing. <P>3. The accused student shall not be subject to disciplinary sanctionsuntil the conclusion of the hearing except in extreme cases whereit is deemed that the individual(s) represents a danger to himself/herselfor to the College community. In such a case the Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs may suspend a student pending the outcomeof the hearing. <P>4. The accused student shall be given copies of all evidence pertinentto the case except any which may be excluded by the College policyon Confidentiality of Student Records. <P>5. The accused student shall have an opportunity to present evidencein his/her behalf, including the testimony of witnesses, and shallnot be compelled to testify against himself/ herself. <P><B>Hearing Guidelines</B><P>The chairperson of the Committee/Council is responsible for maintainingan orderly hearing process. <I>Only those persons recognized bythe chair may speak at the hearing</I>. Persons other than thosedirectly involved in the case are permitted to be present providedthey have the approval of the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs.The chair has the right to exclude persons from the hearing ifthey are disruptive, or to postpone the hearing because of disruptivebehavior of participants or observers. Disruptive behavior mayform the basis of a charge in and of itself. <P>If an accused student fails to appear at a scheduled hearing andhis/her absence is not excused, the hearing may proceed withouthim or her. The hearing may be rescheduled at the option of theAssociate Dean of Judicial Affairs. <P>The following represent general operating guidelines: <BR><P>1. The chairperson will inform the accused student(s) of the policiesand procedures for the hearing including the fact that the hearingmay be recorded. <P>2. The chair will ask each member of the Committee/Council tointroduce himself/herself and relate his/her College affiliation.<P>3. The accused student(s) will have the right to be assisted byan adviser of his/her choice, who must be a member of the ManhattanCollege community (administrator, faculty member or student).The adviser may assist the student in preparation of his/her defense,may accompany him/her to the hearing, may advise the student duringthe hearing, but may not participate directly in the hearing process.Only those persons recognized by the chair may speak at the hearing.<P>4. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and the accused studentwill present statements concerning the alleged violation of thecode of conduct. The accused student, the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs and members of the Committee/Council may examine all writtenmaterial and question all witnesses. <P>5. After all statements have been presented, the Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs and the accused student, in that order, maybe given the opportunity to summarize, at the discretion of thechairperson. <P>6. The Committee/Council will then go into closed session to makeits decision. The Committee/Council will determine by majorityvote from the weight and credibility of the statements and evidencewhether the accused has violated the code of conduct. The chairpersonwill inform the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and the studentof the Committee's decision. <P>7. If the Committee/Council finds the accused student has violatedthe code of conduct, the student will be given the opportunityto make a statement to the Committee/Council. The Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs may respond to statements presented. The Committee/Councilwill also consider the following: <BR><UL><LI>a. the statements presented at the hearing;<LI>b. prior disciplinary record of the student;<LI>c. the disciplinary precedent. <BR></UL><P>The Committee/Council will then determine the sanction in closedsession and inform the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs andthe student. If the student is not able to be present to hearthe decision of the sanction from the hearing board, the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs will inform him/her verbally as soonas possible. Written confirmation of the decision will be sentto the student(s) by the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs. <P>8. When the hearing has ended, all documents and tapes (if recorded)shall remain in the custody of the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs. It is understood that files of each case shall be strictlyconfidential and will not be released without the permission ofthe accused student except under legal compulsion or in caseswhere the safety of persons or property is involved. <BR><P><A NAME="disciplinary_sanctiosn"><B>Disciplinary Sanctions</B></A><P>When it has been determined that a student has violated a Collegerule, a sanction or combination of sanctions is imposed.
