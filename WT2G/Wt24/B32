<H2>PDE's INFORMATION VILLAGE CONCEPT</H2><p>

The Internet has been described as a massive, world-wide library of 
information that is not well organized or catalogued. In other words, 
information can be difficult to find. Our specialty at PDE Publications is to make your home page part of a specialized traffic safety &quot;information 
village&quot; that will quickly become known on the Net as the place to go for 
this kind of information. Browsers with an interest in this topic will find 
the village easily and return to it again and again to check what's new. <p>


The Village consists of Home Pages (Web sites) and a database with free and restricted areas. The free browsing area has interesting articles and news about driver behaviour, traffic safety and education. The restricted area has a password for paying subscribers and offers access to in-depth articles, conference proceedings, periodicals, abstracts and reference materials for traffic safety professionals.<p>

The concept of the Village is to create a networked community of individuals, groups, businesses and organizations with a common interest in traffic safety.<p>

<H3>YOUR HOME PAGE</H3><p>


To get your home page up on the WWW as part of the PDE Traffic Safety 
Information Village, contact us at:<p>

<h2>JOINING THE VILLAGE ...</H2><P>

The terms &quot;Home Page&quot; and &quot;Web site&quot; are somewhat confusing in that they seem to be interchangeable. We can set up a Home Page for you at the Traffic Safety Information Village and this will be your unique Web site, with its own address and accessibility on the World Wide Web. <p>

Think of it as a sort of billboard or brochure that describes the products or services that you or your organization have to offer. But in contrast with the brochure, your page will be interactive. And it can potentially be viewed by millions of Net users locally and around the world at very little cost to you. <p>

If you are curious about the potential of the Web for your business or organization, why not try a basic one-page site? Write out what you would like to say on a sheet of paper and we'll put it up for you for a basic $300 cost for one year. This includes a two-year subscription to the Village database.<p>
If your page (site) is interesting and easy to find on the Net, your potential clients will come to you. They can do this by mail, telephone, fax or E-mail. To make it easier, we can put an E-mail form right on screen. Users simply type in their message and hit the send or submit button. Forms for mail and credit card ordering can also be built into your page.<p>

PDE has the expertise to build sophisticated Web sites and offers the advantage of broad knowledge of safety issues and the goal of creating a networked community of interest.<p>

You can have your local internet connection provider set up a Home Page for you and, for a small charge, we can make it a part of the Village by creating a link to it. However, there are advantages to having us set up your page. There are millions of Web pages out there, but by setting up your page with us, you become part of the Net's distinctive traffic safety community. You will also benefit from everything PDE does to publicize the Village resource.<p>

<P> Sociologist J.P. Rothe asks readers to suspend all inherited beliefs 
about traffic safety problems and solutions. He takes readers into the rich 
and fertile terrain of traffic sociology and its implications for 
understanding the behaviour of road users. He examines the negotiation of 
physical risks to accommodate social expectations; the basic trust that 
establishes the relationships between road users; the driver's licence as a 
form of social control; the role of discretion and tolerance in police work; 
and the issue of speeding from the sociologist's point of view. The goal is 
to motivate the readers towards a new kind of thinking about traffic 
safety. <P>

Most people see driving as a relatively easy task and have little fear of it. But for a significant number of individuals, driving is fraught with risks and fears, especially if they have been subjected to the traumatic experience of a crash. Author Jack Smith has been working with people suffering from post-traumatic stress for 25 years. A veteran of Vietnam, he helped write the American Psychiatric Association's official diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. He shows readers how to evaluate their stress reactions following the trauma of a crash and how to deal with them.<p>

<P>A multidisciplinary look at road safety. Internationally renowned scholars look at the traffic safety problem from 
the standpoints of engineering, philosophy, economics, law, political 
science, education, communication and sociology. It's an exciting effort to

<H3><A NAME="instructional">Instructional</A> support to drivers: The role of in-vehicle feedback in improving driving performance of qualified motorists<BR>
By  M. J. Kuiken (Ph.D. Thesis, 1996)</H3><p>
$19.95 U.S., $26.50 Can. plus $6.00 S & H, 68 pages. <p>

Given that the traffic environment does not give very good feedback on safety, would driving instructors be able to improve safe performance by providing better feedback about risks? What kind of feedback works best?<BR>
This thesis concludes that instructional support needs to be adapted to the individual driver and that, if it is properly suited to the traffic scenario in question, it can exert a positive influence on driver behavior. <P>

Research was conducted at the Traffic Research Centre, University of Groeningen, as part of the Generic Intelligent Driver Support project. Read more about this publication in the <A HREF="/ARTICLES/free/kuiken-96205-5961.html">Library</A>.<P>

<P>David Thompson's book is intended for the parent, family member or "coach" who provides the novice driver with the many hours of practice that are required in order to become accomplished behind the wheel. An attractive layout, combined with auto journalist Thompson's lively style and well researched content, make this a good book for any educator to have as a reference. It blends basic information about car control with insights into the psychology of driving. It also lays out a comprehensive program of exercises for co-drivers to follow during practice. These include braking techniques, collision avoidance, night maneuvers and vision tactics. Hints for both coaches and novices are included. <P>

<P>Why is the average trucker continuously placed in circumstances that, 
according to truckers, demand risky driving? Trucker safety interventions 
have traditionally been aimed at the truck driver. Traffic sociologist Rothe 
contends that intervention programs will work better if the focus is on the 
motivations and influences that govern drivers' behaviour. <P>

Why do seniors get into crashes at intersections? In this report, sociologists Rothe and McGregor focus on how seniors relate to intersections, how they feel about them, and what shapes their driving behaviour. It's an attempt "to uncover reasons, thought processes, and rationales as to why seniors drive through intersections the way they do." <P>

While empirical, or quantative, research gathers facts and statistics, qualitative research zooms in on the human side of things and searches for the underlying causes of  human behaviour. It's a systematic form of the kind of inquiry most of us engage in regularly, whether we realize it or not. In this book, sociologist J.P. Rothe describes the methods of qualitative inquiry and the unique approach he used in researching his popular books on traffic sociology. <P>

<STRONG><A HREF="excerpts.html">READ EXCERPTS</A></STRONG> from &quot;Target Risk&quot;.<P>
Antilock braking systems, airbags, seatbelt laws, traffic lights, speed 
regulations are all part of mammoth efforts to reduce traffic casualties. 
But do these measures and their counterparts in industry and public health 
have the effects intended? In his theory of risk homeostasis, Professor 
Gerald Wilde postulates that they don't because they fail to influence 
people's willingness to take risk. Now, for the first time, Wilde collects 
his controversial theory, along with its supporting arguments and data, into 
one fascinating document. <STRONG>Target Risk</STRONG> is a powerhouse of insights 
into human risk-taking behaviour. It's a book that everyone interested in 
safety and health promotion should have on the shelf. <P>

<P>
Give people a nice safe life and they'll seek out thrills and excitement - and sometimes real danger. In The Dangerous Edge,  Professor Michael J. Apter explores this phenomenon and enlightens us as to the conditions people typically set for themselves when they seek out sensations of excitement and danger. What Apter offers in this book is the first comprehensive and accessible guide to the psychology of excitement. He examines the complex relationship between excitement, anxiety, panic and euphoria. <P>

Apter explores the concept of excitement and what happens when excitement-seeking goes wrong. He discusses the mechanisms by which we allow ourselves to take risks and to reach higher arousal states. Healthy people, he says, seek excitement in ways that are constructive and led to learning, as opposed to antisocial and destructive modes of excitement-seeking such as "wilding", rape, vandalism and reckless driving. <P>

He offers us ways to manage our "protective frame" so that we can recognize what is genuinely threatening or risky and to control the risks we take so as to have more excitement and fun without courting disaster. <P>

This book is not available through bookstores or from the publisher. PDE Publications has a limited number of copies available.

<h2>AAA NOVICE DRIVER EDUCATION MODEL CURRICULUM OUTLINE</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety has sponsored a project 
to "reinvent" driver education into a form that
reduces crashes by novice drivers. The research team reviewed 
the current driver education literature in order to identify
novice driver needs, evaluate methods of instruction,
and assess the effectiveness of driver education in
influencing behavior. The researchers then proposed
performance objectives for driver education graduates
and methods for achieving those objectives.

<h2>ARE BASICS OF DRIVER/ED BEING IGNORED?</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>The buzz words in driver education these days are risk perception and risk management. But are basics about the car and the finer points about
handling skills being squeezed out of the curriculum in the process? "There's no question about it," says Traffic Safety Education Coordinator John
Harvey of Washington State (650 words)

<title>BREAKING THE LAW: EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR YOUNG DRIVER SAFETY</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2>BREAKING THE LAW: EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR YOUNG DRIVER SAFETY</h2>
<p>
<b>Ray Fuller</b>
<p>Irish road safety expert, Dr. Ray Fuller, of Trinity college, Dublin, recently told a
European road safety conference that further training for novice drivers is
essential if their high crash rates are to be reduced. Novice drivers who
have passed their road test are frequently unable to adequately match their
speed to road and traffic conditions, he said.

<h2>BREWERY TEACHES DRIVING SKILLS</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p> One of the busiest downtown streets in Toronto, Ontario is closed to traffic. Pylons are set up for a driver training program on collision avoidance techniques. The high-profile training effort, presented in conjunction with the city's auto show, was jointly sponsored by a brewery, an auto manufacturer, and a tire company. Both the effectiveness of collision avoidance programs and the wisdom of accepting sponsorship from the alcohol beverage industry are being debated by the driver education community.

<h2>DISCOVERY METHOD BOOSTS EGO BUT IT'S NOT GOOD INSTRUCTION</h2>
<p>
<b>Terry Allen, Training Director for Young Drivers of Canada</b>
<p>The "discovery method" of driver training involves taking raw novices and starting them off on a long, straight multi-lane street in moderate to heavy traffic. It has been called the "immersion" approach by its supporters and the "crash and burn" approach by its detractors. (Date: 1995; 700 words)

<h2>DRIVER EDUCATORS SHOULD LOOK TO RESEARCH</h2>

<p>Driving instructors give their students advice about setting their mirrors a certain way, scanning the rearview mirror every five to eight seconds as they drive along, following at a two-second distance, or braking in a certain way. But is that advice based on hard research that links these techniques to increased safety, or is it opinion based on expert drivers' feelings about what makes safer driving?  (Undated, 800 words)

<title>DRIVER IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS IN GERMANY</title>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2>DRIVER IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS IN GERMANY</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>Germany's driver improvement system works. Germany has a system of compulsory medical and psychological examination for drivers who drive while intoxicated and drivers with high demerit points. 
It also has a voluntary educational program which drivers can take to avoid losing their license or to reduce their suspension. 
Every effort has been made to keep the quality of this system high, and some recent studies indicate that these efforts are working. 
This article contains several abstracts of recent studies by German researchers.

<h2>DRIVING INSTRUCTION IN GERMANY</h2>

<b>Published by the Deutsche Fahrlehrer-Akademie E.V.</b>
<p>Had it not been for the united efforts of the driving instructors' associations and the many pedagogical, specialist and organizational ideas which they have come up with over the last 40 years, driving instruction in Germany would not have achieved its present high standards. An important role has been played by the ongoing exchange of ideas which has taken place with scientists, politicians and top administrators.

<h2>DRIVING STANDARDS AGENCY CLEARS THE ROAD FOR TEACHERS OF DRIVING THEORY</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>Presently, only Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) can give professional training to learner drivers in the UK. In July 1996 the UK will conform to European standards with the introduction of a separate theory test. The government anticipates that a broad range of training experts, such as teachers, lecturers and software manufacturers, will wish to develop suitable training courses for learners and have proposed a change in the rules to accommodate this. This article is a summary of the announcement concerning the rule change.

<title>INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT TO DRIVERS</title>

<h2>INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT TO DRIVERS</h2>
<p>
<b>M. J. Kuiken</b>
<p>Given that the traffic environment does not give very good feedback on safety, would driving instructors be able to improve safe performance by providing better feedback about risks? What kind of feedback works best?<BR>
This thesis concludes that instructional support needs to be adapted to the individual driver and that, if it is properly suited to the traffic scenario in question, it can exert a positive influence on driver behavior. <P>

<title>KAMIKAZES: DRIVERS WITHOUT DRIVER TRAINING</title>

<h2>KAMIKAZES: DRIVERS WITHOUT DRIVER TRAINING</h2>
<p>
<b>David Thornhill Thompson</b>
<p>In the waning months of the war in the Pacific, the Japanese High Command, lacking long-range bombers, developed a squadron of suicide pilots called kamikazes, or Divine Wind. That was 50 years ago. In 1993, in the U.S., nearly 8,000 young men and women died in machines they didn't know how to "land" either, only this time they were in automobiles, not airplanes. They were taught how to turn the key and turn the wheel but not how to turn an automotive emergency into a safe landing. (Date: 1994; 1,200 words)

<title>THE DILEMMA OF WHAT TO TEACH</title>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2>THE DILEMMA OF WHAT TO TEACH</h2>
<p>
<b>Dan Keegan</b>
<p>The great variety in approaches to training and educating drivers around the world testifies to the uncertainty about what training can do and how best to do it. Few jurisdictions have mandatory programs. In many countries, nothing more than a very simple quiz on the rules and a 10 to 15-minute road test stand between a license applicant and full driving privileges. At the other extreme, Germany prohibits new drivers from practising even with parents or friends until they've received instruction from a highly-trained professional. (Undated, 1,300 words)

<p>The power of accurately focused advertising to change driver behavior has been demonstrated very effectively in the Australian State of Victoria. A few years ago, traffic fatalities were approaching a 10-year high and it seemed the public were becoming complacent about it. New York-based Grey Advertising Inc. was given the task of developing a tough advertising campaign to combat the carnage. The campaign is reckoned to have played a major part in making Victoria's roads among the safest in the world. (Date: 1993, 275 words)

<h2>ANIMAL HAZARDS ON THE HIGHWAY</h2>

<b>By David Thompson</b>
<p>Driving, like hitting a curve ball, is a psychomotor skill that relies on the pre-programming of the sub-conscious in the bio-computer we call a brain. Reacting instantly, accurately, thus avoiding accidents, is very much dependent on effectively preparing yourself to deal instinctively and correctly with dangerous surprises such as animals wandering on to the road.

<p>Almost all of the 100 drivers used in this study thought it was very realistic. As they approached a blind intersection at 100 kph, a car moved into their path. There wasn't enough room to stop, but there was room to swerve around.(Date: 1994; 700 words)

<h2>FRONT WHEEL HANDBRAKE AN ANOMALY</h2>

<p>Everyone knows that a car's handbrake is connected to the rear wheels, right? In most cases the answer is yes, unless you happen to own a Subaru Loyale or one of Subaru's sporty XT series.  These cars represent a bit of an anomaly because their handbrake is linked to the front wheels.  (Date: 1994, 680 words)

<h2>G-ANALYST CAN LEAD TO SMOOTHER, SAFER RIDE</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>Ask experts to summarize excellent driving and the word that crops up time and again is "smoothness." The smooth driver, the experts say, knows how to control the car without being abrupt and is so good at anticipating changes in the environment that there is never any need to brake or accelerate heavily, or swerve. The capability to measure smoothness would be an obvious boon to driver educators, and this is what a piece of computerized equipment called the G-Analyst does very effectively (Date: 1993, 1,400 words)

<h2>IN SEARCH OF SAFER ROADS</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>A report just released by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation asks the question "What works and what doesn't work in influencing road user behaviour and improving safety?" The conclusion: "Everything and nothing." The report  reviews models of behaviour change, both in general and those directed specifically to health-related behaviours. "Road user behaviour is so strongly determined that a broad range of influences must be applied to affect lasting change," the report concludes.

<h2>INFORMAL VS. FORMAL TRAFFIC LAWS</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>
A traffic ticket and a criminal record for driving at the speed limit? With a sign protesting the 100 km/h limit fixed to their cars, two men drove side by side at exactly the limit on Ontario's highway 401 last summer, creating a moving roadblock. They were charged with obstructing the highway and public mischief. The real issue was their challenge to what traffic sociologist J. Peter Rothe calls "the moral order of the roadway." The men engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt the delicate balance between the written law and the moral order.

<h2>RISK TAKING, HEALTH AND SAFETY</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>In 1977, British Columbia undertook a massive campaign against drunk driving. 
The program reduced drinking and driving fatalities by an estimated 18%, but overall traffic deaths were up 19%.
Professor Gerald Wilde, a Canadian psychologist, argues 
that safety campaigns 
tend to move accidents around rather than reduce them 
because traditional approaches do not motivate individuals 
to change their "target level" of risk.

<p>A skid training program offered to high school students in the Portland, Oregon area who had completed a driver training course the year before, showed some interesting differences between trained and untrained drivers and between subsequent male and female accident and violation rates.

<h2>SOUTH AFRICA TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT FATALITIES</h2>
<p>
<b>Driver/Education, 1993</b>
<p>Comparing traffic crash statistics between one country and another is a tricky business. A lot depends on how crashes and fatality rates are defined, on driving conditions, and on whether the comparison is based on miles driven, population, or number of cars. No matter how the comparison is set up, the Republic of South Africa comes out at  or near the top of the list. Its fatality rate of 11.4 per 100 million km driven compares with 1.45 for the USA and 1.8 for Japan.

<h2>TRAFFIC VIOLATOR SCHOOL RESEARCH REPORT</h2>
<p>
<b>By Michael Finigan, Ph.D., April, 1995</b>
<p>This study was commissioned by the Santa Clara County, California Municipal Court and was designed to examine two issues. The first is the curriculum effect - the effectiveness of the NTSI curriculum (Levels I and II) in reducing subsequent recidivism, particularly accidents, for its participants when compared to a no-treatment control group. The second is the program effect - the effectiveness of the NTSI program in reducing subsequent accidents for its participants compared to drivers who are eligible to attend the program but who chose not to take the TVS dismissal route and to pay the fine for the violation instead.<p

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2>WHY 16-YEAR-OLDS DIE IN CRASHES</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>The U.S.-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has identified a number of reasons for the high crash rate among 16-year-old drivers. "This is the first time we've been able to identify reasons that 16-year-olds are more at risk than older teens," says Institute senior vice-president Allan F.  Williams, one of the world's leading experts on problems associated with young drivers. (Date: 1995, 400 words)

<h2>WHY DRIVERS TAILGATE</h2>
<p>
<b></b>
<p>There's lots of opinions on why drivers tailgate. But there doesn't seem to be much in the line of hard research that would cast some light on this particular kind of driving behavior. (Date: 1994; 500 words)

<H3>The Center for Unlimited Vision<br>

80 Fifth Ave., Suite 1105<br>

New York, NY 10011</font></H3><p>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Center is dedicated to educating people about vision, especially as it

relates to driving. Our instructional materials include the acclaimed

20-minute video "Save a Second. Save a Life."<p>



"Eyes don't tell people what they see. People tell eyes what to look for."

That's the theme of our video, which comes with a short guide for the

instructor and vision charts for testing.<p>

It uses "sports vision" concepts to instruct the use of the eyes in

traffic. Starting with an explanation of central vision and the importance

of visual acuity, it goes on to show how the eyes gather information and

how they can be trained to gather it more effectively.<p>



The emphasis is on how visual skills can be used to get early warning of

potential problems and provide the driver with that extra second of

reaction time that, research tells us, could prevent as many as 80% of

crashes.<p>



Appropriately, the video ends with a quotation from the French philosopher

Voltaire: "There is no such thing as an accident. What we call by that name

is the effect of some cause which we do not see."<p>



<b>"An outstanding training video for instructors and students"<br></b>

Bob Maximo, Past President, DSAA<p>



<b>"An information-packed overview of visual techniques for drivers."<br></b>

Burton H. Brooks, School Library Journal<p>



<b>"It's the best video I have come across on the topic."<br></b>

Dan Miller, American Driver Education Resource Center<p>

<p>

Dr. Shapiro of the Center for Unlimited Vision is available to help companies set up on-site visual safety screening programs. These programs would be designed to test drivers for: usable visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, depth perception, color vision, eye-muscle balance, and peripheral vision. In addition to the testing program, Dr. Shapiro could design and set up a visual skills training and enhancement program. <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Each quarter I have the opportunity to share with our members the continued growth and improvement of driver education. As spring approaches we see many positive signs of a brighter tomorrow.
<P>

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in cooperation with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), has just released new guidelines on graduated driver licensing. This document clearly describes the importance of driver education in the licensing process. All driver education teachers should have this document. For those attending the ADTSEA conference in Grand Junction, Colorado, the publication entitled, &quot;Graduated Driver Licensing System for Young Drivers,&quot; produced by NHTSA in cooperation with AAMVA will be available at the registration desk.<P>

Speaking of the ADTSEA conference, Barbara Brody has planned an excellent conference. Two credit workshops for driver education teachers are offered the week prior to the conference. Information on these courses was provided in a previous mailing. I encourage you to participate in these course offerings and be ready for the future in graduated licensing. The conference program has national leaders at each general session preparing us for the future. To be current and ready for tomorrow, you need to be in Grand Junction, Colorado.<P>

Our president, Bob Sundermeier, and his wife have planned great activities. Get your reservations in early so you can join the exciting festivities planned.<P>

The changes we are experiencing in driver education are tremendous. Combining driver education with driver licensing has had a positive impact on our driver education programs. Several states will be reporting on success stories at our conference. I personally believe this is the single most important change we can make in our programs. You can't sell a steak without sizzle. It is hard to sell driver education without some sizzle--a driver license. I encourage you to become involved in driver education/licensing.<P>

Driver educators have been aware of the value of parent involvement for some time. Several of our corporate members are developing excellent programs to assist us. They are AAA, Champion, Allstate, and General Motors. Each of these programs will be discussed at our conference.<P>

The National Student Safety Program (NSSP) continues to be a great success. The July conference in Honolulu, Hawaii will have 500 students and advisors present for a five day program. Jan Meeker of the Hawaii Department of Education has done an excellent job in planning and hosting this conference. I wish more driver education teachers would become involved in NSSP activities.<P>

We continue to get good press in major newspapers. The Chicago Tribune recently published a significant article on driver education in Illinois. I was personally interviewed for the article and was quoted correctly.<P>

I recently attended the Southeast Region ADTSEA meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. David Donaldson, Maynard Bridges, and Charles McDaniel planned an excellent conference. The conference was both enjoyable and professionally beneficial for me. Thanks, Southeast, for the invitation to participate. By the way, the only way you can attend the Southeast ADTSEA meeting is to be a member of ADTSEA.<P>

Travel plans this spring include  Arizona, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Illinois, and Michigan to talk about graduated licensing, driver education/driver licensing, restructuring driver education, teacher training and certification, parent involvement in driver education, and the enhanced driver education program in Pennsylvania. All these topics have many common threads. The most significant is that of changing the way we do business.<P>

You need to be the leader in your community who directs this change in driver education. Be willing to accept change and provide improved opportunities for young people to drive safely. Convince those who teach with you that driver education is our profession. It provides us with a good job and income to support our families. Teachers need to support ADTSEA so we can make sure the future is bright for our members.<P>

<STRONG>BY Robert L. Sundermeier<BR>
ADTSEA President</STRONG><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unbelievable that Spring is just around the corner! Where does the time go? We are nearing completion and planning of our 40th ADTSEA Conference program thanks to the hard work and dedication of some special individuals. Your host outing, along with the many fun activities being planned for your stay here in western Colorado, has been finalized. We hope to meet your expectations for both the conference program and many activities.<P>
Special thanks go to Barbara Brody for the many hours of planning our conference program. She has put together one of the most informative and exciting programs to be offered to the ADTSEA membership in some time. Most areas of traffic safety have been included. You should have received a draft of the 40th Conference Program, so there is time for any suggestions you may care to make relative to our program planning.  <P>
To my spouse, Barbara, the other half of our conference hosts, a special thank you for a job well done in planning our Tuesday night outing and the many fun activities you can experience. For those of you who never visited this part of Colorado, it will be a once in a lifetime experience. Plan to arrive early and leave late in order to vacation and enjoy our beautiful state. <P>
My appreciation goes to Allen Robinson and the staff at IUP for their assistance and mailing the preconference information. Conference and workshop registrations, bylaw amendments, and voting ballots arrived for our membership in a timely fashion. Please take notice of deadline requirements for each planned activity. Make your reservations early, preferably by the June 1, 1996 deadline. Should you need assistance or have questions about the conference or planned activities, please write or call my wife, Barbara, or me.  <P>
An ambitious spring travel schedule is being planned. I will attend state and regional traffic safety meetings in Kansas, Texas, Utah, and Montana. My purpose is to promote new membership in those states and to personally invite all traffic safety educators to attend our 1996 ADTSEA Conference from August 3-8, 1996 in Colorado.  <P>
I strongly encourage our present ADTSEA members to renew their memberships early and get one new member to join. We all need to contribute in order to realize our goal of 200 new members this year. To quote our friends in the Northwest, &quot;Your ADTSEA membership proves your belief that traffic safety education needs a unified voice to speak at the national level. Your ADTSEA membership strengthens the national association of traffic safety professionals which in turn strengthens and complements our state and regional associations. Your ADTSEA membership entitles you to a subscription to <STRONG>The Chronicle,</STRONG> ADTSEA's journal which keeps you informed about new research, curriculum development, and coming events in the various state, regional, and national association programs.&quot;<P>

<H2><A NAME="impact">IMPACT Is Dead On</A></H2>
<STRONG>by Alisa Vald&eacute;s, Boston GLOBE Staff<P>

This video on the dangers of reckless driving won as Best Documentary at the New England Children's Film and Video Festival. The win generated national exposure for the issue of drinking and driving, including a full-length televised broadcast of IMPACT and discussion with Jason Murray--one of the student filmmakers--as well as a prominent story in the Boston Globe. Here are excerpts from that article.<P>

</STRONG><BLOCKQUOTE>MIDDLEBURY, Vt. -- Charles Smith's name is never mentioned in the documentary, IMPACT, but his ghost circles every word. &quot;As the medical crew was putting the C-collar on you they started suctioning your airway,&quot; says the ambulance driver. He looks right at the camera. &quot;There was nothing left of the driver's side door,&quot; says the state trooper, her eyes narrowing with the memory. &quot;You weren't breathing.&quot;<P>
&quot;I took your heart in my hand and I began squeezing,&quot; says the emergency room doctor. She is crying. <P>
Shortly after Smith's death in November 1989, his peers at a technical high school in Middlebury got together to make IMPACT, a film about auto safety and teenagers. Five car crashes involving young people from that high school took place that year. The teenagers asked everyone involved in Smith's accident--doctor, trooper, EMT, tow truck driver--to look right into the camera and explain to Smith how he died. <P>
Now, six years later, this 17-minute film made by hard-luck, working-class kids in rural Vermont has been voted the best documentary at the New England Children's Film and Video Festival. <P>
&quot;IMPACT was the one that stuck with kid judges the longest after they left,&quot; said Cheryl Hirshman, the coordinator of the festival. &quot;I think the format of having the viewer as the victim is very effective. For most of the kids who judged it, this was something none of them had really thought much about.&quot;<P>
Auto accidents are a common topic of discussion for high school students. There's a saying among them: &quot;Summer's here, three a year,&quot; pointing out how many teenagers are expected to get hurt, if not killed, in auto accidents. <P>
In IMPACT, the footage of people talking to Charles Smith is interspliced with footage of teenage boys talking about accidents they have been involved in themselves. <P>
According to Vermont State Trooper Melody Perkins, who has investigated more than 300 auto accidents in five years, including Charles Smith's, they usually involve males. &quot;I'm so tired of telling mothers their sons are dead,&quot; she said. <P>

<H2><A NAME="alcohol">The Influence of 
Legislation on the Driving</A><BR>
and Alcohol Consumption of College Students</H2><HR>
<p><STRONG>BY Robyn Hagler, Carolyn Miller, John Burling, and Cheri Smith</STRONG><BR>University of Montevallo<p><HR>
<p>
<strong>A number of factors impact drinking and driving. These factors include 
peer pressure, risk taking, knowledge, and legislation. This descriptive study 
utilized a questionnaire approach to sample 159 college students with regard to 
peer pressure, risk taking, knowledge, and legislation. The results support the 
efficacy of strengthened legislation and increased educational programs as 
deterrents to drinking and driving.</strong>
<P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Driving an automobile is a challenge that is accompanied by a 
variety of choices. The choices made by drivers can have a tremendous impact on 
the individual and society. One such choice is that of combining drinking and 
driving, a combination that can be deadly to everyone involved. Alcohol 
impairment is a major problem involving not only drivers, but also pedestrians 
and other roadway users. Approximately 500,000 persons per year are injured in 
alcohol-related crashes. On average, one person is injured every minute and one 
person is killed every twenty-three minutes in an alcohol related crash (MADD, 
1993). <p>
When these numbers are broken down there is some room for optimism. The 
proportion of fatally injured drivers of passenger vehicles with blood alcohol 
concentration of 0.10&#37; or more has declined by at least 5&#37; from 1985 to 1994 
(Fatality Facts: Alcohol, 1995). The factors responsible for this decline may 
also be the same factors that influence a driver's decision to combine drinking 
and driving knowledge, risk taking behaviors, peer pressure, and legislation.<p>
Although students know that alcohol-related automobile accidents are the 
leading cause of death among young people, they also indicate a need for an 
increase in  related information (Wechsler &amp; Isaac, 1993 and Mazon, 1987). 
At the same time, the effectiveness of education approaches such as designated 
drivers may seem to be small when evaluated in terms of reduction of accident 
rates (Eigen, 1991; DeJong &amp; Winsten, 1992; and Giller, 1985). The 
responsibility and liability involved in operating a motor vehicle should be 
stressed in any educational program (Valois, 1983).<p>
Balancing responsibility with the factors of risk-taking behavior and peer 
pressure is a challenge that confronts many young drivers. Giller (1985) states 
that most of the time students believe they make their own decisions and deny 
any pressure from peers. However, many students cite peer pressure as the 
reason for drinking more than they want to (Wechsler &amp; Isaac, 1993; Shore 
&amp; River, 1985 ; Mason, 1987; and Poteat &amp; Moltern, 1982). Combining 
peer pressure with an adolescent sense of immortality and invulnerability can 
result in risk-taking behaviors (Nicholson, Minqi and Mahoney, 1994; Giller, 
1985). High-risk drinking attitude and behavior is often developed and 
reinforced during the college years (Hunnicutt, Davis, Perry-Hunnicutt, and 
Newman, 1992).<p>
While peer pressure and risk-taking are important, it appears that major 
deterrents for drinking and driving among college-age youth involve legislation 
and education.<p>
Drinking alcohol during the college years continues to gain social acceptance, 
yet the trend toward drinking and then driving continues to decline. This 
paradox leaves many safety experts pleasantly surprised and puzzled. Much of 
the reduction in alcohol-related crashes is a result of prevention initiatives 
and stronger drunk driving legislation at the federal and state levels. Driving 
while intoxicated (DWI) laws have steadily grown in strength over the last two 
decades, thanks to the emergence of groups such as Mothers Against Drunk 
Drivers (MADD)  and Students Against Driving Drunk (SADD) (Nicholson, Wang, and 
Mahoney, 1994). Furthermore, a variety of legislative mandates, such as the 
recent Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989, have provided additional 
motivation for the increasing concern about the consumption of alcohol on 
college and university campuses (Gehring &amp; Geraci, 1989).<p>
In 1995, the U.S. Congress repealed the national speed limit, leaving highway 
speed decisions up to the individual states. Congress then followed suit by 
repealing mandatory helmet laws, also leaving that decision up to the 
individual states. However, the decision was made to leave mandatory safety 
belt laws in place. Congress has called for states to strengthen their driving 
under the influence (DUI) legislation. States failing to heed this mandate will 
lose  federal highway funds (Nicholson, Wang, and Mahoney, 1994).
<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Method</H3>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study focuses on the impact of peer pressure, risk-taking 
behaviors, knowledge, and legislative efforts have had on the drinking and 
driving habits of college-aged students.<p>
<strong>Subjects</strong>: The subjects in this study consisted of 159 college 
student volunteers enrolled in  core curriculum health classes in a public 
liberal arts university in the southeast. Of the 159, 60 were male and 99 
female. Eighty-eight  of the students were 18-20 years of age, which is below 
the national drinking age. There were 52  students aged 21-24 years and 19 were 
age 25 and over. Approximately 40&#37; of the sample population classified 
themselves as sophomores, 26&#37; as juniors, 25&#37; as seniors and 9&#37; as freshmen. Of 
those sampled 98&#37; reported to be licensed drivers.<p>
<strong>Survey:</strong> The measurement instrument was a 31 item questionnaire 
with responses on a nine-item scale ranging from never to very often.  Nine of 
the questions related to demographic information such as class status, license 
status, and drinking status. Of the remaining 22 questions, a number focused on 
the effect legislation has on the subject's decision to drink and then operate 
a motor vehicle. Questions relating to legislation included: <p>

<UL><LI>The prospect of spending up to one year in jail for a DUI conviction 
influences my decision not to operate a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol.
<LI>The prospect of being stopped by a police officer for DUI influences my 
decision not to operate a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol. 
</UL><P>
Several questions related to other factors including time, religion, peer 
pressure, knowledge, and risk-taking behavior. Examples of these questions 
included:

<UL><LI>I drink alcohol and drive even though I know it is unsafe.
<LI>My friends influence my decision to drink alcohol.</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Procedure: </STRONG>The subjects were given the questionnaire following 
a one-hour presentation on alcohol awareness and the most recent legislative 
changes in their state. Each of the subjects was asked to fill out the survey 
and was informed that the results would remain anonymous.<p>
<p></blockquote>
<H3>Results</H3>
<p><blockquote>
Sixty-three percent of the respondents reported that they 
drank on a routine basis, and 21&#37; stated that either they or a member of their 
family had been involved in an alcohol-related crash. Only 27&#37; had ever had any 
association with a group such as MADD or SADD. More than half of the students 
(52&#37;) reported alcoholism within their immediate family.<p>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents  reported  that they drank on a routine 
basis. Twenty percent of the females said they or a member of their family had 
ever been involved in an alcohol-related crash. Thirty percent reported to have 
been involved with an organization such as MADD or SADD. Ninety-six percent of 
the female respondents were licensed drivers. Sixty percent of the females 
surveyed were 18-20 years of age, which is below the legal drinking age in this 
state.<p>
The study included five items designed to measure risk-taking behavior related 
to alcohol. Thirty percent of the males admitted they operated a vehicle on a 
routine basis after consuming alcohol, while 19&#37; of the females reported to 
drive a vehicle after consuming alcohol. When asked if they would get in the 
car with a friend who had been drinking, 25&#37; of the males and 11&#37; of the 
females indicated they would take this risk. Assuming that it is unsafe to 
drink and then operate an automobile, 24&#37; of the males and 16&#37; of the females 
reported that they do so on a routine basis.<p>
The survey also looked at the role peer pressure plays in the decision to drink 
and drive.  Of those surveyed, 30&#37; of males and 19&#37; of the females indicated 
their friends influenced their decision to drink alcohol. Seventy-nine percent 
of the females indicated they would get into the car with a drinking driver 
because their friends do, while 77&#37; of the males would do so based on what 
their friends encourage. The survey showed 12&#37; of the female respondents would 
intervene to keep a friend from driving after drinking, while 22&#37; of the male 
respondents would intervene.<p>
Six items focused on the effect of legislation on a college student's decision 
to operate a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol.  Studies indicate that males 
continue to outnumber females two to one in alcohol-related collisions and 
three to one among subjects aged 16-25. <p>
Legislation appears to be a deterrent to the majority of both male and female 
students. A slightly higher percentage was recorded for females in every 
category. The fact that drinking and driving is illegal was a deterrent to 17&#37; 
of the female respondents and 30&#37; of the male respondents. This was the single 
item in which male respondents were closer to the desired response than the 
female respondents. This may indicate that female respondents were more 
responsive to the material penalties than the moral issues.<p>
The prospect of being stopped by a police officer for the suspicion of DUI was 
found to be a deterrent to 80&#37; of the female respondents and 76&#37; of the male 
respondents. The prospect of spending time in jail was a deterrent for 81&#37; of 
the females and 74&#37; of the males. Payment of a fine was reported as a deterrent 
by 79&#37; of the female respondents and 73&#37; of the male respondents. <p>
Two other areas of legislation surveyed were license suspension and license 
revocation.  All respondents reported a suspended and revoked license as a 
deterrent. Females reported 76&#37; and 78&#37; respectively, compared to 69&#37; and 72&#37; 
for the male respondents. Curfew enforcement did not serve as a significant 
deterrent to drinking and driving. Twenty-two percent of the female respondents 
and 24&#37; of the males reported that curfews serve as a deterrent to drinking.
<p>
</blockquote>
<H3>Discussion</h3><p>
<p>
<blockquote>Study results may indicate that some young drivers are prone 
to take alcohol-related risks when operating a motor vehicle. While the 
percentages were relatively low, many students did engage in risk-taking 
behavior involving alcohol use and driving. This has the potential to 
dramatically increase the risk of collision. The results may indicate that 
females remain less aggressive drivers. Female respondents are more likely to 
be affected by the material penalties when dealing with sanctions, fines, jail 
sentences, license suspension, or license revocation. Present data supports 
strengthening legislation to act as a deterrent to drinking and driving.<p>
The intention of a college-level alcohol education program is to inform 
students about the effects of alcohol and encourage responsible drinking. These 
programs should encompass prevention, identification, and the development of 
long-term support for alternative methods. Thirty percent of the female 
respondents have ever been involved with socially conscious groups or the 
designated driver program. Perhaps, improvement of accessibility to such 
programs could lower the percentage of drinking and driving among college 
students.<p>
The issue of deterring drinking and driving for college-age youth appears to 
focus on legislation and education. To separate the effect of education from 
the effects of legislation would be difficult. To obtain desired results, the 
elements of education and legislation should be applied to all aspects of this 
critical issue.<p>

<H2><A NAME="penn">Pennsylvania's Enhanced</A><BR>
Driver Education Curriculum Part II</H2>
<STRONG>BY Richard Hornfeck, Ph.D.</STRONG><BR>
Indiana University of Pennsylvania <P>

This is the second of three articles dealing with Pennsylvania's attempt to produce a lower-risk, entry-level driver into the highway transportation system. The first article in <STRONG>The Chronicle,</STRONG> Vol. 44 (1), discussed the development of the curriculum and the selection of the pilot and control schools. This article will discuss the implementation process, difficulties encountered, and the evaluation process.  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The driver education teacher was the key person in selecting the schools to implement the enhanced curriculum. We found that the respective administrators readily approved their school to participate in the study when the driver education teacher enthusiastically endorsed the four components of the enhanced curriculum (decision making, parent involvement, visual training, and night driving). A great deal of responsibility was placed on the teacher because of the following commitments.  <P>
<UL><LI>The teacher would be required to attend a one-week workshop, at which time he/she would be given the material and shown how to incorporate it into his/her current curriculum. <LI>
The teacher would revise his/her current curriculum to reflect the components of the enhanced curriculum. <LI>
 The teacher would develop a parental involvement plan. This would include activities such as the initial meeting with the parents, planned learning experiences, establishing lines of communication, etc. <LI>
 The teacher would schedule night driving experiences for the beginning driver. <LI>
 The teacher would be responsible for the completion of the survey instruments by both students and parents. <LI>
 The teacher would continue the curriculum for a minimum of three years. </UL>
Without the dedication and commitment of the driver education teacher, we would not have been able to implement the enhanced curriculum in selected high school programs throughout the state.<P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Difficulties Encountered</H3>
<blockquote>
The greatest difficulties encountered when implementing the enhanced curriculum involved the night driving experience. As mentioned in the first article, more schools would have participated had it not been for the night driving requirement. Even with the eighteen schools that were committed to teaching the enhanced curriculum, most of the difficulties encountered evolved around the night driving requirement. <P>
Initially, the teachers were asked to have two night driving experiences with each of their students. The idea was to first work with the student in an environment that placed fewer demands upon the student.  With the second experience, the student would face greater risk in relation to seeing hazards and controlling the car . The teacher would usually schedule two or three students for a block of time. With the two driving experiences, the student could get as much as sixty minutes of driving time and the same or greater observation time. Teachers encountered some problems with this when students failed to show for their scheduled times. This created a dilemma when only two students were scheduled and one was absent. Some teachers felt the best way to address the problem was to involve the parents in this phase of learning by having them ride along with the teacher. This activity enhanced the parent involvement and developed a greater awareness on the parent's part in relation to the risks associated with night driving and how to respond to these risks. <P>
Another problem related to night driving was the longer daylight hours during late spring, summer, and early fall. It does not start to become dark until 8:30 p.m., and this was shortening the available time in which to work with students at night. This meant that the teacher might be working as late as 10:00 p.m. in attempting to meet the night driving requirement. <P>
Another problem encountered with night driving involved those schools that had large student enrollments and only one teacher. Attempting to take each student out for two driving experiences with the limited time available created a major scheduling problem. <P>
To address these problems associated with the night driving experience, we recommended or investigated these solutions.<P>
<UL><LI>  The teacher should be the judge of whether or not the beginning driver needs more than one night driving experience. If the student demonstrates less than desirable skills, he/she should be schedule at least one more time. <LI>
  Parents need to assume a greater role in this part of the instruction. They need to be shown what the risks are, how to safely manage them, and how to plan a night driving route. Parents planned routes from simple environments to the more complex. The parents need to maintain a driving log for their beginning drivers and share it with the teacher.</UL><p>
It is important for the teacher to work with the beginning driver in this low-light environment that is extremely difficult for both the beginning and experienced driver. Even when the teacher is able to take a student out a total of two times in this high risk environment, the beginning driver still needs a great deal more supervised practice with a parent or guardian. Involving the parents in this phase of training would not only address the identified problems, but would also enhance the overall learning experiences for the beginning driver. <P>
Another difficulty encountered with the pilot schools is getting the parents/guardians to participate in the program. This participation begins with the initial meeting that the teacher plans with the parents. Attendance varies between the schools. It also varies in relation to the time of year. Planned meetings for the fall semester usually have a greater turnout than those for the spring semester. Only one of the pilot schools has achieved 100% attendance with the parents/guardians. That school requires the meeting if the novice driver is going to take the laboratory phase of driver education. A meeting time for a week night, an alternate time on Saturday, and an individual appointment is scheduled as needed. This is the only school that makes the initial meeting with the parents mandatory. All the other pilot schools arrange for meeting times, but do not make the meeting mandatory. <P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Program Evaluation</H3>
<blockquote>
As mentioned in the first article, there are eighteen pilot/treatment schools and eighteen control schools going into the third year of the study. All of the schools are state-approved programs. The only thing that is significantly different between the two groups is the enhanced curriculum. The four methods of evaluation occurring with this project are:<P>
<STRONG>State Driving Records.</STRONG> After a student has completed both the classroom and behind-the-wheel phases of driver education, the teacher enters the student's name and permit/license number on a roster and sends it to the State. The student should have a minimum of six months driving experience before the driving record is examined for moving violations and reportable accidents. Comparisons will be made between the pilot/treatment group and the control group. <P>
<STRONG>Self-Reporting Survey.</STRONG> To supplement the state records, an extensive self-reporting survey is administered to the students a minimum of six months after completion of both phases of the driver education program. The survey is referred to as Driver Education Survey II. Students remain completely anonymous when completing the survey and are only identifying their high school, grade, and gender. The self-reporting survey is a supplement to the state records because it is providing a great deal more information than would be available with only the state records. Van Fleet (1979) reported that self-reporting surveys have proven to be a valid means of evaluating the risk and exposure of a young driver.<P>
The five major categories of information being sought with the survey are:<P>
<STRONG>Demographics. </STRONG> General information pertaining to the new driver, including gender, grade, age when receiving a learner's permit, number of months on the learner's permit before being licensed, number of licensing attempts, and whose car is usually driven. <P>
<STRONG>Exposures. </STRONG>Type and amount of driving, including location where most of the driving occurs, types of highways or streets where majority of driving occurs, number of times they drive to school, who accompanies them most of the time, day and time when driving occurs, and safety belt usage. <P>
<STRONG>Violations.</STRONG> Violation information, including number of violations, accumulation of points, and types of violations. <P>
<STRONG>Collisions.</STRONG> Collision experience, including numbers of collisions, when they occurred, and types of collisions.<P>
<STRONG>Cause/Effect. </STRONG>Specifics of collisions experienced by drivers are requested.<P>
Overall, this survey instrument will provide a great deal of information on the beginning driver and will supplement the state records. <P>
<STRONG>Student Program Evaluation. </STRONG> This survey instrument is given to the students immediately after completion of both phases of the driver education program. The thirty questions enable measurement of the student perceptions of the driving task. We also request the student to evaluate the driver education program and driver education in general. The information is also shared with the respective high school program (treatment or control). <P>
<STRONG>Parent Program Evaluation. </STRONG> Once the high school students have completed both phases of the driver education program, they are asked to take a survey instrument home and have their parents complete the respective survey. As with the survey instrument completed by the students, parents are asked identical or similar questions. Examples of the questions are: difficulty, if any, the beginning driver had with certain driving tasks&#59; their evaluation of the driver education program&#59; and their evaluation of driver education in general. Once again, the information is shared with the respective high school (treatment or control). <P>
Data has been collected from both treatment and control schools, since the 1993-1994 school year. The number of schools in both groups has progressively grown since the first school year. In 1993-1994, seven treatment and nine control schools were selected to participate in the project. During 1994-1995, seven treatment and five control schools volunteered to participate, while four treatment and four control schools were added in 1995-1996. Presently, a total of 36 schools (18 treatment and 18 control) are providing data for the four evaluation areas. Initial data analysis is planned for the summer of 1996. Preliminary findings should be available in the fall of 1996 for a future <STRONG>Chronicle</STRONG> article. <P>

<H2><A NAME="vote">Exploring Highway Safety Responsibility</A><BR>
Through Values Voting</H2>
<STRONG>BY Martin J. Spellicy, Director </STRONG><BR>
Alabama Traffic Safety Center, University of Montevallo<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Too often our senses are exposed to motor vehicle tragedy. Radio, television, and newspaper accounts transmit glimpses of lives and families forever altered. Far too often the young seize these headlines, for novice drivers are overrepresented in highway crashes both on a per mile and per capita basis (Wilde, 1994). Wilde (1994) states this overrepresentation is a result of immaturity and experience. Passenger deaths account for 48% of all teenage passenger car occupant deaths, compared with 27% for those older (Williams and Wells, 1995). It behooves driver education instructors to present learning experiences within a low-risk milieu, allowing students to process personal values as they simultaneously assimilate highway safety content. Facilitation of learning experiences which foster student analytical decision making skills, within the current knowledge base of driver education, may better equip students to perceive and confront high risk situations, both as drivers and passengers. <P>
The media reports convey recurrent themes--16-year-old, late at night, weekend, peer pressure, recently licensed, limited experience, speed too fast for conditions, alcohol involvement, multiple passengers, and lack of occupant protection. Unless one is personally acquainted with the victims, the stories soon fade from the conscious memory&#173;only to resurface on subsequent days with different names. How state and federal legislative bodies fulfill their respective highway safety roles can add another causal factor to the youth road safety dialogue. All the while, teachable moments are being squandered. <P>
The following article presents two scenarios, easily incorporated into the curriculum, allowing for the group process to materialize. With the disproportionate losses youth bear as a direct consequence of irresponsible behavior in motor vehicles, the following lesson can nurture the process of shared group values toward individual, publicly acclaimed, self-protective behavior in motor vehicles. <P>
<STRONG>Topic. </STRONG> Responsible decision making related to highway safety issues. <P>
<STRONG>Lesson Objective. </STRONG>Student will interpret and analyze two highway crashes and determine a rank ordering of responsibility for characters in the scenario. Students summarize the influence of peer pressure and the multifaceted issues that can result from irresponsible motor vehicle operation and faulty decision making process. <P>
<STRONG>Assessment Criteria. </STRONG>Students demonstrate analysis in determining and defending rankings of characters in the scenarios. <P>
<STRONG>Activities and Strategies.</STRONG> This teaching activity can be geared either toward pickup truck occupant safety or seat belt safety, and can be presented as either one or two lessons. <P>
<STRONG>Resources and Materials.</STRONG> News stories, cast of characters, scale of characters, rank order of characters, and obituary assignment. <P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Teaching Activity One </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This activity is geared toward pickup truck safety.<P>
<STRONG>Teacher Instructions. </STRONG>Distribute news story and cast of characters sheets. Students read these items, then rank the cast of characters as to degree of responsibility for the outcome. <P>
Students then list the seven characters from most to least responsible. Students (as time allows) come to a small group and/or class consensus. Teacher participates in discussion by pointing out need for individual responsibility and the role peer pressure played in the tragic outcome.<P>

<STRONG>2 Killed, 5 Critically Injured In 11 PM Crash<BR>
</STRONG>(Middleton) Two Middleton 9th graders were killed last night when they were apparently ejected from a pickup truck bed onto the pavement of Highway 13 shortly after 11 pm. A pickup truck, driven by 16-year-old Jim Bond, collided with a sedan operated by 82-year-old Gus Padden. Bond had five occupants riding in the truck bed when the crash occurred. Two of the truck bed occupants were killed and the remaining three occupants riding in the bed of the Bond vehicle were critically injured. Pronounced dead at the scene from massive head injuries were Tom Hart and Conner Belden, ages 15 and 16, respectively. Hart and Belden were ejected from the bed of the Bond pickup and thrown onto the pavement. The drivers, Bond and Padden, were taken to Middleton General Hospital, where each was diagnosed with head trauma and spinal cord injuries. Bond's three additional truck bed passengers, George and Doris Black (brother and sister) aged 16, and Ann Shaw, 17, suffered broken bones and complained of back and neck pain. These three are currently undergoing medical tests at Middleton General. <P>
Police investigators state that Bond was travelling north on Highway 13 when Padden, travelling south, apparently drifted into the northbound lane resulting in the two vehicles colliding head on. Further investigation revealed neither Bond nor Padden were wearing safety belts at the time of the collision. Padden was ticketed for failure to wear prescriptive lenses and failure to maintain lane position. Investigation into the crash is continuing. A bill filed in the state legislature earlier this year that would have prohibited persons from riding in truck beds, along with additional highway safety countermeasures, died in committee.  <P>
Funeral arrangements for Tom Hart and Conner Belden are listed in the Obituary section on page 5. <P>

<STRONG>1 Killed, 2 Escape Injury in 11 PM Crash</STRONG><BR>

(Middleton) One Middleton 9th grader was killed last night when he was apparently ejected onto the pavement of Highway 13 shortly after 11 pm. The driver of the pickup truck, 16-year-old Jim Bond, collided with a 2 door sedan operated by 82-year-old Gus Padden. Bond was pronounced dead at the scene from massive head injuries. A passenger in the Bond vehicle, Meg Shine, was buckled up and reported no injury. Gus Padden, the operator of the sedan, was also buckled up at the time of the collision and was not injured. <P>
Police investigators stated Bond was travelling north on Highway 13 when Padden, who was travelling south, apparently drifted into his lane resulting in the two vehicles colliding head on. It is estimated that each vehicle was travelling within the 30 mph posted speed limit. Bond was ejected from his vehicle and sustained fatal injuries from collision with the he pavement. Padden was ticketed for failure to wear prescriptive lenses and for failure to maintain lane position. A bill filed in the state legislature earlier this year that would have added several provisional safeguards for young drivers died in committee. Investigation into this crash is continuing. <P>
Funeral arrangements for Jim Bond are listed in the Obituary section on page 5. <P>

<STRONG>Meg Shine (Bond friend).</STRONG> Reminded Jim to buckle up but didn't insist on it&#59; she buckled up and was not injured in the crash. <P>
<STRONG>State Legislature.</STRONG> Enacted safety belt law with secondary enforcement provision and a maximum $5.00 penalty.<P>
<STRONG>Local Police. </STRONG> In the five years the safety belt law has been on the books, the department has not issued a ticket for noncompliance&#59; observed Jim drive by not buckled up and did not stop the pickup.<P>
<STRONG>Gus Padden.</STRONG> 82-year-old driver whose license stipulated he was to wear glasses at all times of vehicle operation&#59; Padden was not wearing them at the time of the collision. Padden was buckled up at the time of the crash and was not injured. <P>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Driver education instructors need to present learning experiences within a low-risk milieu, allowing students to process personal values as they simultaneously assimilate highway safety content. Learning experiences which foster student analytical decision making skills, within the current knowledge base of driver education, may better equip students to perceive and confront high risk situations, both as drivers and passengers. Based on Wilde (1994) models, this technique may provide better student decision-making behavior.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>Beyond the horizon</H1>
<H3><I>By Allen Robinson, Ph.D.</I></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This summer has seen proof that our previous discussions have
led to completed products. Four different sets of materials will be available
to drastically improve your ability for implementing parent involvement
programs. The American Automobile Association (AAA), Allstate Insurance
Company, Champion Education, and General Motors have each completed materials
which support parent involvement in driver education. Each program differs
and complements the others. It is exciting to have so many good products
become available at the same time. <BR>
<BR>
We continue to be a society that expects simple solutions to our problems.
We expect our cars to protect us rather than take responsibility for ourselves.
We naively believe that laws are supposed to control others who do not know
how to take care of themselves. We believe that engineering should remove
all hazards associated with driving. <BR>
<BR>
The federal government, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and
most state agencies take the above approach to highway safety. Rather than
deal with the single most important element, the driver, they tie bells
and whistles on these quick and easy solutions. While these temporary solutions
do result in some progress, they also create additional problems. We continue
to have unacceptable accident, injury, and fatality rates in this country.
<BR>
<BR>
Recent efforts by major automobile safety stakeholders are beginning to
yield results. ADTSEA member participation at the National Summit in Crystal
City was greatly appreciated. Each of you made significant contributions
during the sessions, and I know that your efforts will be helpful in finalizing
a strategic plan that is beneficial to ADTSEA goals for driver education.<BR>
<BR>
Members do need to understand that organization development takes many forms
and appearances through its developmental phases. Initial indications and
insights did not support using ADTSEA as a parent agency for this new coalition.
Indications were that a separate agency may need to be developed to avoid
conflicts with goals and efforts of existing agencies. ADTSEA would benefit
from the formation of a separate or joint agency to improve youthful driver
performance. <BR>
<BR>
As ADTSEA CEO, my position on creating a new agency is being reconsidered.
Perhaps this foundling organization can grow within the support of ADTSEA
efforts and goals. During the next few weeks, I will be meeting and discussing
with several different groups concerning the concept of the Summit organizers
forming a coalition or partnership with ADTSEA to achieve the goals discussed
in Crystal City, Virginia. <BR>
<BR>
Decisions have not been made on how we can collectively support efforts
to improve youthful driver performance through education. The Summit was
fruitful in regard to encouraging efforts to move forward with the plans
and develop a strategic plan for implementation. As plans become more clear,
I will share them with the membership through The Chronicle, ADTSEA News
and Views, or a personal communique. This is an exciting time for developing
the opportunities that exist. Education has long been ignored as a component
of highway safety countermeasures. It is very encouraging to feel the support
and energy of major stakeholders supporting efforts to improve youthful
driver performance through education. ADTSEA support and contributions to
this effort are being noticed and are well received.<BR>
<BR>
I encourage everyone to support this effort as we go through the process
of determining how ADTSEA and this newly formed coalition can work together
to improve youthful driver performance. ADTSEA will be called upon to make
extra efforts to develop national education program goals and provide professional
certification recommendations. I encourage every member to lend support
as required during this formative period and wish to thank all who have
given of their time and efforts to this point. <BR>

<H1>Future ADTSEA activities</H1>
<H3>by C.E. Welch<BR>
President</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
It is an honor and privilege to serve as your president. Efforts to support
traffic safety initiatives throughout North America are beginning to take
shape. My plans include the development and maintenance of programs that
enhance membership growth and provide communication and tools to keep traffic
safety instructors on the cutting edge. <BR>
<BR>
We plan to increase membership by 200 through having a promotional membership
drive. ADTSEA needs to be visible at affiliated state and regional conferences
and at the National Safety Council. The board of directors, executive committee,
corporate community, and the ADTSEA CEO will strive to bring in four new
corporate memberships and develop an advisory council that will work with
states facing serious traffic safety education problems such as budget cuts.
<BR>
<BR>
ADTSEA will continue to restructure our organization to support the highest
level of quality and performance. The Standards Committee will continue
to work on establishing professional standards and performance outcomes
to be presented to the Board of Directors in 1996 and 1997. The Evaluations
and Goals Committee will define the duties and responsibilities of the executive
board and the board of directors more clearly by looking carefully at the
Constitution and Bylaws. They will present changes to the membership for
passage. <BR>
<BR>
ADTSEA will clarify the restructuring of driver education to assist states
in the implementation of the graduated licensing programs. ADTSEA will continue
to create partnerships to support driver and traffic safety education by
networking with other organizations, agencies, businesses, communities,
and institutions that promote traffic safety awareness. <BR>
<BR>
We will continue working to secure passage of the Congressional High Risk
Users Act while networking with those support organizations and associations
that represent individuals with special needs. Our goals are to continue
to work with national organizations such as National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) and the American Automobile Association (AAA) to
promote graduated driver licensing bills in all states. <BR>
<BR>
The ADTSEA Board will continue working to establish criteria and award a
National Driver Education Teacher of the Year. Plans include continuing
to expand the National Student Safety Program (NSSP) by finding and securing
a funding grant to offset the cost of the NSSP program with attempts to
maintain the registration cost for the conference at $200. ADTSEA will request
the NSSP Executive Board to revise the NSSP Constitution with the advice
of the NSSP liaison committee. <BR>

<H1>The Road from Dearborn to Crystal City</H1>
<H3>By <I>Terry L. Kline, Ed.D.</I></H3>
<H4><i>Texas A&amp;M University</i></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Major stakeholders in driver and traffic safety have recognized a need to improve youthful driver performance through educational efforts. Major insurance companies and automobile manufacturers are seeking ways to improve the educational practices for developing a graduated driver education program consistent with the current efforts for graduated licensing. <BR>
<BR>
State Farm Insurance and Ford Motor Company initiated efforts in Dearborn,
Michigan leading to a Summit on Youthful Driver Performance in Crystal City, Virginia (Planning Committee Report, 1996). The plans to develop a mechanism for improving youthful driver performance were unveiled to public, private, and governmental agencies. Strategic plans and funding efforts will be developed prior to January 1, 1997 which may include ADTSEA efforts to support graduated education programs to coincide with graduated licensing programs.<BR>
<BR>
The planning committee attendees received a supportive letter from Mr. Ron
Blue of State Farm Insurance. The contents of his letter appear throughout
this article. Ron explained that for the last several months, a small group
of concerned volunteers from many different sources have been working to
form a coalition to dramatically reduce the number of teenage traffic deaths.
Our approach has been to identify ways to significantly improve driver education, driver skills and driver experience under an organizational format that could be either a national coalition, a foundation, or both. As part of
that group, Ron would invite representatives to attend the National Summit
on Driver Education at the Crystal City Hyatt in Washington, DC on September 16 and 17, 1996. He encouraged attendees to continue their role as a member of the coalition for change in driver education and performance. <BR>
<BR>
Planning committee members are calling our effort A Coalition for Improved
Driver Education (CIDE), and Ron has accepted the challenge to serve as
interim chairman. Permanent leadership will be identified as quickly as
feasible. <BR>
<BR>
The coalition continues to attract the interest and attention of a growing
of important individuals who agree that our current systems for training
young people to drive are grossly inadequate. To a person, they agree that
we are on the right track in our efforts to promote national attention among
a group of leading problem solvers who will work in concert to change youthful driver behavior. Never have so many important people been so interested in a grass roots effort to create change in our system for driver education and training. By the same token, as realists, we are all aware of the tremendous effort that will be required and the commitment so many in our society will be asked to make. <BR>
<BR>
Interested coalition members agree, however, that the results and the goals
of our coalition, to reduce the number of teenage deaths by 1,000 or more
by the year 2000, are clearly worth the effort needed to address the issue.
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Defining the Need</H3>

Meeting participants defined and redefined the needs for a unified national
effort because it was believed that only by creating this need could hope
exist to achieve the enrollment needed to move this effort forward. Participants defined the following needs: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li> Define the customer(s) and create awareness and demand
for the programs we develop. <BR>
<Li>  Get youthful buy-in supported by society, customer, parent, peer,
passenger, etc. <BR>
<Li>  Define the content of a program or process that can work. <BR>
<Li>  Reinforce youthful or novice driver responsibility for safety, experience,
and consequence at an attitudinal, knowledge, skill, and behavioral levels.
<BR>
<Li>  Develop and promote a tough graduated license scheme (based upon
skill or age or both). <BR>
<Li>  Develop tougher programs that include consistent driver evaluation
and measurable outcomes. <BR>
<Li>  Define the role of the schools in implementing driver education programs
and do so within the context of other school (societal) needs. <BR>
<Li>  Provide a stronger leadership community for driver education and
for the programmatic efforts we are undertaking. <BR>
<Li>  Place accent on driver road skills and behind-the-wheel experience
in a wide range of conditions. <BR>
<Li>  Create partnership and alliance at all levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
The planning committee agreed that the improvement of youthful driver performance
and attitude can be accomplished through:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><Li>  Awareness<BR>
<Li>  Education<BR>
<Li>  Regulation<BR>
<Li>  Industry and Government <BR>
Partnerships<BR>
<Li>  Research </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Concept discussions were held in June at State Farm's Bloomington, Illinois
offices between representatives from auto manufacturers, glazing suppliers,
and State Farm personnel. It was concluded at these discussions that a joint
industry and government coalition effort, aimed at developing and deploying
improvements in driver education programs and curriculum, could be very
beneficial to society in general. It was also concluded that a focused planning
pre-meeting session made up of a few key and interested persons would be
a necessary step prior to hosting a larger group meeting with all interested
parties. It was thus decided to hold the pre-meeting planning session on
July 26 at Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan and to hold the larger
group meeting on September 16-17 in Washington D.C. The pre-meeting planning
session was used to establish an agenda and to develop a set of strawman
strategic goals at the September meeting in Washington D.C. The pre-meeting
planning session and the group meeting was facilitated by Dudley Davis,
Davis Consulting Group from Baltimore, MD. It was hoped that the meeting
will result in the following outcomes:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><Li>  A list of the invitees to the September 16-17 group meeting
in Washington D.C.<BR>
<Li>  Development of an agenda for the September 16-17 meeting in Washington
D.C. <BR>
<Li>  Determine the probability of success of a joint driver education
coalition effort. <BR>
<Li>  Identify the current initiatives and needs in the driver education
field (gap analysis). This task to be refined and completed at the September
meeting. <BR>
<Li> Development of major strawman strategic goals needed to direct a coalition effort. This task to be refined and completed at the September meeting.
<BR>
<Li> Agreement on individual roles prior to and during Washington meeting. </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Mission Statement</H3>

To significantly reduce the number of youthful driver crashes, injuries,
and fatalities as a result of the improved quality of education, awareness,
research, and regulation in North America through an alliance of powerful,
private, public, and nonprofit partnerships committed to increasing the
competence, experience, performance, and attitudes of teenage drivers. This
will be accomplished through an organization which will develop, promote,
and support a wide variety of initiatives and strategic partnerships. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Goals of a National Summit </H3>

The planning committee supported the following goals of a national summit:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>  To identify the need for an initiative for improved youthful
driver performance and attitudes in North America. <BR>
<Li>  To identify what has been happening in North America as a foundation
for the initiatives developed at the Summit. <BR>
<Li>  To identify the important research and to determine what future scientific
discovery will help in the development of youthful driver initiatives. <BR>
<Li>  To develop goals and tactics that could be used if an alliance is
developed that will underwrite, partner with, or otherwise create technology,
awareness, regulations, research, and strategic partnerships which will
significantly improve teenage driver performance and attitude. <BR>
<Li>  To consider an organization or strategic alliance that can serve
as a source for the certification or accreditation of materials, curricula,
methods, and equipment developed by others, and thereby promote teaching
and learning excellence in schools or wherever youthful driver performance
and attitudes are developed. <BR>
<Li>  To develop, recommend, and provide initial funding for a new initiative to achieve these goals. </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Traffic Safety Education Trends </H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>  The public's attitude toward driver education will decline
unless a national campaign is launched on the seriousness of the magnitude
of the motor vehicle crash problem for youth under 25. <BR>
<Li>  More states will be issuing provisional, probational, or restricted
licenses to teenagers. <BR>
<Li>  States will be imposing stiffer licensing penalties for teenagers
than on older drivers for drinking and driving violations. <BR>
<Li>  More states will be considering imposing night driving curfews for
newly licensed teenagers. <BR>
<Li>  Agencies responsible for road testing and driver licensing will eliminate
road testing and give the responsibility of evaluation to the local certified
driver education teacher. <Li>  Driver and traffic safety education programs
need to strive for a more relevant and measurable curriculum that is student
centered, has performance objectives, has criterion reference tests, and
has instructional materials that have been validated. <BR>
<Li>  Fewer universities will be producing driver education teachers. The
driver education teacher shortage is real. <BR>
<Li>  The most critical concern will be the lack of adequate teacher preparation
standards and certification.<BR>
<Li>  Driver education must, in theory, reflect current knowledge in the
fields of social psychology, mass communication, and organization change.
For example, when discussing drunk driving, use alcohol-impaired driving
because a person does not have to be drunk to be impaired. Do not use &quot;accidents,&quot;
use &quot;crashes&quot; since the term accident suggests the event could
not have been avoided. <BR>
<Li>  Higher standards need to be established by state licensing agencies
if driver education programs improve their effectiveness. <BR>
<Li>  Effective driver education programs will establish partnerships with
parents and businesses in the community to support teaching and learning
in area of driver and traffic safety education. <BR>
<Li>  Parents and good public relations are the key to maintaining a driver
and traffic safety education program. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>The Zone Control System Provides Blueprint for Risk Reduction Habits
</H1>
<H3><I>By Frederik R. Mottola</I></H3>
<H4><I>Professor, Southern Connecticut State University</I></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The curriculum for the Zone Control Driving System accomplishes
many of the concepts Carney (1996) suggests as necessary for risk reduction
behavior. Eugene Carney is strongly commended for his The Chronicle 44 (3)
article entitled, &quot;Driver Education Curriculum&shyp;A Critique and
A Proposal,&quot; in which he addresses several shortcomings of current
driver education curricula. <BR>
<BR>
If there is a value to offering a driver education program, as well there
should be, the major goal should be to help novice drivers acquire the capabilities
to reduce the risks associated with driving. We never drive without exposure
and risk. Most of the risk is manageable, and the consequences of taking
risky actions are very predictable. <BR>
<BR>
An effective driver education curriculum should serve as a blueprint that
can provide a teen with the precise steps necessary for the development
of safe, comfortable, low-risk, and convenient driving habits that will
last a lifetime. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Blueprint to Develop Habits </H3>

If, as educators, rather than teach teens to drive, we were asked to help
them build a house that would provide shelter, security, safety, comfort,
and convenience for the rest of their lives, we would want a design to show
what the finished product should look like. We would also need a detailed
blueprint to efficiently direct the construction. <BR>
<BR>
To build a house, we would need a solid footing to support the foundation.
The foundation must be structured to support the exterior walls of the house,
while the the walls must be able to support the roof of the house. Each
component must be constructed at the proper time and with a perspective
of how it fits into the total plan. It would be of little value to begin
building the walls before the foundation was built. To build a foundation
for a three room house, when our plan is to build a six room house, would
not allow us to achieve our goal. The blueprint would provide us with a
precise plan to guide the construction of the house and to have each stage
of the building process take place in a proper and timely sequence. <BR>
<BR>
Teaching a teen how to use a hammer to drive nails into a two-by-four and
how to use a saw to cut the two-by-four is not the same as teaching the
teen to build the house. Yet, for someone without a blueprint, the driving
of nails may seem the same as building a house. For some, the concept of
what a teen needs to learn to drive a car is focused only upon the immediate
task of &quot;safely&quot; maneuvering the car, with little concern for
what kind of habits are being built that will serve the individual for a
lifetime of driving. Our driver education programs must help students construct
a sturdy shelter of low-risk habits that will provide a lifetime of protection
from the incalculable number of ways that a crash can occur. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>The Zone Control System </H3>

During 1971-72, thousands of motor vehicle crashes were analyzed in an attempt
to discover which driver behavioral patterns were necessary to avoid crashes.
The results of my studies led to the formation of the Zone Control Driving
System. It has been used effectively for teaching novice as well as licensed
drivers risk avoidance behavioral patterns. The millions of ways that crashes
occur involve two common factors. Most crashes occur when there is a reduction
in the driver's line of sight (LOS) and/or a change to the driver's intended
path of travel (POT). Someone or something changes the control which the
driver has over his/her LOS-POT before driving into the deteriorated situation.
<p>
Our mind tells our eyes what to look for. To see effectively, drivers need
to know where to look and what to look for. With the Zone Control System,
instructors are able to teach drivers to look for situations that affect
their LOS-POT. Carney states, &quot;A common practice of treating each traffic
scene as an independent situation to be analyzed independently does not
provide the learner with the transferable guidelines which insure consistent
risk management performances.&quot; This is an important point Carney makes
and a significant reason why the Zone Control System is needed. Although
there are an astronomical number of ways to lose control while driving,
there are only a few principles a driver must learn and practice into habit
to minimize the risk. <BR>
<BR>
The Zone Control System is like having a picture of what our house should
look like when properly constructed. With a clear picture of what the educational
intervention should achieve, we can then formulate the blueprint to direct
the efficient use of our resources to that end. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Two Powerful Tools </H3>

A hammer and hand saw are no longer the most efficient and effective tools
to use for the construction of our house. If we learn how to use a few power
tools, we can build a larger and sturdier house in less time than it would
take with the use of the old hand tools. <BR>
<BR>
Two powerful tools we can use in the construction of our students' shelter
of low-risk habits are targeting and vehicle reference points. By using
the tool of targeting, the student is able to learn how to use searching
skill to gain a mental picture of the space the car is to occupy, which
aids in maintaining a safe path-of-travel. Targeting can give the driver
information more than 12-15 seconds ahead of the car. It can also increase
steering accuracy and help the student develop skid avoidance skills. <BR>
<BR>
The use of reference points allows the driver to get accurate information
as to how the car is positioned in relation to the roadway. Because the
driver's view of the road is blocked by the dashboard and by the hood of
the car, optical illusions make the car appear somewhere other than where
it is. With the use of reference points, the driver is able to see some
part of the vehicle as it relates to some part of the roadway, knowing exactly
where the vehicle is positioned. A driver gains many advantages from the
use of reference points. To list a few: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>The ability to gain consistent success by receiving accurate
feedback of where the vehicle is positioned on the roadway before performing
a turn and other maneuvers and knowing how to easily correct failures. <BR>
<BR>
<Li> Once the method of reference points is learned for one vehicle, the
techniques can be applied to any vehicle. There is rapid transfer of learning
to new situations. <BR>
<BR>
<Li> Even a novice driver can get into a larger vehicle than accustomed
to, such as a sport utility vehicle, van, truck, or motor home, and within
five minutes be comfortable and confident maneuvering it in tight spaces
and in traffic situations. <BR>
<br>

<I>Ed. Note: There will be detailed information on the use of reference
points in the next issue of The Chronicle.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Concurrent Classroom and In-Car </H3>
Carney states, &quot;...decision making guidelines mandate a concurrent
classroom and laboratory instruction program. A single component of risk
can be introduced in class and simultaneously pursued in any laboratory
setting, environment, or situation.&quot; Classroom activities must give
students an opportunity to learn and apply concepts that they will be expected
to perform during the next in-car session. <BR>
<BR>
For example, students learn how to use targeting in the classroom before
applying it to an in-car session. The classroom activities are able to give
the student physical, equivalent, mental, and/or rehearsal opportunities
to prove that they are able to use the &quot;tool.&quot; Once successful
usage is demonstrated in the classroom, then the student should apply that
same process during an in-car session as soon as possible. In-car practice
activities can take place while the student is in the backseat as well as
while driving. <BR>
<BR>
There are four stages of skill development for learning to use targeting.
The first stage is learning how to locate a target. A target is a stationary
object that appears in the center of where you intend to drive the car.
For example, if you look as far down the road as possible to the space that
you expect the car to occupy, you'll see some fixed object, such as part
of a house, a tree, a pole, a sign, a bush, etc. <BR>
<BR>
How to locate a target can be practiced in the classroom or the whole class
can be taken outside and practice selecting targets. It is a good learning
environment. Ten minutes can be spent in the parking lot performing physical, mental, and/or rehearsal of targeting skills by having the students
hold a cardboard pizza round (which can be obtained free from a vendor)
to simulate a steering wheel, while directing them to walk toward various
targets. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone has a good time. The students love it. And you, as the administrator
of the program, will save money. A class of 30 students uses 10 instructor
minutes to prepare all of the students with skills that would have taken
10 minutes for each student to accomplish in-car. That would have cost 300
instructor minutes, saving 290 minutes of valuable in-car instruction time,
benefiting all students. Imagine the savings if this same ratio is applied
to many of the other skills and behavioral patterns the students must learn.
It surely can improve the quality of in-car activities when the student
has already demonstrated some success at the expected performance. <BR>
<BR>
The second stage of targeting is for the student to learn how to evaluate
the target area. The target area is the driving environment to the left
and right of where the target is located. Searching the target area for
driving related information is more important than merely identifying a
target. <BR>
<BR>
The third stage of targeting is to evaluate the targeting path. The targeting
path is the actual space the car is expected to travel on the roadway, from
the present location point when the target is first visible to the destination
point in the target area. <BR>
<BR>
The fourth stage of targeting is to search from one target area to another
for LOS-POT changes. Now the students are ready to begin applying the principles
of Zone Control. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Introduction to Zone Control </H3>

Zones are either Open, Closed, or Changed. An Open Zone is when there is
space to operate without an LOS-POT restriction. A Closed Zone is a zone
not available as a POT and/or there is a restriction to the LOS. A Changed
Zone is a worsening zone condition. It is an open zone changed to a closed
LOS-POT or a zone that was already closed and has an additional change.
<BR>
<BR>
Examples of LOS-POT Zone Changes <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>A red traffic light is a closed front zone POT. <BR>
<Li>A hill crest is a closed front zone LOS. <BR>
<Li>A parked car to your right is a closed right zone LOS-POT. <BR>
<Li>A bicyclist to your right is a closed right zone POT. <BR>
<Li>Oncoming traffic is a closed left zone POT. <BR>
<Li>A truck following closely is a closed rear zone LOS-POT. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H3>First Step of Zone Control </H3>

The first step of Zone Control takes place upon seeing an LOS-POT zone change.
Carney states, &quot;Benign experiences such as...parked vehicles remaining
stationary...encourage drivers to erroneously assign little or no risk to
potential events having considerable risk.&quot; When a driver is taught
to &quot;be careful&amp;quot; because the parked car may pull in front,
or a door may pop open, or someone may be concealed by the parked car, and
none of these events occur, the driver develops an okay expectancy which
leads him/her to believe the danger is no longer there. Or to describe it
in another way, the driver feels comfortable. The internal value of risk
perception is void. There appears to be nothing wrong. <BR>
<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
With the Zone Control System, the parked car is a right-front zone change.
The right-front zone change requires the driver to check other zones to
determine options, then get the best selection of speed, lane position,
and communication. It doesn't matter if the car remains parked. It still
changes the right-front zone, which requires the driver to &quot;create&quot;
control over the situation. The actions required by the driver for the right-front
zone change caused by the parked car are exactly the same as what the driver
would need to do if any right-front zone change occurs, such as: a car backing
out of a driveway, a hitchhiker, an ice cream vendor, construction, a jogger,
a car stopped at an intersection, or a snow bank. <BR>
<BR>
Because the process is the same, and only the elements of the situation
change, we have many opportunities for conscious performance of the routine
to be practiced into habit. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Second Step of Zone Control </H3>

The second step of Zone Control begins after the driver's alert switch is
turned on by detecting a closed zone. Before taking an action, all necessary
information should be obtained by &quot;Checking The Other Zones.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
To make consistently low-risk decisions, a driver needs to gather all available
information in a timely manner. When a deteriorated zone condition is detected
at least 12-15 seconds ahead in the target area, there is ample time to
get complete information. <BR>
<BR>
Example: After seeing a closed front zone, a check of the rear zone should
take place each and every time before or as the foot goes onto the brake
pedal. Such conscious performance during the learning process will help
the driver develop a proper habitual searching pattern. At some time, perhaps
many years after the driver receives his/her license, the driver is confronted
with a quick and unexpected braking action while traveling at 60 mph on
a highway as traffic comes to a sudden stop. A timely, instinctive glance
in the rear view mirror can give the driver options to avoid a devastating
rear end crash. It would be unlikely that a driver education teacher would
ever experience that high risk situation during in-car performance. However,
there can be hundreds of opportunities to practice control of the rear zone,
beginning with checking the rear view mirror during routine stop situations.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Third Step of Zone Control </H3>

The third step of Zone Control takes place after all available information
has been processed. It results in the driver taking the appropriate actions
that will result in the best speed control, lane position, and communication.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Speed Control Options </H3>

After making an evaluation of the zone conditions, you have five options
for speed control. One of these five choices is the best option. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same Speed <BR>
Decelerate <BR>
Off Gas - Cover Brake <BR>
Off Gas - Apply Brake <BR>
Increase Speed </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
At any given moment one of the speed control options is best. Which is &quot;best&quot;
is determined by the principles of Zone Control. For example, one of the
principles states &quot;When the front zone is closed, adjust speed to arrive
into an open zone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Therefore, while approaching a red traffic light, our expectation of correct
performance goes beyond merely stopping for the red light. There is an opportunity
to put the three steps of Zone Control into action culminating with an effective
selection of speed control. <BR>
<BR>
When students take their foot off the accelerator, check the rear view mirror,
and begin applying the brake, positive feedback can be given to reinforce
correct behavior. When the foot stays on the accelerator too long, a cue
can be given to generate a correct response. Effective speed control is
achieved on a conscious level and can be applied in the same manner to numerous
other situations until correct habitual behavior occurs. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Lane Position Options </H3>
<IMG SRC="lanepos.gif" WIDTH="401" HEIGHT="104"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
There are five possible lane positions a driver can select from to gain
&quot;best&quot; lane positioning. Lane <B>position one</B> is in the center
of the lane. Lane <B>position two</B> is to the left edge of the lane. Lane
<B>position three</B> is to the right edge of the lane. Lane <B>positions
four and five</B> are straddle positions used for special situations. <BR>
<BR>
One of the principles of Zone Control for determining correct lane usage
says, &quot;Keep the most open space away from the worst problem.&quot;
While most travel lanes are twelve feet wide, cars are less than six feet
wide. When a driver moves away from a right front zone change by going into
lane position two, there becomes six feet of empty space. Such empty space
can give you more time to recognize when a vehicle is entering your intended
travel path, and it will give other drivers an escape path to minimize or
to avoid a crash. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Students Need to Learn How to Acquire Accurate Feedback </H3>

From the use of the Zone Control System and its principles, drivers are
able to acquire a feedback system to know when successful low-risk behavior
and wrongful higher-risk behavior occur. <BR>
<BR>
The major objective of the Zone Control System is to create control of all
six zones surrounding the vehicle. Drivers are taught not to enter closed
zones and to create adjustments in time and space to arrive into open zones.
They are expected to create improvements in speed and positioning to other
vehicles and to LOS restrictions to gain the best control. <BR>
<BR>
When a zone change is present, and the driver uses the Zone Control System
to create control, the standard for success is several steps removed from
a crash. For example, while approaching an intersection, a truck is stopped
in the left turn lane, resulting in an LOS restriction of the left-front
zone. The driver creates control over the LOS restriction by checking the
rear zone, evaluating lane choice and positioning within the lane, covering
the brake, selecting an appropriate speed choice, and searching to the left-front
of the stopped truck to evaluate POT conditions. <BR>
<BR>
The student can receive positive feedback for any or all of these action.
At first the feedback comes from the instruction, then positive self-feedback
can occur. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Go Beyond Defensive Driving: Be A Creative Driver! </H3>

The Zone Control System, quite simply, teaches drivers how to create control
of the driving environment they are operating in. To be in control means
applying the principles of Zone Control to situations when there is the
best opportunity to neutralize a zone change from becoming a high risk situation
that could result in a dramatic, and often traumatic, reaction. Zone Control
is a proactive system that teaches drivers to make small adjustments to
take control of a situation before the trap is sprung. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is time to stop teaching slogans such a &quot;drive defensively&quot;
and begin teaching drivers how to create control over a situation. When
a driver is in control of a situation, there are fewer surprises from others'
actions. That allows the elimination of stressful, if not dangerous situations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Science of Driving </H3>

There are cause and effect relationships that can give the driver predictable
feedback when a particular condition takes place. For example, when a driver
turns the steering wheel fully in a given direction, and a certain speed
is obtained, the turning radius of the vehicle will be consistent under
those same conditions. When speed is increased the turning radius of the
vehicle will increase. If a driver is approaching a small radius curve and
speed is not reduced, the car is going to use a large steering radius which
makes the car travel beyond the radius of the road. The results are very
predictable. The car goes off the road surface and crashes into the trees
bordering the road's edge. <BR>
<BR>
Carney stated, &quot;Speed selection is not an independent issue. It is
a complex accommodation of a variety of factors.&quot; There are many factors
which can compound the risk a driver is exposed to, and there are always
risk-generating factors not known to the driver. <BR>
<BR>
While approaching a small radius curve, some of the risk factors having
a scientific effect upon the steering radius of the vehicle are direction
of the curve, left or right; camber of the road surface, grade elevation,
up, down, or level; loose sand, water, ice, snow, dew on the road surface;
composition of the pavement; suspension system of the vehicle; tire pressure;
application of acceleration or braking forces; number of occupants in the
vehicle; seating location of occupants; weight of occupants; drive line
entry into the curve; apex positioning; an exiting point of the drive line.
<BR>
<BR>
The presence of any one of these risk factors can result in the car going
out of control when the driver is operating close to the edge of the traction
envelope. <BR>
<BR>
It would be beyond human capabilities to expect a driver to know all the
risk factors that may be working against him/her at any given moment. But
we can teach a system of habit formation that will give the driver an opportunity
to make a low-risk, timely response to compensate for the unknown and unknown
risk factors. <BR>
<BR>
Using the Zone Control System, a driver would identify the curve in the
target area as a front zone change. Check the other zones to see what options
are available for best lane positioning on the approach to the curve. Evaluate
tire/surface traction to aid in the selection of the &quot;best&quot; speed
control. Search into the curve for the condition of the POT before and during
entry. <BR>
<BR>
For each situation, whether it is a curve ahead, a red traffic light, a
parked car, a construction site, stopped traffic, or any of the other countless
different situations, the Zone Control process is the same. The student
need learn only a few principles and apply them over and over in a variety
of situations until it becomes an internalized value. Summary Most good
building contractors are not architects, but they are able to build a solid
structure when provided with a proper blueprint. Spending the past few years
traveling around the country sharing ideas with a great many driver educators,
I have found eager and highly motivated driver educators who welcome effective
curriculum materials. <BR>

<hr><p><h2><A NAME="aaam">AAAM PROPOSES SWEEPING CHANGES</A><br>IN THE 
CDL MEDICAL FITNESS PROGRAM</h2><p>
<blockquote>
The Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, in a report to the Federal Highway Administration, has made numerous recommendations regarding the medical fitness program for drivers engaged in interstate commerce. The recommendations include:<p>

<STRONG>REGULATORY CHANGES</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>The commercial driver medical certification process should be integrated with the 
licensing process at the state level.<p>
Part 391 and Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) 
should be merged, thus giving the states the responsibility for issuing CDLs in 
compliance with current national standards. Possession of a valid CDL should be 
prima facie evidence that a driver meets all the requirements for a CDL. The 
need for a separate medical certificate should be eliminated.<P>

<li>The license renewal cycle and the medical fitness examination period, currently 
biennial, should be harmonized.<P>

<li>Exemptions from the medical fitness requirements should be eliminated.<P>

<li>The definitions of what constitutes a &quot;commercial motor vehicle&quot; must be
 resolved.<p>

Part 391 of the FMCSRs applies to interstate operators of vehicles weighing more 
than 10,000 pounds; however, Part 383 (CDL) applies to drivers of vehicles 
weighing more than 26,000 pounds. There should be consistency in the weight 
threshold if the medical fitness requirements are incorporated into the licensing 
process.<P>

<li>The definition of an interstate driver should be revised to reflect the driving risk 
rather than the cargo lading.<p>

The relative risk of driving a large commercial vehicle, the on-the-job 
responsibilities of the driver, distances and time traveled, and overall driving 
environment should determine the level of functional capacity necessary to drive 
safely, rather than the type of cargo the driver carries or the way in which the 
vehicle he or she drives has been designated for purposes or commerce. There 
should be no fundamental difference between inter- and intrastate driving for 
safety purposes.</ol>

<STRONG>DRIVER LICENSE AGENCY</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>Driver examiners and medical review specialists should be trained to administer 
the fitness evaluation program.<P>

<li>A state-administered fitness certification program must ensure confidentiality.<p>

Medical reporting procedures and documents must be tamper-resistant. Drivers 
must be assured that their privacy regarding medical conditions is protected. 
Access to medical information within the driver licensing agency should be strictly 
controlled and the use of such information clearly defined so that drivers are fully 
informed of their rights and responsibilities in this regard.<P>

<li>State driver license agencies must have the authority to cancel CDLs if drivers do 
not meet current medical standards.<p>

Appropriate authority vested in the driver licensing agency is fundamental.</ol>

<STRONG>MEDICAL COMMUNITY</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>A national pool of medical examiners should be trained and certified to perform commercial driver physical examinations.<p>

At the present time, the quality of medical examiners varies enormously. A 
national system would establish standards of excellence to ensure more effective 
physical examiners would afford drivers the opportunity to have an examination 
anywhere in the country and would establish a system to monitor the quality of 
physical examinations.<P>

<li>Physicians who choose to report drivers with medically disqualifying conditions 
should have immunity from legal action.<P>

<li>A functioning Medical Advisory Board is a fundamental component of an effective 
commercial driver fitness certification program.<p>

The availability of a case by case review process would address some of the 
current issues raised in the Americans with Disabilities Act.</ol>

<STRONG>MOTOR CARRIER INDUSTRY</STRONG><p>

The support of the motor carrier industry is fundamental to a state-administered 
fitness certification process.<p>

Motor carriers must be assured that the issuance of a CDL means that a 
commercial driver is medically fit to drive.<p>

<STRONG>RESEARCH ISSUES</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>Current medical standards should be evaluated.<p>

There is no question that uniform national standards are needed for commercial 
drivers. States should have the right to set high standards for drivers they 
license. Criteria should be based on functional capability rather than be disease 
specific.<P>

<li>The relationship between current medical standards and crash risk should be 
investigated.</ol><P>

<blockquote>
<ul><li>The Bureau of Motor Vehicles in Ohio began issuance of a new plastic, credit card-type license that are specifically designed to be more secure and tamper-proof. The 
new licenses also have bar codes and magnetic stripes.<p>




<li>The Oregon legislature gave final approval and sent to the governor a bill that would 
allow school officials to suspend students' driver licenses for bringing weapons to 
school. Students' licenses could be suspended until they turn 21 years of age.<p>



 
 
<li>Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles offices are back open after a seven-day strike by the Oregon Public Employees Union. <p> 

The Union had sought a 6.5% pay raise to offset a ballot measure passed last fall that requires employees to pay 6% of their salaries into their pension funds. The state offered a 3% raise on 7/1/95 and 11/1/96. Later, the offer was increased by proposing more benefits.


<li>A bill moving through the Louisiana legislature will allow 14-year-olds to obtain driver permits and enroll in driver education courses.<p>




<li>Because of the Oklahoma City bombing, lawmakers who have introduced bills in New York and Pennsylvania legislatures want rental vehicles to have photographic identification of renters.<p>

The bills would require photographs to be taken of customers at the time a vehicle is rented. The New York bill only applies to truck rental while the Pennsylvania bill includes truck and passenger vehicle rental.<p>




<li>Roger David, who is legally blind as well as 55% deaf, surrendered his driver license after admitting that a Arkansas state employee helped him with test answers when he applied for and received his license.<p>




<li>This fall, Virginia will join 40 other states that use a different I.D. system on driver licenses other than social security numbers.<p>




<li>Newton, Massachusetts police raided the American Family Thrift Store and seized more than 200 applications for false driver licenses, as well as the computer and video imaging to make them. Police stated the equipment was used to reproduce driver licenses from all 50 states right down to holograms and driver license restrictions. <p>




<li>A bill passed by the Rhode Island house would add a one-year prison term to motorists convicted of drunk driving when a child is in the car. An additional term of up to ten years would be imposed if the child is injured or killed.<p>


 

<li>The Alabama legislature, under the leadership of Lt. Governor Don Siegelman, is working on drunk driving legislation that would lower the BAC level to .08% for drivers 21 and over, lower the BAC to .02% for under 21 drivers, set a .02% BAC level for drivers of school buses, day-care vans, and commuter buses as well as permit the seizure and sale upon the third conviction for drunk driving. <p>




<li>About 200 employees of New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles walked off their jobs to attend a protest against plans to privatize their offices. A judge has given approval to an injunction barring future job actions.<p>




<li>The look of Arizona's driver license is about to change for the better. <p> 

The Arizona Motor Vehicle Division unveiled a driver license that promises to be more convenient and useful than the one most motorists are carrying with them today. MVD will begin issuing the licenses through a pilot program that started in June in Glendale and Prescott. It will be available statewide on July 1.<p>

This card is made of more durable plastic and features an easy-to-read format. It has a colorful Arizona scene, an embedded driver photo, a hologram film coating, and a bar code/magnetic stripe. The license is produced on equipment that will allow people to leave most MVD offices with the license in hand, rather than waiting for it to come in the mail.<p>

The new design has many features intended to help cut down on fraud. The hologram film will reveal any attempt to tamper with information printed on the face of the card. That same printed information is duplicated in the bar code and magnetic stripe. Twenty-eight states currently issue driver licenses using bar codes and/or magnetic stripe technology as a means of reducing fraud.<p>

The cost of the driver license remains the same. People with a valid license may wait until the license expires or their first photo update to get the new license. For those wishing to get the new license before that time, the cost is $4.<p>

A new &quot;Under 21&quot; license will be issued. It features the driver's photo on the left side of the card and includes the date the cardholder turns 21.<p>




<li>Despite support from the American Association of Retired Persons, the Maine House of Representatives has rejected a bill that would have required drivers over the age of 40 to be vision tested every six years. Foes said teen drivers are more of a threat.</ul><P>

<STRONG>FHWA Proposes CDL Waiver for Fireworks Industry</STRONG><p>

The American Pyrotechnics Association (APA), a non-profit group representing the pyrotechnics industry, has petitioned the FHWA to reconsider its previous determinations and grant a CDL waiver to part-time drivers involved in fireworks displays.<p>

APA argues that the waiver is necessary because, since implementation of the CDL rule in 1992, the fireworks industry has faced serious problems in delivering small fireworks displays to customers located in remote areas. In order to respond to thousands of requests by Fourth of July celebrants, such as small townships, the companies must rely on part-time drivers who not only drive to the display sites, but also handle and discharge the fireworks. The FHWA is requesting public comments on a petition submitted by the pyrotechnics industry on March 6, 1995, for relief from the requirements of the commercial driver license regulations (CDL) 49 CFR Part 383. The FHWA is proposing to authorize waivers for certain drivers transporting fireworks to displays during the period of Independence Day celebrations from the CDL testing and licensing standards The drivers to be covered by these waivers are part-time drivers who have an otherwise valid driver license, as well as licenses or permits issued by applicable state or local agencies certifying that they are approved pyrotechnic operators. A waiver issued by a state under this proposal would only authorize the transportation of less than 500 pounds of fireworks classified as DOT Class 1.3G explosives, from June 30 through July 6 of each year, 
provided that the vehicles operated have gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) of less than 
10,001 pounds and are operated within 300 miles of the sites of origin. The FHWA requests public comments on whether, if granted, the proposed grant of waiver authority would be contrary to the public interest or diminish the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.<p>

 
Comments to the docket were due June 9, 1995.<p>



<STRONG>NTSB Critical of Texas's CDL Issuance Program</STRONG><p>
 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in a report regarding an August 8, 1994, crash on Interstate 30 near Hanks, Texas, was quite critical of the State of Texas.<p>



The commercial truck driver and his passenger were killed after the driver fell asleep and ran into a bridge column. An autopsy of the driver showed marijuana residual and other drugs in his bloodstream and was slightly below the limit for legal intoxication.<p>



NTSB board chair, Jim Hall, states, &quot;Somebody was asleep at the switch there, weren't they?&quot; <p>


Hall was referring to the fact that the truck driver had three DWI convictions as well as an 
extensive criminal record that included sale of amphetamines and unlawful distribution of a controlled substance, Vice Chairman, Robert T. Francos II added, &quot;Two people are asleep at the switch, one is the licensing authority, the other is the employer.&quot;<p>



The Texas Department of Public Safety stated that nothing on the driver's record would have disqualified him from being issued a CDL under Texas law.<p>

He claims that this new and unique book by the premier traffic ticket attorney in America 
instructs drivers with strategies, options, and procedures to fight and win your traffic tickets. He adds that &quot;remember you can't outrun the radar, but you sure can beat it.&quot;<p>



<STRONG>Motorcycle Fatal Crash Study</STRONG><p>



A motorcycle fatal crash study completed by the Michigan Department of State reveals that almost half of all motorcycle operators involved in fatal crashes did not have a motorcycle endorsement. The study profiles the motorcyclist involved in a crash as 31 years old, male, riding alone, and not likely to posses a motorcycle endorsement. In addition, a large sub-population of motorcyclists killed during the five years of study were hard-core scofflaw drivers meaning no motorcycle endorsement, license suspended at the time of the crash, multiple previous crashes, suspensions, and convictions.<p>



A copy of the study is available by writing the Office of Traffic Safety, Michigan Department of State, 208 N. Capitol Avenue, Lansing, MI 48918.<p>

<blockquote>

<STRONG>Is Administrative License Revocation <br>Constitutional?</STRONG><p>



<ul><li>A Fremont County Colorado judge has ruled that the state ALR drunken driving law violates the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Judge Walter Fox ordered that drunken driving charges against Paul Gallardo be dismissed because a second prosecution would have violated the 5th and 14th amendments. Fox noted that the United States Supreme Court, in several decisions, has ruled that &quot;jeopardy attaches at a beginning of a civil proceeding to bar a subsequent criminal prosecution in which a defendant may be punished for the same conduct.&quot;<p>
Courts in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington have dismissed charges for the same reason.<p>





<li>A Virginia judge has given Virginia police the go ahead to resume suspending the driver license of motorists arrested for drunk driving. Judge William Broadhurst wrote that suspending the license of a DUI suspect before his or her trial does not amount to double jeopardy because the suspension and subsequent DUI prosecution are part of the same proceeding. It is expected that a definition ruling won't come until months from now by the Virginia Supreme Court.<p>



<li>Prosecutors in Minnesota in arguments before the State Court of Appeals, say the decision to suspend licenses at the time of arrest is remedial and is done not to punish but to protect the public. The Minnesota Court of Appeals is expected to rule by September, 1995 on what is punishment and what is public protection.<p>



<li>The Nebraska Court of Appeals has ruled that when a prosecutor dismisses a drunken driving case, the Department of Motor Vehicles cannot refuse to reinstate the license of the driver. This ruling comes after a previous ruling rejecting arguments that Nebraska's ALR law constitutes double jeopardy.<p>



<li>Ohio Court of Appeals for the Third Appellate District becomes the most recent state appellate court to reject the double jeopardy defense raised by a DWI defendant. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied upon language from prior Ohio and other state appellate court decisions in holding that &quot;an administrative license suspension is remedial in nature and does not constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause.&quot;</ul><p>


 
<STRONG>Illegal Immigrants Not Eligible <br>for CA Driver Licenses</STRONG><p>


 
A California state appeals court has ruled that illegal immigrants are ineligible for California driver licenses. Opponents argued that licenses could be renewed despite a separate 1994 law that bars &quot;original&quot; licenses to illegal immigrants. But the court said a 1992 state law requires all applicants to give their Social Security numbers. &quot;Persons whose presence in the United States is not authorized by law are not entitled to such documents,&quot; the court said. The case is unrelated to Proposition 187, which would deny many state services to people illegally in the country.<p>



<STRONG>WI Appeals Court Upholds Driver License<br>Suspension for Drug Possession</STRONG><p>



The 2nd Wisconsin District Court of Appeals has upheld the constitutionality of a Wisconsin law requiring the suspension of a driver's license for possessing drugs. The Court said the law is constitutional as it promotes a proper public purpose, such as deterring drug crimes.<p>




<STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Rule<br>
on Property Seizure</STRONG><p>


 
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to rule on a Michigan property seizure case that could have an effect on repeat offenders and DUIL impoundment laws.<p>



The Michigan case involved a woman who was a joint owner of an automobile which was 
confiscated because of her husband's using the automobile in conjunction with illegal sex.<p>



<STRONG>New York State's Court of Appeals<br>
Rules Out Scarlet Letter</STRONG><p>



New York State's Court of Appeals has ruled that a Nassau County Court judge lacked the 
authority to require a six-time drunk driving offender to stick a fluorescent sign on the license plates of his car reading &quot;convicted DWI.&quot;<p>



The court stated, &quot;A sentencing court cannot impose forms of punishment not authorized by statute for a particular crime.&quot;<p>

<H2>EXCERPTS FROM &quot;TARGET RISK&quot;</H2><P>

<HR>

<H3>Why this book? Implications for public policy</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;This book has been written in an effort to explain why traditional interventions are not effective and why some innovative ones are. Wider realization that the traditional ways do not work may stimulate willingness to innovate. Wider awareness of the effectiveness of alternative approaches to health and safety may increase willingness to debate the merits of limited or even society-wide implementation of expectationist measures against lifestyle-dependent death and disease, as well as against violence and abuse of the environment.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>
<h3>An important reading decision</h3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Human beings can never be totally sure of the outcome of their decisions. Ergo, all decisions are risky decisions. You have already taken a risky decision by opening this book and reading the first few lines, and having done so, you are now facing another: to read on or to put it back on the shelf.<p>
And what do I do as the author of this book? It goes without saying that I would like you to read all of it, just as I wrote all of it. If you choose to read on, there is a chance, however slight, that you may afterwards feel that you could have put your time to better use. <p>If, right now, you put it back on the shelf, you may later be nagged by the feeling that you missed out on an opportunity to learn something of importance to your own life expectancy, to that of your loved ones or to people in general. So, which of the two risky decisions do you take?&quot;<p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Risk Homeostasis Theory</h3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Risk Homeostasis Theory maintains that, in any activity, people accept a certain level of subjectively estimated risk to their health, safety, and other things they value, in exchange for the benefits they hope to receive from that activity (transportation, work, eating, drinking, drug use, recreation, romance, sports or whatever).&quot;<p>

</blockquote>
<h3>How we spend our dollars...</h3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Specifically, it is argued that the traditional reliance on enforcement of laws, on informing the public of certain dangers, and on engineering the physical features of the human-made environment is not very productive towards greater health and safety insofar as these are dependent on human conduct. An effort is made to explain why this is so.&quot;<p>

</blockquote>
<H3>The famous Munich taxicab study</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Part of a taxi fleet in Munich was equipped with an anti-lock brake system -- also known as ABS. This type of brake system prevents the wheels from locking up under extreme braking conditions. It offers the advantage of improved steering control over the vehicle during rapid deceleration, especially on slippery road surfaces. The system makes it possible to change the direction of the car and abruptly reduce speed at the same time, at a considerably reduced risk of losing control. <p>ABS brakes offer a perfect example of what was called a change in intrinsic risk towards the end of Section 3.4 -- a change in the objective accident loss expected if drivers don't change their behaviour when a 'safer vehicle' is made available. However, according to risk homeostasis theory, drivers are expected to change their behaviour and to maintain their accident likelihood per hour of driving as long as the target level of risk is not altered.&quot;<p>

...&quot;The drivers were not aware that their driver behaviour was being observed and the observers did not know whether they were in a taxi with ABS or without. The drivers did, of course, know whether or not they were operating an ABS cab, because of their familiarity with the car they were driving. <p>
Subsequent analysis of the rating scales showed that drivers of cabs with ABS made sharper turns in curves, were less accurate in their lane-holding behaviour, proceeded at a shorter forward sight distance, made more poorly adjusted merging manoeuvres and created more 'traffic conflicts'.&quot; <p>

...&quot;The Munich taxicab experiment attracted a great deal of attention, not only in the professional circles, but also in the popular press. Newspapers carried articles about it and Bavarian Television wanted to show the viewers what had happened. As the experiment had already been completed, they decided to re-enact the experimental manipulation and the way the drivers had responded.&quot;...<p>
</blockquote>

<H3>On traffic lights and accidents at intersections</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Traffic lights are not to be condemned, but -- contrary to naive opinion among some professionals and the general public -- they serve no safety purpose, not even in the intersections proper or in their immediate vicinity. Numerous studies on the effect of traffic lights on accidents have compared the numbers of accidents at intersections before and after installation. <p>The effect is that fewer right-angle accidents happen, but more rear-end accidents, as well as left-turn and side-swipe collisions, occur, and the total frequency remains roughly the same. The latter is also true for the average severity of intersection accidents. Although driver actions are drastically altered by these devices, accident loss is not, and the risk remains the same.&quot;<p>

</blockquote>
<H3>Differences between individuals...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Even if there were such a thing as a general risk-taking trait, there is a further reason for the weakness of association between a personality trait such as this, or any other personality trait, and accidents. This is because the tendency to have accidents is not a stable human characteristic.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>
<H3>Differences between  situations...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is evident that risk taking is not a personality trait that is consistent from one situation to another. Similarly, the tendency to have accidents is not consistent from one time period to another. To believe otherwise may well be an example of the 'fundamental attribution error'. This expression is used by social psychologists to refer to the fact that people typically attribute another person's behaviour to that person's lasting character and not often enough to that person's passing state or the prevailing environmental condition.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>

<H3>Do &quot;accidents&quot; just happen or can we control them?...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;Some studies may actually lead to overestimation of the relationship between personality and what little stability there is in accident involvement. This can happen when current scores on personality tests are investigated on their association with past accident record. Take the case of 'external locus of control'. This term refers to persons who attribute the occurrence of important events, such as accidents, to external factors, rather than to their own doing. <p>The latter is called internal locus of control. When applied to driving, external locus of control is measured in terms of the respondents' agreement with statements like: 'driving with no accidents is merely a matter of luck' and 'most accidents happen because of bad roads, lack of appropriate signs, and so on'. Internals typically endorse statements such as 'accidents happen because drivers have not learned to drive carefully enough'.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>

<H3>Managing risk...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;...If a person's decision-making or vehicle-handling skills are poor, that person's level of perceived risk should be high, and if it is not, this reflects overconfidence in one's skills. The same holds for sensory abilities. To be colour-blind or hard of hearing does not imply a significant increase in accident liability, provided the driver considers these handicaps in the estimation of risk. <p>Poor night vision will not increase a person's accident risk unless the person is unaware of it or is willing to accept high levels of accident risk. Deficiencies in skills and sensory functioning, other things being equal, can increase a person's accident likelihood only to the extent that these deficiencies are being underestimated by the person in question, and thus lead to an inappropriately low level of perceived risk.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>

<H3>Does cautious mean safe?...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;...Mrs. Cautious Driver presents an interesting paradox. She was very careful indeed, in fact, so careful that her behaviour was rather unpredictable to other drivers. This made her liable to having accidents. On the other hand, if everybody were to behave as cautiously as she, there would be fewer crashes.&quot;<p>

</blockquote>
<H3>An unpredictable result of enforcement...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;...In what is known as the 'Chicago Crackdown' on drunk driving, judges in that city agreed to impose a seven-day jail sentence on all persons deemed guilty of the offence, but in a period of six months, only 6&#37; of over 6,000 drivers arrested for driving under the influence had actually received such a sentence. In New York State it was found that about 27&#37; of all individuals arrested for violations including driving under the influence were never prosecuted.<p> 
It would seem that a law cannot be enforced if its strictness exceeds popular opinion about the immorality or deviancy of the act concerned. The approach that takes the form of punishing people for specific unsafe acts suffers from several other problems as well, some of which have been identified in the context of organizational psychology.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>

<H3>Incentives can be effective but...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;...It should be noted, however, that the attitude-shaping effect of modest awards can only take place after the operators have changed their behaviour for some minor external inducement. So, the award should be big enough to achieve some behaviour change to begin with. In some cases, a small material reward might imply a major social reward because of its symbolic function. Safe behaviour may thus become 'the right thing to do'. This might help explain why a modest incentive such as free licence renewal for one year produced a major reduction in the accident rate of California drivers.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>
<H3>Speed limits...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;...We will return to this issue in the next chapter, but it's worth noting that enforcement of speed limits may merely have the effect of 'accident migration'. A German study reports a 21&#37; reduction on an expressway following the introduction of a speed limit where no limit had existed. A stretch of expressway running parallel to the one with the new speed limit experienced a 29&#37; increase in accidents, apparently as the result of the fact that drivers who did not want to forgo speedy progress simply took an alternative route.&quot;<p>
</blockquote>

<H3>Another perspective on policy...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;...Suppose we are dealing with a government that is fully aware of the tremendous costs of traffic accidents to its jurisdiction. Suppose, too, that we are dealing with a government that wishes to play a leadership role in reducing the traffic accident rate per head of population, rather than to remain a mere follower of existing public attitude and conduct. <p>In that case, the answer to what a government could do in order to reduce the traffic accident rate is very simple: (a) assume public responsibility for automobile insurance, and (b) impose insurance fees that take account of each individual driver's past accident record and of the requirements for effective incentive programming described above. <p>In doing so, a government would be able to achieve two things: it would pull itself up by its own bootstraps in becoming more concerned about safety promotion than before, and it would enhance the general public's desire for safety and strengthen public support for government action toward that goal.&quot;<p>

</blockquote>



<H3>&quot;Expectationism&quot; -- a new kind of strategy...</H3>
<blockquote>
&quot;In connection with incentives for safe performance, it is of interest to note that they may be viewed as just one example of a wider class of interventions that hold the promise of reducing much more than the fatal accident rate per capita. They also hold promise for reducing lifestyle-dependent disease and death rates, as well as diminishing the level of violence in society.&quot;<p>

&quot;... Expectationism is the name of the preventative strategy for reducing the accident rate and lifestyle-dependent disease and death rate per head of population by enhancing people's perceived value of the future.  It comes in two varieties, and these may be called 'specific' and 'general'.&quot;<p>

<H3>RISK-TAKING, HEALTH AND SAFETY</H3><P>

<blockquote>

In 1977, the Canadian province of British Columbia undertook a massive campaign against drunk driving. There was no change in the law, but there was highly intensified enforcement by police. <P>
The campaign was given huge publicity and very conspicuous mobile Blood Alcohol Testing units (&quot;BATmobiles&quot;) were a prominent feature of the BC driving scene during that year. To give an idea of the scope -- the number of times drivers were stopped was equivalent to 30&#37; of the total number of vehicles registered by the province's 2.5 million inhabitants. <P>
The program reduced drinking and driving fatalities by an estimated 18&#37;. But in a peculiar twist, overall traffic deaths during the same period were up 19&#37;. <P>
This kind of result isn't at all surprising to Professor Gerald Wilde, a Canadian psychologist specializing in risk-taking behavior and transportation safety. <P>
Wilde argues that safety campaigns tend to move accidents around rather than reduce them because traditional approaches do not motivate individuals to change their &quot;target level&quot; of risk, the amount of risk they are willing to accept in their everyday lives. <P>
People have a sort of built-in danger thermostat, he says, a subconsious sense of ambient risk. Make things safer in one aspect of their lives, and they will tend to use up this safety benefit by adapting their behaviour to the new reality and increasing risk-taking in another. He calls the theory Risk Homeostasis. <P>
It's a theory that has been hotly debated in academic circles for almost two decades now. It's been described as &quot;the devil's idea to some in the safety community&quot; because it constitutes a frontal attack on the premises underlying current government and industry policies aimed at reducing losses from accidental deaths and injuries. <P>
It challenges the &quot;technological fixes&quot; offered by engineering greater safety in the vehicle and the environment, and shifts the focus to the behaviour of the driver.<P>
Recent revelations about the effects of automobile antilock braking systems (ABS) on crash rates lend weight to Professor Wilde's theory. The systems work. They help prevent skidding and offer drivers better control in emergencies. But evidence shows that drivers with ABS-equipped vehicles tend to drive faster and rely more on their brakes than drivers who don't have the devices. According to the U.S. Highway Loss Data Institute the systems have not reduced either the frequency or the cost of crashes.<P>
The Dutch-born Wilde began to shape his theory during the early '70s when, as a young researcher working at the National Institute of Road Safety in France, he came across some work by a British psychologist named Taylor. <P>
Taylor had recorded drivers' reactions to road and traffic situations by measuring Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR), changes in the electrical conductance of skin caused by microscopic changes in sweating. Taylor related these measurements to three important variables: the accident history of different sections of roadway as recorded in police accident reports; the levels of GSR experienced by the drivers as they drove over the roadway; and drivers' speeds. <P>
The results fascinated Wilde. They showed that drivers reacted subconsciously to road hazards such as traffic lights, curves and oncoming vehicles, and their reactions related well to the accident history of different road sections. <P>
Over a road section with many hazards drivers showed higher GSR ratings, but over any given period of time the GSR levels were remarkably constant. In other words, if there were lots of hazards, drivers slowed down. They changed their behavior to keep the risk they experienced at a fairly constant level. <P>
In the years since he was inspired by this phenomenon, Wilde has gathered data, refined his theory and marshalled his arguments. Now, as a highly respected and internationally known authority on risk-taking behavior, he has thrown down the gauntlet to the safety and health communities by publishing a book titled <STRONG>Target Risk</STRONG>. <P>
In addition to presenting his theory, with all its supporting concepts and data, the book proposes a radical shift in approaches to promoting health and safety. As an alternative to the traditional strategies of Engineering, Enforcement and Education -- the three E's of safety policy -- Wilde proposes a strategy of &quot;Expectationism.&quot;<P>
Safety comes from within, Professor Wilde believes. Only by improving people's expectations of the future can we change their level of risk acceptance. For example a study of Quebec motorists found that individuals who valued the future highly had fewer driving demerit points, fewer accidents, and better attitudes towards safety. Another study showed that American students with a strong future orientation were less likely to smoke or smoked less.<P>
In driving, the success of incentive programs for safe drivers bolsters the expectationist idea. When a German trucking company offered its drivers a $170 bonus for every six months without accident, its accident rate dropped by 86&#37;. The incentives don't have to be large and in fact, Wilde argues, it's probably better if they aren't. An American mining company gave its workers stamps they could exchange for merchandise as a reward for safe performance. Its accident rate dropped by 98&#37;.<P>
&quot;It's a carrot and stick approach,&quot; Wilde says. &quot;Reward people for good behavior and punish them for bad.&quot; But punishment must not be relied on too heavily -- especially severe punishment. &quot;A law cannot be enforced,&quot; he says, &quot;if its strictness exceeds popular opinion about the immorality or deviancy of the act.&quot; <P>
On the other hand, high expectations for the future can have a powerful effect on health and safety behavior. At the heart of Professor Wilde's blueprint for the future is his advice to governments to shift some of the massive expenditures now allocated to enforcement and engineering into schemes that enhance people's perception of their future and encourage them to want to be safer, healthier and happier.<P>

<H3>WHAT OTHERS SAY<BR>
ABOUT RISK HOMEOSTASIS</H3><P>
<blockquote>
&quot;The best-known model -- but also the most controversial -- is Wilde's 'homeostasis of risk', in which risk perception and risk utility are integrated in a single cybernetic conceptualization.&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Jean-Pascal Assailly, National Transportation Research Institute, France</b><p><p>
</blockquote>

&quot;...the ideas suggested by Wilde have important implications for anyone who must manage risks.&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Gordon F. Pitz, Professor of Psychology, <BR>Southern Illinois University</b><p><p>
</blockquote>
&quot;The risk homeostatic approach, the devil's idea to some in the safety community.&quot;<p>

&quot;Human behaviour is the dominant force in the risk homeostatic approach. Technological changes will be completely offset by user response unless the target level of risk is changed.&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Glenn C. Blomquist, Professor of Economics and Public Administration, University of Kentucky.</b><p><p>
</blockquote>
&quot;...(Wilde) is probably the most prolific researcher and writer in the area of danger compensation or risk-offsetting behavior...&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>E. Scott Geller, Professor of Psychology, <BR>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.</b><p><p>
</blockquote>

&quot;Wilde's diligent, eclectic search for empirical data to support his theory of risk homeostasis is exemplary. His efforts have served as a focal point of debate and have led others into theory-based discussion relevant to driver behaviour...&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Alan C. Donaldson, Senior Research Scientist, <br>
Traffic Injury Research Foundation of Canada.</b><p><p>
</blockquote>

&quot;...there are no epicycles and there is no phlogiston ... similarly, there is no risk homeostasis.&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Leonard Evans, General Motors, Detroit</b><p><p>
</blockquote>
&quot;...Gerald Wilde, the man with the original idea.&quot;<p>
&quot;The Wilde hypothesis suggests an explanation: protecting car occupants from the consequences of bad driving encourages bad driving.&quot;<p>
&quot;...there is one form of safety legislation which Risk Homeostasis Theory suggests will be futile: legislation to protect people from themselves.&quot;<p>
&quot;...the principal, and perhaps the only, determinant of aggregate accident rates is what Wilde calls the 'target level of risk.' &quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>John G.U. Adams, Department of Geography, <br>
University College London</b><p><p>
</blockquote>

&quot;Fundamental questions are asked about our public approaches to coping with risk.&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Lloyd Orr, Professor of Economics, <BR>Indiana University</b><p><p>
</blockquote>

<H3>What is PDE?</H3>

<P> PDE Publications Inc. is a knowledge-based company specializing in driver 
education and traffic safety. With a host site on the Internet's World Wide Web, 
PDE is a global corporation in every sense of the word. While its officers 
and employees are physically located in Toronto, Canada, this is almost 
meaningless in an age where bits of digital information are exchanged 
between computers at nearly light speed. As far as PDE's clients are 
concerned, the company might as well be in London, Geneva, Reykjavik or 
Perth, Australia.

<P> PDE is served by dedicated specialists with many years' experience in 
traffic safety. This experience and knowledge is backed 
by journalistic and computer skills.

<P> PDE Publications is setting up an electronic information resource for 
researchers, policymakers, public speakers and practitioners in traffic 
safety and related fields. It provides one-stop shopping for anyone browsing 
the Internet for information on these subjects.

<P> The company's objective is to disseminate information in this important 
area and provide a meeting of minds for both professionals and 
non-professionals.  There are millions of drivers out there and lots of 
topics of keen interest to both layman and professional.

<P> PDE makes no apologies for being a commercial enterprise. At the same 
time, in the true spirit of the Internet, we provide several free categories 
on our menu for casual browsers, including a regular updated News section, a 
list of upcoming events such as international conferences and seminars, 
names and addresses of prominent organizations.

<P> We are open to casual browsers. However, if you want access to our 
database, it pays to be a subscriber. Our fee to subscribers is $55 U.S. ($75 Can.) 
per year for individuals, $95 U.S. ($128 Can.) for organizations. This fee 
gives unlimited downloading of articles, reports, summaries and 
newsletters.

<P> Once we receive your subscription cheque or money order, we issue you 
with a password to give you full access to our database.<p>

<H3>The Wave of the Future</H3>

<P> By now you must be saturated with all the Internet hype in the news 
media.  Remember that the Internet is just another tool -- a very powerful 
one, but a tool nevertheless. In the case of PDE, we are using the World 
Wide Web to sell knowledge products and create a marketplace -- an 
"information village" if you wish - where anyone who is connected with 
driving or traffic safety can meet to learn and to discuss ideas.

<P> Many of the professionals among you go to conferences and seminars. 
Well, here's a seminar you can join anytime you have half an hour to spare. 
In addition, in our Articles database, we hope to provide you with 
information you can use in preparing your own reports and speeches.

<P> Neither is the flow of information intended to be one-way. If you, in 
turn, have prepared a report or speech and would like the world to see it, 
send it to us for consideration for our database.

<P> Remember, the World Wide Web knows no boundaries. It cuts across all 
borders and jurisdictions and it just as easily cuts through red tape. Here 
is a truly democratic way to participate in this exciting area.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
by JOHN A. LARSON MD<P>

<I>John Larson is a lecturer in psychiatry at Yale University Medical School and a Director of the Institute of Stress Medicine in Norwalk, CT. </I><P>
(A Traffic Safety Information Village news article)<P>
Research by the Friedman institute, beginning in 1978 and by now including over 5,000 participants, has demonstrated conclusively that driver rage, impaired judgement, and risky driving behaviors can be dramatically reduced by group sessions aimed at changing drivers' values and attitudes. This is done by identifying the attitudes held and then systematically pairing each with an alternative attitude, which the participant learns. Once the new attitude is learned, driving behavior becomes safer.<P>

These findings came as a by-product of research aimed at preventing heart attacks. Individuals inclined to have heart attacks have a short fuse, both on and off the road. The Friedman Institute devised a 28 session group treatment to change attitudes triggering temper outbursts. The initial 12 sessions focused on over-reactivity on the road. Changing the attitudes leading to rage on the road proved relatively easy; rage reactions off the road took longer to change, but there too, changing the attitudes led to reduced anger, irritation, aggravation and impatience, and reduced incidence of heart attacks. <P>

Because the researchers were primarily interested in heart attack prevention the implication of the results for safer driving weren't considered. In 1987, I became interested in the possibilities when a rash of shootings occurred on highways in California. I knew how dramatically my own highway rage reactions had changed when I altered the attitudes I took to the highway, and I began writing a book on the subject and teaching this method to groups. <P>

The reason this approach works stems from how the brain works. Attitudes and beliefs have top priority in the brain; behavior follows attitudes. For example, if the teenage driver's attitude is to "show off" his or her driving skills, behavior will reflect this attitude. Parking, starting, passing, turning and merging will be done in an exaggerated fashion in order to "make it show". Secondly, the brain doesn't stop anything; it begins something new and the old brain activity falls into disuse, and eventually becomes discarded as the new behavior becomes reinforced and preferred. Hence, an alternative attitude to "showing off must be taught. For example, "highways are no place for games."<P>

The time is ripe now for research to demonstrate that this approach, incorporates into novice and adult driver training programs, will reduce traffic violations, accidents and deaths. In my opinion, enough data has already been assembled by the Friedman institute to justify a decisive research, establishing the method's practicability.<P>

My recent book, <i>Steering Clear of Highway Madness, </i>presents those principles derived from the research in a highly readable and understandable form. I propose its use as a text for that portion of driver training focusing on attitude change. The following rough outline of research would be relatively easy, inexpensive, and permit collection of data within three to 12 months. <P>

<B>First,</B> have the instructors read the book, carefully following the steps outlined; especially taking the test, before and after, and writing out 3 X 5 cards. The key is to learn "by heart" an alternative attitude to take at the precise moment when, ordinarily, the stress producing attitude is triggered. 
In this process, the instructors will become aware of changes in their own driving, which should convince them of the book's value. <P>

<B>Secondly,</B> add the book as an additional text, to several novice and/or adult classes (at least thirty students should be involved, although the more you have the greater the statistical validity). Students should be required to read the book, do the exercises described, discuss the materials in class, and pass a test on the knowledge.<P>

<B>Thirdly, </B>following the instructional phase, collect data on their driving records for one year, and compare them with a comparable control group (traffic violations, accidents, injuries and deaths). <P>


I will be happy to assist you by conducting seminars for your instructors. <i>Steering Clear of Highway Madness </i> may be ordered from my office (fax: 203-838-3268) or from the publisher, BookPartners (Fax: 503-682-8684). <P>

<i>This article was written by Les Dobson and is based on files <br>
from Finnish Traffic Safety researcher Reima Lehtimaki.</i><P> 

<blockquote>Armed police control checkpoints on major roads, pedestrians scurry out of the path of speeding cars, vehicle insurance is in its infancy and regarded with suspicion by many individuals. At the same time, traffic safety rates high on the school curriculum, many students join the popular "Traffic Scouts" movement and youngsters must be 14 before they ride a bicycle on public roadways, and then only after passing a test.<P>
That's the contradictory situation in Russia painted by Finnish traffic safety consultant Reima Lehtimaki after a recent visit to the republic of Mari El, about 600 kilometres east of Moscow.<P>
Before the collapse of the USSR, foreigners were denied entry to Mari El because of the missile bases there. These bases are  now closed. In common with much of Russia, Mari El is in economic chaos, but Lehtimaki feels the traffic situation there is similar to that prevailing across Russia.<P>
"Although there are few privately-owned vehicles, their number is rapidly increasing," he says. "Urban and rural public transport is abundant and profitable. There are many trucks, jeeps and motorcycles with sidecars. Bicycles are unusual in the towns and the bad condition of the roads makes their use difficult in rural areas.<P>
"In fact, vehicles suffer frequent damage because of the bad roads. Service stations and repair shops are rare," he adds. "Drivers have to make minor repairs themselves and spare parts are difficult to obtain. New vehicles are expensive. As a result, they're kept on the road as long as possible and every car owner needs a garage to protect against thieves. Guarded parking lots are provided for visitors."<P>
Lehtimaki says the automobile is, indeed, the "king of the road" and pedestrians need to keep their eyes peeled. Drivers negotiate the streets at high speed whenever the road surface permits. Road repairs take months and potholes are not always marked. About 200 road-related deaths annually occur in Mari El.<P>
That's the downside. On the other hand, Lehtimaki praises the GAI (pronounced "guy") or traffic police in making the best use of their resources under difficult economic circumstances. GAI has overall responsibility for road safety, including compliance with traffic regulations, technical inspection of vehicles, driver examination and licensing and vehicle registration. GAI, which operates at the federal, state and municipal levels, also co-operates with the education and health authorities in organizing school road safety programs.<P>

<H3>Training and licensing</H3><P>

Regulations introduced in 1994 provide for a uniform approach to traffic regulations across Russia, Lehtimaki says. Car driver training, for example, can be carried out by either a qualified driving school instructor or any licensed driver, providing they are a family member. Drivers cannot get their licence until they're 18, although training can begin as early as 16.<P>
Lehtimaki toured a commercial driving school in the capital city of Yoshkar-Ola that caters to car, bus, truck and trolley drivers and also gives instruction to drivers carrying hazardous materials. The car driver course, conducted mainly after working hours, includes 180 hours of theory and at least 16 hours of driver training.<P>
"Apart from traffic regulations and matters of safety, the course places considerable emphasis on technical matters," Lehtimaki says. "The driver must learn to make minor repairs on the highway. Trainees practice driving only on certain rural and urban routes stipulated by GAI."<P>
It takes two to three months to get a car licence if the student puts in a four-hour session at the school three times a week after work. The course to obtain a car licence costs 600,000 rubles, nearly twice an average month's salary. A theory examination must be passed before proceeding to the actual driving test, which is in two parts - a test in a field to check basic maneuvering skills followed by a test in urban traffic.<P>
GAI enforces speed limits and correct driving procedures by the use of police cars. Such items as documentation, mechanical safety and correct loading are controlled at fixed checkpoints. On seeing a policeman wearing a bullet-proof vest and carrying an automatic rifle at one of the checkpoints, Lehtimaki asked his hosts how often guns are used. "The GAI deputy chief told me the only incident he could recall in 43 years was when an injured moose had to be shot."<P>

<H3>Safety education begins early</H3><P>

Traffic safety education begins in the first grade and Lehtimaki was taken to a school in the city of Volsk, on the Volga River, that had a special classroom designed as a road crossing with traffic lights on the wall and lines painted on the floor. Youngsters were being taught how to safely cross the road. Traffic Scouts is a popular movement across Russia and scouts participate in a nationwide safety contest each year. Older scouts frequently tutor children of kindergarten age and it's not uncommon for the more active scouts to be recruited by GAI. All teachers take road safety training and parents are often the focus of campaigns regarding the use of seat belts and the placing of children in cars.<P>
Lehtimaki says a recently-enacted law permits private insurance companies to set up business and there are now 17 operating in Mari El. Insurance is not mandatory and one company he spoke to paid out only eight claims in 1995 - an indication that the insurance culture in Russia has a long way to go.<P>
The centralization of road safety under GAI has many positive aspects, Lehtimaki says, resulting in little overlapping of responsibilities or in-fighting over jurisdiction. Offsetting these advantages is the danger that road users are too much under the supervision of a single authority. However, the role GAI plays in traffic safety education does much to bolster its public image.<P>

Subscribers will find a more detailed report by Reima Lehtimaki in the <A HREF="infodbase.html">Village library</A></blockquote>

<H1>Video Resources</H1>
<H3>NOTE: This article was originally part of PDE's &quot;Guide to Resources&quot;, which was published in 1994.</H3>

<blockquote>This section of the <STRONG>Guide to Resources</STRONG> started out as an attempt to develop a &quot;top 20&quot; list of videos, but that turned out to be impractical. The information was difficult to get and video catalogues tended to have many titles that were very out of date. <p>
The best alternative seemed to be to ask a cross-section of driver educators from across the U.S. and Canada what videos they use and which ones they would recommend. The results are summarized below. <p>
However, it quickly became obvious that, for the most part, driver educators haven't been buying many new videos. Most of those recommended were more than five years old, and many were more than ten. Money for new purchases has been scarce and there haven't been many new videos available until recently. <p>
The survey turned into two listings: 10 videos widely used in the U.S., and 10 widely used in Canada. A separate listing for Canada is included because there are some good Canadian videos available that seem to be little known in the U.S. There were a total of 27 respondents to the survey, which was quite informal, so not too much significance should be given to the selection. It was just a way to get a measure of what's out there. <p>
More importantly, a listing of videos produced since 1990 will give readers an idea of what new offerings are available. <P>

<H3><A NAME="what">What&#39;s involved</A> for you, the parent</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Getting a driver&#39;s license is one of the important rites of passage to adulthood for the young, new driver -- and it&#39;s certainly a dangerous one.
<P>
A wise parent will seek the help of reliable professionals in preparing the teen for the complex world of the automobile and traffic. It&#39;s not enough for today&#39;s teenagers to learn as their parents did. The driving world they enter is far too intense to tackle without serious preparation.
<P>

As a parent you are the one who cares most about your teenager&#39;s driving ability and safety. This booklet will help you participate in the process of educating your teenager behind the wheel. It will give you insights into the skills and knowledge that professional instructors accumulate over years of teaching. It will inform you about the pitfalls lying in wait for the amateur instructor during the early stages of learning, about the defensive strategies taught in modern driving courses, and about the need to follow up after licensing to ensure that your teen continues to develop defensive driving skills and safe habits.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If possible, leave your teen&#39;s first on-the-road experiences to the care of a professional. Many a nasty accident has occurred because an inexperienced beginner was allowed to get into a situation that was too much to cope with. A miscalculation in speed, a sudden change in traffic conditions, or an awkward combination of circumstances could lead to disaster. The professionals are used to anticipating such problems -- and they have the advantage of dual controls.

 Your task as co-driver is to back up the work of the professionals with well-planned and coordinated practice sessions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Learning to drive a car safely and efficiently in modern traffic involves much more than training to pass a government road test and get a license. However, this is a necessary first stage. Government driver examiners want to ensure that the new driver has adequate control over the vehicle,  knows the rules of the road and the correct procedures for managing a vehicle in traffic, and can make safe decisions.
<P>

The professional instructor is skilled in teaching these basics.  Your role as parent/co-driver is to reinforce what the instructor teaches and provide practice time. It will help enormously if you take the time to refresh your memory by reading through the &quot;Driver&#39;s Handbook&quot;.
 <P>

Helping your teen learn to become an effective driver is an opportunity for you to improve your driving and become a better role model.
<P>

The following outlines some of the major defensive driving concepts taught on modern driving courses. You can get more information on these from your teen&#39;s driver education  textbook.

<H3><A NAME="defensive">Defensive driving techniques</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Being a good defensive driver means more than just being cautious, and mere experience isn&#39;t enough either. The good defensive driver has to <STRONG>work</STRONG> at developing good driving techniques. The following is a summary of the defensive driving concepts commonly covered in driver education courses.
<P>

<strong>Managing space and time</strong>
<P>

This concept is critical to the tactics used in defensive driving. The driver must have space to maneuver and time to react. The following time rules help the novice to compensate for inexperience and are invaluable in reducing risk in traffic.
<P>

<STRONG>The 2-second rule:</STRONG>
<P>

This provides safe spacing when following another car at any speed. By noting when a car ahead of you passes a fixed point and counting your time to reach that point, you can determine whether your spacing is safe. Two seconds (count &quot;one thousand and one, one thousand and two&quot;) is the minimum safe space. This should be practiced from the passenger seat!  The beginner will then develop a sense of what a safe space looks like at different speeds.
<P>

<STRONG>The 4-second stopping rule:</STRONG>
<P>

This is an approximate guide to stopping distance at speeds over 60 kph (37 mph). Choose a fixed point on the roadway ahead and count the seconds until you get there. If you counted four seconds, that point indicated your minimum stopping distance.
<P>

<STRONG>The 12-second visual lead time:</STRONG>
<P>

Ideally, the defensive driver is anticipating traffic movements and potential hazards as far away as the point the car will reach in 12 seconds. Within this distance the driver should scan the scene, including the sidewalks, and make adjustments to speed and position as necessary.
<P>

<STRONG>The Smith System</STRONG>
<P>

The Smith System is one of the most widely used methods for improving defensive driving. It provides five rules for training the eyes to see what is important in driving. They are:
<P>

<UL><LI> Aim high  (to steer accurately and anticipate problems)
<LI> Keep your eyes moving  (avoid fixed stare, stay alert)
<LI> Get the big picture  (don&#39;t allow your eyes to be drawn to one area)
<LI> Leave yourself an &#39;out&#39;  (practice the &#39;what if...&#39; game)
<LI> Make sure they see you  (when there&#39;s conflict for space make eye contact with other driver).
</UL>
<P>

These rules sound simple but it takes considerable practice to develop the habit of using them at all times in traffic.  Good management of space and time allows the Smith system driver to use the five rules most effectively, always having time to scan the scene around the car and adjust speed and position to minimize hazards. 

<P>

<STRONG>Road Commentary Driving</STRONG>
<P>

This technique is used with more advanced drivers. The driver is asked to do a running commentary on what hazards or factors he or she is taking into account while driving. (&quot;Car turning left ahead,&quot; &quot;approaching crosswalk,&quot; &quot;car overtaking in the left lane,&quot; etc.)

Attitude determines how knowledge and skills will be used. It determines whether a driver will be cooperative or competitive in traffic, whether he or she will accept a high level or risk of put into practice the concepts taught on defensive driving courses. 
<P>

Your biggest contribution to your teen&#39;s safety  and effectiveness behind the wheel will be your example. Patience, courtesy, and a willingness to improve will be your best assets. Now is the time to review your own driving habits and offer your teen the example of courtesy and consideration for other road users. This may do more than anything else to ensure your teens driving safety.

<H3><A NAME="planning">Planning practice sessions</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Random driving around during practice sessions can be dangerous.  It&#39;s all too easy for the novice driver to get into trouble, particularly in the early stages. Before getting into traffic be sure that your teen has good coordination with hands and feet.  Until the novice is sure of the pedals, the danger of hitting the wrong pedal in a panic situation is always present.
<P>

It&#39;s important to plan practice sessions.  Decide where to go and what you are going to do before setting out. Take some care in selecting a suitable area.  A large deserted parking lot is ideal for the initial sessions because it allows the beginner to concentrate fully on the feel of the controls and the response of the car.  
<P>

For the initial street sessions find the quietest streets possible. Your teen will learn the correct road and traffic procedures from the professional instructor. Your job will be to provide good feedback while he or she practices these procedures. 
<P>

Accurate lane driving and positioning for turns, good signal timing, and good road sense are the basic ingredients for passing the government road test. These will be learned more effectively by driving around the block with somebody who provides good feedback than by hours of random driving on highway  or streets.  On the other hand, a co-driver who allows the novice driver to get away with faults or who provides poor feedback may hold back the learning process considerably.

<H3><A NAME="practice">Practice hints</A>
</H3><BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Stay alert.</STRONG> Some beginners may give the impression of being confident and in control but may be totally unprepared to deal with any sudden change in conditions and very reliant on you, the co-driver, for guidance and even assistance in  control.  Anticipate problems and always be ready to react. 
<P>

<STRONG>Communicate clearly:</STRONG>  Give directions well in advance and try to always use the same terms (don&#39;t say accelerator one time and gas pedal the next, for example). 
<P>

<STRONG>Don&#39;t hit the beginner with everything at once:</STRONG>  a simple right turn, for example, involves several steps -- checking mirrors, signaling, checking blind areas, braking, positioning, checking for traffic before the turn, steering, and recovery. To expect a beginner to follow all of these correctly during the early sessions is asking too much. 
<P>


<STRONG>Don&#39;t get excited during practice sessions.</STRONG> This communicates itself quickly to the driver and can make performance difficult.
<P>

<STRONG>Don&#39;t overload: </STRONG> A big part of being an instructor or co-driver is reminding the driver to check traffic and to signal and to bring attention to potential hazards. But once again, remember that everything you say is also a distraction for the driver. Be sparing in your comments and, above all, try to avoid letting the beginner get into situations he or she can&#39;t handle.
<P>

<STRONG>Stop and discuss: </STRONG> When your teen makes a mistake, he or she may not be clear as to what went wrong. Explaining and discussing while on the move is not very effective. The beginner is too busy driving!  Stop as soon as you can, while the mistake is still fresh in the memory, and sort out the problem. Don&#39;t jump on every mistake, however, and make a big thing of it. This will affect the beginner&#39;s confidence and concentration on the driving task.
<P>

<STRONG>Don&#39;t clash with what the professional driving instructor teaches.</STRONG> If your teen is doing something that you think is incorrect and maintains that the driving instructor teaches this way -- talk to the driving instructor. Student drivers often wrongly interpret their instructor&#39;s directions.

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The first year of driving is a high-risk period for the beginner. Inexperience combined with a lack of skill means that one in five male 16-year old drivers and about one in ten females will have an accident during their first year of driving.
<P>

Some of the worst accidents occur at night and with a group of young people in the car. If alcohol or any other kind of impairment  is involved the risk in this situation is magnified several times.
<P>

Some supervision during the first year or two will help reduce risk. It&#39;s a good  idea to keep track of the kinds of driving situation your teen has experienced and to gradually work in new ones (for example, night driving, rain, snow, freeways, heavy traffic, passing on the open highway, and so on). Watch for the accumulation of bad habits such as forgetting to signal, sloppy turns, speeding, sudden changes in speed or direction, lack of alertness.

Safe driving is very much a matter of seeing what needs to be seen and
making good decisions, but this is not simple to achieve.

As vison expert <A HREF="/VISION/index.html">Dr. Joe Shapiro</A> points out, &quot;Eyes don&#39;t tell people what they see. People tell eyes what to look for.&quot; In other words, experience and training play a major role in ensuring that a driver&#39;s eyes will look in the right places at the right time. The novice driver&#39;s biggest enemy is the complacency that comes from early success at learning driving basics.

Parents&#39; role is to help their teen overcome that complacency and continue 
to build driving skills after licensing.

<HR><P>
<B>Here are the conclusions from a recent &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; report on 
Commercial Driver Licensing (CDL):</B><P>
<blockquote>
The CDL licensing program is and has been a very effective federal and state 
partnership program. While loopholes and weaknesses do exist, the strength 
and integrity level of the overall system is high.<P>
The recommendations from the AAMVA (American Association of Motor Vehicle 
Administrators) report seem to be reasonable in strengthening the system in 
the short term; however, the long-term solution to achieve a 99% integrity 
level will require numerous additional resources and mandated program. To 
achieve a one-person/one-license/one-record system would require a biometric 
identifier. In addition, an all-driver information system, not just CDLIS, 
would need to be developed (a true national driver register).<P>
Major weaknesses still exist in the information system. The first being a 
licensing jurisdiction's inability to check a license status or record using 
their own network called "AAMVAnet". If a state motor vehicle agency wants 
to check a license, it must go through the National Law Enforcement 
Telecommunication Syhstem (NLETS). The other major weakness is the lack of a 
uniform management information subsystem. Many states do not even know 
passing rates on CDL knowledge tests - let alone information Congress and 
FHWA (Federal Highway Administration)want. In hindsight, the FHWA should 
have required this type of data as part of their rulemaking.<P>
There is still a need for uniformity in U.S. jurisdictions base licensing 
systems. For example, stand alone basic uniform class, type endorsements, 
and restriction codes on the driver license itself are needed. This would 
allow driver licensing personnel and the law enforcement community almost 
total recognition of license information.<P>
FWHA has allowed certain states to use tests that are substandard to the 
model tests, therefore, full uniformity will not be achieved. States using 
the model tests require CDL holders transferring to their state to take the 
model CDL tests. Only a few states have skills test reciprocity.<P>
AAMVA did not conduct, nor has the FHWA required, an investigation into 
fatal crashes similar to the 1980 NTSB previously mentioned. The AAMVA 
report recognizes that CDL holders are using non-CDL licenses to avoid 
convictions, points, etc. The scope of this p;ractice has not been 
determined, nor is it one of the FHWA contract objectives.<P>
Finally, citation tracking research needs to be conducted to determine the 
integrity of the whole traffic records system and if we truly are to 
identify problem drivers.<P></blockquote><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="state">The state of driver education</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety has sponsored a project to &quot;reinvent&quot; driver education into a form that reduces crashes by novice drivers. The research team reviewed the current driver education literature in order to identify novice driver needs, evaluate methods of instruction, and assess the effectiveness of driver education in influencing behavior. The researchers then proposed performance objectives for driver education graduates and methods for achieving those objectives.<P>

The main function of current driver education is to support mobility. New drivers need a certain level of skill in order to pass a state or provincial licensing test and satisfy the concerns of their parents or guardians. Driver education helps meet this need. However, the additional need exists to improve the safety performance of novice drivers. When a large-scale study in DeKalb County, Georgia, failed to show a net safety benefit, driver education lost much government support. Although some jurisdictions and suppliers of curriculum materials have continued to develop their programs, in overall terms driver education has declined in the last 15 years.<P>

This paper identifies ways to restructure driver education to realize its potential for improving safety. This new driver education must operate, at least initially, within current resource limitations. It must be modular and flexible to accommodate different programs and a variety of scales, standards, and resources in different jurisdictions. To be widely accepted, curriculum materials should be packaged for easy and straightforward delivery in poorly capitalized, low-tech instructional environments.<P>
<A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="needs">The needs of novice drivers</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Novice drivers experience serious crash losses far beyond their representation in the driver population or their proportion of mileage driven. As a group they take between five and seven years to reach mature risk levels. However, they vary widely in cultural background, life situation, skills, ability, motivation, level of experience, and crash risk. The difference between male and female behaviors and risks are the best known (although sex differences seem to be diminishing).<P>

The number of novice drivers has been declining for many years, and this has reduced new driver losses. However, this trend will reverse over the rest of the decade as the &quot;baby boom echo&quot; reaches driving age. In addition, economic recession reduces the number of young driver fatalities, so economic recovery may contribute to increased young driver fatalities in the later 1990s. Over the next few years the problem of novice drivers of all ages will take on greater importance.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="novice">Novice driver skills and abilities</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>New drivers lack important skills, particularly those needed to acquire and process information. They are less able to maintain full attention and less likely to take in the information they need from the driving environment. They are not as good as experienced drivers in scanning the environment, recognizing potential hazards while they are still at a safe distance, and making tough decisions quickly. They tend to underestimate the danger of certain risky situations and overestimate the danger in others.<P>

Improved skills alone are not sufficient to ensure new driver safety, however. The safety effects of good driving skills appear to be offset by overconfidence and increased exposure to risk. Better-trained novice drivers become licensed sooner and drive more, in part because of their own increased confidence, but also because their parents often give them more freedom to drive.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="choices">Novice drivers' choices and behavior</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Crashes are caused by what drivers choose to do as much as by what they are able (or unable) to do. Most of novice drivers' increased risk comes from inappropriate behavior -- deliberately taking risky actions, seeking stimulation, driving at high speeds, and driving while impaired. Compared to more experienced drivers, novice drivers more often choose to drive too fast and follow other vehicles too closely. They run yellow lights more, accept smaller gaps in traffic, and allow less room for safety. As a result of their choices, and perhaps because of skill deficiencies as well, they have more rear-end crashes and run-off-the-road crashes than experienced drivers.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="hazard">Hazard perception, risk evaluation, and risk acceptance</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>What drivers are able to do and what they choose to do are two different things. Knowledge of how to control a car is not as critical to safety as individual motivation: Strong motivation makes up for weak skills better than strong skills make up for weak motivation. Without strong motivation to reduce risk, advanced skills training can lead to more crashes, not fewer.<P>

Risk acceptance is not the same thing as crash acceptance. Few drivers will take a risky action if they know it will result in a crash. Instead, risky choices result from poor risk perception and inability to detect hazards, often coupled with overconfidence. Good risk detection, good risk evaluation, and strong motivation may support each other. However, if driver education is to produce safer drivers it must reinforce the individual and community factors that positively influence personal motivation and social responsibility.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="parguard">Parents/guardians and novice drivers</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Parents may inadvertently contribute to the failure of driver education to produce safe drivers. They appear to allow driver education graduates more freedom and offer less supervision, exposing new drivers to increased risk. Thus, driver education needs to involve family intervention and must take advantage of the family's strengths in influencing early driving behavior. Parents and guardians need to take a more active and effective role as their children learn to drive. A major challenge for driver education is to discover how to motivate parents to become more realistic about their children's driving, and about the limitations of driver education courses, without turning them off to formal training.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="comp">Integrating complementary skills and values</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Many different educational fields teach skills, knowledge, and values that are desirable in novice drivers. Driver education objectives are already integrated into other school subjects, such as physics, mathematics, and social studies. New media and teaching techniques can expand the range of this integration. Use of interactive media can enhance attention, improve perception, and hone the decision making skills that apply to many tasks besides driving.<P>

The most critical areas of integration are personal and social values, risk-taking, self esteem, feelings of power, sense of community, and interest in health. These feelings motivate pro-social and self-protective behaviors. Participation in peer group learning activities can help integrate safety-promoting values into all areas of students' lives.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="dev">Developing supporting influences for novice drivers</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Most new drivers' motivation and responsibility can be enhanced by a sufficiently intense program of education. Peer influences, community education programs, and incentives can all affect novice drivers' behavior. Some new drivers display deviant and problem behaviors&#59; they are likely to be at the highest risk. Community resources must address the special needs of these multi-problem youngsters.<P>

To develop community resources, the driver education industry, school authorities, insurers, governments, families, and communities must decide that they care enough about driver safety to coordinate their efforts. This will require many organizations to cooperate and change.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="grad">Graduated licensing</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Graduated and provisional licensing systems are likely to be implemented soon in a number of North American jurisdictions. To make such programs effective over the long term, they must be coordinated with driver education. This raises questions of how to organize driver education programs to support new drivers' learning and performance in different graduated licensing systems.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="strat">Strategic directions</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Demographic and economic trends will lead to an increased market demand for driver education in the coming years. The number of young people is increasing (as are health care costs), and the number and cost of crashes will almost certainly increase concomitantly. With a new, more effective driver education curriculum, issues of standards, governance, and teacher and instructor training will become more important. In addition, the trend towards privatization of driver education will produce new business opportunities for driving schools, suppliers of instructional materials, and instructor trainers. Standards for the compatibility of hardware and software will be needed as technology develops and driver education becomes more complex.<P>

Effective new driver education will be adaptive and experimental. It will stimulate and incorporate rapid advances in knowledge and technology. It will also benefit greatly from advances in interactive learning technology.<P>

Realistic, interactive simulators of the whole driving task are not yet a reality. However, interactive multimedia units and partial task simulators are available, and further development of these types of units is underway. These are the relatively easy parts of the reinvention of driver education, and they will free up resources to concentrate on teaching the &quot;hard parts.&quot;<P>

The hard parts include:<P>

<OL><LI>Devising an effective means of influencing motivation and responsibility&#59;<LI>

Ttraining and supporting the teachers needed to deliver part 1&#59; and<LI>

Mobilizing family, community, industry, and government resources to add weight to the influence of parts 1 and 2.</OL><P>

It is unlikely that the necessary coordination will be achieved on a large scale. It may be possible within communities or private, voluntary associations, such as auto club members or groups of insurance company clients.<P>

The new driver education will not be the result of a single, top-down development exercise, nor will there be a single, monolithic curriculum. It will develop in a pluralistic and competitive way, although governments may need to expand their role by setting standards and coordinating efforts. It will include families, communities, and youth groups as well as schools.<P>

The driver education industry must lead the educational and organizational change that is needed if driver education is to become an effective safety intervention.<P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN to Table of Contents</A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="rec">Recommendations</A></H3>
<OL><LI>Develop software for teaching and testing knowledge and skills in an individual, self-paced, automated way.<P>

<LI>

Develop interactive multi-media units for training and testing driver attention and visual detection as well as risk perception and evaluation.<P>

<LI>

Develop software based on game-theory models to diagnose, clarify, and reinforce modification of new drivers' risk-taking styles and to demonstrate their consequences.<P>

<LI>

Develop improved in-car instruction and instrumentation to teach driving and perception skills and provide feedback on driver performance.<P>

<LI>

Develop participative classroom units for peer-focused seminars, individual study projects, and group work. These are needed to clarify health and safety values and to enhance personal motivation and social responsibility.<P>

<LI>

Develop instructor training to support the use of new interactive media, participative classroom units, and in-car perception units. The need is to reinvent the teacher and instructor's role, enriching the job by shifting the emphasis from information provider to that of coach or mentor for health and safety motivation, social values, and life skills.<P>

<LI>

Develop tools, models, and instruction units that support parent involvement in young driver education.<P>

<LI>

Develop models and incentives that mobilize community, industry, and government support for coordinating positive influences on novice drivers. These should include links between the driver education and health promotion communities and between driver education and insurance providers.<P>

<LI>

Coordinate development of graduated licensing systems with driver education. Move to multi-stage education in the graduated licensing jurisdictions. These driver education formats should also be pilot tested for effectivenes and market acceptance in non-graduated jurisdictions.<P>

<LI>

Expand the integration of driver education topics into other school subjects, particularly health, community service, and other values-related activities.</OL>

<H1>Brewery teaches driving skills</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Mar., 1995)</I><P>
<strong>One of the busiest downtown streets in the Canadian city of Toronto is closed to traffic. Pylons are set up for a driver training program on collision avoidance techniques. The high-profile training effort, presented in conjunction with the city's auto show, was jointly sponsored by a brewery, an auto manufacturer, and a tire company. Both the effectiveness of collision avoidance programs and the wisdom of accepting sponsorship from the alcohol beverage industry are being debated by the driver education community.</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>
<P>
The program described above is called the "Labatt Road Scholarship Program" and, since 1988, it has toured Canada and given some 15,000 drivers a short, two-part introduction to some basic collision avoidance techniques. 
<P>
During the Toronto event, transit drivers, police drivers, ambulance drivers and cab drivers tried their hand at braking exercises, slaloms around pylons, and an avoidance exercise  in which they had to watch for the movement of "pedestrians" (instructors) before deciding which way to swerve around a row of pylons blocking their path. And spectators got to listen to the loudspeaker critiques of chief instructor Gary Magwood about reactions, braking skills, and visual tracking. 
<P>
The message the program is intended to impart, says Labatt National Director of Public Affairs Terry Zuk, is "don't drink and drive," and the program tries to achieve this, he says, by demonstrating collision avoidance techniques to drivers and letting them experience the skills required to react to the unexpected. "Then they will realize how difficult it would be to react properly and apply these skills if they were impaired by alcohol."
<P>
The program provides an interesting intersection of two important issues that driver educators are currently wrestling with: 
<P>
<B>Controversy</B> about the value of teaching advanced skills such as collision avoidance and skid control techniques. Some studies have shown an increase in crashes amongst those who had taken such courses.
<P>
<B>The issue</B> of accepting sponsorship for driver training/education activities from the alcohol beverage industry is also controversial. This subject was a keynote topic at the annual conference of the American Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association (ADTSEA) last August and will be the subject of a vote by ADTSEA members this spring. 
<P>
At the conference, Monita W. Fontaine, Director of State Government Relations with the U.S. Distilled Spirits Council, told attendees that "alcohol abuse is too important a problem to discourage anyone interested in fighting it from doing so." She cited a long list of initiatives dating back to 1937. These ranged from supporting the development of the first breath-testing devices in the 1940s to the establishment of the Scientific Advisory Council (SAC) in 1957 and the Licensed Beverage Information Council (LBIC) in 1979. 
More than 400 research projects have been funded at more than 200 institutions, Fontaine pointed out. The alcohol beverage industry has been active in supporting organizations such as Students Against Drunk Driving and BACCHUS, an organization that promotes alcohol education amongst university students.
<P>
Addressing the other side of the debate. ADTSEA board member Jay A. Smith of Arizona saw the alcohol beverage industry as simply trying to build credibility with the young potential drinker and with law makers at both state and congressional levels. 
<P>
In constantly keeping their names before young people as they are growing up and "glorifying and associating drinking with all good fun activities in life," the brewery industry is desperately trying to gain credibility and positive status with Congress, he said.  
<P>
Smith urged the beverage industry to concentrate on lobbying for quality driver education, including alcohol education, to be made available to all youth in all states. The industry should aim its advertising and promotion towards the middle-aged and not glorify the association of alcohol with fun, he argued.
<P>
"Any association with the alcohol beverage industry, the leading contributor to the very tragedies we are trying to prevent, would only improve their status and credibility and will compromise our effectiveness and credibility," Smith said. 
<P>
Terry Zuk emphasizes that Labatt Breweries is very sensitive to the issues surrounding its sponsorship of a driver training program. "We have to make sure the focus is kept on the effects of alcohol on the driving task," he points out."
<P>
The Road Scholarship curriculum was developed by chief instructor and former Canadian racing champion Gary Magwood. It consists of a one-hour classroom theory session followed by a three-hour session behind the wheel. 
Magwood will be using the same format for programs operated by his own company, CounterSteer, which is in the process of launching a commercial campaign in major Canadian cities across the country. He feels that the programs are effective and that all ages can benefit from them. 
<P>
"It's been a revelation to see how well even very nervous drivers perform," he says,  "and it's been a very pleasant surprise to see how well the older drivers perform. They can achieve the goals of the programs just as well as the younger drivers."
<P>
He constantly refines his programs as a result of feedback from his students and he's scornful of the philosophy that collision avoidance skills shouldn't be taught because drivers trained in these skills tend to use their extra skills to drive faster and harder, or because the skills are lost over time due to lack of practice. 
<P>
It doesn't make sense, Magwood believes, to leave drivers without the basic tools to defend themselves when emergencies occur in traffic. "At the very least," he says, "they should know the proper way to hold the wheel and how to position themselves in the seat for maximum control." And would anyone decide not to train chemists or engineers just because they might lose some of their knowledge and skills over time, he asks. 
<P>
As well, he sees his course as providing much more than collision avoidance skills. Throughout the course he drums in the message about keeping the eyes up, looking where you want to go, and anticipating the next move. 
In one exercise, students are asked to do a slalom through a line of pylons while watching hand-signal directions from an instructor at the far end of the line. This forces them to use peripheral vision to monitor the pylon positions  while keeping their eyes up ahead to the "target". 
<P>
Not only does this technique work in collision avoidance and recovering from skids, Magwood says, it keeps drivers focused farther ahead in traffic and allows them to anticipate problems.<P>

<H1>Canada's Insurers' Position on Driver Training</H1><P>
<blockquote>In the wake of a new research study called &quot;The Role of Driving Experience,&quot; the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) has produced some key recommendations  on driver testing and training.<P>
The study, by the Traffic Injury Research Foundation of Canada,  was commissioned by IBC, the major Canadian trade association for property and casualty insurers.<P>
In a recently issued position paper, IBC sets out the critical factors determining driving experience as being:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Psychomotor Skills: related to the ability to handle the vehicle (e.g., steering and braking);
<LI>Perceptual Skills: related to the ability to perceive the driving environment accurately (e.g., sign recognition, scanning, hazard detection);
<LI>Cognitive Skills: related to the ability to make appropriate decisions and judgments (e.g., speed adjustment for driving conditions, passing); and
<li>Attitudes and Motivations: related to concern for safety and the willingness to exercise responsible driving behavior (e.g., overconfidence, caution, fear, risk-taking, sensation-seeking).
</UL><P>
"Having reviewed the current state of knowledge in these areas - supplemented by a survey of expert opinion - the IBC study found considerable scientific evidence showing that certain critical experience factors influence the level of risk faced by new drivers," says the position paper. "In fact, such evidence had to be present for a specific experience variable to be considered a critical factor," the paper adds.<P>
IBC says a subsequent evaluation showed that eight critical experience-related factors are not being adequately addressed by existing driver training and testing programs in Canada. These factors are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Steering Control
<LI>Speed Control
<LI>Visual Search/Scanning
<LI>Hazard Perception
<LI>Decision-Making
<LI>Personal Risk Assessment
<LI>Lifestyle
<li>Risk-Taking
</UL><P>
"The evidence suggests that these factors should be given the highest priority by the provinces when considering changes that would improve the effectiveness of driver training and testing programs," the paper says. 
Recommendations by the IBC to improve current road tests include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Increasing the length of the test (currently a maximum of 30 minutes) so that applicants are required to demonstrate their abilities over a wider array of traffic situations and circumstances, such as driving at night or on expressways;
<LI>Eliminating unnecessary or ineffective measures - for example, staring the vehicle, parallel parking - so that the limited time available can be used to assess more relevant skills;
<LI>Modifying the role of the driver examiner to encourage more interaction between the examiner and the applicant - for example, posing questions about the rules of the road while the applicant is driving - thus creating a more demanding, multiple-task situation;
<LI>Rating searching/scanning ability for each driving situation or maneuver on the test, for example, having the examiner pay closer attention to mirror checks performed by new drivers to determine if effective visual searching of the road environment is taking place;
<LI>Using automated testing procedures such as simulation and computer-aided testing for new drivers, primarily for purposes of hazard detection and to provide exposure to a wide array of driving conditions and circumstances not always possible during an on-road test (note that these methods could also be used to help identify individuals who display risking driving behaviors);
<li>Making the road test a diagnostic and educational tool, for example, identifying specific deficiencies and prescribing corrective training before re-testing.
</UL><P>
The IBC says that driver education and training programs also need to re-examine their emphasis on critical experience-related skills and consider methods to enhance the teaching of these skills. It suggests the following program modifications:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Extending the time frame for on-road instruction beyond the current limited period of 10 to 12 hours, so that more than just rudimentary skills can be acquired;
<LI>Placing more emphasis on critical skills and tasks - for example, how to integrate skills under different conditions such as night driving - and less on relatively  unimportant maneuvers such as parking;
<LI>Better matching of teaching strategies to the types of skills that need to be learned, for example, multi-stage training consisting of frequent periods of short duration to cover the basic skills, and longer sessions over a more extended time frame for complex skills;
<LI>Tailoring programs to identify and correct critical vehicle-handling skills that some novice drivers have difficulty overcoming;
<LI>Having the student, while driving, report to the instructor on decision alternatives, choices and risk assessments - referred to as "commentary driving";
<li>Introducing lifestyle education to discourage risky behaviors at an early age, long before the age of driver licensing.
</UL><P>
IBC says the report, The Role of Driving Experience, represents one of the most comprehensive studies of driver training and testing methods every undertaken in Canada.<P>
"While our knowledge is still evolving, the research demonstrates that there is considerable room for improvement in existing driver education/training and testing procedures. More important, there is scientific evidence to support a greater emphasis on experience-related factors in the instruction and testing of new drivers - evidence on which the recommendations of this position paper are based.<P>
"To be optimally effective, driver training and testing should be integrated into a multi-stage licensing system. Graduated licensing recognizes this and provides an opportunity to achieve such integration in a way that can significantly improve the process of learning to driver," the IBC adds.<P>
"The adoption of graduated licensing by several provinces in Canada has been a substantial step forward for road safety in Canada. As other provinces adopt graduated licensing - and all jurisdictions continue to seek improvements in road safety - it is now time to take the next steps and full integrate complementary, experience-related driver training and testing procedures into the licensing system."<P><P>

<H1>Discovery Method Boosts Ego<BR>But It's Not Good Instruction</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Mar., 1995)</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>BY Terry Allen, Training Director for Young Drivers of Canada.<P>
<P>
</H3> <P>
<blockquote>
The "discovery method" of driver training involves taking  raw novices and starting them off on a long, straight multi-lane street in moderate to heavy traffic. It has been called the "immersion" approach by its supporters and the "crash and burn" approach by its detractors.<P>

The (usually) unstated aim of the discovery procedure is to allow the student to experience the driving task and to learn either by self-discovery (experimentation) or by osmosis, in much the same way an infant learns language.
<P>
In fairness, it must be stated that this method can work with carefully selected students under the guidance of a particularly charismatic and persuasive instructor-one who recognizes the power of suggestion. For the majority of students, however, its effectiveness is marginal and its use often results in confusion and dissatisfaction. The student then requests a transfer to an orthodox instructor, or the instructor gives up. 
<P>
None of the above can be considered news, yet this method of instruction is tried by almost all instructors at some point in their careers. It has been suggested that this represents laziness on the part of the instructor. <P>
Perhaps it is, although it would seem that this approach would require the patience of a saint and the observational prowess and reflexes of a pilot. The appeal of this approach is to be found elsewhere, in the instructor's psyche.
<P>
It must be a very gratifying experience to take a novice, first time out, and guide him or her, by voice alone, through heavy traffic and complex intersections. It requires absolute confidence. The instructor must appear to the student to have absolute confidence in the student's ability and the student must have absolute confidence in the instructor's ability. And finally, the instructor, in order to satisfy the first case, must be absolutely self-confident. 
<P>
The situation resembles the cliche movie scene. Following some in-flight mishap, the ruggedly handsome hard-drinking pilot "talks down", by radio, an aircraft flown by a passenger with no aeronautical training. One might expect the discovery instructor to lean out the car window and yell "Look Ma, no hands!" midway through the first lesson. 
<P>
Instructors who intuitively recognize the effectiveness of positive suggeston seem particularly susceptible to attempting this approach.
<P>
There is, however, another appeal. On a psychological level, this approach reinforces the child-parent aspect of the student-instructor relationship and confers god-like power on the instructor. This should not be confused with the respect and gratitude shown an orthodox instructor by his or her students. <P>
The latter is the result of a satisfactorily fulfilled contract. The former results from an unhealthy and unwarranted manipulation of the situation. 
It would seem to be in the best interest of all concerned that any instructor using this approach question his or her motivation very carefully.
<P>
In any learning situation (particularly one involving psychomotor skills) self-discovery, osmosis and intuitive learning are all present. <P>
The driving task is no exception. It must be categorically stated that these modes are quite clearly inadequate in most cases. The evidence to support this assertion is visible every day on any street or highway. To put it colloquially: If self-learning is so great, why are there so many bad drivers out there? 
<P>
The alternative-programmed learning- involves a demonstration of proper eye, hand, and foot usage in relation to the speed of the car; the location of reference points such as lanes, curbs, and proper targets; followed by student driving under the control of verbal descriptions of each of these tasks-utilizing as few words as possible, at exactly the correct time, until the proper driving skills are learned. 
<P>
Proper instruction of technique and appropriate timing in a low-presssure driving environment will allow the student to master the important skills of defensive driving while interacting with other drivers. This will reduce their risk of collision.<P>

<H1>Driver Ed Should Look To Research</H1>
<blockquote><P>Driving instructors give their students advice about setting their mirrors a certain way, scanning the rearview mirror every 5 to 8 seconds as they drive along, following at a two-second distance, or braking in a certain way. But is that advice based on hard research that links these techniques to increased safety, or is it opinion based on expert drivers' feelings about what makes safer driving?<P>
 
When leading traffic safety researcher Herb Simpson told driving school owners to "re-evaluate everything they do" several years ago at a conference in Toronto, he meant it quite literally. For a number of years prominent researchers, such as Professor Patricia Waller and Dr. Simpson, have been saying that most of the stuff of driver training and education curriculum, the concepts and skills taught every day by driver education instructors across the continent, have little or no foundation in empirical research. In other words there's little, if any, evidence that teaching particular concepts or skills reduces the tendency of drivers to have a crash during their subsequent driving career.<P>
 
These are very tough words, since their implications for future support for training and education are far-reaching. However, they have their origins in the fact that, in many instances, today's driver educators base their teachings on opinion about what leads to safer driving rather than on empirically based fact.<P>
 
Driver education curriculum today is largely based on a major study of the driving task published in 1970. The study, carried out by the now-defunct Human Resources Research Organization (HumRRO), analyzed the driving task and identified critical elements that should be taught by driver educators. But the study was based on a survey of expert opinion rather than actual empirical research, says Professor Waller, who now heads the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.<P>
 
A leading question for driver educators now is whether curriculum that evolved from the HumRRO Task Analysis fails because there's something wrong with what's taught, or because - as another prominent researcher suggests - the mode of delivery is inappropriate.<P>
 
 Dr. Mike Smith, a senior researcher with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Office of Program Development and Evaluation, believes that the latter consideration plays a big part. Smith proposes that one of the most important questions driver educators must deal with is the "when" of driver education delivery rather than the "what."<P>
 
Detailed research into what works and what doesn't needs to be carried out, Smith says, but he believes that current methods of delivery are inappropriate and that this may be largely responsible for the ineffectiveness of present-day programs. <P>
It's not possible for novice drivers to learn everything they need to know in a short time, Smith feels. The learning needs to be spread out over a much longer time period and tailored to each driver's abilities. <P>
Recently, the NHTSA announced that it supports a two-phase delivery system for driver training/education, and it also supports a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers that would be integrated with, and facilitate, a two-phase system.<P>
 
Where does that leave driver educators? The obvious need to question and re-evaluate the content of today's in-car and classroom lessons is leading driver educators to take a more challenging stance towards the research community. This stance is supported by Herb Simpson. The research community, he says, has criticized the training industry for building programs by the seat of their pants. <P>
"But if the training industry challenged the research community and said, `We'd love to build programs based on facts, but what are the facts?' I think they'd run for the hills. A lot of what they're saying in terms of the research they have is bluff."<P>
 
Just exactly where the research world stands on the matter of empirical evidence about various elements of the driving task related to risk is the subject of a major study recently completed by the Canadian Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF) under Dr. Simpson's direction. <P>
The study, titled The Role of Driving Experience, was carried out for the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) as a follow-up to its New to The Road study, which was completed in 1991 and laid the foundations for the system of graduated driver licensing just introduced in the province of Ontario.<P>
 
"I believe that the research community has created a myth that if driver educators would pay attention they would have effective programing," says Simpson. But the Role of Driving Experience study, which has reviewed about 250 research reports as well as all of the expert opinion, will, he believes, reveal that research efforts so far have been rather chaotic. <P>
This is not to say, he adds, that there isn't some good information about important psychomotor skills, perceptual differences, differences in cognitive processes, and so on. The report will point out this work. But the results are not cut and dried and there's an important need to map out a strategy for research that will fill in the gaps.<P>

<H1>Driver Training &quot;Down Under&quot;</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Sept. 1994)</I><P>
<P>

<H5>By JOHN KILPATRICK</H5> <P>
<P>

<strong>John Kilpatrick is Operations Director at the Roadcraft-Queensland Driver 
Training complex at Gympie, Australia. The 58-hectare (143 acre) complex, 
situated about 100 km (60 miles) north of Brisbane, offers programs ranging 
from preschool traffic education to pre-license programs, corporate 
defensive driving courses and advanced skills training. Facilities include 
an extensive skid pan, gravel roads, a special 2 km four-wheel-drive 
training track, a lecture theatre, classrooms and a display area.  </strong><P>
<P><blockquote>

Our training centre was initiated by the Rotary Clubs in Gympie. We had a 
high road toll in the area so a dedicated committee was formed to establish 
a road safety driver training complex. Originally, educational programs were 
conducted for pre-school, primary and high school students. Support was 
solicited from schools, and teachers would assist on a volunteer basis.  In 
1983 I was appointed the first full-time staff member and a concerted effort 
was made to increase the volume of students, while at the same time 
progressively developing and refining program content.  <P>

The traffic safety education program was conducted on a miniaturized road 
environment which includes features such as intersections, roundabouts, 
traffic lights and roadway curves. Other programs for high school students, 
ambulance drivers, motorcyclists, truck drivers, and four-wheel-drive 
operators were developed with consultation from industry and operators. 
Currently Roadcraft provides road safety education and driver training for 
9,000-10,000 people per year. <P> A new facility is planned for the Brisbane 
area (Queensland's capital city) in the near future. Land is available for 
the project and resource planning is established. We're investigating the 
concept of a multi-functional, multi-user facility operating on a 
fee-for-service basis.  <P>

My study tour of driver training organizations in North America and Europe 
had a number of objectives: we want to provide more effective programs for 
existing clients and to broaden our client base; we want ideas for our new 
facilities; we want to establish contact with reputable providers of driver 
training and education; and we want to develop new marketing strategies.
<P>

The tour confirmed that there are many people and organizations looking for 
ways to achieve desirable behavioural outcomes for their students. But it 
also confirmed the perennial problem of not knowing the effects of 
instructional input on ongoing safe driver behaviour. I believe that when we 
discover more effective mechanisms to produce safe drivers it will cause a 
revolution in the field of road trauma prevention. In the short term, the 
major effect of my findings on Roadcraft's programs will be to utilise our 
facilities more efficiently and to apply creative solutions to specific 
vehicle safety problems.  <P>

The Australian driver education movement suffers from negative government 
attitudes about its effectiveness as a safety measure, and an inability to 
attract research funds. There's also a lack of networking between 
practitioners of driver education. <P> An important part of the study tour 
was the opportunity to communicate with people and organizations that share 
common educational philosophies and strategies, and learn from their 
experiences. The open-minded attitudes demonstrated by practitioners that I 
met with in North America and Europe have given me the encouragement to try 
to increase the momentum of driver education in Australia. 

<P>
<H4>Some general observations</H4><P>


The organizations I visited or made contact with in America, Canada, 
Switzerland and Austria shared the common feature of having access to ground 
facilities to instruct in the major component areas of their curricula. 
Traditional skills such as emergency braking techniques, skid control, and 
general car control skills took precedence in America and to some degree in 
Canada. <P> 

The organizations I had contact with in Canada used a mixture of those 
traditional skills and attitudinal/behavioural change activities.  <P>

Austria and Switzerland centred their programs on skills-based activities 
with a significant difference: facilities designed to simulate adverse road 
environment conditions featured prominently. Also, sophisticated use of 
electronics, low-traction surfaces and skid inducers formed part of the 
larger organizations' teaching environments and teaching strategies.  The 
most important aspect of the study tour was the opportunity to meet with 
professional driver education and training practitioners and to establish 
lines of communication with them.  <P> 

Comparatively speaking, driver education is a relatively new concept here in 
Australia and much input is required to find solutions to the problems 
confronting driver educators. My tour, and the new connections I made, will 
help greatly in developing the motivation and resources to enhance road 
safety, not just in our communities here, but also on a national and global 
basis.

<H1>Instructional support to drivers</H1>
<H3>The role of in-vehicle feedback in improving <BR>driving performance of qualified motorists</H3>
<STRONG>By  M. J. Kuiken (Ph.D. Thesis, 1996)</STRONG><br>

HAREN: TRAFFIC RESEARCH CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN (pp.168).<P>
<hr><P>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<blockquote>
The main topic of this thesis was the use of feedback to efficiently reduce 
the occurrence of driving errors that might endanger road participants. The 
thesis initially focused on the position of inexperienced drivers. After a 
relatively short training period, newly qualified drivers are expected to 
drive safely without further supervision or guidance. Accident analyses 
demonstrate that young and inexperienced drivers are particularly 
vulnerable in traffic. The accident rate for this group is considerably 
higher than for more experienced drivers. Several studies have suggested 
that at least part of this problem is due to insufficiently developed 
driving skills. Feedback from the traffic environment is generally poor 
(McKenna 1982&#59; Brown, 1989&#59; Groeger 1990). Consequently, drivers easily 
fail to notice a discrepancy between their intended actions and realized 
actions. Inappropriate behaviour can thus become a habitual part of 
drivers' performance. Hence maintaining or improving safe driving 
procedures after drivers have qualified will require normative feedback. In 
this thesis we have investigated the effects of extrinsic feedback to 
drivers in situations in which they have been found to make errors, by 
means of an in-vehicle feedback system.<P>

Error tendencies of inexperienced drivers were investigated using a postal 
questionnaire on behavioural antecedents of accidents. The rationale for 
using self-reports was that accident reports usually generate insufficient 
information about accident causes. This study gave some insight into 
drivers' critical behaviour in specific (accident) situations, which can 
serve to provide guidelines for the provision of extrinsic feedback on 
aspects of the driving task. Speed behaviour in curves was selected as the 
target behaviour of this study.<P>

Although the survey revealed very little difference between the errors made 
by inexperienced drivers and those made by experienced drivers, accident 
statistics and additional studies suggest that excessive speed in curves 
seems to be related to drivers' level of experience and age. To investigate 
this issue further the driving performance of inexperienced drivers was 
compared to more experienced drivers. The methodology used, involved 
measuring drivers' speed when they were 
 negotiating curves and straight road sections in an instrumented vehicle. 
However, once more, no clear differences between experience groups were 
found.<P>

This led to the conclusion that behavioural errors of individual drivers 
need to be addressed independent of their level of experience, and that 
support by means of feedback needs to be adapted to the individual driver. 
Within the larger project of which this study formed part (i.e. the GIDS 
project), a detailed normative task analysis was made and an on-line access 
to this database was made available for the use of our study. Basic notions 
were that drivers are goal-directed and that they are likely to regularly 
make mistakes or to fail to solve problems. Instead of providing feedback 
based on an analysis of error tendencies of different groups of drivers, 
feedback would need to be generated on the basis of real-time comparison 
between the actual performance of individual drivers and the normative 
performance. It was expected that such personalized feedback would 
facilitate the acquisition of safe, i.e. normative, driving skills by 
reducing specific errors.<P>

Two experiments were carried out to assess the relationship between the 
personalized feedback and driving performance. The studies were performed 
in the driving simulator. Drivers received feedback on speed errors in 
curves with different radii, and/or at intersections. Errors were defined 
as deviations from the normative performance rules concerning speed 
behaviour in these situations. One of the main findings was that, compared 
to drivers who did not receive extrinsic performance feedback, drivers made 
considerably fewer and smaller speed errors when given feedback. These 
results suggest that performance support modifies driver behaviour. The 
findings also showed that feedback in supported situations transferred to 
unsupported but similar situations, i.e. other curves.<P>

Another question in the experimental studies concerned the effects of 
various feedback characteristics, such as the timing and the modality of 
the feedback. The experiments investigated the effects of precise 
scheduling of feedback messages, and of verbal and haptic messages. What 
emerged most clearly from the findings is that both verbal and haptic 
performance feedback seem capable of conveying information to drivers on 
the basis of which the alter their behaviour. On the basis of the research 
reported here, it is clear that instructional support, which is properly 
suited to the traffic scenario in question, can exert a very substantial 
positive influence on driver performance. The general conclusion of this 
thesis is that in-vehicle feedback systems that monitor the output of the 
driver continually and compare it with the output that would be expected 
from the standpoint of safety, may play an important role in the future in 
the refinement and maintenance of certain behaviours. The present range of 
events and manoeuvres over which the first generation prototype co-driver 
and tutoring systems are able to give support, is very limited. The next 
step is to develop the knowledge to include many more tasks and traffic 
situations that prevail in driving. Advancements in these areas will 
determine the rate of progress both of support systems in general and of 
feedback systems in particular.<P>

<H1>Kamikazes: Drivers without driver training</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Sept., 1994)</I><P>
<H4>By DAVID THORNHILL THOMPSON</H4> <P>
<P><blockquote>
In the waning months of the war in the Pacific, the Japanese High Command, lacking long-range bombers, developed a squadron of suicide pilots called kamikazes, or Divine Wind. <P>
In exchange for a spiritual ticket to a higher place in heaven these brave young men were trained to take off in a small fighter plane with a huge bomb strapped to the belly and to fly that plane directly  into an Allied warship. Of course, with the pressing constraints of time and resources, and because it was seen to be unnecessary, these human instruments of war were never taught how to land the plane. Taught to take off but not how to land. 
<P>
That was 50 years ago. In 1993, in the U.S., nearly 8,000 young men and women died in vehicles they didn't know how to "land" either, only this time they were in automobiles, not airplanes. They were taught how to turn the key and turn the wheel but not how to turn an automotive emergency into a safe landing.
<P>
Over the past 15 years, successive administrations in Washington and countless state and local governments have relentlessly gutted the driver education system, based on the premise that it is a waste of taxpayers' money. In 1994, less than 25 states offer driver ed in their school systems and only 15 require it as a condition of licensing.
<P>
Teenage drivers are 7% of all licensed drivers, yet they are involved in 25% of all accidents. Their death rates are similar. They account for something in the order of $75-100 billion in crash damage, personal injury, medical costs and other accident expenses annually. So we have a set of opposing trend lines. <P>
Teenage accident rates go up and driver ed efforts go down. Every day we send more kamikazes off to deal with an increasingly hostile traffic environment, while simultaneously reducing their pre-flight training. How can this make sense?<P>

<H4>People raise kids, not government</H4><P>

Driver education became a sacrificial lamb to budget pressures when the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA), an agency of the Department of Transportation, reached a fundamental, if totally counter-intuitive, conclusion. It decided years ago, and stands firm in this conviction now, that driver ed does not produce safer drivers. <P>
That's right. NHTSA believes that it has proof that you cannot improve traffic safety through improved driver training. This is based primarily on a study conducted in Georgia over ten years ago, often called the DeKalb County Study, or more formally, the Safe Performance Curriculum Study.
<P>
And that's where it's been left for 10 years.  In more recent times, NHTSA has reviewed the Georgia experience and firmly concluded that "we have done a reasonable assessment of the driving task."  They go on to speculate that "results from [new analysis would not] lead to significant changes in the current content of driver education programs." <P>
Finally, NHTSA has concluded that "the missing link in the question of why driver education is not more effective...[is] when driver ed is taught." <P>
Accordingly, in a Report To Congress on May 31, 1994, NHTSA made a formal proposal to introduce graduated licensing programs nationwide-the postponement of the driving privilege from 16 to a later age. This report, mis-titled Research Agenda For An Improved Novice Driver Education Program, devotes the first 20 of its 22 pages (90%) to making its case for graduated licensing. One page is devoted to parental involvement and a half-page to innovative technology. 
<P>
There is in this report not one specific proposal concerning driver training. Nothing concerning new curricula. No reference to evaluation of current techniques. 
<P>
It appears that, beginning 15 years ago, the scientists met, designed an experiment called the Safe Performance Curriculum and applied it to some subjects. During the test the laboratory "rats" just didn't get it. So the scientists met again and concluded that since there was nothing wrong with their design, it must be the fault of the "rats". Conclusion? Perhaps we need older "rats" to make our design work.
<P>
No administration since 1984 has put driver training on its agenda. The most recent proposal to Congress by NHTSA continues this theme. Having concluded that students were incapable of changing their behavior, NHTSA now is pushing strongly for graduated licensing, proposing  nothing concrete in the area of improved driver training. Meanwhile, states, often dependent on federal highway funds, have followed the federal lead, continuing to reduce their own driver training programs.<P>
<H4>Try, try again</H4><P>
While the concept of graduated licensing may well have important benefits in reducing accident rates by raising consciousness of the consequences of accidents among young drivers, a poorly trained 18-year-old is just as dangerous as a poorly trained 16-year-old. And there is little likelihood that such legislation, which must be passed at the state and local level, will be popular or universally applauded. <P>
In other words, it will be a long time coming. In the meantime, government must become pro-active in the funding and development of new training techniques and systems, the benefits of which would apply with or without graduated licensing.
<P>
Congress should demand that NHTSA go back to its drawing board and produce some real innovation in driver ed for the first time in 15 years.<P>


<H4>Meanwhile, back at the ranch</H4><P>

But we ordinary citizens and parents should stop sitting around holding our breath, waiting for government to solve our problem, or the sound of our teenagers crashing, whichever comes first. Followed shortly by the mailman with a bill for tripling the insurance premium. <P>
It is time for parents to take control again; to reassume the ultimate responsibility for the safety of their children. That, importantly, includes driver training.
<P>
Here is a perfect opportunity for citizen activism. If those in the driver ed community who have felt helpless as the politicians and the bureaucrats bled driver ed programs into ineffectiveness, would unite in a program to re-involve parents in the process, two important things would happen. <P>
First, some new drivers would get the additional training and experience necessary to help them survive their early automotive emergencies. And second, they would be reaching a powerful, voting constituency-parents-and showing them firsthand how little government is doing to support driver ed. <P>
Why do we not have PTA groups organizing local driver training days? Why can't we get local governments to provide some open spaces for training ranges just as they provide basketball and tennis courts?<P>
 

<H4>Back to basics</H4><P>
No one doubts that we have become a nation of bad drivers. Every day on the way to work, you can witness multiple acts of bad habits, bad judgment and bad manners. It's time we went back to basics and got parents back into the habit of taking responsibility for the safety and behavior of their children. The driver ed community should take the lead in this back-to-basics movement.<P>

<H2>LEARNING TO DRIVE ...<BR>A guide for teenagers and their parents</H2><p>
<blockquote>Learning to drive is a major turning point in the lives of teenagers and their parents.<p>
Getting a driver's licence is one of the important rites of passage to adulthood for the young, new driver - and it's certainly a dangerous one. A wise parent will seek the help of reliable professionals in preparing the teen for the complex world of the automobile and traffic. It's not enough for today's teenagers to learn like their parents did. The driving world they enter is far too intense to tackle without serious preparation.<p>
The cost of driving, the risks, the pressures, all speak to the need for a well-trained and educated driver. It's not good enough just to get by any more. Driving is not something to learn by trial and error. It involves skill, knowledge, and above all, habits that need to be carefully shaped.<p>
As a parent you are the one who cares most about your teenager's driving ability and safety.<p>
This guide is designed to help you participate in the process of educating your teenager behind the wheel. It will give you insights into the skills and knowledge that the best professional instructors have accumulated over years of teaching. It will inform you about the pitfalls lying in wait for the amateur instructor during the early stages of learning, about the defensive strategies taught in modern driving courses, and about the need to follow up after licencing and ensure that your teen continues to develop defensive driving skills and safe habits.<p>
Remember, getting a licence is NOT the end of learning to drive. The first six months after licensing are critical to the shaping of safe habits, and these, along with attitudes, are far more important than a high degree of knowledge or skill.<p>

<H3>GOING ON THE ROAD</H3><p>

Many a tragic accident has resulted from parents unwittingly allowing their teens to get into driving situations for which they are not properly prepared.<p>
Often the beginner driver appears confident and in control but in reality is simply getting by - so long as nothing unusual happens. A sudden change in conditions could easily cause panic. This is something the professional driving instructor learns to anticipate and has skills to deal with.<p>
There are very good arguments for leaving your teenager's first on-the-road experiences to the care of a professional. Experience, know-how, and dual controls make a big difference. And it's nice to get off to a good start.<p>
Also it's important to get the beginner working on the right habits straight away.<p>

<H3>PASSING THE DRIVING TEST</H3><p>

Driver examiners want licence applicants to show that they know the rules, have reasonable control over the car, and can follow the CORRECT procedures when carrying out basic maneuvers such as turns, lane changes, and parking.<p>
They don't expect perfect performance, and they know that beginners will be nervous, but they do expect them to be able to "read" the roadway environment (signs, signals, and pavement markings) and relate to traffic.<p>
Remember, the government road test only covers basic driving situations. Passing it doesn't make a driver safe or competent in dealing with all the different driving situations he or she will meet in a lifetime of driving. <p>

<H3>AFTER LICENSING</H3><p>

Many novice drivers are left to themselves once they obtain their licence. THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE. The newly licensed driver is still a novice with only basic skills. Many young people equate skill with the car with driving skill. Leaving them to learn from the driving environment may often seem to work BUT THE ENVIRONMENT CAN BE A VERY HARSH TEACHER. Without some advice and supervision the typical beginner will be a mass of bad habits after the first year. And the beginner won't get away with bad habits as easily as the experienced parent.<p>
The best answer to this is to help the novice to continue working on safe driving techniques and strategies during the first year and longer.<p>
The following summary of defensive driving techniques will provide you with some important insights into doing this. These are techniques that need to be studied and worked at constantly, so that they become an INSTINCTIVE part of the driver's habits. They aren't as simple as they seem - in fact many drivers don't seem to understand them at all - so it might be a good idea to read more about them in your teen's driver education text book.<p>

<H3>DEFENSIVE DRIVING TECHNIQUES</H3><p>

Being a good defensive driver means more than just being cautious. And mere experience isn't enough either. The good defensive driver has to WORK at developing good driving techniques. The following is a summary of the defensive driving concepts commonly covered in driver education courses:<p>

<H4>Managing Space and Time</H4><p>

This concept is critical to defensive driving. The driver must have space to maneuver and time to react. The following time rules help the novice to compensate for inexperience and are invaluable in reducing risk in traffic.<p>

<b>The 2-second rule:</b>
This provides safe spacing when following another car at any speed. By noting when a car ahead of you passes a fixed point and counting your time to reach that point you can determine whether your spacing is safe. Two seconds (count "one thousand and one, one thousand and two") is the minimum safe space. This should be practiced from the passenger seat!  The beginner will then develop a "sense" of what a safe space is at different speeds.<p>

<b>The 4-second stopping rule:</b>
This is an approximate guide to stopping distance at speeds over 60 kph. Choose a fixed point on the roadway ahead and count the seconds until you get there. If you count four seconds, that point indicated your minimum stopping distance.<p>

<b>The 12-second visual lead time:</b>
Ideally the defensive driver is anticipating traffic movements and potential hazards as far away as the point the car will reach in 12 seconds. Within this distance the driver should scan the scene, including the sidewalks, and make adjustments to speed and position as necessary.<p>

<H4>The Smith System</H4><p>

The Smith System provides five rules for training the eyes to see what is important in driving. They are:<p>

<ol><li>Aim high (to steer accurately and anticipate problems)
<li>Keep your eyes moving (avoid fixed stare, stay alert)
<li>Get the big picture (don't allow your eyes to be drawn to one area)
<li>Leave yourself an 'out' (practice the 'what if. ..' game)
<li>Make sure they see you (when there's conflict for space make eye contact with other driver).</ol><p>

These rules sound simple but it takes considerable practice to develop the habit of using them at all times in traffic.<p>

Using the Smith System, the driver always tries to keep "space for the car and visibility for the driver". These two strategies allow the driver to use the five rules most effectively, always having time to scan the scene around the car and adjust speed and position to minimize hazards.<p>

<H4>The I.P.D.E. System (Identify, Predict, Decide, Execute)</h4><p>

Some programs use this 4-step process to help drivers organize their thinking when making decisions in traffic. With it go the concepts of:<p>

<ul><li>Isolating - Keeping space between your car and potential problems
<li>Stabilizing - Avoiding sudden changes in speed or direction
<li>Separation - Avoiding having to deal with many problems at once
<li>Compromising - Reducing conflicts for space and avoiding "pressure" in traffic situations.</ul><p>

<h4>The Ground Viewing Habit</h4><p>

Drivers judge the speed and direction of other vehicles by relating to the ground around them. If the driver ahead in the lane next to you, for example, begins to move over into your lane you will detect this movement earlier by glancing or using your peripheral vision to relate his movement to the lane markings. The ground viewing habit is also useful in detecting the feet of pedestrians behind parked cars.<p>

<h4>Road Commentary Driving</H4><p>

This technique is used with more advanced drivers. The driver is asked to do a running commentary on what hazards or factors he or she is taking into account while driving. ("Car turning left ahead", "approaching crosswalk", "car overtaking in the left lane", etc.)<p>

This is an excellent technique for improving seeing habits and making drivers more aware of how much they can see if they work at improving visual habits.  However, it takes practice to apply this technique effectively. It's best to start off with one or two items such as crosswalks or speed limit signs.<p>

<h4>Attitude</h4><p>

Attitude determines how knowledge and skills will be used. It determines whether a driver will be cooperative or competitive in traffic, whether he or she will accept a high level or risk of put into practice the concepts taught on defensive driving courses.<p>

It is the single most important element in defensive driving and the most difficult one to influence.<p>

Some driver education programs use the concept of Parent, Child, and Adult attitude states to help drivers identify and control attitudes that affect their driving behavior.<p>

These attitude states are expressions of personality. The "parent" state is caring, protective, but also critical and punishing. It imitates how parents relate to children. The "child" attitude state is freely expressive, impulsive, and reacts to events in a naive way. The "adult" state is the thinking, reasoning one that asks questions and tries to select the best behavior.<p>

<h4>Planning</h4>

It's important to plan practice sessions, particularly the early ones. Decide where to go and what you are going to do before setting out. Take some care in selecting a suitable area.<p>

The introduction to the car might be done in the driveway. (This should be thorough. Don't assume anything.)  First attempts at controlling the  car should be made in an area where the learner can concentrate on the response of the machine to the controls without having to worry about traffic or obstacles.<p>

A large deserted parking lot is ideal.<p>

Emphasize the coordination of hands and feet in these parking lot sessions. The beginner driver tends to forget the hands while using the feet and the feet while using the hands. This can lead to serious problems on the street, for example, the driver may freeze on the gas pedal while struggling to steer around a turn.<p>

Once the beginner can comfortably control the speed and direction of the car, practice should be moved to the street. The next stage of learning to drive is developing good street sense.<p>

Accurate lane driving and positioning for turns are important for communication as well as traffic flow. Beginners often feel that they are in the center of their lane when they are not and frequently position badly for turns.<p>

It's important to make them realize that changes in speed and direction are interpreted by other drivers and that they are just as much a means of communication as the turn signals.<p>

For early practice in using street space, try to find quiet streets with rectangular blocks. Curves, parked cars, traffic, distract the learner from the main task of judging speed and position.<p>

Later these can be gradually introduced and the beginner can be shown how to deal with the hidden spaces behind parked cars, oncoming cars, pedestrians, and so on.<p>

The keynote here is awareness. The beginner must be made aware of ALL the factors involved in these basic roadway situations.<p>

<b>Equipment:</b>  One of the most valuable pieces of equipment driving instructors install in their cars is a second rear view mirror. As co-driver you can use this to monitor traffic behind. This makes practice sessions much more relaxing. Learning to judge space and timing when using the rear view mirror takes considerable practice and the beginner can do this while sitting in the passenger seat. A good mirror with hinged adjustment can be purchased quite cheaply at auto accessory stores and it's certainly a worthwhile investment. However, remember that this second mirror creates an extra blind spot so be careful where you place it.<p>

Random driving can lead to problems where beginner drivers are concerned. It's all too easy for the inexperienced beginner to get into a situation that he or she can't handle. A tense beginner, suddenly surrounded by traffic, for example, may freeze up and be unable to function at all.<p>

An experienced instructor with dual controls might handle such a situation easily, but for a parent - inexperienced in such matters - it could lead to an accident!<p>

It's good idea to give beginner drivers as much accompanied driving time as possible both before and after licensing. But don't use them randomly as a chauffeur to drive to shops, school, or on summer trips, until they are competent in all the basic traffic situations.<p>

Make an effort to evaluate your teenager's abilities before going out on the  public street to practice. Some will have acquired considerable driving related skills from other activities, for example riding a bicycle, operating "go-carts"  or even from video games that require hand-eye coordination and attention dividing skills. Others may need to start at the very basics.<p>

... and remember, some beginners may give the impression of being confident and in control but may, in fact, by totally unprepared to deal with any sudden change in conditions and very reliant on you, the co-driver, for guidance and even assistance in  control.<p>

<h4>Practice Hints</h4><p>

Decide what you're going to do and where you're going to do it before each practice session. This will help avoid the complications of getting caught up in situations you hadn't planned on or prepared for.<p>

<b>Communicate clearly:</b>  Give directions well in advance and try to always use the same terms (don't say accelerator one time and gas pedal the next, for example). It's difficult to drive a car if you don't have a clear idea of where you're going or what you are going to do next.<p>

<b>Don't hit the beginner with everything at once:</b>  a simple right turn, for example, involves several steps - checking mirrors, signaling, checking blind areas, braking, positioning, checking for traffic before the turn, steering, and recovery. To expect a beginner to follow all of these correctly during the early sessions is asking too much. Concentrate on braking and steering first and then work in the rest.<p>

<b>Keep the risk level low:</b>  Try to anticipate problems and avoid awkward situations. Choosing the right location for practice sessions is an important factor here.<p>

<b>Be ready to give timely assistance:</b> Cueing the beginner to brake or steer before he or she gets into trouble may save you an accident. Last second warnings can lead to panic.<p>

<b>Don't get excited during practice sessions:</b> This communicates itself quickly to the driver and can make performance difficult.<p>

<b>Don't overload:</b>  A big part of being an instructor or co-driver is reminding the driver to check traffic and to signal and to bring attention to potential hazards. But once again, remember that everything you say is also a distraction for the driver. Be sparing in your comments and, above all, try to avoid letting the beginner get into situations he or she can't handle.<p>

<b>Be positive:</b>  Compliment the learner driver on doing things well. Comments such as "good turn", "good steering", or "good speed", give the beginner assurance and reinforce this behavior. It's easy to fall into the trap of making a constant stream of negative comments. This makes for a very poor learning situation and can badly undermine confidence. It's important here that the co-driver making the comments has a good sense of space and timing in traffic and is capable of evaluating skills. Otherwise it's all too easy to reinforce poor driving behavior.<p>

<b>Stop and discuss:</b>  When your teen makes a mistake he or she may not be clear as to what went wrong. Explaining and discussing while on the move is not very effective. The beginner is too busy driving!  Stop as soon as you can, while the mistake is still fresh in the memory, and sort out the problem. Don't jump on every mistake, however, and make a big thing of it. This will affect the beginner's confidence and concentration on the driving task.<p>

<b>Don't clash with what the professional driving instructor teaches:</b> If your teen is doing something that you think is incorrect and maintains that the driving instructor teaches this way - talk to the driving instructor. Student drivers often misunderstand or wrongly interpret their instructor's directions.<p>

<b>Don't present yourself as the complete expert on driving:</b> Driving is a complex task with many aspects to it and , as an amateur, your attitude should be one of willingness to learn. This will be a good example to your teenager.<p>

<h4>After Licensing</h4>

Don't allow your teenager full driving privileges immediately after getting a licence.<p>

The first year of driving is a high risk period for the beginner. Inexperience combined with lack of skill means that one in five male l6-year old drivers and about one in 10 females will have an accident during their first year of driving.<p> 

Statistics show another risk peak after 18 months to two years when increasing skill and experience may lead to over-confidence. By this time habits are accumulating and the driver is devoting less and less conscious attention to the task of driving. Some of the habits accumulated will be good ones but others will be potentially dangerous, needing only the right (or wrong!) circumstances to become the cause of an accident.<p>

Some supervision during these early driving experiences will help enormously in making the teenage driver safer.<p>

The newly licensed driver needs help in learning to handle the great variety of roadway and traffic situations that every driver faces today. Timely hints and reminders will be invaluable.<p>

It's a good idea to keep track of the kinds of driving situations your teen has experienced and to gradually work in new ones (for example, night driving, rain, snow, freeways, heavy traffic, passing on the open highway, and so on.)<p>

<b>Bad habits to watch for:</b>  These are habits that begin to "creep-in" immediately after licensing and if allowed to accumulate, they become like time bombs that, sooner or later, lead to accidents.<p>

<ul><li>Forgetting to signal.
<li>Sloppy turns (especially left turns) that cut across other drivers' traffic lanes.
<li>Omitting the head check or blind area check when changing lanes.
<li>Following too closely.
<li>Forgetting to reduce speed when approaching potential hazards. (This is a primary cause of accidents.)
<li>Sudden changes in speed or direction that can catch other drivers by surprise.
<li>Backing up without turning the head and checking thoroughly behind.
<li>Accelerating through  amber lights.
<li>Continuing through changing traffic lights later and later.
<li>Allowing attention to wander more and more from the driving task.
<li>Increasing laxity in obeying speed limits, stop signs, and other traffic rules.
<li>Sloppy predriving habits (remember predriving habits set the 'tone' for driving and are important psychologically).
<li>Disregard for other drivers' problems on the highway (for example the driver who needs to change lanes or pull into traffic).</ul><p>

<h4>Warning!</h4><p>

Safe driving is very much a matter of seeing what needs to be seen and making good decisions. An extensive Indiana University study cited IMPROPER LOOKOUT and INATTENTION as being the most commonly identified causes of traffic  accidents.<p>

In the case of improper lookout the driver very often had "looked but did not see". The majority of these errors occurred at intersections. The most common event that drivers failed to attend to was "traffic stopped or slowing ahead".<p>

The driving environment holds many traps for the inattentive driver. It can play tricks on the eyes. Roadway illusions are the cause of many accidents, safety experts suspect. Especially at night time. Curves look easier than they really are, red lights look farther away, lighting plays tricks.<p>

The driver with just a year or two experience may be particularly susceptible to these traps. This will be especially true if the alertness of the eyes and the ability to judge are impaired by fatigue or drugs such as alcohol and some medications.<P>

<H1>New Curriculum<BR> to Revolutionize Driver Training</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Mar. 1995)</I><P>
<blockquote>
The emphasis on outcomes that's been driving a strong wind of change through educational systems everywhere is about to hit driver education. 
<P>
Boring classroom sessions will become a thing of the past. Time-wasting "joy rides" with instructors will go too, and everything that the  driver education community does will become subject to close scrutiny and hard-nosed decisions about its value in achieving training and education goals and objectives. 
<P>
That's the thrust of a summary of a Novice Driver Education Model Curriculum Outline just released by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. 
<P>
The summary is not so much a blueprint for a curriculum as a proposal for revolution - it points directions in which all kinds of initiatives, from graduated licensing to parent involvement and community participation, will play a role in shaping how new drivers are trained and how their attitudes will be shaped as they embark on their driving careers. 
<P>
"The new driver education," the summary states, "will not be the result of a single top-down exercise, nor will there be a single, monolithic curriculum. It will develop in a pluralistic and competitive way, although governments may need to expand their role by setting standards and coordinating efforts. It will include families, communities, and youth groups as well as schools."
<P>
In other words, sitting students in a classroom or a car for so many hours, having them pass paper and pencil tests, and then letting them proceed through the system, will no longer do. The students will have to demonstrate their skills and knowledge. 
<P>
That has interesting implications for the way driver training and education are conducted now. Managers have become skilled at processing students, but with other agendas intruding excessively on the safety goals of programs (For example, meeting commercial bottom-line requirements or providing additional income for an already-busy high school teacher). 
<P>
"At the moment, the delivery system is good at meeting time requirements," says educator Owen Crabb, "but if the time requirements were thrown out the window and only outcomes counted, how would programs fare?" The emphasis on outcomes will reverberate throughout the system in a profound way, Crabb believes.  
<P>
Obviously, a very challenging time is ahead for the driver training/education community. Developments will be taking place across a broad spectrum-from interactive multi-media learning programs to community-based activities and parent involvement. "The driver education industry must lead the educational and organizational change that's needed if driver education is to become an effective safety intervention," the AAA report urges.<P>

Proposed definitions of safe driving</H1>
<H3>An attempt to clear the road for more effective driver education</H3>
<p>

<i>Abstract from a paper by Pierro Hirsch, of Montreal, Quebec</i><p>
<blockquote>
A survey of traffic accident literature reveals a marked lack of agreement on what constitutes a valid measure of safe driving. Nor does there appear to be any strong support for a single coherent theoretical model to explain or to account for the occurrance of driving collisions. <p>The only consensus shared by researchers seems to be that involvement in an automobile collision is not, by itself, considered to be a reliable indicator of "unsafe" driving. This discussion paper suggests that one of the reasons for this overall lack of clarity may be a general tendency to confuse the interrelated but distinctly different concepts of "legal" and "safe" driving. <p>A definition of "safe" driving is proposed and contrasted with "legal" driving and a basis for a cognitive approach to collision-prevention training and driver licence evaluation is suggested. <p>

<H1>Some predictions on driver ed</H1><P><blockquote>Several years ago, as president of the American Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association, John Harvey identified some trends in driver training and education that would characterize the decade of the nineties.<P>
  
A national campaign would be necessary to keep the public's attention focused on traffic deaths, he predicted, otherwise the problem would fade into the background as more sensational problems such as AIDS and crime took the spotlight. That observation proved to be on target.<P>
 
Harvey, who is Regional Traffic Safety Education Coordinator for Service District 101 in Washington State, also predicted that governments would toughen up license requirements and impose harsher penalties for driving infractions. These predictions, too, seem to be right on track.<P>

<H4>Graduated licensing</H4><P>

The province of Ontario has just introduced a two-phase system of graduated licensing which will involve a second driving test for license applicants, and a number of jurisdictions are considering similar initiatives. <P>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration supports the trend to graduated licensing and also a two-phase system of training/education for drivers. Legislation to support states in developing tougher licensing standards and tougher penalties for violators is before Congress.<P> 

<H4>Shortage of instructors</H4><P>

Fewer universities are involved in training driver education teachers these days, Harvey says, and he sees a critical shortage of adequately-trained instructors ahead as an aging populaton of teachers reaches retirement. This concern is also expressed by the American Automobile Association, which has stepped up its efforts to provide instructor training.<P>
 
"Validation" will be the theme for curriculum development over the next few years, Harvey feels. He predicts an increasing emphasis on student-centered performance objectives, criterion reference tests, and instructional materials that have been tested for effectiveness.<P>

Harvey also sees a trend towards qualitative changes in the way programs operate. Curriculum will be connected to other social and educational issues, he says, and there will be an increase in partnerships with communities through Community Traffic Safety Programs.  These partnerships, he predicts, will be the key to maintaining strong driver ed.<P>

<H1>The Dilemma of What to Teach</H1><P><H4>By Dan Keegan</H4>
<blockquote><P>
Shortly after midnight not long ago, six young people climbed into a station wagon and left a party in a small rural area. One was dropped off not far from the party and the other five continued along the winding country road.<P>

With its dips, curves and hills, the road was not one for speed. There was no safe place for passing. The station wagon carrying the five youths came up fast behind another car then tailgated so closely the car's occupants so closely they thought it would hit the back bumper.<P>

Inexplicably, the driver of the station wagon pulled out to pass just at the crest of a hill. The driver of a third car coming the other way probably didn't have a chance. In addition to the youths in the station wagon, three of the five occupants in the other car were also killed.<P>

The crash was a classic case of all the risks associated with teen-driving tragedies - late at night, a crowded car, possible drinking (beer bottles were found in the wreckage) and poor judgment. The huge media response and the calls for tougher regulation and more education were predictable.<P>

Whether graduated licensing, now being introduced in many jurisdictions, will reduce the risk faced by novice drivers has been widely discussed. Even more debatable is the effectiveness of driver education as a countermeasure. 
Uncertain benefits<P>

The great variety in approaches to training and educating drivers around the world testifies to the uncertainty about what training can do and how best to do it. Few jurisdictions have mandatory programs. In many countries, nothing more than a very simple quiz on the rules and a 10 to 15-minute road test stand between a license applicant and full driving privileges. <P>At the other extreme. Germany prohibits new drivers from practising even with parents or friends until they've received instruction from a highly-trained professional. 
Underlying the many approaches is the fact that we really don't know what training and education can accomplish. <P>The most comprehensive study undertaken was initiated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 1978, involving 16,000 high school students in De Kalb County, Georgia. The students were divided into a control group, a group that got the standard 30-hour "Pre-Driver Licensing" (PDL) training traditionally offered in U.S. high schools, and a third group that received a special, enhanced "Safe Performance Curriculum" (SPC) of about 80 hours.<P>
The study provided no evidence for driver education. In an interesting twist, the more highly-trained SPC students actually had slightly more crashes than the PDL group. One explanation was that the more polished driving of the SPC group gave them more access to the family car and more opportunity to crash. According to Dr. Jack Weaver, the study's director, follow-up research seemed to bear this out.<P>
In the aftermath of the De Kalb study, support for driver education declined and funding for school programs withered. The flow of energy and ideas also dried up, many programs continued purely on inertia and quality plummeted. The driver-training and education community never accepted the study as a valid test. <P>The commercial-training community was particularly critical, pointing out that the type of programs tested in De Kalb typically offered a mere four to six hours of in-car training. The good news was that the study forced a complete re-evaluation of what driver education is all about.<P>
<H4>Much opinion, little research</H4><P>
One prominent researcher, Patricia Waller, of the University of Michigan, questions whether driver education is understood at all. She opposed the De Kalb study in the first place, believing that the criteria for evaluating safe driving were based on opinion, not research. "An opinion survey among instructors and other professionals in the field decided what concepts programs would teach, rather than any basis of human factors research," she says. more and more voices have been added to the call for basic research into the specifics of training and educating drivers.<P>
Dr. Mike Smith, of NHTSA has taken a keen interest in the De Kalb study and its aftermath. He believes the problem is more a matter of how driver training and education are presented rather than what's presented. He doesn't see further research revealing anything dramatically new or different to teach. It's more a question of timing than anything else, he feels. Trying to teach novices everything at once, before they get a license, isn't effective because they simply can't absorb the information.<P>
"When the teacup is full," he says, "there's no point in pouring more into it."<P>
"We need a minimum of two different levels of training," says Smith. "The initial level would teach basic vehicle handling and control skills. After that, novices need to gain experience in basic vehicle handling. Then, I would bring them back and give them safe-driving information, teach appropriate decision-making skills, reduced risk taking and so on, both in the classroom and behind the wheel." <P>Smith sees some kind of graduated licensing as the structure in which to set these instructional levels.<P>
<H4>Constellation of behavior</H4><P>
The need to redesign how we educate drivers is now obvious. The challenge is what form the redesign should take.<P>
Canada' Alberta Motor Association tackled this problem at a 1993 conference on developing a curriculum for novice drivers. A multidisciplinary group representing traffic safety research, education, sociology, psychology, health communication, media, design and technology spent two days at the University of Alberta pondering the issue.<P>
The participants generally agreed that the constellation of attitudes and behaviors typically associated with youth in particular could not be dealt with in a one-shot education experience. As well as basic training, educators somehow need to effectively address risk perceptions, attitudes and values.<P>
Dr. Christian Heinrich, of the German Federal Highway Research Institute's Driver Behavior Branch, and Canadian traffic sociologist J. Peter Rothe explained that the traffic and social environments both play a vital role determining how after-licensing experiences shape  driver behavior.<P>
According to Heinrich, as drivers experience their driving environment, they may make wrong assumptions about risk based on what they get away with. Guidance in the early stages can alert them to these wrong assumptions. Rothe pointed out that social risks often outrank driving risks when drivers make decisions - for example, teens who decide that the immediate consequence of calling home to tell a parent they're too impaired to drive outweighs the more remote risk of having a crash or being caught. Educational interventions, said Rothe, must deal with these social considerations.<P>
At the Alberta conference, the idea of a one-shot curriculum exploded into a multiplicity of new questions about what should be taught, the kinds of educational experiences needed, and the most effective media.<P>
These, then, are the challenges that lie ahead for the training and education community. Basic training should be redesigned according to more realistic expectations of outcomes. Follow-up education should include issue-oriented, discussion-type forums that are far more likely than lectures to alter the type of perceptions that lead to tragedies like the crash described at the beginning of this article.<P>
As John Palmer, Chair of Traffic safety and Health Sciences at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, pointed out to participants at the Alberta conference, properly directed discussion forums often dispel the myths teenagers have about their how their peers feel about risk behavior.<P>
What is emerging from all the discussion is that the driver training and education community must offer a more diverse range of capabilities. The instructor who teaches the beginner the basics of operating a car in traffic will be only one link in the chain. The rest of the chain must include traffic education in kindergarten, bicycle education, post-licensing training, and programs that branch out to health, socialization ,law and civic responsibility.<P>

<H1>Alberta's privatized driver testing</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, June. 1994)</I><P>
<blockquote>
In November 1993, the province of Alberta introduced what it called a "one-window approach" to the delivery of registry and licensing services. Registry services such as vehicle registration, driver examinations and licensing, land title, lien and corporate searches, and selected land-related and vital statistics services are now delivered through private agencies. 
<P>
Under this system, driver license road tests are being delivered by government-designated driver examiners who have established a business relationship with private issuing agents or who choose to offer these services independently. No one may be designated as an examiner who is owner, part owner, shareholder, partner in, or employee of a driving school.
<P>
There are currently 125 designated driver examiners in the province, many of them former government examiners who accepted the opportunity to become designated private sector examiners. 
<P>
The change has certainly speeded up the process of getting a road test, says Calgary driving school owner Janice Elliot. "You can get one today," Elliot told a recent conference of driving school owners in Ontario. "You can get one in an hour in some places," she said. 
<P>
The change to privatized testing has brought allegations of poor quality testing and a dramatic lowering of standards. There have been rumours of $5 tests being advertised on street corners. But these are just rumours, says Registries spokesperson Jeanette Espie-Lefebvre. "Examiners couldn't make a living at that price. As far as we can determine, they're charging about the same as was charged under the government system ($15), sometimes more in rural areas. The going rate is $15 to $20." 
<P>
Monitoring and auditing of driver examiners is carried out by 14 Driver Testing Administrators who are government employees based in Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge and Red Deer. Monitoring of administrative requirements, ride alongs and client consultations are being used to maintain testing quality and fairness. 
<P>
Applicants for the position of examiner must have a Class Five driver licence in good standing, two years without suspension, less than four demerit points, no criminal record, a grade 12 education, and pass a comprehensive knowledge and road test. The application fee is $50 and applicants must complete a 7-day training program which costs $550 for basic classification examiners.<P>

<H1>International driver's license invaluable</H1><P><H4>By Dan Keegan</H4>
<P><blockquote>
<P>For the small cost involved, an International Driving Permit is a wise investment if you're thinking of driving while abroad. And even if you're not actually planning to drive, who knows? Your plans might change so why not be prepared.<P>
Essentially, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is proof that you hold a valid driver's licence in your own country.<P>
It may not be absolutely necessary to have it, since most countries recognize each other's licenses. but possessing an IDP has many advantages.<P>
The permit is intended to overcome the difficulties drivers might have while travelling by car in other countries that may have widely varying license requirements.<P>
The authorization for the IDP has its basis in international conventions on road safety. There were conventions in 1923, 1943, 1949 and 1968 which established rules for IDPs.<P>
One of the main advantages of the IDP, which is easy to apply for and doesn't involve taking a driving test, is that it is printed in 10 languages - the five United Nations official languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese) plus German Arabic, Italian, the Scandinavian languages and Portuguese.<P>
It's easy to imagine how this might solve problems. If you're stopped by the police for some reason, or you need identification, you can present a document that may be in the local language, or at least can be understood.<P>
There are other advantages, too.<P>
If you're in an accident, or need to rent a car, it can be invaluable. In fact, in more than 40 countries you can't rent a car at all unless you have an IDP. For driving in Europe, travel officials say the IDP is more necessary in some countries than others, but it's advised for most.<P></blockquote><HR>

<H1>Ontario moves to graduated licensing</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, June. 1994)</I><P>
<blockquote>
Ontario moved very quickly, during the past year, to become the first jurisdiction in North America to adopt a full-fledged graduated driver licensing (GDL) system for all new drivers. 
<P>
Following cabinet endorsement in June 1993, the legislation for GDL moved quickly through the system and by December it had passed into law. This was record-breaking speed, according to Assistant Deputy Minister and Registrar for Motor Vehicles Kim Devooght. And it reflects the extent of government commitment to the initiative and a level of public support that's been estimated as high as 87%. 
<P>
The system was initiated on April 1, 1994, and will be fully implemented as of June 6. It's a two-level system with provision for a road test in each level and restrictions that are gradually lifted as drivers move through.<P>
Drivers coming from jurisdictions outside the province that have driver licensing exchange agreements with Ontario (all Canadian provinces and territories, the United States and Japan) are exempt from the conditions of GDL provided they have at least two years' driving experience. <P>
These drivers will receive an Ontario driver's license without having to complete a knowledge test or road test, provided they meet all the medical requirements. 
<P>
Licensed drivers from these jurisdictions with less than two years driving experience will be allowed to enter Level Two of the GDL system, and they can take a Level Two road test to become fully licensed after they have accumulated two years' driving experience under the system. 
<P>
Drivers from jurisdictions without a licensing agreement with Ontario must meet all medical requirements and pass a vision and knowledge test on the rules of the road. If they don't have proof of more than two years' driving experience they will be treated as new drivers. If they do have such proof, they will be allowed to take a Level Two road test and become fully licensed drivers if they pass it.If they fail, they can schedule a Level One road test.<P>
 
All drivers holding a class `L'(Car) or Class `R'(Motorcycle) learner's license before April 1, 1994, were allowed to continue under the existing system. However, they must pass their road test before June 6, 1994 to avoid the graduated system. If they don't pass this test before June 6, they enter Level Two of the graduated system. 
<P>

<H4>Anxious new drivers</H4><P>

Prior to the initial implementation date of April 1, 1994, aspiring new drivers almost literally invaded driver examination centers in an attempt to squeeze through before being caught in the GDL mesh. One center in downtown Toronto reported that, for a two-week period in March, applications for learner permits soared from the normal rate of about 150-200 per day to more than 700 per day. <P>
At some centers police had to be called in to maintain order in the line-ups and even that, said one examiner, didn't prevent friction between impatient applicants.<P>


<H4>License costs go up</H4><P>
 

The cost of an Ontario driver's license will increase considerably under the new system. The previous charge of $31 covered the knowledge test, vision test, road test, and a charge for the license itself. New rates were announced recently: $10 for the knowledge test; $40 for the Level One road test; $75 for the Level Two road test. Novice drivers exiting the graduated system will pay an additional $50 for a five-year driver's license, bringing the total to $175.<P>
 

<H4>The second road test</H4><P>


A prototype of the Level Two road test has been developed by consultants Engel and Townsend under contract to the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Data analysis from field tests conducted over the summer will be used to finalise test procedures, set examiner training, and set passing scores based on norms provided by the field test data. A final version should be ready by early 1995. The same prototype is being used for the development of a Level Two motorcycle test.  
<P>
The prototype is based on a similar test (also developed by Engel and Townsend) now being used for commercial drivers throughout the U.S. The U.S. Commercial Driver License test is the first research-based driver license test to be developed and used in North America. <P>
It cost over $1,000,000 to develop and it emphasised three key factors: what behaviours are involved in safe driving; what the examiner has to do to see the driver performing these behaviours; and what criteria the examiner can use to decide whether the driver performed these behaviours correctly. The test relies on a high standard of examiner training and consistency in scoring license applicants. 
<P>
An interim Level Two test, which is an extended version of the pre-GDL road test, will be used until the prototype is finalised.<P><H3>FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW IN ONTARIO</H3><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, June. 1994)</I><P>

Under the old licensing system, new drivers in Ontario had to pass a vision test and a written test (40 questions) to obtain an `L' or learner's license. Then they were required to wait a minimum of three days before taking a road test. Successful completion of the road test gave them a two-year probationary licence. 
<P>
Graduated licensing began on April 1, 1994 and was fully implemented on June 6.<P>
<P>

Ads bring down <BR>Aussie road deaths...temporarily</H1><P>


<I>(Driver/Education, June 1993)</I><P>
<blockquote>
The power of accurately focussed advertising to change driver behavior has been demonstrated very effectively in the Australian State of Victoria. 
A few years ago, traffic fatalities were approaching a 10-year high and it seemed the public were becoming complacent about it. New York-based Grey Advertising Inc. was given the task of developing a tough advertising campaign to combat the carnage. The campaign is reckoned to have played a major part in making Victorian roads among the safest in the world.<P>

Advertising researchers found that focus groups were little affected by the kind of brutal advertisements featuring smashed cars and bodies, often used in such campaigns. "We found that when you're dealing with death, people are pretty quick to bring the shutters down," said Greg Harper, a Grey partner. "They laughed at the commercials."<P>

Grey came up with a new genre of commercials that focussed on the effects of crashes on others. They found that people don't worry as much about being killed themselves as they do about killing or causing hurt to someone else, particularly someone they love. One commercial featured a mother cradling a son killed on a crosswalk by a speeder; another a youth with a broken neck crying over a brother he'd killed in a drunk driving crash.<P>

Victoria road deaths last year were half the 1989 total It's reported that auto body shop business is down by a third and there's a shortage of donated transplant organs. The effects of the commercials seems to be short-lived, however. When the ads were stopped, the crash rate immediately started to rise again.<P>

<h1>Animal hazards on the highway</h1><p>

<h4>By David Thompson</h4><p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Driving, like hitting a curve ball or a triple axle, is a psychomotor skill that relies on the pre-programming of the sub-conscious in the bio-computer we call a brain. Reacting instantly, accurately, thus avoiding accidents, is very much dependent on effectively preparing yourself to deal instinctively and correctly with dangerous surprises.<p>

Not long ago as Jane, my best friend and chief chef, was about to pop the marinated flank steak on the grill, there came a thunderous banging on our front door. We live "out in the country" so uninvited, post-sundown visitors are rare indeed. So rare that Jane said: "Someone is banging on the front door. Would you please see who it is?"<p>

I put down my end-of-day lubricant and proceeded to investigate this rude interruption. As I turned on the porch light and looked out through the vertical glass panel beside the front door, I was appalled and terrified by the apparition who stood howling on our front porch. 
Here was a young man of average height and weight, soot-blackened and clothes burned half off, blood coursing down the left side of his face and open, bleeding wounds on the forehead, hands and knees. Someone in awesome pain.<p>

Beyond our house, the road continues uninhabited, northward through pine forest and tobacco field for another mile and a half. Our young man was returning home from his job as a chef, southbound along this gravel road in the dark. A deer leapt in front of his truck from left to right and our young man instinctively swerved to the right to avoid hitting it.<p>

Had he made this move in any other of the 7,290 feet of that gravel road he would simply have gone into last year's tobacco stubble or the scrub brush. Instead, he went over a sharp drop-off which ends at a 30-year-old Douglas fir tree. In  about three seconds, the truck rolled, struck the tree and the gas tank exploded in flames.<p>

Our young man was about to die. Somehow the gods saw fit to leave him conscious enough to know that if he did not kick out a window and crawl away, he would surely die on the spot.<p>

He did crawl out and then walked the third of a mile to our house. We got him an EMS ambulance and happily he is now recovering at a local burn centre. It took 200 stitches to close the wounds. But he's going to be fine.<p>

So what's the point of all this? Here's the point. This is the third story of this type that I've heard in three years. Driver swerves to avoid hitting animal ... you know the rest. 
Jane and I would be devastated if some driver were to strike Buckie, our In-Your-Face Gordon Setter, or Dewey, our Get-Out-Of-My-House cat. But it would be much worse if someone died trying to avoid that contact.<p>

So here's the bottom line. No matter how much of an animal lover you may be. No matter how much you are sickened by the sight of dead dogs, cats, deer, raccoons or birds along the highway, ask yourself this question. Better your son or daughter than the dead animal? I don't think so.<p>

So start now to pre-program your mind to instantaneously grit your teeth and hit  the damned thing. Our young man has third degree burns over at least half of his body, a shattered right arm and a long convalescence because he instinctively did the "humane" thing and tried to avoid the deer.<p>

Had he gone ahead and hit the deer, he might have (but probably not) totalled his truck. Certainly, he'd have walked away whole. The alternatives are ugly, but the choice is clear.<p>

<H1>Daytime running lights: A warning</H1><P> <H4>By Dan Keegan</H4>
<P>
<blockquote>
<P>As more cars use daytime running lights, the risk to drivers not using them will steadily increase, according to Transport Canada studies. 
Starting with the 1990 model-year, the federal government ordered all cars sold in Canada must have Daytime Running Lights (DRLs).<P>

The effectiveness of daytime lights in reducing accidents has been proven by research in a number of countries, including Canada, the U.S., Finland and Sweden. The systems have been shown to reduce multiple vehicle collisions by as much as 32 per cent. Finland was the first to make their use mandatory in 1972. Sweden followed suit in 1977.<P>
But Transport Canada's research into the use of daytime lights showed another effect, one that will become more important as daytime running lights become a standard part of the driving scene. Drivers who don't have daytime running lights run a risk of being "masked" by drivers who do. 
Research carried out for Transport Canada in the mid-'70s by Dr. Dennis Atwood, showed that drivers meeting a line of cars in a passing situation were more likely to miss an oncoming car without headlights if it were surrounded by cars that had headlights on.<P>
Atwood's results played a large part in the change in Ontario's traffic laws requiring automobile headlights to be switched on one hour earlier in the evening and switched off one hour later in the morning.<P>
The masking effect, which Atwood attributed to either the glare or the distraction effect of the headlights (or a combination of both) was strongest at dawn and dusk and increase rapidly as the level of light dropped off. 
At sunset, the light level can drop by a factor of 10 in as little as 10 minutes, he says, and the risk increases rapidly for drivers not switching on their headlights.<P>
Atwood believes that as a greater proportion of drivers begin using daytime running lights, the danger of masking will increase for those left without them.<P>
Daytime running light systems have a lower intensity than low beam headlights and last longer with less energy use.<P>
While the biggest advantage of the systems is when natural light is low, such as at dusk or dawn or when skies are overcast, research indicates that they are also an advantage even on bright, sunny days.<P>
Because the human eye is light-seeking, drivers will see an oncoming car sooner and make a more accurate estimate of its rate of approach.<P>
The effect is particularly important for peripheral vision, which may not see an object at all unless it contrasts sharply with its background or moves against it. Using daytime lights significantly reduces the chances of a car, cyclist or pedestrian moving unexpectedly into your path.<P>
Atwood suggests that drivers of cars that don't have daytime running lights as a standard feature purchase a retrofit kit rather than using low beams.<P>

<H1>Front-wheel handbrake an anomaly</H1><P>
Driver/Ed, 1994<P>
<blockquote>


Everyone knows that a car's handbrake is connected to the rear wheels, right? 
In most cases the answer is yes, unless you happen to own a Subaru Loyale or one of Subaru's sporty XT series. These cars represent a bit of an anomaly because their handbrake is linked to the front wheels.<P>
 
Explains Richard Marsan, Technical Services Manager with Subaru Canada Ltd. in Montreal: "The handbrake is basically an emergency brake. And looking at things from an engineering standpoint, Subaru manufacturer Fuji decided to install it on the front disks, which are larger and provide more stopping power.<P>
"Stopping a car with only one set of brakes, front or rear, is never too satisfactory because the vehicle tends to slip all over the place, especially in bad weather," Marsan adds. "This skidding effect is really very evident where the handbrake is connected to the rear wheels, as in most cars."<P>
There's little chance of inducing a front wheel skid with the Loyale or XT handbrake, Marsan says. "The Loyale weighs around 2,800 pounds and you'd need the strength of an Arnold Schwarzenegger to lock up the front end," he adds. <P>The handbrake, of course, requires more strength to apply because it is cable-activated rather than hydraulic or power-assisted. Also, there are always trade-offs and the front wheel emergency brake is less efficient when used as a parking brake. <P>If a parked car's disks are hot from driving, for instance, the handbrake shoes will squeeze the expanded disks, possibly causing damage. In addition, when the disk cools and the metal contracts, there's a danger of the car rolling downhill if the brake hasn't been applied firmly in the first place.<P> 
As a result, Fuji has switched back on its newer Legacy, SVX and Impreza models, all of which have disks all round. The handbrake has been connected to a combined drum and disk on the rear wheels.<P> 
"It's not a new idea," says Marsan. "In fact, I think it first appeared on the '66 Porsche. Basically, it consists of a small drum containing the handbrake shoes and surrounded by the disk. In this configuration, the disk provides reinforcement for the drum, preventing any distortion during heavy use."<P>
Why not install a disk/drum combination on the front end? "Firstly, it takes up a lot of room," says Marsan, "and also the front-end handbrake is extremely expensive because it must be engineered to let the wheels turn. Putting it on the rear wheels is really a cost-saving measure."<P>
If you've just got to have a front-wheel handbrake model, better look for a used car. Subaru has already replaced its XT series with the SVX, and the best-selling Loyale has also been phased out.<P>

<H4>Winter handbrake tip</H4><P> 

A car that doesn't have traction control can be stuck if just one wheel is on a slippery surface, even though all the others have excellent traction. Since the differential gear allows the engine to turn the drive wheels of the car at different rates (essential for going around corners), a patch of ice that offers little or no resistance to one of the drive wheels can cause all the power to go to that wheel, leaving the other drive wheel stopped. <P>If the spinning wheel can be slowed down, then power has to transfer to the stopped wheel. 
If the parking brake works on the drivewheels, which it does on pretty well all rear-wheel-drive cars, and also on the front-wheel-drive Subaru described on this page, a trick that may work is to slow the spinning wheel using a slight pressure from the parking brake. <P>If the parking brake slows the spinning wheel, then power has to shift to the stopped wheel. This trick doesn't always work, but it may save a tow if you're stuck sometime.<P>

<H1>Informal vs. Formal Traffic Laws</H1>
<H3>BY Daniel Keegan</H3>
<blockquote>
A traffic ticket and a criminal record for driving at the speed limit? When Ontario teacher Gordon Thompson's story hit the media recently, it triggered a wave of letters and phone calls and even a few editorials. <P>

It was a story that appeared to fall right into the laps of advocates of higher speed limits and present an acute embarrassment for advocates of stricter speed limit enforcement. How could anyone be charged with obeying speed limit laws? <P>

With a sign protesting the 100 km/h limit fixed to his car, Thompson and a friend drove side by side at exactly the limit on Ontario's highway 401 last summer. Between them they created a moving roadblock that infuriated some drivers to the extent that they passed on the shoulders. Every now and then the duo pulled off to relieve the pressure but they kept this up for over 80 km on what is one of the province's major arterial roadways. <P>

They were charged with obstructing the highway and public mischief. The latter, a criminal offense, was later dropped in return for pleading guilty to the obstruction charge. Both wound up with a fine and a six-month license suspension.<P>

The roadblock was Thompson's protest against being fined for doing what drivers do all the time on this stretch of highway -- driving at 115 to 120 km/h, the difference being that Thompson knew the police were behind him. They'd tolerated the 110-112 km/h Thompson said he was traveling at for the previous 10 km. When he pushed the speedometer needle up towards 120, the flashing red lights went on. <P>

In the aftermath of the case, John Weingust Q.C., a lawyer who was prominent in the fight against photo radar, is described in a local newspaper article as being &quot;stunned&quot; by the charges. &quot;At worst,&quot; Weingust said, &quot;Mr. Thompson may have been guilty under the Highway Traffic Act, Section 147, the left-lane bandit provision. The maximum fine for that is $100. His friend in the other car did absolutely nothing wrong.&quot;<P>

However, it&#185;s obvious that Thompson's strict obedience of the law wasn't the real issue here, or the source of the charges. There was much more to this incident that being a left-lane bandit or merely driving too slowly for traffic conditions. The real issue was Thompson's challenge to what traffic sociologist <A HREF="/pde/books.html#beyond">J. Peter Rothe</A> calls &quot;the moral order of the roadway,&quot; the system of trust and expectations that allows drivers and other road users to interact with one another efficiently in the everyday practical circumstances of driving. What Thompson and his friend did was engage in a conspiracy to disrupt the delicate balance between the written law and the moral order.<P>

In this moral order, traffic laws coexist with informal rules in a sort of symbiotic relationship that helps traffic to work efficiently and adapt to situations. The unspoken, undefined nature of these informal rules makes them difficult to discuss and deal with. For police, the written laws are often a tool for enforcing the informal rules and maintaining the checks and balances of the system.<P>

A &quot;zero tolerance&quot; enforcement of traffic laws is hardly possible, much less desirable. We humans are not that clever at devising rules to cover all situations at all times, and sticking strictly to the rules, as unions have found out, is a good way to bring a system to its knees. Instead, we allow individuals to improvise, and they do. But, as Rothe points out, these improvisations are not whimsical or unordered. &quot;Driving,&quot; he says, &quot;includes standardized behavior that is at the root of all community living.&quot; People don't live by following rules exactly, but neither do they make up their behavior as they go along. <P>

On the roadway, Rothe notes, &quot;cars, lanes, intersections, roadway markings, signal lights and traffic signs are interpreted according to the significance they have for people's driving purposes.&quot; And while there's lots of individualistic behavior, people generally follow norms. This allows for smooth performances as drivers and other road users communicate with one another and negotiate their way through everyday interactions in traffic. <P>

The very smooth performer is the one who has mastered all the skills involved in control, tactics, communicating, making decisions, and managing the subtle interactions of traffic with the least amount of physical and social friction. <P>

Naturally, these norms develop somewhat differently according to culture and place, and even from locality to locality. Sometimes the differences are so subtle that drivers moving from one area to another are irritated or distracted by them without being able to figure out why. Montreal drivers complain about Toronto's bad driving and vice versa. Vancouver drivers have their own unique style of interaction. <P>

Sometimes the differences are dramatic. Europeans fling their cars around winding roadways and into narrow spaces in a manner that Canadians visitors sometimes describe as insane. Europeans are amused to see Canadian drivers balk at driving through spaces at least one and a half times the width of their car. They find the driving here sedate (even lethargic, as one tourist put it) but amazingly polite.<P>

England's notorious traffic roundabouts cause problems for tourists as they try to figure out both formal and informal laws on the fly. On the other hand, a four-way stop intersection in Toronto is perhaps even more confusing to the European visitor. Drivers are supposed to stop but they mostly don't. Right of way comes more from communication with other drivers than from reference to the formal rule of first come, first go and give way to traffic on the right. <P>

Sociologist Rothe has carried out extensive research into these informal roadway relationships and the role of police in maintaining order. As a researcher with the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, he spent hundreds of hours riding with police, truckers, novice drivers, elderly drivers and motorcyclists, studying and noting the system of trust and expectations that allows drivers and other road users to interact with one another efficiently. <P>

Police have a great deal of discretion in enforcing traffic laws, Rothe observed. In a sense, traffic acts as a sort of screening device which frequently allows officers an entry point to investigate more serious offenses. They may use a minor infraction of the law to initiate a contact. <P>

In his recent book Beyond Traffic Safety, he describes the relationship between police and truckers. Police generally respect truckers and often rely on them for help in finding wanted cars, dealing with accidents or learning about roadway problems. But truckers are pressed into pushing the limits of tolerance by the competitiveness of their trade. <P>

&quot;When truckers are stopped, the meetings resemble a cultural ceremony, a form of plea bargaining, a staged interaction,&quot; Rothe writes. An officer may pick on some minor technicality (a mud flap out of place or a license plate improperly attached) as just cause to stop the truck. Then the ceremony begins. <P>

In these encounters, police officers have their own criteria for a smooth performance. They carefully choose whom they will stop and where, and &quot;stage encounters by managing an appearance that they are preserving the sanctity of the law... They take precautions to avoid being played for a fool,&quot; Rothe observes. For their part, drivers learn to play the game. &quot;When the man stops you, you have to know how to play the game, how to play it right so you don't get burnt too bad,&quot; one trucker remarked.<P>

Gordon Thompson's protest was a direct challenge to this game. His goal was to prove that the speed limit doesn't work, but it does -- not by making everyone drive at 100 km/h or less, but by shifting the balance of roadway power from those who want to drive at 120 towards those who want to drive slower. <P>

Modern cars can handle speeds of 120 or even 140 km/h on high-speed roadways with ease, and little skill is required from the driver. But when things go wrong at these speeds, few drivers have the necessary skills to respond adequately. As well, there are costs to higher speeds, not just in pollution and crash risk, but to the rights of those who would like to use the highways at slower speeds. As one motorist said, &quot;It's getting harder to drive at 100 km/h. There's too much pressure to drive faster.&quot; <P>

The speed advocates argue that higher speeds don't mean more crashes or more fatalities. But as noted English traffic expert John Adams points out, safety is not just a matter of crash statistics. As traffic gets faster, those road users who are more vulnerable are pushed out of the game, leaving the roadway to the speed merchants. <P>

The battle over speed limits may be more one of roadway equity and the role of the car in transportation than of saving lives.<p>

<H1>
Risk taking, health and safety</H1>
<blockquote>
In 1977, the province of British Columbia undertook a massive campaign against drunk driving. There was no change in the law, but there was highly intensified enforcement by police.<P>
The campaign was given huge publicity, and very conspicuous mobile Blood Alcohol Testing units (&quot;BATmobiles&quot;) were a prominent feature of the BC driving scene that year. To give an idea of the scope, the number of times drivers were stopped was equal to 30&#37; of the number of vehicles registered by the province's 2.5 million inhabitants.<P>


The program reduced drinking and driving fatalities by an estimated 18&#37;, but in a peculiar twist, overall traffic deaths during the same period were up 19&#37;.<P>

This kind of result isn't at all surprising to Professor Gerald Wilde, a Canadian psychologist specializing in risk-taking behavior and transportation safety. Wilde argues that safety campaigns tend to move accidents around rather than reduce them because traditional approaches do not motivate individuals to change their &quot;target level&quot; of risk, the amount of risk they are willing to accept in their everyday lives.<P>

People have a sort of built-in danger thermostat, he says, a subconscious sense of ambient risk. Make things safer in one aspect of their lives, and they will tend to use up this safety benefit by adapting their behavior to the new reality and increasing risk-taking in another. He calls the theory Risk Homeostasis.<P>

It's a theory that has been hotly debated in academic circles for almost two decades now. It's been described as &quot;the devil's idea to some in the safety community&quot; because it constitutes a frontal attack on the premises underlying current government and industry policies aimed at reducing losses from accidental deaths and injuries.<P>

It challenges the technological fixes offered by engineering greater safety in the vehicle and the environment, and shifts the focus to the behavior of the driver.<P>

Recent revelations about the effects of automobile antilock braking systems (ABS) on crash rates lend weight to Professor Wilde's theory. The systems work. They help prevent skidding and offer drivers better control in emergencies, but evidence shows that drivers with ABS-equipped vehicles tend to drive faster and rely more on their brakes than drivers who don't have the devices. According to the U.S. Highway Loss Data Institute, the systems have not reduced either the frequency or the cost of crashes.<P>

The Dutch-born Wilde began to shape his theory during the early '70s when, as a young researcher working at the National Institute of Road Safety in France, he came across some work by a British psychologist named Taylor.<P>

Taylor had recorded drivers' reactions to road and traffic situations by measuring Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR), changes in the electrical conductance of skin caused by microscopic changes in sweating. Taylor related these measurements to three important variables: the accident history of different sections of roadway as recorded in police accident reports&#59; the levels of GSR experienced by the drivers as they drove over the roadway&#59; and drivers' speeds.<P>

The results fascinated Wilde. They showed that drivers reacted subconsciously to road hazards such as traffic lights, curves and oncoming vehicles, and their reactions related well to the accident history of different road sections.<P>

Over a road section with many hazards, drivers showed higher GSR ratings, but over any given period of time, the GSR levels were remarkably constant. In other words, if there were lots of hazards, drivers slowed down. They changed their behavior to keep the risk they experienced at a fairly constant level.<P>

In the years since he was inspired by this phenomenon, Wilde has gathered data, refined his theory and marshaled his arguments. Now, as a highly respected and internationally known authority on risk-taking behavior, he has thrown down the gauntlet to the safety and health communities by publishing a book titled <strong><A HREF="/pde/books.html#target">&quot;Target Risk&quot;</A></strong>.<P>

In addition to presenting his theory, with all its supporting concepts and data, the book proposes a radical shift in approaches to promoting health and safety. As an alternative to the traditional strategies of Engineering, Enforcement and Education -- the three E's of safety policy -- Wilde proposes a strategy of &quot;Expectationism.&quot;<P>

Safety comes from within, Professor Wilde believes. Only by improving people's expectations of the future can we change their level of risk acceptance. For example, a study of Quebec motorists found that individuals who valued the future highly had fewer driving demerit points, fewer accidents, and better attitudes towards safety. Another study showed that American students with a strong future orientation were less likely to smoke, or smoked less.<P>

In driving, the success of incentive programs for safe drivers bolsters the expectationist idea. When a German trucking company offered its drivers a $170 bonus for every six months without an accident, its accident rate dropped by 86&#37;. The incentives don't have to be large and in fact, Wilde argues, it's probably better if they aren't. An American mining company gave its workers stamps they could exchange for merchandise as a reward for safe performance. Its accident rate dropped by 98&#37;.<P>

&quot;It's a carrot and stick approach,&quot; Wilde says. &quot;Reward people for good behavior and punish them for bad.&quot; But punishment must not be relied on too heavily, especially severe punishment. &quot;A law cannot be enforced,&quot; he says, &quot;if its strictness exceeds popular opinion about the immorality or deviancy of the act.&quot;<P>

On the other hand, high expectations for the future can have a powerful effect on health and safety behavior. At the heart of Professor Wilde's blueprint for the future is his advice to governments to shift some of the huge expenditures now allocated to enforcement and engineering into schemes that enhance people's perception of their future and encourage them to want to be safer, healthier and happier.<p>

<H1>South Africa takes steps<BR>to combat fatalities</h1><p><i>Driver/Education, 1993</i><p>
<blockquote>Comparing traffic crash statistics between one country and another is a tricky business. A lot depends on how crashes and fatality rates are defined, on driving conditions, and on whether the comparison is based on miles driven, population, or number of cars. No matter how the comparison is set up, the Republic of South Africa comes out at  or near the top of the list. Its fatality rate of 11.4 per 100 million km driven compares with 1.45 for the USA and 1.8 for Japan.<p>
In recent years the republic has developed a systems management approach to dealing with its traffic safety problems. Its rapidly growing School Driver Education Program (SDEP) is part of that approach. <p>
 The SDEP started with a pilot program in a Capetown school in 1984. Today the SDEP is offered at almost 700 high schools throughout the republic - and organizers are trying to slow growth to ensure that infrastructure is properly developed and that quality is maintained. <p>
SDEP's beginnings were modest. Wouter Smit, a traffic manager with the Capetown police, and Harry Attwood, a former traffic manager, borrowed a used car from a local dealer and pulled together a program that produced 80 graduates at Plumstead High School . <p>
Volkswagen South Africa heard of the program's success and offered to supply Golf cars for an expanded program in 1984 - South Africa's National Road Safety Year. Caltex Oil chipped in with fuel and lubricants. By the end of 1984 the SDEP course had been presented to 335 graduates with the help of nine teachers and local traffic officers. <p>A national Management Committee was formed with representatives of the sponsors, the Institute of Advanced Motorists, the National Road Safety Council (NRSC), and interested traffic departments. By 1990 over 10,000 students had been trained by 1,200 qualified teachers.<p>

<h4>University Safety Education Centre</h4><p>
In 1987 the Centre for Education in Traffic Safety (CENETS) was formed at Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education. Headed by Dr. Sarel Smit, it's the only centre of its kind in Africa and is part of the Faculty of Education. CENETS is fully funded by the NRSC and carries out research into traffic safety and traffic safety education as well as providing support to the SDEP by offering training to high school teachers who wish to run programs in their schools. Traffic Safety Education is offered as an extra-curricular option to student teachers.<p>Driver training is one of the functional areas of a national Traffic Safety Management System (TSMS) that includes legislation, traffic safety education, vehicle registration/licensing, road and environment, adjudication, traffic information, medical rescue services, marketing, driver training, research and development, technology transfer, and traffic control/policing.<p>
The TSMS has a working group for driver training that includes members of the National Management Committee that oversees the SDEP. The Management Committee has divided the country into eight regions, each with a regional committee. Schools that want to participate in the SDEP apply to the regional committees, which then forward the application to the National Management Committee.<p>
The regional committees consist of: a chairman (a local traffic officer who also sits on the National Committee); a vice-chairman selected by the regional committee; representatives of the participating schools (principals and SDEP instructors); a representative of the provincial education department; representatives of the sponsors; some co-opted members; and a representative of the NRSC. The NRSC provides support in the form of instructor training, training manuals and administrative services.<p>
Traffic safety education is another functional area of the TSMS, separate from that of driver training. CENETS director Smit is currently chairperson of this area, which is comprised of representatives of the departments of education for the various population groups, researchers, and people with expert knowledge in relevant areas. This functional area is responsible for public information campaigns about topics such as seatbelts and impaired driving. <p>
Another important facet of this functional area is the development of educational materials that are fed into various areas of the school curriculum. Senior CENETS researcher Pieter Venter is currently preparing a manual on the integration of traffic safety material into the curriculum for senior primary grades 4 through 7. A colleague is doing the same thing for the pre-primary groups up to grade 3. Another of Dr. Smit's staff members has just concluded a master's thesis on the integration of traffic safety content into the biology curriculum of Grades 10 to 12.  <p>

<h4>The Strategic Plan</h4><p>
The climate of change in South Africa means that the SDEP will have to be sensitive and adaptable to changes going on around it as well as rapid change within. To that end it conforms to a strategic plan that provides for constant feedback, analysis, and restatement of objectives. <p>
At the August, 1992 conference of the American Driver and Traffic Safety Education in Atlanta, Dr. Jaap Kroon, associate professor of business economics at Potchefstroom University, presented a model for strategic management under which the SDEP operates. 
In the strategic management plan, information about the internal and external environments is monitored and fed into a "SWOT" matrix. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats are identified and, using the matrix, a logical framework is developed for a systematic analysis of all the SDEP activities. <p>From the analysis, an implementation plan is developed. For example if strengths and opportunities predominate in the analysis, that sends the SDEP into an expansion mode. If weaknesses and threats predominate, then the system becomes more concerned with feedback, repair and improvements. <p>
<i>For more information on South Africa's driver education initiatives contact Dr. Sarel Smit or Dr. Pieter Venter at CENETS, Tel: (0148) 99-1063 or Fax: (0148) 99-2799.</i><p>
<h3>DRIVER'S LICENCE EASY TO OBTAIN</H3><p>In South Africa, a driver's licence isn't difficult to obtain. No formal training is required and few drivers take any. A learner's permit can be obtained at age 17 on completion of a knowledge test. A full driver's licence can be obtained at age 18 by passing a road test. No waiting period is required between the learner's permit and the road test once the applicant is 18 years old.<p>
Training is offered by several groups. Private driving schools, under the auspices of the South African Institute of Driving instructors, cater to the individual learner driver. Groups such as the Institute of Advanced Motorists, BMW of South Africa, and the AA Foundation provide more advanced training. <p>The School Driver Education Program (SDEP), which provides theory as well as behind-the-wheel training, was introduced at a Capetown high school in 1984. Since then it has escalated into a national program offered at almost 700 schools throughout the republic. <p>
The rapid growth in SDEPs was spurred by growth in traffic, a potent mix of third and first world road users, and huge problems caused by unschooled drivers entering the traffic system. Many of the new drivers entered with little knowledge about their vehicles or the conventions and procedures that provide for an orderly flow of traffic. The SDEPs are aimed at diffusing more sophisticated traffic and driving knowledge through the road user population. <p>
"We are ensuring a generation of safer road users who will pass on their abilities," says safety researcher Pieter Venter of Potchefstroom Christian University's Centre for Education in Traffic Safety, which acts as a research and training resource for the school programs. <p>  
Currently SDEPs provide 17 hours of classroom education and six hours or 100 km behind-the-wheel instruction. The curriculum includes  a basic introduction that alerts pupils to factors such as the road-worthiness of the car, stopping distances, and basic vehicle control. The behind-the-wheel time covers motoring techniques such as gear changing and following distances. Driving theory includes the IPDE decision-making system, and the influence of factors such as alcohol, drugs and emotions.<p> 
The programs are offered after school hours (7:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.) but Venter hopes they will soon be recognized as a regular part of the school curriculum and that the theory portion will be included in the school day.<P>

<H1>Street driving and the gas pedal</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Dec. 1994)</I><P>
<blockquote>
Today's auto advertisers know that speed and power sell. And they also know that they're selling to a largely unsophisticated market in which most of the "targets" of the advertising are not particularly knowledgeable about what power and speed mean, or how to use them. 
<P>
Car advertising consistently depicts speed and maneuverability as selling points, and when it comes to speed the most commonly cited statistic is acceleration from 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h). And that, according to auto technology journalist Gerry Malloy, is a particularly useless statistic to offer in relation to a car's acceleration needs for common traffic situations.
<P>
Since drivers rarely, if ever, need to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) in one burst, what should interest them more are the kinds of acceleration needed for traffic situations such as merging into a traffic flow, changing into faster lanes of traffic, or getting onto freeways. In other words, acceleration from 30-50 mph (50-80km/h) or from 50-70 mph (80-120 km/h) is much more significant for the driver, suggests Malloy. 
<P>
But even these statistics may not be as important as how the car actually responds to the accelerator pedal. Acceleration figures are measured at full throttle. What is more relevant to the street driver, Malloy says, is how the engine responds to pressure on the pedal. <P>
If the response is too slow, the driver may regard the engine as underpowered, even though it may, in fact, be more powerful than the engines of comparable cars. And if the response is too quick it may be difficult, or even impossible, to get smooth starts or smooth transitions to higher speeds. Also, the car may be difficult to control, particularly in slippery conditions, because it's all-too-easy to overdo things with the gas pedal at the wrong moment.  
<P>
There may be a number of reasons for poor throttle response, Malloy points out. The car may be underpowered, but it could also be due to poor throttle linkage geometry, "or its low-speed, part-throttle performance may be compromised to generate a high peak power output that will look good in advertising comparisons with the competition."
<P>
Some manufacturers are beginning to see the light and are beginning to favour better feel over big horsepower numbers, according to Malloy. One 1995 car, he says, is getting a reduction in power to increase its performance in the more critical street-driving responses.<P>

<H1>The challenge of ABS</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, June. 1994)</I><P>
<blockquote>
Some automobile advertisements seem to present the antilock braking system (ABS) as a sort of magic solution to the average driver's poor braking skills. The drivers in the ads stop short of children who dash into the roadway, and neatly steer around obstacles to avoid collisions. Engineers hail ABS as perhaps the greatest safety advance in decades. But a recent report by the U.S. Highway Loss Data Institute, which represents insurance companies, stated that antilock systems aren't reducing either the frequency or the cost of crashes that result in insurance claims for vehicle damage. 
<P>
Can it be that one of the best developments in auto safety engineering in decades has produced no benefits in terms of reduced deaths, injuries and repair bills from crashes?
<P>
By all accounts this seems to be the case. In January this year the Virginia-based Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) released the results of a study on ABS effectiveness in reducing collisions. The study found no significant payoff in terms of deaths, injuries or lower repair bills for cars equipped with ABS. 
<P>
Some states have been offering insurance discounts for cars with ABS, but many in the insurance business didn't seem to be surprised by the HLDI results. "We never felt there was any strong evidence ABS reduces the number of accidents," State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance spokesman David Hurst told the New York Times recently. "We offer discounts only because we're supposed to, not because we feel they're justified," he added. 
<P>
There appears to be a number of reasons why ABS hasn't produced the promised safety payoff. One is that many drivers don't understand them or know how to use them properly. Another reason, and one that's received a great deal of attention in research circles, is that ABS seems to produce a behaviour change in some drivers. They drive faster, more recklessly, take more chances.
<P>
The classic study of this phenomenon was carried out in Germany in the early '80s. The German Ministry of Transport commissioned a multi-year study of taxi drivers using vehicles with and without ABS. In one phase of the study, without the drivers knowledge, accelerometers were placed in the vehicles to record the abruptness of changes in speed and direction. It was found that drivers with ABS made more abrupt changes. In another phase, observers were sent out to ride with the drivers and note their style and other driving characteristics. The observers had been trained until they were in close agreement in their judgments of driver behaviours, and told to ride with the drivers from one point to another, a distance of about 20 km. 
<P>
"It was a beautiful case of a double blind study; a textboook example of how it should be done," says Queen's University psychologist Gerald Wilde, one of the consultants on the study. <P>
"The observers didn't know whether or not the vehicles had ABS, and the drivers didn't know they were being observed." 
Driver behaviours on about 20 different scales (for example, merging behaviour, speed, following distance, lane tracking, whether they created traffic conflicts) were recorded by the observers. "On some 13 of those scales, or at least the large majority, there were some significant differences. ABS cars were driven more recklessly," says Wilde. 
"We offer discounts only because we're supposed to, not because we feel they're justified." 
<P>
Wilde cites the study in support of his theory of Risk Homeostasis, a concept that is widely known in traffic safety circles and often hotly disputed. The theory asserts that every society has a kind of danger thermostat, that there's a level of risk people will accept in exchange for the benefits of their way of life. A new device that makes an activity safer, Wilde postulates, will result in a collective increase in risky behaviour. In other words, people know the level of risk they'll accept in their lives, and if given a device such as ABS, they'll use up its benefits by changing behaviour in such a way as to return to their "target level" of risk.
<P>
Certainly the research seems to confirm that ABS produces some kind of risk compensation effect in drivers. A more recent study of ABS by Transport Canada had similar findings to the German one, and a French study involving 100 Renault employees is of particular significance for driver trainers. This study found that drivers trained in the use of ABS performed better in a simulated collision avoidance task. 
<P>
There are about 10 million ABS-equipped cars on North American roads today, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The device is popular with the public but this, says the IIHS, may be because of misleading car commercials that imply better stopping power under all conditions. And in some cases even the owner's manuals that come with the cars can be misleading. Some manuals give no special instructions at all while one offers the misleading statement that its ABS functions with normal pedal operation. 
Some auto makers are also considering special training programs for their customers on the proper use of ABS.<P>

<H4>GETTING THE BEST FROM ABS</H4>

Antilock braking systems don't offer shorter stopping distances. In fact on loose surfaces, where gravel or loose snow can form a wedge in front of the tire, ABS is a disadvantage. Drivers skilled at threshold braking can equal, or even outdo, ABS at stopping short. What ABS really excels at is allowing maximum braking while maintaining steering control. 
<P>
For drivers unused to ABS, the important thing is to experience how it feels and how the car reacts in a controlled environment. Some drivers have reported that they were scared by the sound the brakes make when ABS was in action, and instinctively released the pedal. And drivers tend to react with old habits when faced with an emergency-for example by pumping the brake pedal while stopping on slippery surfaces. <P>
"Don't wait to discover how your car will respond when faced with an emergency situation," says Sgt. Graham Austin, head of Police Vehicle Operations in Metro Toronto. "Find various surfaces in safe areas and experience the handling capabilities of ABS." 
<P>
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety president Brian O'Neill advises drivers to use firm, continuous brake pressure. Others, such as Petro Canada Skid Control School manager Doug Annett, say "slam" the pedal and keep it down, letting ABS do the rest. Most importantly, don't pump the pedal while doing emergency braking. This is the ABS's job. And it does it very well.<P>

<H1>Why 16-year-olds die in crashes</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<blockquote>
The U.S.-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has identified a number of reasons for the high crash rate among 16-year-old drivers.<P>

"This is the first time we've been able to identify reasons that 16-year-olds are more at risk than older teens," says Institute senior vice-president Allan F. Williams, one of the world's leading experts on problems associated with young drivers. Sixteen-year-olds had previously been studied as part of the larger group of teenage drivers so that their differences hadn't been isolated. 
What's different about 16-year-olds' fatal crashes? They're more likely to involve driver error, speeding and other thrill-seeking behavior. They're more likely to include three or more occupants - often teenage peers - in the vehicle.<P>

During 1994, the institute's researchers interviewed dozens of parents and siblings of 16-year-olds who died in crashes, publishing their accounts of the crash and its aftermath. These personal accounts helped spark national interest in the issue.<P>

Also in 1994, the institute made the case for graduated licensing, which was first implemented in New Zealand in 1987. Similar systems were adopted in 1994 in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Nova Scotia. Graduated licensing is also beginning to attract attention in the United States. 
Apart from making the case for graduated licensing, the institute explains why traditional approaches to improving the safety of young drivers don't work as well as many people expect.<P>

Training and education programs can help teens learn driving skills, but it's often not poor skills that cause the crashes. It's the attitudes of teenagers, who naturally tend to rebel against adult standards. Peer pressure influences them more than advice from adults. Teen are slower than adults to perceive danger and, when they do, they often don't relate to it. They think they are invulnerable.<P>

The risk is highest when 16-year-olds are out at night with their peers, the institute says. Crashes involving this group occur more often on Friday and Saturday evenings compared with fatal crashes involving older drivers.<P>

Eighty-two per cent of such crashes involved driver error when 16-year-old were at the wheel, compared with 62 per cent of fatal crashes involving adult drivers. The proportion of fatal crashes with three or more occupants in the vehicles is twice as high when 16-year-olds are driving.<P>

<H1>Why drivers tailgate</H1><P>
<P>
<P>
<I> (Driver/Education, Dec. 1994)</I><P>
<blockquote>
There's lots of opinions on why drivers tailgate. But there doesn't seem to be much in the line of hard research that would cast some light on this particular kind of driving behaviour. 
<P>
Several experts queried in preparation for this article admitted that, while they know of research dealing with tailgating behaviour in general, they could not bring to mind any  specific research into why individual drivers do it. Even GM Senior Researcher Leonard Evans, author of Traffic Safety and the Driver, a book that has been referred to as the bible of traffic safety research, seems to have little more than opinion to offer on the topic of why drivers adopt a tactic in traffic that is not only dangerous, but also has several tactical disadvantages. 
<P>
"Why do drivers choose to follow so closely? It seems to me that it becomes largely a driving habit, rather than a reasoned conscious behaviour," Evans writes. "Drivers appear to do many things for their own benefit rather than for any utility benefit." He goes on to suggest that, in some cases, it may be done as criminal behaviour that's indulged in for its own sake. 
<P>
Evans also suggests that the lack of speed difference between vehicles allows drivers to feel safe. This, and the fact that crashes are rare events and that drivers can get away with tailgating, makes drivers complacent about the danger. "They have learned from repeated experience that it is safe to do so, in the sense that they have been doing it for years without adverse consequences," he writes.<P>
 

<H4>Challenge for educators</H4><P>

If these views hold true, driver educators have an almost impossible challenge in dealing with the problem. The two-second rule is taught as a rule of thumb for minimum safe following distance. Many educators now suggest three to four seconds as a minimum. <P>
But selling this driving technique on the basis of safety may be difficult if penalties for tailgating (in the form of accidents) are rare and drivers feel no sense of danger. 
<P>
On the other hand, more utilitarian penalties for tailgating are quite common. Tailgaters get blocked in more often because they are unable to anticipate problems ahead and select the best lane. <P>
"They  feel more stress because they can't use their vision properly and do long-range traffic planning," says driver training consultant David Baker. "Drivers are often more concentrated on defending the indefensible, the space between them and the car in front, rather than on the cooperative aspect of driving in traffic," says Baker. "When they're shown how, they can see and feel the benefits of staying back and having more control. They feel more confident about their control over the situation."
<P>
However, it might be a lot easier to find ways to sell these benefits if a great deal more were known about why tailgaters tailgate.<P>

<H1>Beyond the horizon</H1>
<H3><I>By Allen Robinson, Ph.D.</I></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This summer has seen proof that our previous discussions have
led to completed products. Four different sets of materials will be available
to drastically improve your ability for implementing parent involvement
programs. The American Automobile Association (AAA), Allstate Insurance
Company, Champion Education, and General Motors have each completed materials
which support parent involvement in driver education. Each program differs
and complements the others. It is exciting to have so many good products
become available at the same time. <BR>
<BR>
We continue to be a society that expects simple solutions to our problems.
We expect our cars to protect us rather than take responsibility for ourselves.
We naively believe that laws are supposed to control others who do not know
how to take care of themselves. We believe that engineering should remove
all hazards associated with driving. <BR>
<BR>
The federal government, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and
most state agencies take the above approach to highway safety. Rather than
deal with the single most important element, the driver, they tie bells
and whistles on these quick and easy solutions. While these temporary solutions
do result in some progress, they also create additional problems. We continue
to have unacceptable accident, injury, and fatality rates in this country.
<BR>
<BR>
Recent efforts by major automobile safety stakeholders are beginning to
yield results. ADTSEA member participation at the National Summit in Crystal
City was greatly appreciated. Each of you made significant contributions
during the sessions, and I know that your efforts will be helpful in finalizing
a strategic plan that is beneficial to ADTSEA goals for driver education.<BR>
<BR>
Members do need to understand that organization development takes many forms
and appearances through its developmental phases. Initial indications and
insights did not support using ADTSEA as a parent agency for this new coalition.
Indications were that a separate agency may need to be developed to avoid
conflicts with goals and efforts of existing agencies. ADTSEA would benefit
from the formation of a separate or joint agency to improve youthful driver
performance. <BR>
<BR>
As ADTSEA CEO, my position on creating a new agency is being reconsidered.
Perhaps this foundling organization can grow within the support of ADTSEA
efforts and goals. During the next few weeks, I will be meeting and discussing
with several different groups concerning the concept of the Summit organizers
forming a coalition or partnership with ADTSEA to achieve the goals discussed
in Crystal City, Virginia. <BR>
<BR>
Decisions have not been made on how we can collectively support efforts
to improve youthful driver performance through education. The Summit was
fruitful in regard to encouraging efforts to move forward with the plans
and develop a strategic plan for implementation. As plans become more clear,
I will share them with the membership through The Chronicle, ADTSEA News
and Views, or a personal communique. This is an exciting time for developing
the opportunities that exist. Education has long been ignored as a component
of highway safety countermeasures. It is very encouraging to feel the support
and energy of major stakeholders supporting efforts to improve youthful
driver performance through education. ADTSEA support and contributions to
this effort are being noticed and are well received.<BR>
<BR>
I encourage everyone to support this effort as we go through the process
of determining how ADTSEA and this newly formed coalition can work together
to improve youthful driver performance. ADTSEA will be called upon to make
extra efforts to develop national education program goals and provide professional
certification recommendations. I encourage every member to lend support
as required during this formative period and wish to thank all who have
given of their time and efforts to this point. <BR>

<H1>Future ADTSEA activities</H1>
<H3>by C.E. Welch<BR>
President</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
It is an honor and privilege to serve as your president. Efforts to support
traffic safety initiatives throughout North America are beginning to take
shape. My plans include the development and maintenance of programs that
enhance membership growth and provide communication and tools to keep traffic
safety instructors on the cutting edge. <BR>
<BR>
We plan to increase membership by 200 through having a promotional membership
drive. ADTSEA needs to be visible at affiliated state and regional conferences
and at the National Safety Council. The board of directors, executive committee,
corporate community, and the ADTSEA CEO will strive to bring in four new
corporate memberships and develop an advisory council that will work with
states facing serious traffic safety education problems such as budget cuts.
<BR>
<BR>
ADTSEA will continue to restructure our organization to support the highest
level of quality and performance. The Standards Committee will continue
to work on establishing professional standards and performance outcomes
to be presented to the Board of Directors in 1996 and 1997. The Evaluations
and Goals Committee will define the duties and responsibilities of the executive
board and the board of directors more clearly by looking carefully at the
Constitution and Bylaws. They will present changes to the membership for
passage. <BR>
<BR>
ADTSEA will clarify the restructuring of driver education to assist states
in the implementation of the graduated licensing programs. ADTSEA will continue
to create partnerships to support driver and traffic safety education by
networking with other organizations, agencies, businesses, communities,
and institutions that promote traffic safety awareness. <BR>
<BR>
We will continue working to secure passage of the Congressional High Risk
Users Act while networking with those support organizations and associations
that represent individuals with special needs. Our goals are to continue
to work with national organizations such as National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) and the American Automobile Association (AAA) to
promote graduated driver licensing bills in all states. <BR>
<BR>
The ADTSEA Board will continue working to establish criteria and award a
National Driver Education Teacher of the Year. Plans include continuing
to expand the National Student Safety Program (NSSP) by finding and securing
a funding grant to offset the cost of the NSSP program with attempts to
maintain the registration cost for the conference at $200. ADTSEA will request
the NSSP Executive Board to revise the NSSP Constitution with the advice
of the NSSP liaison committee. <BR>

<H1>The Road from Dearborn to Crystal City</H1>
<H3>By <I>Terry L. Kline, Ed.D.</I></H3>
<H4><i>Texas A&amp;M University</i></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Major stakeholders in driver and traffic safety have recognized a need to improve youthful driver performance through educational efforts. Major insurance companies and automobile manufacturers are seeking ways to improve the educational practices for developing a graduated driver education program consistent with the current efforts for graduated licensing. <BR>
<BR>
State Farm Insurance and Ford Motor Company initiated efforts in Dearborn,
Michigan leading to a Summit on Youthful Driver Performance in Crystal City, Virginia (Planning Committee Report, 1996). The plans to develop a mechanism for improving youthful driver performance were unveiled to public, private, and governmental agencies. Strategic plans and funding efforts will be developed prior to January 1, 1997 which may include ADTSEA efforts to support graduated education programs to coincide with graduated licensing programs.<BR>
<BR>
The planning committee attendees received a supportive letter from Mr. Ron
Blue of State Farm Insurance. The contents of his letter appear throughout
this article. Ron explained that for the last several months, a small group
of concerned volunteers from many different sources have been working to
form a coalition to dramatically reduce the number of teenage traffic deaths.
Our approach has been to identify ways to significantly improve driver education, driver skills and driver experience under an organizational format that could be either a national coalition, a foundation, or both. As part of
that group, Ron would invite representatives to attend the National Summit
on Driver Education at the Crystal City Hyatt in Washington, DC on September 16 and 17, 1996. He encouraged attendees to continue their role as a member of the coalition for change in driver education and performance. <BR>
<BR>
Planning committee members are calling our effort A Coalition for Improved
Driver Education (CIDE), and Ron has accepted the challenge to serve as
interim chairman. Permanent leadership will be identified as quickly as
feasible. <BR>
<BR>
The coalition continues to attract the interest and attention of a growing
of important individuals who agree that our current systems for training
young people to drive are grossly inadequate. To a person, they agree that
we are on the right track in our efforts to promote national attention among
a group of leading problem solvers who will work in concert to change youthful driver behavior. Never have so many important people been so interested in a grass roots effort to create change in our system for driver education and training. By the same token, as realists, we are all aware of the tremendous effort that will be required and the commitment so many in our society will be asked to make. <BR>
<BR>
Interested coalition members agree, however, that the results and the goals
of our coalition, to reduce the number of teenage deaths by 1,000 or more
by the year 2000, are clearly worth the effort needed to address the issue.
<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Defining the Need</H3>

Meeting participants defined and redefined the needs for a unified national
effort because it was believed that only by creating this need could hope
exist to achieve the enrollment needed to move this effort forward. Participants defined the following needs: <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li> Define the customer(s) and create awareness and demand
for the programs we develop. <BR>
<Li>  Get youthful buy-in supported by society, customer, parent, peer,
passenger, etc. <BR>
<Li>  Define the content of a program or process that can work. <BR>
<Li>  Reinforce youthful or novice driver responsibility for safety, experience,
and consequence at an attitudinal, knowledge, skill, and behavioral levels.
<BR>
<Li>  Develop and promote a tough graduated license scheme (based upon
skill or age or both). <BR>
<Li>  Develop tougher programs that include consistent driver evaluation
and measurable outcomes. <BR>
<Li>  Define the role of the schools in implementing driver education programs
and do so within the context of other school (societal) needs. <BR>
<Li>  Provide a stronger leadership community for driver education and
for the programmatic efforts we are undertaking. <BR>
<Li>  Place accent on driver road skills and behind-the-wheel experience
in a wide range of conditions. <BR>
<Li>  Create partnership and alliance at all levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
The planning committee agreed that the improvement of youthful driver performance
and attitude can be accomplished through:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><Li>  Awareness<BR>
<Li>  Education<BR>
<Li>  Regulation<BR>
<Li>  Industry and Government <BR>
Partnerships<BR>
<Li>  Research </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Concept discussions were held in June at State Farm's Bloomington, Illinois
offices between representatives from auto manufacturers, glazing suppliers,
and State Farm personnel. It was concluded at these discussions that a joint
industry and government coalition effort, aimed at developing and deploying
improvements in driver education programs and curriculum, could be very
beneficial to society in general. It was also concluded that a focused planning
pre-meeting session made up of a few key and interested persons would be
a necessary step prior to hosting a larger group meeting with all interested
parties. It was thus decided to hold the pre-meeting planning session on
July 26 at Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan and to hold the larger
group meeting on September 16-17 in Washington D.C. The pre-meeting planning
session was used to establish an agenda and to develop a set of strawman
strategic goals at the September meeting in Washington D.C. The pre-meeting
planning session and the group meeting was facilitated by Dudley Davis,
Davis Consulting Group from Baltimore, MD. It was hoped that the meeting
will result in the following outcomes:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><Li>  A list of the invitees to the September 16-17 group meeting
in Washington D.C.<BR>
<Li>  Development of an agenda for the September 16-17 meeting in Washington
D.C. <BR>
<Li>  Determine the probability of success of a joint driver education
coalition effort. <BR>
<Li>  Identify the current initiatives and needs in the driver education
field (gap analysis). This task to be refined and completed at the September
meeting. <BR>
<Li> Development of major strawman strategic goals needed to direct a coalition effort. This task to be refined and completed at the September meeting.
<BR>
<Li> Agreement on individual roles prior to and during Washington meeting. </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Mission Statement</H3>

To significantly reduce the number of youthful driver crashes, injuries,
and fatalities as a result of the improved quality of education, awareness,
research, and regulation in North America through an alliance of powerful,
private, public, and nonprofit partnerships committed to increasing the
competence, experience, performance, and attitudes of teenage drivers. This
will be accomplished through an organization which will develop, promote,
and support a wide variety of initiatives and strategic partnerships. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Goals of a National Summit </H3>

The planning committee supported the following goals of a national summit:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>  To identify the need for an initiative for improved youthful
driver performance and attitudes in North America. <BR>
<Li>  To identify what has been happening in North America as a foundation
for the initiatives developed at the Summit. <BR>
<Li>  To identify the important research and to determine what future scientific
discovery will help in the development of youthful driver initiatives. <BR>
<Li>  To develop goals and tactics that could be used if an alliance is
developed that will underwrite, partner with, or otherwise create technology,
awareness, regulations, research, and strategic partnerships which will
significantly improve teenage driver performance and attitude. <BR>
<Li>  To consider an organization or strategic alliance that can serve

<H3>Traffic Safety Education Trends </H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>  The public's attitude toward driver education will decline
unless a national campaign is launched on the seriousness of the magnitude
of the motor vehicle crash problem for youth under 25. <BR>
<Li>  More states will be issuing provisional, probational, or restricted
licenses to teenagers. <BR>
<Li>  States will be imposing stiffer licensing penalties for teenagers
than on older drivers for drinking and driving violations. <BR>
<Li>  More states will be considering imposing night driving curfews for
newly licensed teenagers. <BR>
<Li>  Agencies responsible for road testing and driver licensing will eliminate
road testing and give the responsibility of evaluation to the local certified
driver education teacher. <Li>  Driver and traffic safety education programs
need to strive for a more relevant and measurable curriculum that is student
centered, has performance objectives, has criterion reference tests, and
has instructional materials that have been validated. <BR>
<Li>  Fewer universities will be producing driver education teachers. The
driver education teacher shortage is real. <BR>
<Li>  The most critical concern will be the lack of adequate teacher preparation
standards and certification.<BR>
<Li>  Driver education must, in theory, reflect current knowledge in the
fields of social psychology, mass communication, and organization change.
For example, when discussing drunk driving, use alcohol-impaired driving
because a person does not have to be drunk to be impaired. Do not use &quot;accidents,&quot;
use &quot;crashes&quot; since the term accident suggests the event could
not have been avoided. <BR>
<Li>  Higher standards need to be established by state licensing agencies
if driver education programs improve their effectiveness. <BR>
<Li>  Effective driver education programs will establish partnerships with
parents and businesses in the community to support teaching and learning
in area of driver and traffic safety education. <BR>
<Li>  Parents and good public relations are the key to maintaining a driver
and traffic safety education program. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>The Zone Control System Provides Blueprint for Risk Reduction Habits
</H1>
<H3><I>By Frederik R. Mottola</I></H3>
<H4><I>Professor, Southern Connecticut State University</I></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The curriculum for the Zone Control Driving System accomplishes
many of the concepts Carney (1996) suggests as necessary for risk reduction
behavior. Eugene Carney is strongly commended for his The Chronicle 44 (3)
article entitled, &quot;Driver Education Curriculum&shyp;A Critique and
A Proposal,&quot; in which he addresses several shortcomings of current
driver education curricula. <BR>
<BR>
If there is a value to offering a driver education program, as well there
should be, the major goal should be to help novice drivers acquire the capabilities
to reduce the risks associated with driving. We never drive without exposure
and risk. Most of the risk is manageable, and the consequences of taking
risky actions are very predictable. <BR>
<BR>
An effective driver education curriculum should serve as a blueprint that
can provide a teen with the precise steps necessary for the development
of safe, comfortable, low-risk, and convenient driving habits that will
last a lifetime. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Blueprint to Develop Habits </H3>

If, as educators, rather than teach teens to drive, we were asked to help
them build a house that would provide shelter, security, safety, comfort,
and convenience for the rest of their lives, we would want a design to show
what the finished product should look like. We would also need a detailed
blueprint to efficiently direct the construction. <BR>
<BR>
To build a house, we would need a solid footing to support the foundation.
The foundation must be structured to support the exterior walls of the house,
while the the walls must be able to support the roof of the house. Each
component must be constructed at the proper time and with a perspective
of how it fits into the total plan. It would be of little value to begin
building the walls before the foundation was built. To build a foundation
for a three room house, when our plan is to build a six room house, would
not allow us to achieve our goal. The blueprint would provide us with a
precise plan to guide the construction of the house and to have each stage
of the building process take place in a proper and timely sequence. <BR>
<BR>
Teaching a teen how to use a hammer to drive nails into a two-by-four and
how to use a saw to cut the two-by-four is not the same as teaching the
teen to build the house. Yet, for someone without a blueprint, the driving
of nails may seem the same as building a house. For some, the concept of
what a teen needs to learn to drive a car is focused only upon the immediate
task of &quot;safely&quot; maneuvering the car, with little concern for
what kind of habits are being built that will serve the individual for a
lifetime of driving. Our driver education programs must help students construct
a sturdy shelter of low-risk habits that will provide a lifetime of protection
from the incalculable number of ways that a crash can occur. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>The Zone Control System </H3>

During 1971-72, thousands of motor vehicle crashes were analyzed in an attempt
to discover which driver behavioral patterns were necessary to avoid crashes.
The results of my studies led to the formation of the Zone Control Driving
System. It has been used effectively for teaching novice as well as licensed
drivers risk avoidance behavioral patterns. The millions of ways that crashes
occur involve two common factors. Most crashes occur when there is a reduction
in the driver's line of sight (LOS) and/or a change to the driver's intended
path of travel (POT). Someone or something changes the control which the
driver has over his/her LOS-POT before driving into the deteriorated situation.
<p>
Our mind tells our eyes what to look for. To see effectively, drivers need
to know where to look and what to look for. With the Zone Control System,
instructors are able to teach drivers to look for situations that affect
their LOS-POT. Carney states, &quot;A common practice of treating each traffic
scene as an independent situation to be analyzed independently does not
provide the learner with the transferable guidelines which insure consistent
risk management performances.&quot; This is an important point Carney makes
and a significant reason why the Zone Control System is needed. Although
there are an astronomical number of ways to lose control while driving,
there are only a few principles a driver must learn and practice into habit
to minimize the risk. <BR>
<BR>
The Zone Control System is like having a picture of what our house should
look like when properly constructed. With a clear picture of what the educational
intervention should achieve, we can then formulate the blueprint to direct
the efficient use of our resources to that end. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Two Powerful Tools </H3>

A hammer and hand saw are no longer the most efficient and effective tools
to use for the construction of our house. If we learn how to use a few power
tools, we can build a larger and sturdier house in less time than it would
take with the use of the old hand tools. <BR>
<BR>
Two powerful tools we can use in the construction of our students' shelter
of low-risk habits are targeting and vehicle reference points. By using
the tool of targeting, the student is able to learn how to use searching
skill to gain a mental picture of the space the car is to occupy, which
aids in maintaining a safe path-of-travel. Targeting can give the driver
information more than 12-15 seconds ahead of the car. It can also increase
steering accuracy and help the student develop skid avoidance skills. <BR>
<BR>
The use of reference points allows the driver to get accurate information
as to how the car is positioned in relation to the roadway. Because the
driver's view of the road is blocked by the dashboard and by the hood of
the car, optical illusions make the car appear somewhere other than where
it is. With the use of reference points, the driver is able to see some
part of the vehicle as it relates to some part of the roadway, knowing exactly
where the vehicle is positioned. A driver gains many advantages from the
use of reference points. To list a few: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>The ability to gain consistent success by receiving accurate
feedback of where the vehicle is positioned on the roadway before performing
a turn and other maneuvers and knowing how to easily correct failures. <BR>
<BR>
<Li> Once the method of reference points is learned for one vehicle, the
techniques can be applied to any vehicle. There is rapid transfer of learning
to new situations. <BR>
<BR>
<Li> Even a novice driver can get into a larger vehicle than accustomed
to, such as a sport utility vehicle, van, truck, or motor home, and within
five minutes be comfortable and confident maneuvering it in tight spaces
and in traffic situations. <BR>
<br>

<I>Ed. Note: There will be detailed information on the use of reference
points in the next issue of The Chronicle.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Concurrent Classroom and In-Car </H3>
Carney states, &quot;...decision making guidelines mandate a concurrent
classroom and laboratory instruction program. A single component of risk
can be introduced in class and simultaneously pursued in any laboratory
setting, environment, or situation.&quot; Classroom activities must give
students an opportunity to learn and apply concepts that they will be expected
to perform during the next in-car session. <BR>
<BR>
For example, students learn how to use targeting in the classroom before
applying it to an in-car session. The classroom activities are able to give
the student physical, equivalent, mental, and/or rehearsal opportunities
to prove that they are able to use the &quot;tool.&quot; Once successful
usage is demonstrated in the classroom, then the student should apply that
same process during an in-car session as soon as possible. In-car practice
activities can take place while the student is in the backseat as well as
while driving. <BR>
<BR>
There are four stages of skill development for learning to use targeting.
The first stage is learning how to locate a target. A target is a stationary
object that appears in the center of where you intend to drive the car.
For example, if you look as far down the road as possible to the space that
you expect the car to occupy, you'll see some fixed object, such as part
of a house, a tree, a pole, a sign, a bush, etc. <BR>
<BR>
How to locate a target can be practiced in the classroom or the whole class
can be taken outside and practice selecting targets. It is a good learning
environment. Ten minutes can be spent in the parking lot performing physical, mental, and/or rehearsal of targeting skills by having the students
hold a cardboard pizza round (which can be obtained free from a vendor)
to simulate a steering wheel, while directing them to walk toward various
targets. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone has a good time. The students love it. And you, as the administrator
of the program, will save money. A class of 30 students uses 10 instructor
minutes to prepare all of the students with skills that would have taken
10 minutes for each student to accomplish in-car. That would have cost 300
instructor minutes, saving 290 minutes of valuable in-car instruction time,
benefiting all students. Imagine the savings if this same ratio is applied
to many of the other skills and behavioral patterns the students must learn.
It surely can improve the quality of in-car activities when the student
has already demonstrated some success at the expected performance. <BR>
<BR>
The second stage of targeting is for the student to learn how to evaluate
the target area. The target area is the driving environment to the left
and right of where the target is located. Searching the target area for
driving related information is more important than merely identifying a
target. <BR>
<BR>
The third stage of targeting is to evaluate the targeting path. The targeting
path is the actual space the car is expected to travel on the roadway, from
the present location point when the target is first visible to the destination
point in the target area. <BR>
<BR>
The fourth stage of targeting is to search from one target area to another
for LOS-POT changes. Now the students are ready to begin applying the principles
of Zone Control. <BR>

<H3>Introduction to Zone Control </H3>

Zones are either Open, Closed, or Changed. An Open Zone is when there is
space to operate without an LOS-POT restriction. A Closed Zone is a zone
not available as a POT and/or there is a restriction to the LOS. A Changed
Zone is a worsening zone condition. It is an open zone changed to a closed
LOS-POT or a zone that was already closed and has an additional change.
<BR>
<BR>
Examples of LOS-POT Zone Changes <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<Li>A red traffic light is a closed front zone POT. <BR>
<Li>A hill crest is a closed front zone LOS. <BR>
<Li>A parked car to your right is a closed right zone LOS-POT. <BR>
<Li>A bicyclist to your right is a closed right zone POT. <BR>
<Li>Oncoming traffic is a closed left zone POT. <BR>
<Li>A truck following closely is a closed rear zone LOS-POT. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H3>First Step of Zone Control </H3>

The first step of Zone Control takes place upon seeing an LOS-POT zone change.
Carney states, &quot;Benign experiences such as...parked vehicles remaining
stationary...encourage drivers to erroneously assign little or no risk to
potential events having considerable risk.&quot; When a driver is taught
to &quot;be careful&amp;quot; because the parked car may pull in front,
or a door may pop open, or someone may be concealed by the parked car, and
none of these events occur, the driver develops an okay expectancy which
leads him/her to believe the danger is no longer there. Or to describe it
in another way, the driver feels comfortable. The internal value of risk
perception is void. There appears to be nothing wrong. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
With the Zone Control System, the parked car is a right-front zone change.
The right-front zone change requires the driver to check other zones to
determine options, then get the best selection of speed, lane position,
and communication. It doesn't matter if the car remains parked. It still
changes the right-front zone, which requires the driver to &quot;create&quot;
control over the situation. The actions required by the driver for the right-front
zone change caused by the parked car are exactly the same as what the driver
would need to do if any right-front zone change occurs, such as: a car backing
out of a driveway, a hitchhiker, an ice cream vendor, construction, a jogger,
a car stopped at an intersection, or a snow bank. <BR>
<BR>
Because the process is the same, and only the elements of the situation
change, we have many opportunities for conscious performance of the routine
to be practiced into habit. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Second Step of Zone Control </H3>

The second step of Zone Control begins after the driver's alert switch is
turned on by detecting a closed zone. Before taking an action, all necessary
information should be obtained by &quot;Checking The Other Zones.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
To make consistently low-risk decisions, a driver needs to gather all available
information in a timely manner. When a deteriorated zone condition is detected
at least 12-15 seconds ahead in the target area, there is ample time to
get complete information. <BR>
<BR>
Example: After seeing a closed front zone, a check of the rear zone should
take place each and every time before or as the foot goes onto the brake
pedal. Such conscious performance during the learning process will help
the driver develop a proper habitual searching pattern. At some time, perhaps
many years after the driver receives his/her license, the driver is confronted
with a quick and unexpected braking action while traveling at 60 mph on
a highway as traffic comes to a sudden stop. A timely, instinctive glance
in the rear view mirror can give the driver options to avoid a devastating
rear end crash. It would be unlikely that a driver education teacher would
ever experience that high risk situation during in-car performance. However,
there can be hundreds of opportunities to practice control of the rear zone,
beginning with checking the rear view mirror during routine stop situations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Third Step of Zone Control </H3>

The third step of Zone Control takes place after all available information
has been processed. It results in the driver taking the appropriate actions
that will result in the best speed control, lane position, and communication.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Speed Control Options </H3>

After making an evaluation of the zone conditions, you have five options
for speed control. One of these five choices is the best option. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same Speed <BR>
Decelerate <BR>
Off Gas - Cover Brake <BR>
Off Gas - Apply Brake <BR>
Increase Speed </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
At any given moment one of the speed control options is best. Which is &quot;best&quot;
is determined by the principles of Zone Control. For example, one of the
principles states &quot;When the front zone is closed, adjust speed to arrive
into an open zone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Therefore, while approaching a red traffic light, our expectation of correct
performance goes beyond merely stopping for the red light. There is an opportunity
to put the three steps of Zone Control into action culminating with an effective
selection of speed control. <BR>
<BR>
When students take their foot off the accelerator, check the rear view mirror,
and begin applying the brake, positive feedback can be given to reinforce
correct behavior. When the foot stays on the accelerator too long, a cue
can be given to generate a correct response. Effective speed control is
achieved on a conscious level and can be applied in the same manner to numerous
other situations until correct habitual behavior occurs. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Lane Position Options </H3>
<IMG SRC="lanepos.gif" WIDTH="401" HEIGHT="104"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
There are five possible lane positions a driver can select from to gain
&quot;best&quot; lane positioning. Lane <B>position one</B> is in the center
of the lane. Lane <B>position two</B> is to the left edge of the lane. Lane
<B>position three</B> is to the right edge of the lane. Lane <B>positions
four and five</B> are straddle positions used for special situations. <BR>
<BR>
One of the principles of Zone Control for determining correct lane usage
says, &quot;Keep the most open space away from the worst problem.&quot;
While most travel lanes are twelve feet wide, cars are less than six feet
wide. When a driver moves away from a right front zone change by going into
lane position two, there becomes six feet of empty space. Such empty space
can give you more time to recognize when a vehicle is entering your intended
travel path, and it will give other drivers an escape path to minimize or
to avoid a crash. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Students Need to Learn How to Acquire Accurate Feedback </H3>

From the use of the Zone Control System and its principles, drivers are
able to acquire a feedback system to know when successful low-risk behavior
and wrongful higher-risk behavior occur. <BR>
<BR>
The major objective of the Zone Control System is to create control of all
six zones surrounding the vehicle. Drivers are taught not to enter closed
zones and to create adjustments in time and space to arrive into open zones.
They are expected to create improvements in speed and positioning to other
vehicles and to LOS restrictions to gain the best control. <BR>
<BR>
When a zone change is present, and the driver uses the Zone Control System
to create control, the standard for success is several steps removed from
a crash. For example, while approaching an intersection, a truck is stopped
in the left turn lane, resulting in an LOS restriction of the left-front
zone. The driver creates control over the LOS restriction by checking the
rear zone, evaluating lane choice and positioning within the lane, covering
the brake, selecting an appropriate speed choice, and searching to the left-front
of the stopped truck to evaluate POT conditions. <BR>
<BR>
The student can receive positive feedback for any or all of these action.
At first the feedback comes from the instruction, then positive self-feedback
can occur. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Go Beyond Defensive Driving: Be A Creative Driver! </H3>

The Zone Control System, quite simply, teaches drivers how to create control
of the driving environment they are operating in. To be in control means
applying the principles of Zone Control to situations when there is the
best opportunity to neutralize a zone change from becoming a high risk situation
that could result in a dramatic, and often traumatic, reaction. Zone Control
is a proactive system that teaches drivers to make small adjustments to
take control of a situation before the trap is sprung. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is time to stop teaching slogans such a &quot;drive defensively&quot;
and begin teaching drivers how to create control over a situation. When
a driver is in control of a situation, there are fewer surprises from others'
actions. That allows the elimination of stressful, if not dangerous situations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Science of Driving </H3>

There are cause and effect relationships that can give the driver predictable
feedback when a particular condition takes place. For example, when a driver
turns the steering wheel fully in a given direction, and a certain speed
is obtained, the turning radius of the vehicle will be consistent under
those same conditions. When speed is increased the turning radius of the
vehicle will increase. If a driver is approaching a small radius curve and
speed is not reduced, the car is going to use a large steering radius which
makes the car travel beyond the radius of the road. The results are very
predictable. The car goes off the road surface and crashes into the trees
bordering the road's edge. <BR>
<BR>
Carney stated, &quot;Speed selection is not an independent issue. It is
a complex accommodation of a variety of factors.&quot; There are many factors
which can compound the risk a driver is exposed to, and there are always
risk-generating factors not known to the driver. <BR>
<BR>
While approaching a small radius curve, some of the risk factors having
a scientific effect upon the steering radius of the vehicle are direction
of the curve, left or right; camber of the road surface, grade elevation,
up, down, or level; loose sand, water, ice, snow, dew on the road surface;
composition of the pavement; suspension system of the vehicle; tire pressure;
application of acceleration or braking forces; number of occupants in the
vehicle; seating location of occupants; weight of occupants; drive line
entry into the curve; apex positioning; an exiting point of the drive line.
<BR>
<BR>
The presence of any one of these risk factors can result in the car going
out of control when the driver is operating close to the edge of the traction
envelope. <BR>
<BR>
It would be beyond human capabilities to expect a driver to know all the
risk factors that may be working against him/her at any given moment. But
we can teach a system of habit formation that will give the driver an opportunity
to make a low-risk, timely response to compensate for the unknown and unknown
risk factors. <BR>
<BR>
Using the Zone Control System, a driver would identify the curve in the
target area as a front zone change. Check the other zones to see what options
are available for best lane positioning on the approach to the curve. Evaluate
tire/surface traction to aid in the selection of the &quot;best&quot; speed
control. Search into the curve for the condition of the POT before and during
entry. <BR>
<BR>
For each situation, whether it is a curve ahead, a red traffic light, a
parked car, a construction site, stopped traffic, or any of the other countless
different situations, the Zone Control process is the same. The student
need learn only a few principles and apply them over and over in a variety
of situations until it becomes an internalized value. Summary Most good
building contractors are not architects, but they are able to build a solid
structure when provided with a proper blueprint. Spending the past few years
traveling around the country sharing ideas with a great many driver educators,
I have found eager and highly motivated driver educators who welcome effective
curriculum materials. <BR>

<blockquote>&quot;Your teenager will still think he's immortal. But we'll have improved his life expectancy.&quot;<P>

That statement appeared in a Kingston, Ontario, newspaper advertisement last 
month. It was an ad for a novice driver training program run by Young 
Drivers of Canada (YD), an internationally franchised chain of driving 
schools that has branches in the U.S. and Europe. It angered psychology 
professor Gerald Wilde, an expert on driving and risk-taking behaviour based 
at the local Queen's University. He feels it's misleading advertising.<P>

The ad's statement, Wilde feels, conflicts with evidence about the 
effectiveness of driver education. It also conflicts with Wilde's theory of 
risk homeostasis, which tries to explain why it is that safety measures 
developed by industry and government often don't yield the intended 
results.<P>
Risk homeostasis theory (RHT) has been the subject of hot debate in safety 
and health circles for almost two decades now. It states that unless a 
safety measure motivates drivers to reduce their &quot;target level of risk,&quot; it 
will have no effect on their chances of having an accident and no effect on 
their life expectancy prospects. Wilde has just put his theory, along with 
all of its supporting arguments and data, into a book titled <STRONG><A HREF="target.html">Target Risk</A></STRONG>.<P>

Wilde's theory is debated because it brings into question the effectiveness 
of any safety measure -- whether it be engineering, enforcement or education -- in reducing crashes, unless it can change safety motivation. The recent 
revelation from the Highway Loss Data Institute that antilock braking 
systems have not reduced deaths, injuries or repair bills, is a case in 
point. <P>
It bolsters Wilde's theory that drivers tend to use up the safety value of 
such interventions by adjusting their behaviour so that their perceived 
level of risk remains the same. In the case of ABS, the evidence shows that 
drivers of cars equipped with it tend to drive faster, take more chances, 
and use their brakes more heavily.<P>

With regard to driver training as a safety intervention, Wilde writes: 
&quot;There are two opposing views, the prevailing one that driver training is 
productive towards safety, and the view held by RHT that it is not. &quot;<P>  
Professor Wilde defines training as &quot;the instilling of practical perceptual, 
decisional and motor skills,&quot; and education as &quot;the effort to enlighten, to 
civilize, and thus to impart more mature views, beliefs and values.&quot; He 
points out that the evidence does not support beliefs that current driver 
training/education programs for novice drivers reduce crashes. In fact, he 
goes further to argue that the same applies to post-licensure defensive 
driving courses.<P> 
Risk homeostasis theory has been described as &quot;a frontal attack&quot; on the 
basic premises underlying most of today's government and industry safety 
practices by internationally renowned risk analysis experts Paul Slovic and 
Baruch Fischhoff, and as &quot;the devil's idea to some in the safety community&quot; 
by  economics professor Glenn Blomquist of the University of Kentucky.<P>

It's of particular importance to the driver education community right now. 
Concerns about the safety value of driver education programs have been 
undermining driver ed efforts for more than a decade and there is an obvious 
dissonance between what the driver training/education community feels it's 
doing, and what the research and policymaking communities believe about the 
achievements of training/education. It's also of particular interest in that 
Professor Wilde is part of the Northport Associates team that is developing 
a model for a new kind of driver training/education curriculum.<P>
<H3>Outdated curriculum</H3><P>

In recent years, educators have been shifting their emphasis strongly in 
favour of safety as the primary outcome of training and education. Driver 
education textbooks that became packed with details various interest groups 
felt were important are now seen as a problem in terms of safety 
effectiveness. &quot;We have a 90-hour textbook and a 30-hour classroom,&quot; says 
former Oregon Driver Education Supervisor Del Freeman. &quot;They're trying to 
cover uphill park, downhill park, how to change a flat tire, but there's no 
injury rate involved in those things&quot; (see <STRONG>Driver/Education</STRONG>, September 
1994).<P>

The new emphasis is on teaching risk perception and decisionmaking. But if 
driver training doesn't produce a safety effect, do we need it? Might we be 
faced, at some time in the future, with the rather bizarre prospect of zero 
training requirements for the operation of expensive, and potentially 
dangerous automobiles on overcrowded roadways?<P>

In recent years, lack of support for driver training and education has 
devastated the quality of services in many jurisdictions. Tough competition 
for business has meant that standards have slipped and many of the better 
operators have been forced out. &quot;Bad operators have a tendency to drive out 
good,&quot; says AAA Foundation Executive Director David K. Willis.  In tough 
economic times, school owners who cut corners, pay low rates to instructors, 
and provide minimal service can survive better, while owners who obey the 
rules, pay their taxes, and maintain high standards fall by the wayside.<P>

Most participants in the training industry seem to feel that safety has to 
be their product. It's difficult to get instructors to talk about other 
kinds of outcomes without quoting safety as a benefit.  Most instructors 
want to feel that their students will learn good driving habits from them, 
maintain those habits after getting a licence, and be less likely to have a 
crash as a result. However, the practical reality for instructors is that 
their students would like to pass their driving test and get a licence, and 
that has to be the instructor's immediate priority. For the most part, the 
driving test drives training priorities and determines the quality of 
training.<P>

Does this basic necessity preclude making driver's safer? It doesn't have 
to, according to Young Drivers of Canada (YD) president Peter Christianson. 
Christianson takes issue with Wilde's view of training effectiveness. &quot;We're 
brave enough to say we can keep somebody alive,&quot; he says. &quot;Wilde wants to 
challenge ... he hasn't taken our course. He hasn't driven down a gravel 
shoulder at 80 km/h with two wheels on the gravel ... done threshold braking 
from 80 km/h ... done brake and avoid...hasn't taken a defensive driving 
course so he knows how to move his eyes properly.&quot;<P>

&quot;If you design your course with the specific objectives of reducing crashes 
and saving lives you will see something totally different from what most 
driving schools are teaching, that is, to pass the road test.&quot; 
Christianson sees a big challenge for driver trainers in Ontario's new &quot;G2&quot; 
road test. This is a longer, and more thorough, test of defensive driving 
ability that will be given to driver licence applicants in Ontario at the 
end of the second phase of graduated licensing. It will likely be 
implemented in the spring of 1995. Currently, G2 licence applicants are 
being tested with an enhanced version of the pre-graduated licence road 
test.<P>

You can't pass the G2 test, Christianson says, unless you drive defensively. 
And YD Graduates will find it easy, he feels, because YD has always trained 
students to meet these kinds of demands. However, the trend away from 
driving basics is not something Christianson favours. The YD strategy, he 
says, is &quot;to give people the basic skills quickly, so that the remaining 
60-70&#37; of course time can be spent on teaching defensive driving or 
safety.&quot;<P>

Studies that have indicated driver education courses as being ineffective in 
producing safety gains don't impress Christianson. Researchers, he feels, 
haven't studied the best programs. &quot;I can't give you any studies that 
validate driver training,&quot; he says, &quot;but they (researchers) can't validate 
what they're saying either.&quot; The DeKalb study, often quoted as the largest 
and most controlled study of driver education effectiveness ever, and as 
definitive evidence of driver ed's failure, was flawed, he points out, in 
that there was very little actual on-road driving time included. &quot;Any 
educator will tell you that you remember 10&#37; of what you hear, 20&#37; of what 
you hear and see, up to 80&#37; of what you hear see and do...it's the doing 
that creates the change.&quot;<P>

Can training programs change the attitudes and behaviour that lead to 
crashes? &quot;Change of attitude is cemented,&quot; Christianson says, &quot;when students 
can see the results of a different type of driving behaviour -- they see what 
they can do...but they don't tend to become risk takers unless you do the 
training badly.<P>

<H3>Training paradox</H3><P>

The DeKalb study mentioned above compared three large groups of about 5,500 
high school students. One group got a specially developed &quot;Safe Performance 
curriculum&quot; (SPC), which included 32 hours of classroom instruction, about 
16 hours of simulator training, about 16 hours on a driving range, and about 
four hours of on-road training. A second group got a minimal training 
program with only 20 hours classroom, simulator and range combined, and just 
one hour of actual on-road training. The third group were not allocated to 
any formal training at all and were left to parental instruction, although 
some might have taken formal training on their own initiative.<P>

While Christianson is critical of the small amount of time spent in on-road 
training with the SPC DeKalb group, Professor Wilde is more interested in 
the fact that the group that got the most training had the worst driving 
record in the years following, a result that's been echoed in similar 
studies in the UK and Norway.  &quot;Since it's difficult to accept that training 
could make people worse,&quot; he writes in <STRONG><A HREF="target.html">Target Risk</A></STRONG>, &quot;one could reason as 
follows. Suppose that beginner drivers as a group more often overestimate 
risk than underestimate it. All else being equal, they will incur fewer 
accidents.&quot; <P>
The highly trained DeKalb group, Wilde surmises, were likely overconfident 
due to their increased level of skill. The less trained were likely to 
overestimate their risk in driving situations and, as a consequence, to 
drive with greater caution.<P>

This, according to Wilde's risk theory, leads to the paradoxical situation 
in which &quot;additional training should lead to an increase in accident rate 
precisely because the graduates have become more competent -- more competent 
risk takers, that is. Better driving skill -- risk perception included -- does 
not necessarily mean fewer accidents,&quot; he concludes.<P>

Christianson agrees that the accident chances of risk overestimators could 
be increased through training -- if that training has the wrong approach. 
Skid control training is an example, he feels. &quot;Skid training has been done 
incorrectly for the past 25 years; (many) programs have removed the fear, 
the respect for danger, by giving students a skid baptism, spinning them 
out.&quot; Emergency techniques training on YD courses does not include 
situations in which the student driver loses control over the car.<P>

A skid that doesn't go past the limits of recovery is OK, but spinning out 
just serves to overcome the student's natural fear of losing control. &quot;We 
should leave students with a fear of unknown. Once it becomes fun, every off 
ramp becomes a place to skid,&quot; says Christianson.<P>

While Wilde's homeostasis theory is threatening to driver training/education 
it is not necessarily incompatible with it. &quot;The notion that people could be 
educated to lower their acceptance of accident risk is not incompatible with 
the postulates of risk homeostasis theory,&quot; he writes, pointing to 
reductions in accidents and violations achieved in a preliminary study of a 
form of psychotherapy applied to repeated offenders as an example.<P>

Driver educators will get a clearer look at the future of training/education 
when the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety releases its model for curriculum 
development. One of the critical questions to be decided in framing the 
model, says project leader Lawrence Lonero, is the question of how 
priorities will be balanced between attempting to develop methods that are 
more effective in producing safety benefits and the furthering of other 
potential outcomes such as greater mobility, more efficient drivers, and the 
production more sophisticated traffic citizens.

<h3><A NAME="aaa">AAA curriculum on track</A></h3><P>
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety's project to develop a model for a new kind of driver education is on schedule for completion at the end of January 1995, according to the Foundation's Executive Director, David K. Willis. <P>
The model curriculum will be in the public domain once completed, and anyone can take it and continue the work, Willis says. It will be a signpost for further development and Willis hopes that some organization or group will carry on the work once the report on the project is released. <p>
Under project leader Lawrence P. Lonero of Northport Associates, the process of developing a model curriculum guideline includes an extensive review of the literature, discussions with selected key people in the field, and a weighing and balancing of key issues. One of these issues, says Lonero, is the question of whether safety should be the sole priority of driver training/education or whether other objectives such as mobility, efficiency, and economy in using the automobile in the traffic system should receive prominent emphasis. <P>

<h3><A NAME="drive">Drive Michigan safely</A></h3><P>
A two-year safe driving campaign in Michigan state is putting primary emphasis on driver courtesy. &quot;Drivers must have the skills and knowledge they need to be good drivers and that is why the State Safety Commission is encouraging motorists to give more thought to the driving experience and to exercising courtesy,&quot; said Secretary of State Richard H. Austin. <P>
There has been increasing public concern in Michigan about discourteous drivers. The Transportation Association of Michigan (TSAM) is exploring the possibility of establishing &quot;courtesy clubs&quot; to encourage drivers to clean up their act. &quot;Any comments and suggestions for the campaign are welcome,&quot; says TSAM President Thomas Reel. <P>

At Hartland High School in Livingston County, Michigan, students entering driver education programs are asked to sign an agreement, along with their parent or guardian, which sets out expectations and restrictions for the student's first year of driving. These requirements are somewhat similar to the requirements of graduated licensing programs. Technical assistance for the program is being provided by the Traffic Safety Association of Michigan (TSAM) and the Michigan Department of State.

<H3><A NAME="alcohol">Does DE work for alcohol offenders?</A></H3>

In recent years, educational programs for repeat offenders have become a popular alternative to fines and licence suspensions. This has been due to an assumption that drinking drivers lack knowledge or skills that would enable them to avoid subsequent offences. <P>
Evaluations of educational programs do show increases in knowledge and improved attitudes. However, evidence to show improvements in subsequent offence records has been scarce. One reason for this, it is suggested, is that the effects of the educational programs are long term. <P>
While there is no conclusive evidence of such effects, a unique long-term follow-up study by Dr. Robert Mann of the Addiction Research Foundation in Toronto, Ontario, has produced significant evidence of a positive result from educational programs. <P>
Dr. Mann examined the incidence and causes of death among two groups of impaired drivers, 7 to 13 years after their second conviction. One group had attended a brief educational program, the other had not. Those who had attended the educational program had a significantly lower mortality rate than those who did not. <P>
The lower deaths associated with the educational programs were from accidental and violent causes. There was no difference between the groups in deaths due to cirrhosis and alcohol dependence syndrome. <P>

California has just passed a bill that paves the way towards allowing certain driving schools to conduct California's driver licence road test. The bill passed the assembly on August 29 and was sent to the governor. <P>
If the governor consents to it, the bill will implement a pilot program to study testing by commercial driving schools. It will also impose duties on the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to monitor the privatized testing. Tests given by commercial driving schools will be the same as those given by the DMV and the DMV will conduct on-site inspections.<P>
Driving school examiners will be required to have at least 500 hours of instructional experience and may not test students they have previously instructed. <P>

<H3><A NAME="newtest">California's new test</A></H3>

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is developing a new driving test aimed at improving the state's drivers. <P>
Following recommendations by researcher Dr. James McKnight, the DMV has developed, and is now field-testing, a test known as the Driver Performance Evaluation (DPE). The new test is intended to provide a longer and more comprehensive road test, using routes that reflect the state's complex driving environments, and with scoring criteria that will provide for more objectivity and standardization. It's expected to be a much tougher test that will drive standards for training and education in the coming years. The pilot program began in late May 1994. <P>
Applicants taking the new test will be expected to do freeway driving, and deal with merging traffic, bicycle lanes, and traffic congestion. They will also be expected to identify mechanical equipment on their vehicles and do a pre-drive check test. Failure to carry out these test elements will result in postponement or disqualification. The test will take about 20 minutes.<P>

<H3><A NAME="whatis">What is driver education?</A></H3>

What image comes to mind when you hear the words &quot;driver education&quot;? According to a &quot;non-scientific&quot; survey, says traffic safety consultant Jack Weaver in a recent newsletter to his clients, most people think of it as &quot;a high school course for young drivers.&quot; <P>
This is a wrong impression, says Dr. Weaver. But it's a view held by 80&#37; of those surveyed, and this included police, traffic judges, even high school teachers. <P>
&quot;The point is,&quot; writes Weaver, &quot;those of us that have been working in the driver and traffic safety education profession for several years have done a damn poor job of public information.&quot; Driver education is much more than school courses for beginners, he says . &quot;It is an education, training and information dissemination program in which all public and private agencies and businesses can and should participate&#138;It is a training and education effort intended to improve the knowledge and skills of every highway and roadway user from the cradle to the grave.&quot;<P>
Weaver prefers the title &quot;Driver and Traffic Safety Education&quot;. This, he feels, reflects the fact that it's multi-program training and education which serves a wide clientele.<P>
Traffic safety groups &quot;are finally realizing the need to synthesize the various elements of driver and traffic safety education into a dynamic public and private force,&quot; says Weaver. <P>

<H3><A NAME="init">Canada's safety initiatives: Blueprint for the future</A></H3>

The Canada Safety Council is hosting a follow-up to the 'Facing The Challenge 2001' conference hosted by the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA) and the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) last February in Toronto, Ontario.<P>
The conference, titled &quot;Your Piece of The Puzzle,&quot; will take place in Ottawa, Ontario on March 15, 1995. Its goal is to offer individuals and representatives from associations, government agencies and companies a chance to develop their own strategies within the national agenda for reducing traffic crashes. <P>
During sessions and workshops at the conference, attendees will have the assistance of knowledgeable safety practitioners from national, provincial and local levels of government, and industry will provide sample models for delegates to work from.<P>
During the February conference (see <STRONG>Driver/Education</STRONG>, June 1994) five priorities in road safety were identified. These were: <P>

<UL><LI>To improve driver education and public awareness.<LI>
To promote a higher level of communication and cooperation amongst various road safety stakeholders.<LI>
To improve financial support, particularly by re-allocating funds.<LI>
To improve the quality of road safety data.<LI>
To improve enforcement through efficiency and better allocation of resources.</ul><P>

Among the solutions proposed under the heading of public awareness and education were the following:  <P>

<UL><LI>Stimulating public debate and marketing safety issues by raising awareness of injuries, pain, death and suffering to an emotional level.<LI>
Demonstrating the health costs.<LI>
Promoting alternative transportation.<LI>
Using the media to promote road safety issues.<LI>
Mobilizing communities and public education organizations to organize communication networks through mobile phones&#59; toll free numbers to report dangerous driving or traffic problems&#59; computer bulletin boards&#59; publications.  <LI>
Promoting childhood traffic education from kindergarten through Grade 12.</UL><P>

<STRONG>DRIVER EDUCATION</STRONG><P>

In the area of driver education the solutions suggested were:<P>

<UL><LI>Development of national minimum standards for all road safety educators, programs and driver's tests. <LI>
Self-regulating and monitoring of driving schools<LI>
Cooperative approach between government and driving schools for delivery of driver improvement programs.<LI>
encourage effective incentives to take training and retraining programs (e.g. employer-sponsored).<LI>
Raise the profile of driver education<LI>
Increase program emphasis on human factors, injury prevention, defensive driving, collision avoidance techniques, risk assessment and decision making.</UL><P>

<STRONG>NEW DRIVERS</STRONG><P>

It was suggested that graduated licensing systems be adopted by all jurisdictions, utilizing a uniform model wherever appropriate. Also that:<P>

<UL><LI>Effectiveness be monitored.<LI>
More challenging road tests be established.<LI>
Secondary training programs be encouraged for all new drivers. <LI>
Remedial sanctions for violations of graduated licensing restrictions. </UL><P>

<H2><A NAME="street">Street driving and the gas pedal</A></H2>
<blockquote>
Today's auto advertisers know that speed and power sell. And they also know that they're selling to a largely unsophisticated market in which most of the &quot;targets&quot; of the advertising are not particularly knowledgeable about what power and speed mean, or how to use them. <P>
Car advertising consistently depicts speed and maneuverability as selling points, and when it comes to speed the most commonly cited statistic is acceleration from 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h). And that, according to auto technology journalist Gerry Malloy, is a particularly useless statistic to offer in relation to a car's acceleration needs for common traffic situations.<P>
Since drivers rarely, if ever, need to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) in one burst, what should interest them more are the kinds of acceleration needed for traffic situations such as merging into a traffic flow, changing into faster lanes of traffic, or getting onto freeways. In other words, acceleration from 30-50 mph (50-80km/h) or from 50-70 mph (80-120 km/h) is much more significant for the driver, suggests Malloy. <P>
But even these statistics may not be as important as how the car actually responds to the accelerator pedal. Acceleration figures are measured at full throttle. What is more relevant to the street driver, Malloy says, is how the engine responds to pressure on the pedal. If the response is too slow, the driver may regard the engine as underpowered, even though it may, in fact, be more powerful than the engines of comparable cars. And if the response is too quick it may be difficult, or even impossible, to get smooth starts or smooth transitions to higher speeds. Also, the car may be difficult to control, particularly in slippery conditions, because it's all-too-easy to overdo things with the gas pedal at the wrong moment.  <P>
There may be a number of reasons for poor throttle response, Malloy points out. The car may be underpowered, but it could also be due to poor throttle linkage geometry, &quot;or its low-speed, part-throttle performance may be compromised to generate a high peak power output that will look good in advertising comparisons with the competition.&quot;<P>
Some manufacturers are beginning to see the light and are beginning to favour better feel over big horsepower numbers, according to Malloy. One 1995 car, he says, is getting a reduction in power to increase its performance in the more critical street-driving responses. <P>

By 1996, the Atlanta, Georgia area will be a showcase for the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (IVHS). The area has been selected to be one of the first large-scale tests of IVHS technology, and visitors to the Olympic Games will find cars, taxis and buses that are equipped with onboard computers giving them information about locations, traffic problems and routes. These technologies have already been tried out in a number of areas around the world, including a test in the Orlando, Florida area that was completed this year. The Orlando system is reported to have saved about 20% in driving time for cars equipped with the devices. <P>
Electronic wizardry is also saving money, and crashes, at toll areas on some highways. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority reports that before installing electronic toll collection at its 10 toll plazas, 13% of fatalities occurred in their vicinity. Since then, there have been no fatalities and only two crashes. <P>
Vehicles equipped with the electronic toll recorders don't have to stop as they pass the booths. It's estimated that about 500,000 American cars already have these devices installed. <P>
Even smarter vehicles have radar that warns drivers about obstacles in their path and slows their vehicle if it's getting too close to the one ahead. One such vehicle has been driven from Detroit to Chicago and back without the driver having to assume control over speed. <P>

<h3>... And licenses too...</h3><P>
Soon, the European Union will adopt a &quot;smart card&quot; driver's license as the standard for the new unified European license. The card will store information about the driver, for example, about convictions, medical information, and so on. And it can be re-programmed.<P>
In Sweden, Fred Goldberg is taking this idea a step further. Goldberg's daughter was killed by a driver who was driving at high speed while under the influence of alcohol, and whose licence had already been suspended for another drunk driving conviction. Goldberg's idea is a smart-card license that is recognized by a reader installed in the vehicle. The reader would be programmed to recognize whether a license is valid, or even to recognize just certain licenses, such as those of family members. It could also be programmed to recognize whether an alcohol breath test is required before a driver is allowed to start the car. <P>
There are potential problems with the card. For example, you'd have to lend your license to someone who wanted to borrow your car, or to the auto dealer for servicing. But the prospects for implementation look good. The Swedish National Road Administration has given a grant to Goldberg to develop his idea and he also has the support of businesses, including SAAB and Volvo. <P>

So what about drivers? Keep reading <STRONG>Driver/Education</STRONG> for ideas on how to make drivers smarter.<P>

<H2><A NAME="skid">Skid training results difficult to figure</A></H2>
<blockquote>
&quot; Driving in snow is democracy&#59; money and power don't count.&quot; <br>
-- From the Internet<P>

A skid training program offered to high school students in the Portland, Oregon area who had completed a driver training course the year before, showed some interesting differences between trained and untrained drivers and between subsequent male and female accident and violation rates. <P>
The training program was the subject of a study carried out under the direction of Dr. Barnie Jones, Office of the Manager, Oregon Driver and Motor Vehicle Services. <P>
The training was carried out at a Portland area commercial driving school. It consisted of a short classroom session followed by behind-the-wheel training on a large, flat, asphalt parking lot with a serpentine course marked off with pylons.<P>
 The practical training was carried out in a car equipped with a special hydraulically-operated outrigger system that lifts the weight of the vehicle off the wheels, thereby simulating reduced traction conditions. The outrigger system is mounted on castoring wheels that allow the car to drift in any direction if traction is sufficiently reduced. The weight can be lifted off any of the four wheels independently, so that oversteer can be simulated as well as very low friction conditions such as snow or ice. <P>

There were three phases to the practical training:<P>

<UL><LI>The first phase consisted of instruction in driver position, hand position and eye placement, first-hand experience of loss of traction under various conditions, and the application of various techniques for maintaining traction and control.<LI>
The second phase consisted of timed trials over the serpentine course.<LI>
In the third phase, students were asked to drive over the course without brakes.</UL> <P>

Throughout the course, the instructor emphasized skills for anticipating hazards and avoiding loss of traction. <P>
About 1000 students participated in the study. One group of 300 students actually completed the training. A second group of 322 students consisted of those who had asked to be on the course but did not complete the training. A third group of 396 students did not volunteer.<P>
In a summary of the results of this and other studies of the effectiveness of skid training, Jones concluded that &quot;available research on skid training is highly equivocal.&quot;  Studies in Norway, Sweden, and the U.S. generally show increases in accident rates among course graduates, rather than decreases. However, some interesting differences revealed by Jones's findings may point up important areas of development for advanced training providers to explore.<P>

<H3>The results</h3><P>
<UL><LI>Males and females appear to respond differently to advanced skills training. For example, trained males had slightly more violations than untrained, and trained females slightly less than untrained females. <LI>
Students who completed the training were slightly more likely to have an accident rather than less. <LI>
The trained group had significantly less accidents in reduced-traction conditions than the untrained group. This training effect was clear for both sexes, although females tended to have relatively more slick-surface accidents.<LI>
Interestingly, there was virtually no difference between trained and untrained groups in culpability for accidents. <LI>
Drivers with skid car training were involved in a lower proportion of rear-end collisions.</UL> <P>

Jones suggests that several competing explanations for the results should be explored. First, those with skid car training may drive more and, independent of the quality of their driving, have more accidents. Second, trained drivers may be more confident of their ability on slick roads and drive more in these situations. Third, skid training may promote overconfidence which is manifested in more risky driving in all kinds of driving situations. <P>
&quot;On the surface,&quot; Jones says, &quot;the findings seem contradictory. A higher overall accident rate suggests that skid car training is detrimental, but the relative absence of slick surface accidents and rear-end collisions indicates that skid car training is having the desired effect, to the extent that these are the types of accidents that the training should be expected to prevent.&quot; <P>

<H2><A NAME="tailgate">Why drivers tailgate</A></H2>
<blockquote>
Alison Smiley  (Human factors expert):  &quot;It's a sociological question.&quot;<P>

Tom Prescott (Forensic services/accident investigator): &quot;Drivers are close to one another and feel as if they're walking...there's a lack of speed differential.&quot;<P>

John Sawatsky (Former police psychologist): &quot;It's aggression.&quot;<P>

Roadworthy (Driver education textbook): &quot;It often indicates that the driver is half asleep and is following the moves of other traffic like a robot.&quot;<P>

Leonard Evans (Author of <STRONG>Traffic Safety and the Driver</STRONG>): &quot;Drivers learn, from repeated experience, that it is safe to do so...the dominant cue when following is the relative speeds of the cars...as long as the vehicles are moving at the same speed there is no feeling of danger...People from different countries have different perceptions of risk in the following distance behind other vehicles...it's a 'collective' learning experience.&quot;<P>

Peter Marsh and Peter Collett (Authors, The Driving Passion). &quot;It's territorial...To prevent overtaking cars getting into the frontal territory, drivers will frequently close up the gap between themselves and the car in front.&quot;<P>
<blockquote><HR></blockquote>


As the preceding items indicate, there are lots of opinions on why drivers tailgate. But there doesn't seem to be much in the line of hard research that would cast some light on this particular kind of driving behaviour. <P>
Several experts queried in preparation for this article admitted that, while they know of research dealing with tailgating behaviour in general, they could not bring to mind any  specific research into why individual drivers do it. Even GM Senior Researcher Leonard Evans, author of <strong>Traffic Safety and the Driver,</strong> a book that has been referred to as the bible of traffic safety research, seems to have little more than opinion to offer on the topic of why drivers adopt a tactic in traffic that is not only dangerous, but also has several tactical disadvantages. <P>
&quot;Why do drivers choose to follow so closely? It seems to me that it becomes largely a driving habit, rather than a reasoned conscious behaviour,&quot; Evans writes. &quot;Drivers appear to do many things for their own benefit rather than for any utility benefit.&quot; He goes on to suggest that, in some cases, it may be done as criminal behaviour that's indulged in for its own sake. <P>
Evans also suggests that the lack of speed difference between vehicles allows drivers to feel safe. This, and the fact that crashes are rare events and that drivers can get away with tailgating, makes drivers complacent about the danger. &quot;They have learned from repeated experience that it is safe to do so, in the sense that they have been doing it for years without adverse consequences,&quot; he writes. <P>

<h3>Challenge for educators</h3><P>
If these views hold true, driver educators have an almost impossible challenge in dealing with the problem. The 2-second rule is taught as a rule of thumb for minimum safe following distance. Many educators now suggest 3-4 seconds as a minimum. But selling this driving technique on the basis of safety may be difficult if penalties for tailgating (in the form of accidents) are rare and drivers feel no sense of danger. <P>
On the other hand, more utilitarian penalties for tailgating are quite common. Tailgaters get blocked in more often because they are unable to anticipate problems ahead and select the best lane. &quot;They feel more stress because they can't use their vision properly and do long-range traffic planning,&quot; says driver training consultant David Baker. &quot;Drivers are often more concentrated on defending the indefensible, the space between them and the car in front, rather than on the cooperative aspect of driving in traffic,&quot; says Baker. &quot;When they're shown how, they can see and feel the benefits of staying back and having more control. They feel more confident about their control over the situation.&quot;<P>
However, it might be a lot easier to find ways to sell these benefits if a great deal more were known about why tailgaters tailgate. <P>

<H2><A NAME="commercial">Commercial driver training standards under scrutiny</A></H2>
<blockquote>
A report from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on the effectiveness of private sector commercial-driver training is expected to be released this month. <P>
Congress asked the FHWA for the report to help it decide on whether the training should be subjected to mandatory or voluntary standards. Trucking interests are divided in their opinions. Owner-operators feel that there should be mandatory standards, but an alliance of trucking interests has been formed to lobby for voluntary standards. <P>
One reason the American Association of Trucking Associations is in favour of voluntary standards is because of the difficulty government might have in adapting standards to the great variety of training needed for drivers in different jobs. &quot;The government is likely to take a one-size-fits-all approach, which is not necessarily appropriate,&quot; ATA senior vice president John Collins told the Highway &#38; Vehicle Safety Report recently. Collins believes the government should set standards based on outcomes, or what the driver can do, rather than on hours spent in class or on a particular topic. The owner-operators maintain that drivers are not being properly trained and that mandatory standards are required to change this.<P>
The Driver Training Alliance is sponsoring a forum in March 1995 to search for solutions. <p>

<H2><A NAME="life">Life under graduated licensing</A></H2>
<blockquote>
After only nine months, it's too soon to offer a diagnosis on how North America's first comprehensive graduated driver licensing system is panning out -- but there are a few snapshot images that can help set the scene. <P>
Government is quite likely doing very well out of it. Before graduated driver licensing (GDL) the cost of getting a license was $31. That included $10 for the knowledge test, $14 for the road test, and $7 for the license itself -- a bargain by any measure. After GDL, the total licence cost is $175, including the second road test at the end of Level Two. With over 200,000 licence applicants each year that means a lot of extra dollars in government coffers. <P>
In the driver training world the picture is dramatically different. It's a disaster area. Business has been down about 50&#37;, by all accounts,  in some areas perhaps as much as 75&#37;. Times are worse than any of the old hands in the business can remember. Intense competition, price cutting, and even sharp practices are the order of the day. <P>
Government is selling the public a product they want and will pay extra to get -- the right to drive.  <P>
In contrast, the driver training industry is facing a dilemma that was neatly demonstrated by a sting operation shown on national television on December 13. A TV reporter is filmed, with a hidden camera, through the window of a driving school. He's bargaining with a driving school owner about taking a course and he wants to know if he really has to sit in class for the whole 25 hours required to get a valid certificate that will give him insurance rebates and a reduction of four months in Level One of GDL. The school owner assures him that they can work something out.<P>
It's a unique situation. The customer wants to cheat by taking less service than he is paying for! But that's the driving school business. If it weren't for incentives it's very unlikely that Ontario driving schools would sell anything like the more than 100,000 approved driving courses (25 hours class, 10-12 hours in-car) now sold each year. <P>
The drop in driving school business was anticipated by the industry. It was a repeat of what happened in New Zealand when a similar licensing system started there in 1987. <P>

<H2><A NAME="update">Update on Ontario</A></H2>
<blockquote>
The Ministry of Transportation has launched a review of the content and delivery of driver education programs throughout the province. Aston Mutiisa, manager of the ministry's Strategic Issues Office, has invited individuals and organizations to participate by joining an advisory committee. <P>

<H3>New tests</H3><P>

A report on the government's new Level Two road test has been presented to an advisory committee which represents the various road safety stakeholders, including driving school owners. Details of the test will likely be released early in the new year. In the meantime, the Road Safety Educators Association (RSEA), which represents driving instructors, has its own test -- the Driver Competency Assessment. This evaluation procedure was developed under the aegis of Transport Canada. It concentrates on a driver's information gathering skills and defensive driving tactics, in addition to basic operational skills. Extensive use of extra interior mirrors by the tester to monitor the eye movement of subjects is a feature of the test.<P>

<H3>Unity prevails</H3><P>

The September issue of <STRONG>Driver/Education</STRONG> included a lengthy account of a well-planned campaign by the Ontario commercial driver training industry to gain a measure of self-regulation and to upgrade standards for schools and instructors.  <P>
The account ended with discord between the long-established Driving School Association of Ontario (DSAO) and a group of dissident driving schools that was attempting to form a breakaway association. At the heart of the discord was a detailed scheme put forward by the Road Safety Educators Association (RSEA) whereby driving schools conducting approved driver education courses would only use RSEA members as instructors and would require instructors to upgrade. Many driving school owners and instructors felt threatened by these proposals. <P>
Just as the September issue was going to print, there was talk of reconciliation between the breakaway group and the DSAO. For a while, it was difficult to determine how things were progressing. The DSAO initiated legal proceedings against the principals of the breakaway group and no one would talk about it. <P>
As the December issue goes to press, the matter seems to have been resolved. The breakaway group has dissolved and two of its members have taken  newly-created seats on the DSAO's board of directors. A primary financial concern for the smaller school owners has been cleared up in that the RSEA will not require instructors to take courses but will offer them as options.<P>

Extra copies are available at $4.95 U.S.<P>&quot;We've done a great job over the years of teaching people how to pump the brakes to maintain control,&quot; says Foundation Executive Director David K. Willis. &quot;You can't do that with ABS.&quot; Many people don't have the foggiest notion how ABS works or how it affects driving techniques, Willis says. The video, made with generous support from General Motors,  brought an actual driver ed class to the GM proving grounds at Milford, Michigan to demonstrate the dos and don'ts of ABS. The class is shown how ABS works and the correct way to use it to maintain control over a car in brake-and-avoid situations. The advantages of ABS are demonstrated and it is emphasized that ABS's main advantage is in enabling the driver to maintain control. A 12-page Teacher's Guide booklet accompanies the video. <P>

This program is aimed at generating discussion between teacher, parent and teenager about four major areas of concern for teenage drivers: speeding, night driving, safety belt use, and drinking and driving. The kit includes the videotape, and instructor's materials consisting of four reproducible activity mastersheets, a master copy of the SADD Contract for Life, a sample letter to parents, a fact sheet about teen  driving, a response card, and a four-page viewer's guide. The video features dialogue between teens and their parents about their differing views on teen driving and the risks associated with the four areas of concern. Inserted at intervals are prompts for discussion, and facts about teen driving casualties. The plan is for teachers to preview the video before showing it to students, and it is suggested that it be viewed in segments. The materials are designed to help teenagers identify the consequences of driving at excessive speeds, realize that night driving is hazardous, recognize the importance of seatbelt use, and establish guidelines of responsibility for both drivers and passengers. <P>

<STRONG>BY Allen Robinson, Ph.D.<BR>
ADTSEA Chief Executive Officer</STRONG><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Each quarter I have the opportunity to share with our members the continued growth and improvement of driver education. As spring approaches we see many positive signs of a brighter tomorrow.
<P>

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in cooperation with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), has just released new guidelines on graduated driver licensing. This document clearly describes the importance of driver education in the licensing process. All driver education teachers should have this document. For those attending the ADTSEA conference in Grand Junction, Colorado, the publication entitled, &quot;Graduated Driver Licensing System for Young Drivers,&quot; produced by NHTSA in cooperation with AAMVA will be available at the registration desk.<P>

Speaking of the ADTSEA conference, Barbara Brody has planned an excellent conference. Two credit workshops for driver education teachers are offered the week prior to the conference. Information on these courses was provided in a previous mailing. I encourage you to participate in these course offerings and be ready for the future in graduated licensing. The conference program has national leaders at each general session preparing us for the future. To be current and ready for tomorrow, you need to be in Grand Junction, Colorado.<P>

Our president, Bob Sundermeier, and his wife have planned great activities. Get your reservations in early so you can join the exciting festivities planned.<P>

The changes we are experiencing in driver education are tremendous. Combining driver education with driver licensing has had a positive impact on our driver education programs. Several states will be reporting on success stories at our conference. I personally believe this is the single most important change we can make in our programs. You can't sell a steak without sizzle. It is hard to sell driver education without some sizzle--a driver license. I encourage you to become involved in driver education/licensing.<P>

Driver educators have been aware of the value of parent involvement for some time. Several of our corporate members are developing excellent programs to assist us. They are AAA, Champion, Allstate, and General Motors. Each of these programs will be discussed at our conference.<P>

The National Student Safety Program (NSSP) continues to be a great success. The July conference in Honolulu, Hawaii will have 500 students and advisors present for a five day program. Jan Meeker of the Hawaii Department of Education has done an excellent job in planning and hosting this conference. I wish more driver education teachers would become involved in NSSP activities.<P>

We continue to get good press in major newspapers. The Chicago Tribune recently published a significant article on driver education in Illinois. I was personally interviewed for the article and was quoted correctly.<P>

I recently attended the Southeast Region ADTSEA meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. David Donaldson, Maynard Bridges, and Charles McDaniel planned an excellent conference. The conference was both enjoyable and professionally beneficial for me. Thanks, Southeast, for the invitation to participate. By the way, the only way you can attend the Southeast ADTSEA meeting is to be a member of ADTSEA.<P>

Travel plans this spring include  Arizona, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Illinois, and Michigan to talk about graduated licensing, driver education/driver licensing, restructuring driver education, teacher training and certification, parent involvement in driver education, and the enhanced driver education program in Pennsylvania. All these topics have many common threads. The most significant is that of changing the way we do business.<P>

You need to be the leader in your community who directs this change in driver education. Be willing to accept change and provide improved opportunities for young people to drive safely. Convince those who teach with you that driver education is our profession. It provides us with a good job and income to support our families. Teachers need to support ADTSEA so we can make sure the future is bright for our members.<P>

<STRONG>BY Robert L. Sundermeier<BR>
ADTSEA President</STRONG><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unbelievable that Spring is just around the corner! Where does the time go? We are nearing completion and planning of our 40th ADTSEA Conference program thanks to the hard work and dedication of some special individuals. Your host outing, along with the many fun activities being planned for your stay here in western Colorado, has been finalized. We hope to meet your expectations for both the conference program and many activities.<P>
Special thanks go to Barbara Brody for the many hours of planning our conference program. She has put together one of the most informative and exciting programs to be offered to the ADTSEA membership in some time. Most areas of traffic safety have been included. You should have received a draft of the 40th Conference Program, so there is time for any suggestions you may care to make relative to our program planning.  <P>
To my spouse, Barbara, the other half of our conference hosts, a special thank you for a job well done in planning our Tuesday night outing and the many fun activities you can experience. For those of you who never visited this part of Colorado, it will be a once in a lifetime experience. Plan to arrive early and leave late in order to vacation and enjoy our beautiful state. <P>
My appreciation goes to Allen Robinson and the staff at IUP for their assistance and mailing the preconference information. Conference and workshop registrations, bylaw amendments, and voting ballots arrived for our membership in a timely fashion. Please take notice of deadline requirements for each planned activity. Make your reservations early, preferably by the June 1, 1996 deadline. Should you need assistance or have questions about the conference or planned activities, please write or call my wife, Barbara, or me.  <P>
An ambitious spring travel schedule is being planned. I will attend state and regional traffic safety meetings in Kansas, Texas, Utah, and Montana. My purpose is to promote new membership in those states and to personally invite all traffic safety educators to attend our 1996 ADTSEA Conference from August 3-8, 1996 in Colorado.  <P>
I strongly encourage our present ADTSEA members to renew their memberships early and get one new member to join. We all need to contribute in order to realize our goal of 200 new members this year. To quote our friends in the Northwest, &quot;Your ADTSEA membership proves your belief that traffic safety education needs a unified voice to speak at the national level. Your ADTSEA membership strengthens the national association of traffic safety professionals which in turn strengthens and complements our state and regional associations. Your ADTSEA membership entitles you to a subscription to <STRONG>The Chronicle,</STRONG> ADTSEA's journal which keeps you informed about new research, curriculum development, and coming events in the various state, regional, and national association programs.&quot;<P>
With winter behind us, we look forward to new challenges ahead. By working together we can make a difference in meeting those challenges and look forward to a brighter future. <P><A HREF="#contents">RETURN</A> to Table of Contents

<H2><A NAME="impact">IMPACT Is Dead On</A></H2>
<STRONG>by Alisa Vald&eacute;s, Boston GLOBE Staff<P>

This video on the dangers of reckless driving won as Best Documentary at the New England Children's Film and Video Festival. The win generated national exposure for the issue of drinking and driving, including a full-length televised broadcast of IMPACT and discussion with Jason Murray--one of the student filmmakers--as well as a prominent story in the Boston Globe. Here are excerpts from that article.<P>

</STRONG><BLOCKQUOTE>MIDDLEBURY, Vt. -- Charles Smith's name is never mentioned in the documentary, IMPACT, but his ghost circles every word. &quot;As the medical crew was putting the C-collar on you they started suctioning your airway,&quot; says the ambulance driver. He looks right at the camera. &quot;There was nothing left of the driver's side door,&quot; says the state trooper, her eyes narrowing with the memory. &quot;You weren't breathing.&quot;<P>
&quot;I took your heart in my hand and I began squeezing,&quot; says the emergency room doctor. She is crying. <P>
Shortly after Smith's death in November 1989, his peers at a technical high school in Middlebury got together to make IMPACT, a film about auto safety and teenagers. Five car crashes involving young people from that high school took place that year. The teenagers asked everyone involved in Smith's accident--doctor, trooper, EMT, tow truck driver--to look right into the camera and explain to Smith how he died. <P>
Now, six years later, this 17-minute film made by hard-luck, working-class kids in rural Vermont has been voted the best documentary at the New England Children's Film and Video Festival. <P>
&quot;IMPACT was the one that stuck with kid judges the longest after they left,&quot; said Cheryl Hirshman, the coordinator of the festival. &quot;I think the format of having the viewer as the victim is very effective. For most of the kids who judged it, this was something none of them had really thought much about.&quot;<P>
Auto accidents are a common topic of discussion for high school students. There's a saying among them: &quot;Summer's here, three a year,&quot; pointing out how many teenagers are expected to get hurt, if not killed, in auto accidents. <P>
In IMPACT, the footage of people talking to Charles Smith is interspliced with footage of teenage boys talking about accidents they have been involved in themselves. <P>
According to Vermont State Trooper Melody Perkins, who has investigated more than 300 auto accidents in five years, including Charles Smith's, they usually involve males. &quot;I'm so tired of telling mothers their sons are dead,&quot; she said. <P>

<H2><A NAME="alcohol">The Influence of 
Legislation on the Driving</A><BR>
and Alcohol Consumption of College Students</H2><HR>
<p><STRONG>BY Robyn Hagler, Carolyn Miller, John Burling, and Cheri Smith</STRONG><BR>University of Montevallo<p><HR>
<p>
<strong>A number of factors impact drinking and driving. These factors include 
peer pressure, risk taking, knowledge, and legislation. This descriptive study 
utilized a questionnaire approach to sample 159 college students with regard to 
peer pressure, risk taking, knowledge, and legislation. The results support the 
efficacy of strengthened legislation and increased educational programs as 
deterrents to drinking and driving.</strong>
<P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Driving an automobile is a challenge that is accompanied by a 
variety of choices. The choices made by drivers can have a tremendous impact on 
the individual and society. One such choice is that of combining drinking and 
driving, a combination that can be deadly to everyone involved. Alcohol 
impairment is a major problem involving not only drivers, but also pedestrians 
and other roadway users. Approximately 500,000 persons per year are injured in 
alcohol-related crashes. On average, one person is injured every minute and one 
person is killed every twenty-three minutes in an alcohol related crash (MADD, 
1993). <p>
When these numbers are broken down there is some room for optimism. The 
proportion of fatally injured drivers of passenger vehicles with blood alcohol 
concentration of 0.10&#37; or more has declined by at least 5&#37; from 1985 to 1994 
(Fatality Facts: Alcohol, 1995). The factors responsible for this decline may 
also be the same factors that influence a driver's decision to combine drinking 
and driving knowledge, risk taking behaviors, peer pressure, and legislation.<p>
Although students know that alcohol-related automobile accidents are the 
leading cause of death among young people, they also indicate a need for an 
increase in  related information (Wechsler &amp; Isaac, 1993 and Mazon, 1987). 
At the same time, the effectiveness of education approaches such as designated 
drivers may seem to be small when evaluated in terms of reduction of accident 
rates (Eigen, 1991; DeJong &amp; Winsten, 1992; and Giller, 1985). The 
responsibility and liability involved in operating a motor vehicle should be 
stressed in any educational program (Valois, 1983).<p>
Balancing responsibility with the factors of risk-taking behavior and peer 
pressure is a challenge that confronts many young drivers. Giller (1985) states 
that most of the time students believe they make their own decisions and deny 
any pressure from peers. However, many students cite peer pressure as the 
reason for drinking more than they want to (Wechsler &amp; Isaac, 1993; Shore 
&amp; River, 1985 ; Mason, 1987; and Poteat &amp; Moltern, 1982). Combining 
peer pressure with an adolescent sense of immortality and invulnerability can 
result in risk-taking behaviors (Nicholson, Minqi and Mahoney, 1994; Giller, 
1985). High-risk drinking attitude and behavior is often developed and 
reinforced during the college years (Hunnicutt, Davis, Perry-Hunnicutt, and 
Newman, 1992).<p>
While peer pressure and risk-taking are important, it appears that major 
deterrents for drinking and driving among college-age youth involve legislation 
and education.<p>
Drinking alcohol during the college years continues to gain social acceptance, 
yet the trend toward drinking and then driving continues to decline. This 
paradox leaves many safety experts pleasantly surprised and puzzled. Much of 
the reduction in alcohol-related crashes is a result of prevention initiatives 
and stronger drunk driving legislation at the federal and state levels. Driving 
while intoxicated (DWI) laws have steadily grown in strength over the last two 
decades, thanks to the emergence of groups such as Mothers Against Drunk 
Drivers (MADD)  and Students Against Driving Drunk (SADD) (Nicholson, Wang, and 
Mahoney, 1994). Furthermore, a variety of legislative mandates, such as the 
recent Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989, have provided additional 
motivation for the increasing concern about the consumption of alcohol on 
college and university campuses (Gehring &amp; Geraci, 1989).<p>
In 1995, the U.S. Congress repealed the national speed limit, leaving highway 
speed decisions up to the individual states. Congress then followed suit by 
repealing mandatory helmet laws, also leaving that decision up to the 
individual states. However, the decision was made to leave mandatory safety 
belt laws in place. Congress has called for states to strengthen their driving 
under the influence (DUI) legislation. States failing to heed this mandate will 
lose  federal highway funds (Nicholson, Wang, and Mahoney, 1994).
<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Method</H3>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study focuses on the impact of peer pressure, risk-taking 
behaviors, knowledge, and legislative efforts have had on the drinking and 
driving habits of college-aged students.<p>
<strong>Subjects</strong>: The subjects in this study consisted of 159 college 
student volunteers enrolled in  core curriculum health classes in a public 
liberal arts university in the southeast. Of the 159, 60 were male and 99 
female. Eighty-eight  of the students were 18-20 years of age, which is below 
the national drinking age. There were 52  students aged 21-24 years and 19 were 
age 25 and over. Approximately 40&#37; of the sample population classified 
themselves as sophomores, 26&#37; as juniors, 25&#37; as seniors and 9&#37; as freshmen. Of 
those sampled 98&#37; reported to be licensed drivers.<p>
<strong>Survey:</strong> The measurement instrument was a 31 item questionnaire 
with responses on a nine-item scale ranging from never to very often.  Nine of 
the questions related to demographic information such as class status, license 
status, and drinking status. Of the remaining 22 questions, a number focused on 
the effect legislation has on the subject's decision to drink and then operate 
a motor vehicle. Questions relating to legislation included: <p>

<UL><LI>The prospect of spending up to one year in jail for a DUI conviction 
influences my decision not to operate a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol.
<LI>The prospect of being stopped by a police officer for DUI influences my 
decision not to operate a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol. 
</UL><P>
Several questions related to other factors including time, religion, peer 
pressure, knowledge, and risk-taking behavior. Examples of these questions 
included:

<UL><LI>I drink alcohol and drive even though I know it is unsafe.
<LI>My friends influence my decision to drink alcohol.</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Procedure: </STRONG>The subjects were given the questionnaire following 
a one-hour presentation on alcohol awareness and the most recent legislative 
changes in their state. Each of the subjects was asked to fill out the survey 
and was informed that the results would remain anonymous.<p>
<p></blockquote>
<H3>Results</H3>
<p><blockquote>
Sixty-three percent of the respondents reported that they 
drank on a routine basis, and 21&#37; stated that either they or a member of their 
family had been involved in an alcohol-related crash. Only 27&#37; had ever had any 
association with a group such as MADD or SADD. More than half of the students 
(52&#37;) reported alcoholism within their immediate family.<p>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents  reported  that they drank on a routine 
basis. Twenty percent of the females said they or a member of their family had 
ever been involved in an alcohol-related crash. Thirty percent reported to have 
been involved with an organization such as MADD or SADD. Ninety-six percent of 
the female respondents were licensed drivers. Sixty percent of the females 
surveyed were 18-20 years of age, which is below the legal drinking age in this 
state.<p>
The study included five items designed to measure risk-taking behavior related 
to alcohol. Thirty percent of the males admitted they operated a vehicle on a 
routine basis after consuming alcohol, while 19&#37; of the females reported to 
drive a vehicle after consuming alcohol. When asked if they would get in the 
car with a friend who had been drinking, 25&#37; of the males and 11&#37; of the 
females indicated they would take this risk. Assuming that it is unsafe to 
drink and then operate an automobile, 24&#37; of the males and 16&#37; of the females 
reported that they do so on a routine basis.<p>
The survey also looked at the role peer pressure plays in the decision to drink 
and drive.  Of those surveyed, 30&#37; of males and 19&#37; of the females indicated 
their friends influenced their decision to drink alcohol. Seventy-nine percent 
of the females indicated they would get into the car with a drinking driver 
because their friends do, while 77&#37; of the males would do so based on what 
their friends encourage. The survey showed 12&#37; of the female respondents would 
intervene to keep a friend from driving after drinking, while 22&#37; of the male 
respondents would intervene.<p>
Six items focused on the effect of legislation on a college student's decision 
to operate a motor vehicle after drinking alcohol.  Studies indicate that males 
continue to outnumber females two to one in alcohol-related collisions and 
three to one among subjects aged 16-25. <p>
Legislation appears to be a deterrent to the majority of both male and female 
students. A slightly higher percentage was recorded for females in every 
category. The fact that drinking and driving is illegal was a deterrent to 17&#37; 
of the female respondents and 30&#37; of the male respondents. This was the single 
item in which male respondents were closer to the desired response than the 
female respondents. This may indicate that female respondents were more 
responsive to the material penalties than the moral issues.<p>
The prospect of being stopped by a police officer for the suspicion of DUI was 
found to be a deterrent to 80&#37; of the female respondents and 76&#37; of the male 
respondents. The prospect of spending time in jail was a deterrent for 81&#37; of 
the females and 74&#37; of the males. Payment of a fine was reported as a deterrent 
by 79&#37; of the female respondents and 73&#37; of the male respondents. <p>
Two other areas of legislation surveyed were license suspension and license 
revocation.  All respondents reported a suspended and revoked license as a 
deterrent. Females reported 76&#37; and 78&#37; respectively, compared to 69&#37; and 72&#37; 
for the male respondents. Curfew enforcement did not serve as a significant 
deterrent to drinking and driving. Twenty-two percent of the female respondents 
and 24&#37; of the males reported that curfews serve as a deterrent to drinking.
<p>
</blockquote>
<H3>Discussion</h3><p>
<p>
<blockquote>Study results may indicate that some young drivers are prone 
to take alcohol-related risks when operating a motor vehicle. While the 
percentages were relatively low, many students did engage in risk-taking 
behavior involving alcohol use and driving. This has the potential to 
dramatically increase the risk of collision. The results may indicate that 
females remain less aggressive drivers. Female respondents are more likely to 
be affected by the material penalties when dealing with sanctions, fines, jail 
sentences, license suspension, or license revocation. Present data supports 
strengthening legislation to act as a deterrent to drinking and driving.<p>
The intention of a college-level alcohol education program is to inform 
students about the effects of alcohol and encourage responsible drinking. These 
programs should encompass prevention, identification, and the development of 
long-term support for alternative methods. Thirty percent of the female 
respondents have ever been involved with socially conscious groups or the 
designated driver program. Perhaps, improvement of accessibility to such 
programs could lower the percentage of drinking and driving among college 
students.<p>
The issue of deterring drinking and driving for college-age youth appears to 
focus on legislation and education. To separate the effect of education from 
the effects of legislation would be difficult. To obtain desired results, the 
elements of education and legislation should be applied to all aspects of this 
critical issue.<p>

<H2><A NAME="penn">Pennsylvania's Enhanced</A><BR>
Driver Education Curriculum Part II</H2>
<STRONG>BY Richard Hornfeck, Ph.D.</STRONG><BR>
Indiana University of Pennsylvania <P>

This is the second of three articles dealing with Pennsylvania's attempt to produce a lower-risk, entry-level driver into the highway transportation system. The first article in <STRONG>The Chronicle,</STRONG> Vol. 44 (1), discussed the development of the curriculum and the selection of the pilot and control schools. This article will discuss the implementation process, difficulties encountered, and the evaluation process.  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The driver education teacher was the key person in selecting the schools to implement the enhanced curriculum. We found that the respective administrators readily approved their school to participate in the study when the driver education teacher enthusiastically endorsed the four components of the enhanced curriculum (decision making, parent involvement, visual training, and night driving). A great deal of responsibility was placed on the teacher because of the following commitments.  <P>
<UL><LI>The teacher would be required to attend a one-week workshop, at which time he/she would be given the material and shown how to incorporate it into his/her current curriculum. <LI>
The teacher would revise his/her current curriculum to reflect the components of the enhanced curriculum. <LI>
 The teacher would develop a parental involvement plan. This would include activities such as the initial meeting with the parents, planned learning experiences, establishing lines of communication, etc. <LI>
 The teacher would schedule night driving experiences for the beginning driver. <LI>
 The teacher would be responsible for the completion of the survey instruments by both students and parents. <LI>
 The teacher would continue the curriculum for a minimum of three years. </UL>
Without the dedication and commitment of the driver education teacher, we would not have been able to implement the enhanced curriculum in selected high school programs throughout the state.<P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Difficulties Encountered</H3>
<blockquote>
The greatest difficulties encountered when implementing the enhanced curriculum involved the night driving experience. As mentioned in the first article, more schools would have participated had it not been for the night driving requirement. Even with the eighteen schools that were committed to teaching the enhanced curriculum, most of the difficulties encountered evolved around the night driving requirement. <P>
Initially, the teachers were asked to have two night driving experiences with each of their students. The idea was to first work with the student in an environment that placed fewer demands upon the student.  With the second experience, the student would face greater risk in relation to seeing hazards and controlling the car . The teacher would usually schedule two or three students for a block of time. With the two driving experiences, the student could get as much as sixty minutes of driving time and the same or greater observation time. Teachers encountered some problems with this when students failed to show for their scheduled times. This created a dilemma when only two students were scheduled and one was absent. Some teachers felt the best way to address the problem was to involve the parents in this phase of learning by having them ride along with the teacher. This activity enhanced the parent involvement and developed a greater awareness on the parent's part in relation to the risks associated with night driving and how to respond to these risks. <P>
Another problem related to night driving was the longer daylight hours during late spring, summer, and early fall. It does not start to become dark until 8:30 p.m., and this was shortening the available time in which to work with students at night. This meant that the teacher might be working as late as 10:00 p.m. in attempting to meet the night driving requirement. <P>
Another problem encountered with night driving involved those schools that had large student enrollments and only one teacher. Attempting to take each student out for two driving experiences with the limited time available created a major scheduling problem. <P>
To address these problems associated with the night driving experience, we recommended or investigated these solutions.<P>
<UL><LI>  The teacher should be the judge of whether or not the beginning driver needs more than one night driving experience. If the student demonstrates less than desirable skills, he/she should be schedule at least one more time. <LI>
  Parents need to assume a greater role in this part of the instruction. They need to be shown what the risks are, how to safely manage them, and how to plan a night driving route. Parents planned routes from simple environments to the more complex. The parents need to maintain a driving log for their beginning drivers and share it with the teacher.</UL><p>
It is important for the teacher to work with the beginning driver in this low-light environment that is extremely difficult for both the beginning and experienced driver. Even when the teacher is able to take a student out a total of two times in this high risk environment, the beginning driver still needs a great deal more supervised practice with a parent or guardian. Involving the parents in this phase of training would not only address the identified problems, but would also enhance the overall learning experiences for the beginning driver. <P>
Another difficulty encountered with the pilot schools is getting the parents/guardians to participate in the program. This participation begins with the initial meeting that the teacher plans with the parents. Attendance varies between the schools. It also varies in relation to the time of year. Planned meetings for the fall semester usually have a greater turnout than those for the spring semester. Only one of the pilot schools has achieved 100% attendance with the parents/guardians. That school requires the meeting if the novice driver is going to take the laboratory phase of driver education. A meeting time for a week night, an alternate time on Saturday, and an individual appointment is scheduled as needed. This is the only school that makes the initial meeting with the parents mandatory. All the other pilot schools arrange for meeting times, but do not make the meeting mandatory. <P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Program Evaluation</H3>
<blockquote>
As mentioned in the first article, there are eighteen pilot/treatment schools and eighteen control schools going into the third year of the study. All of the schools are state-approved programs. The only thing that is significantly different between the two groups is the enhanced curriculum. The four methods of evaluation occurring with this project are:<P>
<STRONG>State Driving Records.</STRONG> After a student has completed both the classroom and behind-the-wheel phases of driver education, the teacher enters the student's name and permit/license number on a roster and sends it to the State. The student should have a minimum of six months driving experience before the driving record is examined for moving violations and reportable accidents. Comparisons will be made between the pilot/treatment group and the control group. <P>
<STRONG>Self-Reporting Survey.</STRONG> To supplement the state records, an extensive self-reporting survey is administered to the students a minimum of six months after completion of both phases of the driver education program. The survey is referred to as Driver Education Survey II. Students remain completely anonymous when completing the survey and are only identifying their high school, grade, and gender. The self-reporting survey is a supplement to the state records because it is providing a great deal more information than would be available with only the state records. Van Fleet (1979) reported that self-reporting surveys have proven to be a valid means of evaluating the risk and exposure of a young driver.<P>
The five major categories of information being sought with the survey are:<P>
<STRONG>Demographics. </STRONG> General information pertaining to the new driver, including gender, grade, age when receiving a learner's permit, number of months on the learner's permit before being licensed, number of licensing attempts, and whose car is usually driven. <P>
<STRONG>Exposures. </STRONG>Type and amount of driving, including location where most of the driving occurs, types of highways or streets where majority of driving occurs, number of times they drive to school, who accompanies them most of the time, day and time when driving occurs, and safety belt usage. <P>
<STRONG>Violations.</STRONG> Violation information, including number of violations, accumulation of points, and types of violations. <P>
<STRONG>Collisions.</STRONG> Collision experience, including numbers of collisions, when they occurred, and types of collisions.<P>
<STRONG>Cause/Effect. </STRONG>Specifics of collisions experienced by drivers are requested.<P>
Overall, this survey instrument will provide a great deal of information on the beginning driver and will supplement the state records. <P>
<STRONG>Student Program Evaluation. </STRONG> This survey instrument is given to the students immediately after completion of both phases of the driver education program. The thirty questions enable measurement of the student perceptions of the driving task. We also request the student to evaluate the driver education program and driver education in general. The information is also shared with the respective high school program (treatment or control). <P>
<STRONG>Parent Program Evaluation. </STRONG> Once the high school students have completed both phases of the driver education program, they are asked to take a survey instrument home and have their parents complete the respective survey. As with the survey instrument completed by the students, parents are asked identical or similar questions. Examples of the questions are: difficulty, if any, the beginning driver had with certain driving tasks&#59; their evaluation of the driver education program&#59; and their evaluation of driver education in general. Once again, the information is shared with the respective high school (treatment or control). <P>
Data has been collected from both treatment and control schools, since the 1993-1994 school year. The number of schools in both groups has progressively grown since the first school year. In 1993-1994, seven treatment and nine control schools were selected to participate in the project. During 1994-1995, seven treatment and five control schools volunteered to participate, while four treatment and four control schools were added in 1995-1996. Presently, a total of 36 schools (18 treatment and 18 control) are providing data for the four evaluation areas. Initial data analysis is planned for the summer of 1996. Preliminary findings should be available in the fall of 1996 for a future <STRONG>Chronicle</STRONG> article. <P>

<H2><A NAME="vote">Exploring Highway Safety Responsibility</A><BR>
Through Values Voting</H2>
<STRONG>BY Martin J. Spellicy, Director </STRONG><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Too often our senses are exposed to motor vehicle tragedy. Radio, television, and newspaper accounts transmit glimpses of lives and families forever altered. Far too often the young seize these headlines, for novice drivers are overrepresented in highway crashes both on a per mile and per capita basis (Wilde, 1994). Wilde (1994) states this overrepresentation is a result of immaturity and experience. Passenger deaths account for 48% of all teenage passenger car occupant deaths, compared with 27% for those older (Williams and Wells, 1995). It behooves driver education instructors to present learning experiences within a low-risk milieu, allowing students to process personal values as they simultaneously assimilate highway safety content. Facilitation of learning experiences which foster student analytical decision making skills, within the current knowledge base of driver education, may better equip students to perceive and confront high risk situations, both as drivers and passengers. <P>
The media reports convey recurrent themes--16-year-old, late at night, weekend, peer pressure, recently licensed, limited experience, speed too fast for conditions, alcohol involvement, multiple passengers, and lack of occupant protection. Unless one is personally acquainted with the victims, the stories soon fade from the conscious memory&#173;only to resurface on subsequent days with different names. How state and federal legislative bodies fulfill their respective highway safety roles can add another causal factor to the youth road safety dialogue. All the while, teachable moments are being squandered. <P>
The following article presents two scenarios, easily incorporated into the curriculum, allowing for the group process to materialize. With the disproportionate losses youth bear as a direct consequence of irresponsible behavior in motor vehicles, the following lesson can nurture the process of shared group values toward individual, publicly acclaimed, self-protective behavior in motor vehicles. <P>
<STRONG>Topic. </STRONG> Responsible decision making related to highway safety issues. <P>
<STRONG>Lesson Objective. </STRONG>Student will interpret and analyze two highway crashes and determine a rank ordering of responsibility for characters in the scenario. Students summarize the influence of peer pressure and the multifaceted issues that can result from irresponsible motor vehicle operation and faulty decision making process. <P>
<STRONG>Assessment Criteria. </STRONG>Students demonstrate analysis in determining and defending rankings of characters in the scenarios. <P>
<STRONG>Activities and Strategies.</STRONG> This teaching activity can be geared either toward pickup truck occupant safety or seat belt safety, and can be presented as either one or two lessons. <P>
<STRONG>Resources and Materials.</STRONG> News stories, cast of characters, scale of characters, rank order of characters, and obituary assignment. <P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>2 Killed, 5 Critically Injured In 11 PM Crash<BR>
</STRONG>(Middleton) Two Middleton 9th graders were killed last night when they were apparently ejected from a pickup truck bed onto the pavement of Highway 13 shortly after 11 pm. A pickup truck, driven by 16-year-old Jim Bond, collided with a sedan operated by 82-year-old Gus Padden. Bond had five occupants riding in the truck bed when the crash occurred. Two of the truck bed occupants were killed and the remaining three occupants riding in the bed of the Bond vehicle were critically injured. Pronounced dead at the scene from massive head injuries were Tom Hart and Conner Belden, ages 15 and 16, respectively. Hart and Belden were ejected from the bed of the Bond pickup and thrown onto the pavement. The drivers, Bond and Padden, were taken to Middleton General Hospital, where each was diagnosed with head trauma and spinal cord injuries. Bond's three additional truck bed passengers, George and Doris Black (brother and sister) aged 16, and Ann Shaw, 17, suffered broken bones and complained of back and neck pain. These three are currently undergoing medical tests at Middleton General. <P>
Police investigators state that Bond was travelling north on Highway 13 when Padden, travelling south, apparently drifted into the northbound lane resulting in the two vehicles colliding head on. Further investigation revealed neither Bond nor Padden were wearing safety belts at the time of the collision. Padden was ticketed for failure to wear prescriptive lenses and failure to maintain lane position. Investigation into the crash is continuing. A bill filed in the state legislature earlier this year that would have prohibited persons from riding in truck beds, along with additional highway safety countermeasures, died in committee.  <P>
Funeral arrangements for Tom Hart and Conner Belden are listed in the Obituary section on page 5. <P>

<STRONG>1 Killed, 2 Escape Injury in 11 PM Crash</STRONG><BR>

(Middleton) One Middleton 9th grader was killed last night when he was apparently ejected onto the pavement of Highway 13 shortly after 11 pm. The driver of the pickup truck, 16-year-old Jim Bond, collided with a 2 door sedan operated by 82-year-old Gus Padden. Bond was pronounced dead at the scene from massive head injuries. A passenger in the Bond vehicle, Meg Shine, was buckled up and reported no injury. Gus Padden, the operator of the sedan, was also buckled up at the time of the collision and was not injured. <P>
Police investigators stated Bond was travelling north on Highway 13 when Padden, who was travelling south, apparently drifted into his lane resulting in the two vehicles colliding head on. It is estimated that each vehicle was travelling within the 30 mph posted speed limit. Bond was ejected from his vehicle and sustained fatal injuries from collision with the he pavement. Padden was ticketed for failure to wear prescriptive lenses and for failure to maintain lane position. A bill filed in the state legislature earlier this year that would have added several provisional safeguards for young drivers died in committee. Investigation into this crash is continuing. <P>
Funeral arrangements for Jim Bond are listed in the Obituary section on page 5. <P>

<STRONG>CAST OF CHARACTERS</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>Jim Bond.</STRONG> 16-year-old, licensed two weeks, has been told to drive safely by parents but has not been provided any limits on use of vehicle or time to be home&#59; believed wearing a safety belt would make him appear uncool and was not buckled up at time of crash. <P>
<STRONG>Father (Jim Bond).</STRONG> Bought and gave Jim car when Jim turned 16&#59; did not stress safety when he presented Jim with the car&#59; gave Jim set of keys to pickup and took Jim to get his license the day Jim was of age. <P>
<STRONG>Mother (Jim Bond).</STRONG> Sees Jim leave driveway without safety belt fastened&#59; says nothing to him as she waved good-bye.<P>
<STRONG>Meg Shine (Bond friend).</STRONG> Reminded Jim to buckle up but didn't insist on it&#59; she buckled up and was not injured in the crash. <P>
<STRONG>State Legislature.</STRONG> Enacted safety belt law with secondary enforcement provision and a maximum $5.00 penalty.<P>
<STRONG>Local Police. </STRONG> In the five years the safety belt law has been on the books, the department has not issued a ticket for noncompliance&#59; observed Jim drive by not buckled up and did not stop the pickup.<P>
<STRONG>Gus Padden.</STRONG> 82-year-old driver whose license stipulated he was to wear glasses at all times of vehicle operation&#59; Padden was not wearing them at the time of the collision. Padden was buckled up at the time of the crash and was not injured. <P>
<STRONG>Additional Information.</STRONG>  Legislature killed bills to institute a graduated license for persons under 21 years of age. The provision would have included stipulations that would not allow a driver to drive without someone over 21 in the vehicle during the first year of operation&#59; those drivers under 17 would not be allowed to drive with more than two other persons under 18 in the vehicle unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 21.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Driver education instructors need to present learning experiences within a low-risk milieu, allowing students to process personal values as they simultaneously assimilate highway safety content. Learning experiences which foster student analytical decision making skills, within the current knowledge base of driver education, may better equip students to perceive and confront high risk situations, both as drivers and passengers. Based on Wilde (1994) models, this technique may provide better student decision-making behavior.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<hr><p><h2><A NAME="aaam">AAAM PROPOSES SWEEPING CHANGES</A><br>IN THE 
CDL MEDICAL FITNESS PROGRAM</h2><p>
<blockquote>
The Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, in a report to the Federal Highway Administration, has made numerous recommendations regarding the medical fitness program for drivers engaged in interstate commerce. The recommendations include:<p>

<STRONG>REGULATORY CHANGES</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>The commercial driver medical certification process should be integrated with the 
licensing process at the state level.<p>
Part 391 and Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) 
should be merged, thus giving the states the responsibility for issuing CDLs in 
compliance with current national standards. Possession of a valid CDL should be 
prima facie evidence that a driver meets all the requirements for a CDL. The 
need for a separate medical certificate should be eliminated.<P>

<li>The license renewal cycle and the medical fitness examination period, currently 
biennial, should be harmonized.<P>

<li>Exemptions from the medical fitness requirements should be eliminated.<P>

<li>The definitions of what constitutes a &quot;commercial motor vehicle&quot; must be
 resolved.<p>

Part 391 of the FMCSRs applies to interstate operators of vehicles weighing more 
than 10,000 pounds; however, Part 383 (CDL) applies to drivers of vehicles 
weighing more than 26,000 pounds. There should be consistency in the weight 
threshold if the medical fitness requirements are incorporated into the licensing 
process.<P>

<li>The definition of an interstate driver should be revised to reflect the driving risk 
rather than the cargo lading.<p>

The relative risk of driving a large commercial vehicle, the on-the-job 
responsibilities of the driver, distances and time traveled, and overall driving 
environment should determine the level of functional capacity necessary to drive 
safely, rather than the type of cargo the driver carries or the way in which the 
vehicle he or she drives has been designated for purposes or commerce. There 
should be no fundamental difference between inter- and intrastate driving for 
safety purposes.</ol>

<STRONG>DRIVER LICENSE AGENCY</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>Driver examiners and medical review specialists should be trained to administer 
the fitness evaluation program.<P>

<li>A state-administered fitness certification program must ensure confidentiality.<p>

Medical reporting procedures and documents must be tamper-resistant. Drivers 
must be assured that their privacy regarding medical conditions is protected. 
Access to medical information within the driver licensing agency should be strictly 
controlled and the use of such information clearly defined so that drivers are fully 
informed of their rights and responsibilities in this regard.<P>

<li>State driver license agencies must have the authority to cancel CDLs if drivers do 
not meet current medical standards.<p>

Appropriate authority vested in the driver licensing agency is fundamental.</ol>

<STRONG>MEDICAL COMMUNITY</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>A national pool of medical examiners should be trained and certified to perform commercial driver physical examinations.<p>

At the present time, the quality of medical examiners varies enormously. A 
national system would establish standards of excellence to ensure more effective 
physical examiners would afford drivers the opportunity to have an examination 
anywhere in the country and would establish a system to monitor the quality of 
physical examinations.<P>

<li>Physicians who choose to report drivers with medically disqualifying conditions 
should have immunity from legal action.<P>

<li>A functioning Medical Advisory Board is a fundamental component of an effective 
commercial driver fitness certification program.<p>

The availability of a case by case review process would address some of the 
current issues raised in the Americans with Disabilities Act.</ol>

<STRONG>MOTOR CARRIER INDUSTRY</STRONG><p>

The support of the motor carrier industry is fundamental to a state-administered 
fitness certification process.<p>

Motor carriers must be assured that the issuance of a CDL means that a 
commercial driver is medically fit to drive.<p>

<STRONG>RESEARCH ISSUES</STRONG><p>

<ol><li>Current medical standards should be evaluated.<p>

There is no question that uniform national standards are needed for commercial 
drivers. States should have the right to set high standards for drivers they 
license. Criteria should be based on functional capability rather than be disease 
specific.<P>

<li>The relationship between current medical standards and crash risk should be 
investigated.</ol><P>

<blockquote>
<ul><li>The Bureau of Motor Vehicles in Ohio began issuance of a new plastic, credit card-type license that are specifically designed to be more secure and tamper-proof. The 
new licenses also have bar codes and magnetic stripes.<p>




<li>The Oregon legislature gave final approval and sent to the governor a bill that would 
allow school officials to suspend students' driver licenses for bringing weapons to 
school. Students' licenses could be suspended until they turn 21 years of age.<p>



 
 
<li>Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles offices are back open after a seven-day strike by the Oregon Public Employees Union. <p> 

The Union had sought a 6.5% pay raise to offset a ballot measure passed last fall that requires employees to pay 6% of their salaries into their pension funds. The state offered a 3% raise on 7/1/95 and 11/1/96. Later, the offer was increased by proposing more benefits.


<li>A bill moving through the Louisiana legislature will allow 14-year-olds to obtain driver permits and enroll in driver education courses.<p>




<li>Because of the Oklahoma City bombing, lawmakers who have introduced bills in New York and Pennsylvania legislatures want rental vehicles to have photographic identification of renters.<p>

The bills would require photographs to be taken of customers at the time a vehicle is rented. The New York bill only applies to truck rental while the Pennsylvania bill includes truck and passenger vehicle rental.<p>




<li>Roger David, who is legally blind as well as 55% deaf, surrendered his driver license after admitting that a Arkansas state employee helped him with test answers when he applied for and received his license.<p>




<li>This fall, Virginia will join 40 other states that use a different I.D. system on driver licenses other than social security numbers.<p>




<li>Newton, Massachusetts police raided the American Family Thrift Store and seized more than 200 applications for false driver licenses, as well as the computer and video imaging to make them. Police stated the equipment was used to reproduce driver licenses from all 50 states right down to holograms and driver license restrictions. <p>




<li>A bill passed by the Rhode Island house would add a one-year prison term to motorists convicted of drunk driving when a child is in the car. An additional term of up to ten years would be imposed if the child is injured or killed.<p>


 

<li>The Alabama legislature, under the leadership of Lt. Governor Don Siegelman, is working on drunk driving legislation that would lower the BAC level to .08% for drivers 21 and over, lower the BAC to .02% for under 21 drivers, set a .02% BAC level for drivers of school buses, day-care vans, and commuter buses as well as permit the seizure and sale upon the third conviction for drunk driving. <p>




<li>About 200 employees of New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles walked off their jobs to attend a protest against plans to privatize their offices. A judge has given approval to an injunction barring future job actions.<p>




<li>The look of Arizona's driver license is about to change for the better. <p> 

The Arizona Motor Vehicle Division unveiled a driver license that promises to be more convenient and useful than the one most motorists are carrying with them today. MVD will begin issuing the licenses through a pilot program that started in June in Glendale and Prescott. It will be available statewide on July 1.<p>

This card is made of more durable plastic and features an easy-to-read format. It has a colorful Arizona scene, an embedded driver photo, a hologram film coating, and a bar code/magnetic stripe. The license is produced on equipment that will allow people to leave most MVD offices with the license in hand, rather than waiting for it to come in the mail.<p>

The new design has many features intended to help cut down on fraud. The hologram film will reveal any attempt to tamper with information printed on the face of the card. That same printed information is duplicated in the bar code and magnetic stripe. Twenty-eight states currently issue driver licenses using bar codes and/or magnetic stripe technology as a means of reducing fraud.<p>

The cost of the driver license remains the same. People with a valid license may wait until the license expires or their first photo update to get the new license. For those wishing to get the new license before that time, the cost is $4.<p>

A new &quot;Under 21&quot; license will be issued. It features the driver's photo on the left side of the card and includes the date the cardholder turns 21.<p>




<li>Despite support from the American Association of Retired Persons, the Maine House of Representatives has rejected a bill that would have required drivers over the age of 40 to be vision tested every six years. Foes said teen drivers are more of a threat.</ul><P>

<STRONG>FHWA Proposes CDL Waiver for Fireworks Industry</STRONG><p>

The American Pyrotechnics Association (APA), a non-profit group representing the pyrotechnics industry, has petitioned the FHWA to reconsider its previous determinations and grant a CDL waiver to part-time drivers involved in fireworks displays.<p>

APA argues that the waiver is necessary because, since implementation of the CDL rule in 1992, the fireworks industry has faced serious problems in delivering small fireworks displays to customers located in remote areas. In order to respond to thousands of requests by Fourth of July celebrants, such as small townships, the companies must rely on part-time drivers who not only drive to the display sites, but also handle and discharge the fireworks. The FHWA is requesting public comments on a petition submitted by the pyrotechnics industry on March 6, 1995, for relief from the requirements of the commercial driver license regulations (CDL) 49 CFR Part 383. The FHWA is proposing to authorize waivers for certain drivers transporting fireworks to displays during the period of Independence Day celebrations from the CDL testing and licensing standards The drivers to be covered by these waivers are part-time drivers who have an otherwise valid driver license, as well as licenses or permits issued by applicable state or local agencies certifying that they are approved pyrotechnic operators. A waiver issued by a state under this proposal would only authorize the transportation of less than 500 pounds of fireworks classified as DOT Class 1.3G explosives, from June 30 through July 6 of each year, 
provided that the vehicles operated have gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) of less than 
10,001 pounds and are operated within 300 miles of the sites of origin. The FHWA requests public comments on whether, if granted, the proposed grant of waiver authority would be contrary to the public interest or diminish the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.<p>

 
Comments to the docket were due June 9, 1995.<p>



<STRONG>NTSB Critical of Texas's CDL Issuance Program</STRONG><p>
 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in a report regarding an August 8, 1994, crash on Interstate 30 near Hanks, Texas, was quite critical of the State of Texas.<p>



The commercial truck driver and his passenger were killed after the driver fell asleep and ran into a bridge column. An autopsy of the driver showed marijuana residual and other drugs in his bloodstream and was slightly below the limit for legal intoxication.<p>



NTSB board chair, Jim Hall, states, &quot;Somebody was asleep at the switch there, weren't they?&quot; <p>


Hall was referring to the fact that the truck driver had three DWI convictions as well as an 
extensive criminal record that included sale of amphetamines and unlawful distribution of a controlled substance, Vice Chairman, Robert T. Francos II added, &quot;Two people are asleep at the switch, one is the licensing authority, the other is the employer.&quot;<p>



The Texas Department of Public Safety stated that nothing on the driver's record would have disqualified him from being issued a CDL under Texas law.<p>

<STRONG>Keep Your CDL Clean</STRONG><p>


 
Mark D. Sutherland of Santa Ana, has authored a new book that he says no trucker should be without titled, &quot;Traffic Ticket Defense for Truckers.&quot;<p>



He claims that this new and unique book by the premier traffic ticket attorney in America 
instructs drivers with strategies, options, and procedures to fight and win your traffic tickets. He adds that &quot;remember you can't outrun the radar, but you sure can beat it.&quot;<p>



<STRONG>Motorcycle Fatal Crash Study</STRONG><p>



A motorcycle fatal crash study completed by the Michigan Department of State reveals that almost half of all motorcycle operators involved in fatal crashes did not have a motorcycle endorsement. The study profiles the motorcyclist involved in a crash as 31 years old, male, riding alone, and not likely to posses a motorcycle endorsement. In addition, a large sub-population of motorcyclists killed during the five years of study were hard-core scofflaw drivers meaning no motorcycle endorsement, license suspended at the time of the crash, multiple previous crashes, suspensions, and convictions.<p>



A copy of the study is available by writing the Office of Traffic Safety, Michigan Department of State, 208 N. Capitol Avenue, Lansing, MI 48918.<p>

<blockquote>

<STRONG>Is Administrative License Revocation <br>Constitutional?</STRONG><p>



<ul><li>A Fremont County Colorado judge has ruled that the state ALR drunken driving law violates the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Judge Walter Fox ordered that drunken driving charges against Paul Gallardo be dismissed because a second prosecution would have violated the 5th and 14th amendments. Fox noted that the United States Supreme Court, in several decisions, has ruled that &quot;jeopardy attaches at a beginning of a civil proceeding to bar a subsequent criminal prosecution in which a defendant may be punished for the same conduct.&quot;<p>
Courts in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington have dismissed charges for the same reason.<p>





<li>A Virginia judge has given Virginia police the go ahead to resume suspending the driver license of motorists arrested for drunk driving. Judge William Broadhurst wrote that suspending the license of a DUI suspect before his or her trial does not amount to double jeopardy because the suspension and subsequent DUI prosecution are part of the same proceeding. It is expected that a definition ruling won't come until months from now by the Virginia Supreme Court.<p>



<li>Prosecutors in Minnesota in arguments before the State Court of Appeals, say the decision to suspend licenses at the time of arrest is remedial and is done not to punish but to protect the public. The Minnesota Court of Appeals is expected to rule by September, 1995 on what is punishment and what is public protection.<p>



<li>The Nebraska Court of Appeals has ruled that when a prosecutor dismisses a drunken driving case, the Department of Motor Vehicles cannot refuse to reinstate the license of the driver. This ruling comes after a previous ruling rejecting arguments that Nebraska's ALR law constitutes double jeopardy.<p>



<li>Ohio Court of Appeals for the Third Appellate District becomes the most recent state appellate court to reject the double jeopardy defense raised by a DWI defendant. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied upon language from prior Ohio and other state appellate court decisions in holding that &quot;an administrative license suspension is remedial in nature and does not constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause.&quot;</ul><p>


 
<STRONG>Illegal Immigrants Not Eligible <br>for CA Driver Licenses</STRONG><p>


 
A California state appeals court has ruled that illegal immigrants are ineligible for California driver licenses. Opponents argued that licenses could be renewed despite a separate 1994 law that bars &quot;original&quot; licenses to illegal immigrants. But the court said a 1992 state law requires all applicants to give their Social Security numbers. &quot;Persons whose presence in the United States is not authorized by law are not entitled to such documents,&quot; the court said. The case is unrelated to Proposition 187, which would deny many state services to people illegally in the country.<p>



<STRONG>WI Appeals Court Upholds Driver License<br>Suspension for Drug Possession</STRONG><p>



The 2nd Wisconsin District Court of Appeals has upheld the constitutionality of a Wisconsin law requiring the suspension of a driver's license for possessing drugs. The Court said the law is constitutional as it promotes a proper public purpose, such as deterring drug crimes.<p>




<STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Rule<br>
on Property Seizure</STRONG><p>


 
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to rule on a Michigan property seizure case that could have an effect on repeat offenders and DUIL impoundment laws.<p>



The Michigan case involved a woman who was a joint owner of an automobile which was 
confiscated because of her husband's using the automobile in conjunction with illegal sex.<p>



<STRONG>New York State's Court of Appeals<br>
Rules Out Scarlet Letter</STRONG><p>



New York State's Court of Appeals has ruled that a Nassau County Court judge lacked the 
authority to require a six-time drunk driving offender to stick a fluorescent sign on the license plates of his car reading &quot;convicted DWI.&quot;<p>



The court stated, &quot;A sentencing court cannot impose forms of punishment not authorized by statute for a particular crime.&quot;<p>

Is your teenager about to drive? Remember, auto accidents are the number-one cause of death in teenagers. Give yourself and your teenager some peace of mind with the added protection of the <STRONG>Peace of Mind Sign</STRONG>. <P>

Your teen may feel a little uncomfortable with this sign on the car but, as a parent, you should insist on its use during practice sessions with your new driver. Take a lesson from driving schools. These organizations use warning signs on their vehicles to improve communication with other drivers and to help ensure the safety of their students. Now you can offer your child that same protection. Don't hesitate a minute when you can maximize the safety of your child. <P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Provide a better practice environment</H3>
<blockquote>
Provide your new driver with a "cushion of safety." The <STRONG>Peace of Mind 
Sign</STRONG> can easily prevent an accident by simply alerting other vehicles to your situation.  It will help prevent tailgating, horn honking, altercations with other drivers. It relieves much of the stress for driver and parent.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Safe driving is a mix of three factors: a mechanically fit vehicle, and a driver who is physiologically and psychologically sound. For example, it is not only important that your brakes are in working order, but also that your eyes are not tired or your stress level too high due to traffic conditions. <P>
<P>
Many unsafe driving behaviors are obvious: for example, speeding, reckless lane changing, or drinking and driving. By avoiding these habits, we can make driving safer. Being mentally and physically prepared for driving is a good way to prevent accidents. <P>
<P>
Consider fatigue. When you're tired, or low on energy, you have a greater risk of falling asleep at the wheel. Physical work combined with missing lunch or neglecting to take breaks will contribute to drowsiness. Your reflexes will slow and you are more likely to misjudge traffic conditions. <P>
<P>
Your number-one priority while driving should be staying alert and attentive. It will help if you are well rested and your vehicle well ventilated. You may avoid eye fatigue by varying the focus of your concentration on the road rather than staring at a single point in front of you. Checking your mirrors periodically will also relieve fatigue.<P>
<P>
In bright sunlight or snow glare, wear good-quality sunglasses that reduce glare and ultraviolet rays. If you find yourself becoming drowsy due to the monotony of driving, try playing the radio, singing loud or taking a passenger. <P>
<P>
When you become too tired, stop the truck, get out and stretch your legs, eat, or get a coffee. If all else fails, it's time for a nap. A majority of truck accidents are caused by drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Better to get there late than not at all. There is no load so important that you should risk your life or the lives of others. <P>
<P>
You should plan stops during long trips and, if you have a co-driver, turn the wheel over to him/her before you get too tired. <P>
<P>
Plan your route on trips to unfamiliar areas. This will help you get to your destination as efficiently and safely as possible without having to worry about where you are going. Too much time spent searching for street signs or highway exits is a dangerous distraction.  <P>
<P>
Reducing stress behind the wheel is extremely important. The best strategy for fighting stress is to learn to live with inevitable traffic delays. It helps to know that other drivers are also frustrated and that traffic congestion is not a conspiracy against you alone. If traffic jams cause you considerable stress, you can try to avoid them by finding an alternative route or changing your departure time. <P>
<P>
Your driving goal should be to arrive safely. The key to success is trip preparation, adequate rest, avoiding distractions and taking interruptions in stride. <P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>The truck driver as a shift worker</H1>

<H3>By Curt Roush</H3>
<P>
<HR><P>
<blockquote>
Webster's dictionary defines the word &quot;diurnal&quot; as the act of functioning on a daily basis or of the daytime. It defines the word &quot;nocturnal&quot; as the act of happening during the night or functioning at night. <P>

Shift workers know all too well the drawbacks of being nocturnal in a traditionally diurnal world. The difficulty of maintaining proper sleep and eating habits are two of the most common. However, there are also other areas that must be considered if we are to get a better understanding of the problems truck drivers experience as shift workers.<P>

The natural biological clock in each human being dictates to us that we work, or be active, during daylight hours and sleep or rest at night. We live in a fast-paced society in which our work dictates survival. We are not all biologically on the same wavelength by choice, or by some directive that affects our normal lives and the lives of those with whom we are closely affiliated.<P>

Truck drivers are, and always have been, shift workers. As they roll down the nation's highways in control of 80,000 pounds of perpetual motion, the demands on their lives become of critical interest to everyone.<P>

The truck driver works alone, for the most part, and not under direct supervision. At times he must make split-second decisions which could affect his cargo, his life or the lives of others. His judgement at those times must be razor sharp or the end result could be disastrous.<P>

As mentioned earlier, there are problems that exist in shift workers' -- or, if you will, truck drivers' -- lives. The rate of divorce or separation is much higher than that of &quot;normal&quot; people. They tend to be either party animals or social recluses and are seldom moderate in their living habits. <P>

Medical conditions such as stroke, heart-related diseases, stomach and bowel problems are more prevalent than in normal people. Alcohol abuse and drug abuse are 2-5 times the normal rate. Sleep disorders are also much more prevalent, and these wear down the body's natural immune system, causing drivers to be more susceptible to colds or flu viruses and resulting in a higher rate of loss of work time. <P>

Many of these conditions could be avoided if the companies that employ drivers would consider a few general guidelines: <P>

<UL><LI>Express to your shippers that their first obligation is to the safety of the driver and the motoring public.<LI>

Make sure the driver has ample time to perform the task and has time allotted for required rest periods or mechanical breakdown when promising the customer delivery or other services.<LI>

Agree with them prior to contracting the move that all the agents are in place to assure a safe operation.<LI>

Never put the truck driver in jeopardy or in a compromising situation that would create an undesirable result for anyone.<LI>

Try not to put the driver in a repetitious mode. Nothing puts a person's brain to sleep faster than boring tasks, so try to keep the job assignment interesting. </UL><P>

Schedules that have no regard for the realities of human psychology can be very costly since they often result in expensive accidents. <P>

<H1>What happens when you <EM>do</EM><BR> 
have an accident<P></H1>

<STRONG>By Rick Grammick</STRONG><P>

Rick Grammick is a Loss Prevention Specialist with Markel Insurance. Markel Loss Prevention staff are active participants in the Hamilton-Niagara 
Regional Chapter of the TSA Council of Driver Trainers.<P>
<HR>
<P>
<blockquote>
Despite the best efforts of a fleet safety department or the cautious small-truck 
operator, accidents do happen. But safety pays, even after an accident, and 
furthermore, a good safety program will have a great influence on court 
proceedings and settlements.<P>

In court, the appearance of things is often more important than reality, so 
always remember that your files and records may end up in court during a 
serious case. Safety, personnel, maintenance, and policy documents and files 
can be requested and entered as evidence against you. <P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Presentation</H3>
<blockquote>
Studies reveal that verdicts of cases have sometimes been decided entirely on 
appearance. How do your drivers and Owner-Operators appear? <P>

A burly, bearded cowboy type of driver may lose the cases for you before any 
witnesses are even given a chance to speak. On the other hand, well- 
groomed, well-spoken, intelligent drivers are involved in accidents too, 
but they tend to give a much more favorable impression, both to the police 
and to a jury. <P>

This should be a definite consideration when hiring. Ask yourself at the time 
of initial contact, &quot;What's my overall first impression of this driver and do I 
want him to represent my firm&quot;?<P>

Appearance of equipment is also a big factor. Clean, well-maintained trucks 
reflect pride and professionalism. Dirty unkempt trucks tell everyone you 
don't care. With public opinion of the trucking industry as it is, that is a 
message you cannot afford to convey. Owner-Operators trucks that have 
offensive slogans painted on them or nicknames like &quot;Speed Demon&quot; will 
have a great deal of negative influence on a jury.<P>

CB radios in trucks are a necessity these days, but remind drivers that police, 
MTO, and the general public also monitor CB radio. I have listened to some 
conversations on CB radio between two truckers that I certainly would not 
want repeated in court. Driver CB handles are also a problem. Quite often 
they may sound catchy to a driver but offensive to the public.<P>

Radar detectors are illegal in Ontario and, if allowed in company or Owner 
Operator trucks, convey a strong impression to police and juries that 
your driver intends to violate the law. Even if the driver was not speeding 
the impression is that sooner or later the law would be broken.<P>

Incomplete or missing driver logs and maintenance files and records will 
only make your drivers, and more importantly, your operation, look bad. 
Lawyers will often try to prove speeding or operating over hours by 
examining log books for the days, or even weeks, prior to accidents. Examine 
the results of your log auditing carefully and correct problems as they occur. <P>

The absence of driver logs can also create problems. Canadian and U.S. 
regulations state that carriers must only maintain driver log books for a 
period of six months. When a serious accident occurs the log books for at least 
30 days prior to the accident should be included in the accident investigation 
file otherwise lawyers may argue that these log books were unfavorable to 
the carriers or else they would not have been destroyed. Remember you may 
well be in court several years after the accident took place. Missing 
maintenance records infer that they would have revealed shortcomings and 
therefore were destroyed.<P>

Lawyers, especially U.S. ones, are now becoming experts at trucking 
regulations and know full well both hours of service regulations and 
maintenance file requirements. When defects are reported to carriers by 
drivers the records should clearly reflect that the defects were corrected, 
where, and by whom. The process of inspection and repair must be clear. <P>

Driver personnel files should be in strict compliance with government 
requirements and should contain, at least, the employment application, 
references and written records of reference checks, written road test results, 
driver's license information, recall dates for licenses, medicals, training and a 
copy of the MVR or driver's abstract. <P>

Remember, if you do not want a jury to see a messy file after a serious 
accident has occurred clean it up before one takes place.<P>

On the subject of MVRs or drivers' abstracts, it always amazes me how many 
carriers regularly turn this information over to their insurance company and 
seemingly do not examine it. Carriers are genuinely embarrassed when 
insurance companies question records. Misinformation in a driver's file 
could have devastating results in court. <P>
</blockquote>
<H3>Be prepared<P></H3>
<blockquote>
Preparing for the eventuality of an accident before it happens makes good 
sense. Drivers should be instructed to report accidents immediately and these 
accidents should be reported to both the insurance company and the 
insurance broker immediately. Often an adjuster can be on the scene before 
vehicles are even moved. Drivers should know what information to 
preserve and how to conduct themselves at the scene. They should give basic 
information to the investigating officer and not give verbal or written 
statements to anyone else. Above all drivers must not admit liability at the 
scene, even if they feel they're at fault.<P>

Every accident, even those which initially do not seem serious, should be 
treated as potential problems and as much information as possible should be 
collected. Early evaluations concerning liability are notoriously faulty. <P>

Photographs should be taken of all aspects of the accident scene including 
undamaged portions of vehicles involved. All drivers should be equipped 
with a disposable camera and instructed on what to photograph.<P>

Take pictures of the insides of the crashed vehicles showing possible 
obstructions to a driver's vision. Try to show, in photographs, what drivers 
could and could not see at the point of impact. Photograph anything that could 
be valuable as evidence. <P>

Accident reconstructionists may be invaluable in court and today, due to 
advances in accident reconstruction simulation technology, they can produce 
video-like re-creations of crash events that clearly show what happened at the 
scene. <P>

If you do need to go to court, take the time to prepare your drivers, giving 
consideration to how they look as well as what they will say. Your lawyers 
will advise you in these matters. Remember due diligence means that, in 
most cases, your firm will be deemed guilty and you must prove your 
innocence. A good set of files and records and hard evidence that your safety 
program is not just smoke and mirrors but actually works, is your 
best defense.<P></blockquote>

Safety Ratings &#38; CVORs</title>

<H1>Safety Ratings &#38; CVORs<P></H1>

<STRONG>BY Richard Grammick</STRONG><P>

Rick Grammick is a Loss Prevention Specialist with Markel Insurance. Markel Loss Prevention staff are active participants in the Hamilton-Niagara Regional Chapter of the TSA Council of Driver Trainers.<P>
<HR>
<P><blockquote>
At a recent seminar presented by the Hamilton-Niagara Regional Chapter of 
the TSA Council of Driver Trainers, Chris Brant from the MTO Carrier Safety 
Rating Project, explained up-coming Carrier Safety Ratings in Ontario and 
how they will work. <P>

Auditors will come equipped with a CVOR report, recent roadside CVSA 
inspection reports, carrier accident history and data from other carriers of 
equal size to compare with.<P>

One half of the rating will focus on driver information files, recall systems, 
and log books. Carriers must maintain current driver licensing information, 
a recall system to track renewals, training records, accident records, and prove 
a system of monitoring drivers' log books.<P>

It is expected that a carrier match toll receipts, fuel stops and any other 
available &quot;time markers&quot; to verify the information provided by the driver in 
the log book. This audit system will reveal mistakes and incorrect log book 
entries.<P>

Markel's Loss Prevention department provides Road Observation Reports to 
insureds and these are acceptable as log book &quot;time markers&quot;. Each Road 
Observation Report contains a time, a date and a location, and this 
information can be compared with a driver's log book. The carrier must 
assure that all drivers are in compliance with the Hours-of-Work regulations 
and document corrective action for drivers who violate.<P>

The other half of the Carrier Safety Rating will come from vehicle 
inspections, vehicle files and maintenance records. Ratings will follow the 
U.S. category system of &quot;Satisfactory,&quot; &quot;Conditional&quot; and &quot;Unsatisfactory.&quot; A 
percentage system will rate 76% and above as Satisfactory, 50% to 75% as 
Conditional and below 50% as Unsatisfactory. Sanctions may be placed on the 
Unsatisfactory rating, for example by declaring the carrier ineligible to 
transport dangerous goods in Ontario.<P>

Following an unfavorable audit, the MTO will give the carrier written 
recommendations and arrange to conduct another audit in 6 months. 
Continued Unsatisfactory ratings could result in licensing sanctions or 
removal of operating privileges in Ontario.<P>

Favorable audit reports should be forwarded to Markel so that we can 
acknowledge the good job you are doing. Shippers are now being educated by 
intelligent safety conscious carriers to obtain CVOR and audit reports, and to 
understand the information provided. Safety is well worth the price.<P>

</blockquote>
<H3>Monitoring</H3>
<blockquote>
Margaret Mooney from the MTO Carrier Control office explained that her 
office monitors CVOR records for 90,000 carriers in Ontario operating 175,000 
heavy trucks. There are 2 types of CVOR records available for $5 from MTO. 
The public record does not include the allowable demerit point threshold 
level, the carrier's current violation rate, demerit points assigned to entries, 
or fines paid. The carrier may obtain a CVOR record with all information 
included. <P>

Information is kept on record for a period of 5 years and the automated 
monitoring system always looks at a 2-year sliding window. Demerit points 
are assigned for all violations, detentions, convictions, and accidents. Much 
discussion took place about how many demerit points an accident carries. 
Margaret Mooney explained that a truly non-preventable accident carries 1 
demerit point, but if there is any reason to believe that action on the part of 
the driver was unsafe then the accident carries 10 demerit points.<P>

Allowable threshold levels are determined by multiplying the provincial 
averages for carriers of equal size by 3. Demerit point violation rates are a 2 
year count. When the violation rate approaches the threshold level MTO 
action is taken. The carrier is expected to submit an action plan and make a 
25% improvement within 3 months. <P>

<h2><a href="/960828/mission.htm">Mission Statement</a></h2><p>
Converting energy resources cleanly and efficiently, cleaning up past environmental contamination, and preventing future 
environmental contamination will be some of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.
<p>
The EERC is recognized internationally as an expert in scientifically advanced energy systems and the prevention and 
cleanup of air, water, and soil pollution.
<p>
Established as a federal research and development facility in 1951, the EERC has been a part of the 
<a href="http://www.und.nodak.edu">University of North Dakota</a> (UND) since 1983. With a staff of more than 
<a href="/gif/staff.jpg">260 talented scientists, engineers, and support personnel</a>, the EERC is one of the 
leading developers of energy and environmental technologies in the world.
<p>
A thriving environment and sufficient energy are essential for a high quality of life. The future depends upon 
our ability to extract energy and other resources in a manner that does not jeopardize the integrity and stability 
of the environment.  To do that, we need to understand the complex network of connections between energy and 
environment.
<p>
"Knowledge has replaced raw material and labor as society's key resource. But even more important than knowledge 
is imagination," says EERC Director Gerald Groenewold. "The EERC is a model for interdisciplinary teamwork, 
partnership building, and the development of imaginative solutions to critical issues."<p>

<Font Size=+2><b>I</b></font>ntelligent use and management of water resources are required to ensure 
sufficient, quality water for public use and future development of industry 
and agriculture in the Basin of the Red River of the North.  Available water 
is limited in the Red River Basin.  There is a great need to care for the 
supplies available and identify the various management options available.  
Water quality is as important as quantity.  The quality of water resources 
in the Basin must be determined with respect to potential contaminants, thus 
establishing a baseline for future use.  Once a baseline is established, 
changes in water quality can be monitored, and solutions to problems encountered 
can be determined.  This program was developed to establish a consortium of 
industries, municipalities, and other regional entities in partnership with 
state and federal governments to address important issues that may impact 
the areas water resources.  A watershed management program such as this 
can be used to respond to environmental and water quantity concerns with 
technical solutions while allowing for community and economic development.

<h1>Wind turbines installed on two North Dakota reservations</h1><hr></center>
    With assistance from the EERC, two North Dakota American Indian tribes are producing electricity
from wind turbines to help power reservation facilities.<p>
    On Aug. 9, a 100 kilowatt wind turbine began generating electricity for the Spirit Lake Casino, which
is owned and operated by the Spirit Lake Nation and located south of Devils Lake, N.D.  An identical wind
turbine west of Belcourt, N.D., began generating electricity Sept. 10 for a water treatment plant that serves
the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation and neighboring communities.  Formal dedication ceremonies are
planned at each site during October.<p>

    The Spirit Lake wind turbine is expected to provide about one-quarter of the casino's electricity needs. 
The Turtle Mountain wind turbine should provide about 30 percent of the water treatment plant's electricity
needs.  The utility-scale wind turbines, previously owned and operated by the Foras Company, Palm Springs,
Calif., are 80 feet tall with blades 65 feet in diameter.  Each wind turbine can generate enough electricity to
serve at least 50 homes. Both turbines were erected between July 22 and Aug. 9 under the supervision of Joe
Kolbach, operations manager for Micon Wind Turbines Inc.<p>
    Jay Haley, an EERC senior research engineer and technical manager for the projects, says the wind
turbines will provide both tribes with experience in operating and maintaining the technology.  Tribal
windsmiths, who received training at a Foras wind farm in California earlier this year, will be responsible for
operating and maintaining the turbines and gathering research data.<p>
    Haley says that data collected from the turbines will be used to determine the economic feasibility of
building wind farms to produce electricity for the reservations.  With 36 percent of America's potential wind
energy, North Dakota is sometimes referred to as "the Saudi Arabia of wind energy."<p>
    The EERC is also involved in the assessment of wind energy resources on the Standing Rock
Reservation, located in south central North Dakota and north central South Dakota.  The Center is a
subcontractor to Xenergy, Burlington, Mass., which is conducting an integrated evaluation of the
reservation's energy resources aimed at improving energy efficiency and evaluating potential new energy
sources.<p>
    All three projects are being funded by the <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
</a> under the 1992 EnergyPolicy Act.  They are part of a DOE program coordinated by the 
<a href="http://www.nrel.gov">National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL)</a>, Golden, Colo., to develop Native American energy resources.  <p>

<hr>
</center>
Partnerships are key to solving complex energy and environmental problems and developing innovative energy and environmental technologies.  To bring an idea through the rigorous stages of research, development, demonstration, and commercialization, a cohesive team of people possessing distinctive skills and disciplines is needed.
<p>
The EERC is committed to a philosophy of RDD&C. In partnership with private industry, government agencies, research organizations, and academic institutions, the EERC conducts research and development of practical, problem-solving technologies and processes--RD.  It demonstrates those technologies and processes in the field--the second D.  Finally, working with its industrial partners, it seeks to commercialize successful technologies and processes--C.
<p>
Developing energy and environmental technologies is neither quick nor inexpensive.  It can take several years to develop and then successfully demonstrate a technology.  The cost can reach well into the millions of dollars.  By the time an idea is commercialized, a project team often includes government and private research organizations, scientists, research managers, laboratory technicians, engineers, engineering technicians, venture capitalists, investors, market analysts, entrepreneurs, marketers, business managers, accountants, patent and copyright counsel, legal counsel, elected officials, and regulatory agencies.
<p>
Commercializing energy and environmental technologies holds the potential for significant returns, however.  The EERC is willing to make the long-term investment and take the risks to seize these opportunities.

The EERC extends an invitation for partnership ventures to anyone seeking research, development, demonstration, and commercialization opportunities focused on energy and environmental technologies.

<h2>Partnership Opportunities</h2><hr></center>
 
The EERC has enjoyed extraordinary growth during the past decade. Its list of clients includes hundreds of domestic and international companies as well as scores of national and international academic institutions and government agencies.  Today, the number of contracts at the EERC is approaching 200 per year.  Annual contract revenue exceeds $22 million. The EERC maintains a highly flexible business approach, tailoring contractual agreements to individual client needs.   More than 70 percent of its contracts are with private industrial partners.
<p>
<h2>EERC-DOE Jointly Sponsored Research Program</h2>
<ul plain>
The EERC is an agent for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Jointly Sponsored Research Program (JSRP).   Through this program, commercial entities can team with the EERC and DOE to demonstrate and commercialize innovative energy and environmental technologies. The JSRP provides up to 40 percent cofunding for nonfederally matched projects that address a broad range of national energy and environmental priorities.
</ul><p>
<h2>EERC Consortium-Sponsored Research</h2>
<ul plain>
The EERC's consortium-sponsored research is a proven approach to addressing similar needs of multiple clients. Through this program, research and financial risks are spread over a larger base, enabling members to obtain a greater product than would have been possible with the same amount of funding invested individually.
</ul><p>
<h2>EERC-DOE Environmental Management Program</h2>
<ul plain>
The EERC has a partnership with DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center to assist in the development and implementation of innovative technologies to clean up environmental contamination at U.S. nuclear weapons facilities.  The EERC-DOE Cooperative Agreement focuses special attention on involving U.S. small businesses and their cleanup technologies.  The EERC's role is to work with small businesses on final development and demonstration of these technologies.
</ul><p>
<h2>EERC-EPA Center for Air Toxic Metals</h2>
<ul plain>
The EERC's Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) is a partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, industry, and research organizations that is involved in the prevention and control of air toxic metal emissions.  CATM has an Affiliates Program that allows organizations to participate as partners in its assorted technical program areas.  Affiliate members provide direction to ensure CATM program areas are focused on issues relevant to industry and government. The cost of becoming a member of the Affiliates Program is $20,000 per year.
 </ul><p>
<h2>EERC Memoranda of Understanding</h2>
<ul plain>
The EERC has executed several short-term, renewable memoranda of understanding with private sector companies.  These memoranda are "agreements" to pursue specific technology applications or other opportunities and serve as the basis for subsequent formal contractual relationships.
</ul><p>
<h2>EERC Foundation</h2>
<ul plain>
The EERC has established the EERC Foundation to house intellectual property developed at the EERC and to foster the development, demonstration, and commercialization of energy and environmental technologies.
</ul><p>
<h2>EERC Confidentiality</h2>
<ul plain>
Confidentiality is often a concern for industrial clients seeking to maintain a competitive edge.  North Dakota law provides for practical confidentiality agreements between the EERC and its partners.

<h2>Environmental Management Technology
Demonstration and Commercialization</h2><hr></center>

The U.S. Department of Energy is facing the monumental task of cleaning up environmental contamination at nuclear weapons facilities and other sites across the nation.  The EERC has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the DOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize environmental management technologies to clean up these sites.  The EERC's Environmental Management (EM) Program is working to accomplish this in two ways:  1) by providing the private sector, especially small businesses, with the expertise and technical resources needed to take their technologies to the marketplace and 2) through research, development, and demonstration of its own technologies, leading to commercialization partnerships with the private sector.
<p>
<h2>Key Environmental Management Activities</h2>
<ul plain>
<li>Extraction and Analysis of Pollutant Organics from Contaminated Solids Using Off-Line Supercritical Fluid Extraction and On-Line SFE/IR - The EERC is evaluating and demonstrating simple-to-operate field instrumentation and extraction methods capable of providing rapid analysis of organic contaminants.
<p>
<li>Thermal Decomposition of High-Organic-Content Radioactive Wastes - In partnership with the American Plastics Council, DOE, and other U.S. companies, the EERC has developed a low-temperature process for thermal decomposition of mixed-waste plastics, automotive shredder wastes, and chemical spill residuals.  The process will form the basis of a commercially viable recycling process able to accommodate a variety of plastics and high-organic-content materials from laboratory and production facilities that handle low-level nuclear materials.
<p>
<li>Fluid-Bed Calcination for Liquid Wastes - The EERC is evaluating denitrification strategies that can be applied to bed-sintering problems experienced in the fluid-bed processing of liquid wastes at EM sites.
<p>
<li>Centrifugal Membrane Filtration - Large volumes of water contaminated with heavy metals and radionuclides exist at DOE and Department of Defense sites. SpinTek Membrane Systems Inc. of Huntington Beach, California, has developed a uniquely configured centrifugal membrane filtration process to produce a clean, filtered water stream and a low-volume concentrate stream.  The EERC is evaluating the process and conducting several other tasks to optimize the application of the technology to EM cleanup needs.
<p>
<li>Laser Cleaning of Contaminated Painted Surfaces - Radionuclide-contaminated paint is an obstacle to the economical decommissioning of structures and equipment at EM sites.  F2 Associates of Albuquerque, New Mexico, has developed an innovative laser cleaning unit that removes contaminated paint from surfaces without releasing hazardous contaminants into the atmosphere.  The EERC is providing technical support in the development of the technology.
<p>
<li>Systems Analysis of Environmental Technologies - Many technologies are being developed to clean up EM sites. The EERC, in cooperation with the Waste Policy Institute and DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center, is evaluating the technical viability and economic competitiveness of these technologies.  Results from the evaluations will be used to enhance current research programs and to advance the timing of site cleanup.</ul>

<h2>Center for Air Toxic Metals</h2><hr></center>

Air toxic metals pose a significant challenge to the preservation of the global environment.  To meet this challenge, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1993 designated the EERC as the Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM).  CATM is focused on minimizing the effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the environment.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing 189 substances, including air toxic metals.  In order to devise regulations, CATM is working with industry and government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a theoretical basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate and impacts of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  Developing, demonstrating, and commercializing technologies and processes that reduce the release of air toxic metals is a major part of CATM's mission.  The EERC's internationally recognized research on fuels characterization, combustion, ash behavior, ash utilization, ash disposal, and groundwater and its experience in developing partnerships and training programs uniquely qualify CATM to be the world leader in air toxics research.  CATM invites international participation in the program.
<p>
<h2>Key CATM Activities</h2><ul plain>
<li>Identifying sources of toxic metals in the oil, gas, utility, and waste-to-energy industries.<p>
<li>Examining all options to prevent the release of air toxic metals.<p>
<li>Determining the partitioning of metals in process streams and their amount, form, and ultimate fate.<p>
<li>Developing, demonstrating, and commercializing technologies and processes that mitigate the release or toxicity of potentially toxic metals.<p>
<li>Developing techniques to effectively sample and measure air toxic metals in feedstocks and process streams.<p>
<li>Developing computer-based technologies to compile the vast quantities of data and predict the fate of air toxic metals.<p>
<li>Developing educational programs to foster environmental literacy in students.<p>

<h2>American Indian Initiative</h2><hr></center>


The University of North Dakota has a long-standing commitment to American Indians.  The EERC is continuing this tradition through a program focused on responding to energy and environmental needs on Indian lands.  The EERC is developing partnerships with a growing network of American Indian organizations, including tribal governments, tribal colleges, American Indian-owned businesses, and the Council of Energy Resource Tribes (CERT).  The EERC also is working to increase American Indian university enrollments in energy and environmental disciplines to broaden American Indian employment opportunities.
<p>

<h3>Key American Indian Initiative Activities</h3>
<ul plain>
<li>A considerable percentage of the Alaska Native population is located in remote villages. Because of the long distance that fuel must be shipped and other factors, the cost of energy in these communities is among the highest in the United States.  The EERC and DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center are working in partnership with Alaska Native and state officials to introduce small, economical, environmentally friendly, easy-to-operate-and-maintain technologies that use indigenous fuels and waste materials to produce electricity and heat.  The lessons being learned in Alaska are transferable to Native Hawaiian and American Indian communities throughout the United States and to the world.<p>

<li>The Devils Lake Sioux Tribe in Fort Totten, North Dakota, has contracted with the EERC to evaluate the environmental impact of the tribal municipal landfill, wastewater treatment lagoons, and nitrate contamination on groundwater near tribal water supply wells.<p>

<li>The Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe (TMCT), in partnership with the EERC, has been awarded $248,000 from DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory to demonstrate the production of electricity from wind on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota.  The TMCT-EERC team will conduct an environmental impact assessment, identify the optimal wind energy sites, and install and operate a wind turbine to produce power for tribal industries.<p>

<li>Universal Technologies Corporation (UTC), a 100% American Indian-owned and 
-controlled environmental consulting firm in Powell, Wyoming, and the EERC have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) under which both parties offer a broad range of services, including resource characterization, energy conversion, site assessment, groundwater geology, waste utilization, and contaminant remediation.<p>

<li>Council of Energy Resource Tribes, an organization of 53 federally recognized Indian tribes and four Canadian Indian nations, and the EERC have developed an MOU under which CERT, members of CERT, and the EERC will work together on specific research, development, demonstration, and commercialization projects focused on resource assessment, energy conversion technology, reclamation of disturbed lands, waste utilization, site cleanup, contaminant remediation technology, and training.</ul>

<h2>Water Management</h2><hr></center>

Water is the world's most precious resource.  In order to ensure sufficient quantities of quality water for public use and future development of industry and agriculture, intelligent use and management of water resources are required.  The EERC has a long history of water management research.  Today, it is a recognized expert on a host of water conservation and contamination issues and has an expanding number of water management initiatives.
<p>
<h2>Key Water Management Activities</h2>
<ul plain>
<li>Red River Basin Water Management Consortium - The EERC and AGVISE Laboratories Inc., a Northwood, North Dakota, private laboratory specializing in environmental and agricultural testing and research, have teamed to develop a water management program for the Red River of the North Basin.  The program will establish a consortium of industry, municipalities, and other entities in partnership with state and federal governments to develop a long-term watershed management strategy for the basin.  The program is expected to become a model for watershed management in other areas of the United States and the world.
<p>
<li>Freeze-Thaw/Evaporation - The EERC has developed a process in partnership with B.C. Technologies in Laramie, Wyoming, to remove salts, organic material, and other contaminants from brackish water.  The freeze-thaw/evaporation process relies on ice crystallization in below-freezing temperatures and evaporation in warm weather to purify contaminated water.  Brackish water is produced during oil and gas industry operations.  Current disposal methods are costly.  The process also has the potential to turn naturally salty groundwater and surface water into high-quality, potable water.
<p>
<li>Red River Basin Riparian Demonstration Project - The establishment of riparian zones-areas of trees, shrubs, and vegetation that line the banks of streams and rivers-is one of the best methods for preventing surface water and groundwater pollution.  The EERC is spearheading a project aimed at restoring riparian areas and improving surface water and groundwater in eastern North Dakota.
<p>
<li>Impacts of Agricultural Chemicals on Groundwater Quality - The EERC is conducting a research program to determine the potential for groundwater contamination from agricultural chemicals.  Through long-term, comprehensive studies of multiple field sites in the northern Great Plains, the program will provide a scientific basis for effectively managing agricultural chemicals and a model to resolve specific problems.

<h1>Coal</h1><hr></center>

Coal will continue to play a major role in meeting world energy demands well into the 21st century. The EERC has more than four decades of basic and applied coal research, with particular emphasis on low-rank coals.   Today, the EERC is the world's leading low-rank coal research center.   EERC coal research pursues a scientific understanding of the physical, chemical, and mineralogical nature of coal as the foundation for predictively engineering coal conversion technologies and power systems.   From fundamental resource characterization to waste utilization or disposal, EERC coal research allows coal to be used more cleanly and efficiently in existing facilities as well as in emerging technologies.

<h2>Advanced Materials Science</h2><hr></center>

The structures inside advanced coal-fired energy systems will be exposed to much higher temperatures and much more corrosive environments than in today's steam cycle systems.  These conditions require the use of advanced structural materials such as high-temperature alloys, intermetallics, and ceramics in the construction of these systems.  The EERC is working to develop innovative methods and technologies that promote the use of advanced structural materials. Current efforts include corrosion-resistant joining of silicon-based ceramics and laboratory-, bench-, and pilot-scale testing of coal gas and slag corrosion of alloys, ceramics, and brick refractories.  The EERC will seek to transfer developed technologies to the materials industry via licensing agreements through the EERC Foundation.

<h2>Reclamation of Disturbed Lands</h2><hr></center>

Reclamation of lands disturbed by mining, energy extraction, wetlands alteration, waste disposal, agriculture, military operations, and other activities is the final step in the use of the earth's resources. Understanding the geology and water resources of a site is key to successful reclamation.  The EERC has more than two decades of applied research focused on understanding different landscapes prior to disturbance, enabling it to tailor reclamation that is cost-effective and compatible with the surrounding environment.

<h2>Atmospheric Emission Control</h2><hr></center>

Atmospheric emission control of pollutants at power plants and other facilities is critical to maintaining a healthy level of air quality in the world.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated the EERC the Center for Air Toxic Metals.  EERC atmospheric emission control research has led to retrofit acid gas and particulate removal technologies for existing energy facilities. It also is providing understanding critical to the design of the next generation of equipment needed to control particulate as well as gaseous organic and inorganic emissions from utilities, incinerators, refineries, and other industrial sources.  By-products produced by power plant emission control systems are a resource that can be used for a variety of purposes.  The EERC has extensive experience in the utilization of these by-products.

<h2>Waste Utilization and Disposal</h2><hr></center>

Cost-effective, environmentally sound utilization of wastes continues to be a volatile issue. The EERC's approach begins with understanding the physical, chemical, mineralogical, leaching, and biological character of different wastes. This understanding enables the EERC to predict what is in a material, how much is there, how it may leach into surrounding soil and groundwater, and how it ultimately will behave in the environment--information critical to its successful use or disposal.  The knowledge gained in waste research is valuable in the cleanup of contaminated sites. Waste utilization is the preferred option. Disposal is the option of last resort.   Solutions must integrate science, technology, individual responsibility, and policy.

<h2>Experimental Design and Analytical Methods Development</h2><hr></center>

Experimental design and analytical methods development are necessary to identify, quantify, and understand increasingly complex materials and processes in ever greater detail. Standard methods of analysis for measuring the results of experiments are often inadequate for research needs, making it necessary to develop appropriate protocols, which, in turn, typically become tomorrow's standard methods. The EERC is committed to practical experimental design and the development of new analytical methods to identify and quantify natural and synthetic materials. Helping clients understand critical questions regarding their problems so that cost-effective answers can be obtained in a timely manner is the primary goal.

<h2>Research Facilities and Equipment</h2><hr></center>

To conduct meaningful and productive research, it is necessary to provide dedicated scientists and engineers with state-of-the-art research tools.   The EERC strives to provide the best possible combination of equipment, laboratory space, talent, and leadership. With the completion of a $7.6 million expansion in 1994, EERC laboratory, technology demonstration, and office space increased to 169,000 square feet dedicated to energy and environmental research, development, demonstration, and commercialization. The EERC maintains a wide range of laboratories and equipment for solid, liquid, and gaseous characterization of the physical, chemical, mineralogical, biological, hydrological, and geological properties of natural and synthetic materials and processes.  These highly sophisticated and diverse tools can be used in a variety of research programs.  This provides for effective utilization of instrumentation and facilities and fosters a cross-fertilization of ideas and solutions for analogous situations between research programs.

<H2>Director's
Message<BR>Dr. Gerald
H. Groenewold</h2>

</TD> </TR> </TABLE> </BR>
One of my most enjoyable activities is sharing the culture, personality, and accomplishments of
the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC) with the numerous individuals who
visit
our Center each year.  The vast majority of our first-time visitors seem quite surprised at the
practically oriented, problem-solving, business approach to research, development,
demonstration,
and technology commercialization that has become the cornerstone of our organization.  <p>

<p>

Since 1983, the EERC has evolved from an almost strictly coal-oriented, federal R&amp;D
facility to
a
broadly focused, global energy and environmental technology center.  During FY95 alone, the
EERC developed 139 contracts with U.S. industrial clients in 34 states.  During the same period
of time, we received contracts for projects in eight foreign countries as well as a variety of
federal
contracts.  <p>

<p>

Partnership building is a key element of EERC program development efforts.  The EERC has a
multiyear Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Energy which provides select     
funding
for applied basic research and for joint venture projects with nonfederal partners.  During fiscal
year 1995, the Jointly Sponsored Research Program funding available from the Department of
Energy was used to cofund 19 partnership projects.  Eleven new Jointly Sponsored Research
Program projects were initiated during the year, while eight existing projects received additional
funding.  The nonfederal funding brought to this program by the Energy &amp; Environmental
Research Center represents 61% of the total dollars for the program.  With the current focus to
reduce or eliminate the federal deficit, Congress must seek to identify and fund technically
superior, cost-effective programs.  The EERC's Cooperative Agreements for fundamental
research and jointly sponsored research combine to form just such a program.  Nonfederal
entities
are voting for this program with their hard-earned research, development, demonstration, and
commercialization dollars, as evidenced by the 61% funding share they provided during the past
year.  <p>

<p>

   Technology commercialization and global technology export opportunities are currently
generating a great deal of discussion in our country.  Fundamental to maximizing the success of
these efforts is the development of industry, government, and research organization partnerships. 
The EERC is a successful practicing model for partnership building.  In addition, during the past
few years, the EERC has spun off eight technology companies; others are anticipated in the near
future.  <p>

<p>

   As you read through this report, you will gain a sense of the problem-solving,
business-oriented, partnership-building culture of the EERC.  All organizations reflect the
people
who work there.  We are blessed with an extremely talented technical and support staff. 
Moreover, at least as important as their technical talents are the dedication, decency, and high
level of integrity of our staff.  <p>

<p>

<p>   We look forward to another successful and gratifying year in 1996.  Please call us if we
may be able to provide assistance to you or your organization.</p>

</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>EERC Highlights: July-December 1993</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Eastern European Initiative Results in Two Projects for
the EERC</h3>

     As part of its ongoing Eastern European initiative, the EERC was involved in two
projects
totaling $500,000 to study opportunities for coal technology commercialization in the
Czech Republic and clean coal technology uses in Bulgaria.<p>


<hr>
<h3>Ethanol Study Focuses on Effects of Denaturant and
Water </h3>

     The EERC conducted a research project for the National Corn Growers Association to
determine whether controlling the amount of denaturant and water in ethanol could make
it a more environmentally friendly fuel additive.  The research was important in light of the
Environmental Protection Agency's fall 1994 deadline to issue final rules regulating
reformulated gasoline.  <p>

<hr>
<h3>EERC Director Appointed to North Dakota 2000
Committee </h3>

     EERC Director Gerald Groenewold was one of nine North Dakotans appointed to the
29-member North Dakota 2000 Committee.  The committee was begun in 1988 by the
Greater North Dakota Association to develop a vision for the future of the state.  It held a
series of town meetings in 40 communities to create a consensus on North Dakota's
direction into the next century.  Groenewold chaired the Greater North Dakota Association
Futures Committee prior to being appointed to the North Dakota 2000 Committee.<p>
<hr>
<h3> Works on Canadian Oil and Gas Industry Project
</h3>

     The EERC worked with the Canadian oil and gas industry on a $500,000 field
demonstration project to identify the most effective and economical ways to clean up
subsurface contamination at plants processing high-sulfur natural gas (sour gas).  The
EERC joined the Alberta Sour Gas Plant Subsurface Remedial Technologies Project,
initiated several years ago under the joint sponsorship of the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers and Environment Canada.  Sour gas-producing plants are found
worldwide, and the large number of them in Alberta cause varying levels of subsurface
contamination.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Scientist Participates in National Science Foundation
Madagascar Project</h3>

     EERC paleontologist Joseph Hartman spent six weeks during the summer of 1993 in
Madagascar, an island nation off the east coast of Africa, conducting paleontologic and
geologic research as part of the National Science Foundation's Grants for Exploratory
Research Program.  He was part of a group of paleontologists looking for vertebrates
(mammals and dinosaurs) and invertebrates from the Late Cretaceous period.  Hartman
specializes in nonmarine mollusks, such as clams and snails, that lived in freshwater or
terrestrial environments.<p>
<hr>
<h3> Fluid-Bed Combustion Project Good Example of
Research, Industry, and Government Partnership </h3>
     State and federal governments and utilities worked with the EERC on a 3-year, $1.2
million jointly sponsored research project to study ash-related problems in fluid-bed combustion
boilers.  Fluid-bed combustors can burn a wide variety of fuels, including coal, almond shells,
wood chips,
orchard prunings, and waste sludge and can be retrofitted to older power plants, helping to
improve
efficiency and reduce air pollution. <p>

<hr>
<h3>  EERC Researcher Honored with International Award
</h3>

     EERC researcher Steven Hawthorne, known worldwide for his work in the field of
supercritical fluid extraction, was honored with the Award of Excellence at the 5th
International Symposium on Supercritical Fluid Chromatography and Extraction in
Baltimore.<p>

<hr>
<h3>  Research Could Help Farmers Avoid Agricultural
Chemical Contamination of Groundwater </h3>

     The EERC began the fourth year of a 7-year, $3.5 million groundwater research project
funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop an understanding of the
occurrence, transport, and fate of agricultural chemicals.  This research will  help conserve
and protect irrigation and drinking water resources, increase agricultural efficiency, improve
chemical management practices, and provide a scientific basis for the regulation of
agricultural chemicals.<p>

<hr>
<h3>  Center Receives Funding for Aircraft Deicing Research
</h3>

     The North Dakota Department of Economic Development and Finance's Technology
Transfer, Inc., financed a 6-month, $100,000 research project at the EERC to develop and
demonstrate an environmentally friendly technology to deice aircraft at airports.  The
approach will result in more effective aircraft deicing, leading to greater air traffic safety.<p>

<hr>
<h3> EERC Promotes Environmental Awareness Through
Center for Air Toxic Metals </h3>

     In conjunction with being named the Center for Air Toxic Metals by the Environmental
Protection Agency,  the EERC formed an Environmental Education Committee to promote
environmental awareness within the Center and the University of North Dakota, as well as
throughout surrounding communities.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Patents Economical Coal Liquefaction Process
</h3>

     The elusive goal of economically converting coal into synthetic petroleum products is
one
step closer because of a coal liquefaction process patented by the EERC.  Preliminary
economic evaluations show that the EERC's coal liquefaction process, which is designed to
use lignitic and subbituminous coals (low-rank coals), can produce synthetic petroleum
30% to 40% below the cost of existing coal liquefaction technologies using bituminous coal. 

<hr>
<h3>  Research Shows Promise of New Technology to Recycle
Plastics </h3>

     Research showing that most plastics can be converted into useful liquids to serve as
manufacturing feedstocks provides new options for recycling postconsumer plastics,
diverting waste from landfills, and helping to conserve natural resources.  A research project
on advanced technology to recycle plastics was conducted by the EERC for the American
Plastics Council, a consortium of 25 major U.S. plastics manufacturers.<p>


<hr>
<h3>  EERC Matches State Lignite Research Program Dollars
5 to 1 </h3>

     State dollars awarded to the EERC through the North Dakota Lignite Research,
Development and Marketing Program were matched at a ratio of better than 5 to 1. 
According to the Lignite Energy Council, the EERC received $387,000 in contract funding
through the state program, which was leveraged into projects totaling nearly $2 million. <p>

<hr>
<h3>  Research Probes Airborne Contamination of
Groundwater by Pesticides </h3>

     Scientists at the EERC turned up some interesting findings in their efforts to determine
how pesticides and fertilizers used in agriculture reach groundwater.  Analyses of wind-blown
soil particles from the Grand Forks region show that these particles contain a
number of commonly used pesticides.  Airborne particles are eventually deposited over the
landscape, falling in surface water and on the ground.  In certain situations, chemicals may
leach downward and enter shallow groundwater aquifers.<p>

<h2>EERC Highlights: January-December 1994</h2>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Expansion Project Finished, Move into New
Facilities Completed</h3> 

     Completion of two new facilities gave the EERC an opportunity to further expand in
order to meet the
worldwide demand for its services and expertise.  The EERC completed its new Environmental
Research Laboratory Addition in January 1994, and nearly all staff and equipment were moved
into it
before the end of February.  Funding for the $7.6 million project was provided from the
following
sources:  $3.5 million from a U.S. Department of Energy grant, $2.5 million from a state bond
issue
guaranteed by the University of North Dakota Alumni Association Foundation (to be paid back
by the
EERC over a 10-year period), and a $1 million grant from the Grand Forks Growth Fund.  The
EERC
provided $600,000 in funding from its revenues.  The expansion project was completed in two
phases. 
The first phase was the four-level, 50,000-ft<SUP>2</SUP> Environmental
Research Laboratory
Addition.  The
second phase was a three-level, 7400-ft<SUP>2</SUP> Pilot Plant Addition.  <p>

<hr>
<h3>Enertech, EERC, and DOE Team Up on Municipal Solid
Waste Project</h3>

     The EERC, EnerTech Environmental, Inc., of Atlanta, and the U.S. Department of
Energy are
working together on a joint venture project investigating the use of municipal solid waste and
lignite
coal slurries to cofire power plants.<p>

<hr>
<h3>  Clay Soils Provide Natural Channels for Groundwater
Contamination</h3> 

     As natural filters, clay soils can help prevent agricultural chemicals from reaching
shallow
groundwater, but they probably are not providing nearly as much protection as once thought. 
Researchers at the EERC are finding that clay soils form relatively imperfect barriers between
agricultural chemicals and groundwater aquifers.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Center for Air Toxic Metals Officially Kicks Off
Program</b><p> </font> 

     An EERC research program aimed at controlling emissions of air toxic metals from
power plants and
waste incinerators officially began in May 1994.  In conjunction with this program, the EERC
started
a project with North Dakota's State Industrial Commission and the lignite industry to reduce air
toxic
emissions from lignite-fired power plants. <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Patented EERC Process Makes High-Value Char from
Low-Value Leonardite</b><p> </font> 

     A process patented by the EERC converts leonardite, a low-value, naturally occurring
material, into a
high-value char that sells for $400 to $1000 a ton. The Center's technology uses leonardite and a
mild
gasification process to produce a char that can replace expensive activated carbon used for air
and
water filtration.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  American Foundrymen's Society Supports EERC Form
Coke Project</b><p> </font> 

     The EERC is using the mild gasification process it developed to produce a form coke
briquette from
subbituminous coal for use as a furnace fuel and carbon source in hot metal production.  The
Center is
working with the American Foundrymen's Society of Chicago on a 4-year, $420,751 project
aimed at
producing a coke product that costs less and is equal to or better than conventional foundry coke
made
from high-quality bituminous coal.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Coal-Cleaning Process Offers Potential for Low-Rank
Lignite</b><p> </font> 

     Preliminary results of EERC research show that low-rank lignite coal can be cleaned to
produce a fuel
that complies with national clean air standards.  The research was conducted under North
Dakota's
Lignite Research, Development and Marketing Program using coal from Knife River Coal
Mining
Company's Beulah (North Dakota) mine. <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Waste-to-Energy Options Discussed with Grand Forks
Officials</b><p> </font> 

     EERC Director Gerald Groenewold and Associate Director Michael Jones met with
Grand Forks city
and county officials in June 1994 to discuss an innovative waste-to-energy technology that may
offer a
potential solution to the city's future landfill concerns.  The officials heard about a process the
EERC
is developing with EnerTech Environmental, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, and the U.S. Department of
Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Indonesian Delegation Discusses Partnership
Opportunities with the EERC</b><p> </font> 

     A delegation of six high-level Indonesian government officials visited the EERC in
September 1994 to
discuss the possibility of establishing a cooperative research and development training program
in
clean coal technologies. <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Receives Environmental and Beautification
Awards</h3> 

     The EERC received an environmental award from the University of North Dakota and a
beautification
award from the Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce.  The University of North Dakota presented
the
EERC with the John Meagher Ecology Award in recognition of the EERC's recycling efforts and
its
environmental research program.  The Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce presented the EERC
with
its 1994 Beautification Award in recognition of the Center's efforts to improve and maintain the
beauty of its property.<p>

<p>

<h3>  EERC Studies Effects of Fly Ash Used to Stabilize
Underground Mines</b><p> </font> 

     The EERC worked with the North Dakota Public Service Commission, which regulates
mining and
reclamation in the state, and the North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated
Laboratories, the state agency that enforces environmental regulations, to provide objective
scientific
information to answer questions about using fly ash for mine stabilization.  <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Electric Power Research Institute Brings International
Hot-Gas Filter Project to the EERC</b><p> </font> 

     An international consortium formed by the Electric Power Research Institute is working
with the
EERC to study ash problems associated with the cleaning of hot gases in advanced energy
systems. 
The 3-year, $1.8 million project is funded by the Electric Power Research Institute, the U.S.
Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center, and nine energy-related
businesses in
Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Energy Secretary O'Leary Dedicates Two New EERC
Additions</b><p> </font> 

     U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary spoke during a ceremony August 26, 1994, to
dedicate the new
Environmental Research Laboratory and Pilot Plant Additions at the EERC.  O'Leary, a former
vice
president with Northern States Power Company in Minneapolis, was appointed to her post by
President Bill Clinton in 1993.  Also attending and speaking at the event were Senator Jocelyn
Burdick, Senator Kent Conrad, Senator Byron Dorgan, Congressman Earl Pomeroy, Grand Forks
Mayor Michael Polovitz, and Earl Strinden, executive director of the University of North Dakota
Alumni Association and Foundation.  University of North Dakota President Kendall Baker
presided. 
Construction on the $7.6 million expansion project began in 1992 and was completed in early
1994. 
The EERC's growing environmental research and development programs required a significant
expansion of laboratory facilities.  The new additions enabled the Center to consolidate labs that
were
located across the University of North Dakota campus and provide office space for the
researchers and
technicians who work in the labs.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Two UND Environmental Education Proposals Approved
for Funding</b><p> </font> 

     Two environmental education courses funded with grants from the EERC's Center for
Air Toxic
Metals were offered at the University of North Dakota fall 1994.  The courses were selected
from
among seven proposals submitted to the EERC by University of North Dakota faculty.  <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Process Sponsored Through Gas Research Institute,

Relationships for the EERC</b><p> </font> 

     The EERC's initiative in East Central Europe took a big step forward in November 1994
with the
successful completion of the Center's second energy and environmental conference in Prague,
Czech
Republic. The conference and its associated workshops attracted more than 300 industry
representatives, government officials, and researchers from 20 countries.  Entitled "The Second
International Conference on Energy and Environment:  Transitions in East Central Europe," the
conference was organized by the EERC and the Power Research Institute of Prague.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Coal-Water Fuel Technology Attracts Russian and
German Interest</b><p> </font> 

     Technology pioneered by the EERC to produce coal-water fuel from low-rank coals
attracted the
attention of a German company and a Russian research institute during the energy and
environmental
conference in Prague. The EERC's coal-water fuel process produces a liquid fuel from low-rank
coal
that upgrades the coal's energy value and environmental performance and can be used as a
replacement for heavy oil in industrial and utility boilers.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Workshops Focus on Low-Cost Power Generation, Clean
Fuels for East Central Europe</b><p> </font> 

     Two 2-day workshops preceding the November Prague conference examined the best
technologies for
generating power using the low-rank brown coal found in East Central Europe and how to deal
with
air pollution caused by domestic use of low-rank brown coal.  The workshops were sponsored by
the
U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center and organized by the
EERC.  <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Czech Coal Industry Seeks EERC Assistance to Remain
Competitive</b><p> </font> 

     Facing stiff competition from imported Russian natural gas, Czech coal industry officials
met in
Prague with representatives of the EERC to discuss how their industry can become more
competitive
in the energy marketplace.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Assisting with Cleanup of U.S. Department of
Energy Nuclear Weapons Sites and Facilities</b><p> </font> 

     The EERC is assisting the U.S. Department of Energy with the cleanup of its nuclear
weapons
complex and other contaminated sites throughout the country.  The Center began work on a
5-year,
$2.5 million cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy
Technology Center.  The Center is supporting the U.S. Department of Energy Environmental
Restoration and Waste Management Program, which is aimed at cleaning up soil and water
contamination at the agency's sites.  <p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Meets with Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.
Department of Energy, and Industry on Air Toxic Metals</h3> </font> 

     Measuring and controlling emissions of mercury, selenium, lead, and other air toxic
metals from
energy generation systems was the focus of a December 1994 meeting between government
officials,
industry representatives, and researchers.  Held at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
combustion and environmental laboratory research facilities in Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, the meeting provided a forum for the exchange of information on the measurement and
control of air toxic metals.  Participants were also updated on the activities of the Center for Air
Toxic Metals, a nationally coordinated research program funded by the Environmental
Protection
Agency and industry and operated by the EERC at Grand Forks, North Dakota.<p>

</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>EERC Highlights: January-June 1995</h2> 
<hr>
<h3> EERC Environmental Education Program Fosters
<font color="#00ff00">"Greening of UND"</h3> </font> 

     The EERC actively promoted the "greening of UND" to encourage environmental awareness
and
pollution prevention within the Center and on the University of North Dakota campus.  The
EERC's
greening program also aims at reducing waste and increasing energy efficiency both locally and
globally, with efforts ranging from the Center's own recycling program to its research on
developing
new recycling technology for the plastics industry.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Helps Venezuelan Refinery Recover Valuable
Element</h3> 

     The EERC assisted a Venezuelan oil refinery in recovering vanadium, a valuable element
found in
unusually high concentrations in the crude petroleum of northern South America.  The Center
worked
with the Lagoven Amuay Refinery in Judibana, Venezuela, one of the world's largest refineries. 
The
refinery plans to recover the vanadium from ash and market it worldwide.  Vanadium is used in
rust-resistant
high-speed tools, as a steel alloy, as a commercial catalyst, and in power plant air pollution
control systems.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Provides Examples of How University Research
Benefits Communities</h3> 

     Practical, market-driven university research can be a springboard for creating jobs and
economic
growth within North Dakota communities.  University research can also help these communities
deal
effectively with the energy and environmental issues they face.  Those messages were conveyed
by
Michael Jones, EERC associate director, during two workshops he conducted at Marketplace '95
in
January at Bismarck, North Dakota.<p>

<hr>
<h3>  U.S. Department of Energy Official Recognizes EERC for
Work on Coal Ash Report</h3> 

     The EERC received recognition in January 1995 at the American Coal Ash Association's 11th
International Symposium on Use and Management of Coal Combustion By-Products in Orlando,
Florida.  Robert Bedick of  the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology
Center
accepted an award from the association, which was presented to the U.S. Department of Energy
for
its effort in submitting a report to Congress on the barriers to increased coal by-product
utilization.  In
his acceptance speech, Bedick acknowledged the EERC's efforts in assembling the background
information for the report.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Out-of-State Dollars Create Regional Jobs at the
EERC</h3> 

     North Dakotans and Minnesotans benefit the most from research dollars brought into the
northern
plains region from across the country and around the world by the EERC.  More than two-thirds
of
the EERC's 260 employees are from North Dakota and Minnesota, with 112 from 45
communities in
North Dakota and 62 from 40 communities in Minnesota.  Forty-four of the Center's North
Dakota
employees are from Grand Forks; 90 are graduates of the University of North Dakota; and 44
people
from the North Dakota-Minnesota region are nondegreed employees holding technical and
support
positions. <p>
<hr>

<h3>  EERC Surfs the "Information Superhighway"</h3>
</font> 

     Cruisers of the information superhighway can learn about the EERC's programs, facilities, and
capabilities through its World-Wide Web home page on the Internet.  With an Internet connection
and
Web-browsing software such as Mosaic and Netscape, the Center's home page can be accessed at
http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu.  The EERC's home page, which first went on-line in July 1994,
was
accessed more than 30,000 times by people around the world in a 6-month period.  In 1995 the
home page
was accessed over 150,000 times.  <p>

<hr>
<h3>  EERC Technology, Expertise Create Spin-Off
Businesses</h3> 

     Although the EERC is known internationally for its energy and environmental research, it also
contributes to economic development in Grand Forks and the surrounding region.  Seven
companies
have been formed by EERC staff that are based on the technology and expertise developed at the
Center.  These companies have either commercialized processes, techniques, and scientific
research
developed at the EERC or are moving them closer to commercialization.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Joint Venture Program with U.S. Department of Energy
Assists Industry Research</h3> 

     Using federal dollars made available through a jointly sponsored research program with the
Department of Energy, the EERC has helped industry deal with energy and environmental issues. 
From the beginning of the joint venture program through fiscal year 1994, the U.S. Department of
Energy contributed $12.9 million in 72 EERC projects, totaling $28.5 million in confunded
research. 
In FY94, the $2.6 million Department of Energy investment resulted in $6.1 million in joint
projects
(57% nonfederal match).  In FY95, the EERC achieved a 61% private to 39% federal match.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Coal Ash Behavior and Deposition Short Course
Taught Nationwide</h3> 

     The EERC sponsors a one-day short course, available throughout the United States, offering a
practical overview of the physical and chemical processes related to ash behavior in coal-fired
boilers. 
The goal of this course is to provide an overview of recent research that is increasing the
understanding of mineral behavior in coal utilization and leading to the advancement of methods
to
predict ash behavior.<p>

anniversary (April 22, 1995) was sponsored by the EERC's Environmental Education Committee. 
Nineteen students from a class at Lewis and Clark Elementary School in Grand Forks won the
contest.  They toured the EERC and participated in the Center's Earth Day party.  Posters created
as
a class project were based on the theme "Clean Energy for a Clean Environment."  EERC
researchers
helped students learn how energy can be produced cleanly and efficiently and provided
demonstrations
of how Center work helps prevent pollution and clean up environmental contamination.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Mercury Contamination Workshops Offered to Oil and
Gas Industry</h3> 

     Workshops focused on mercury soil contamination at oil and gas industry metering sites are
held at
cities throughout the United States.  The workshops are organized by the EERC with the support
of

Technology
Center.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Assists North Dakota Tribe in Conducting Wind
Energy Research</h3> 

     In an effort to harness some of the enormous energy potential of North Dakota's windswept
prairies,
the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa is working to develop its wind energy resources in
partnership
with the EERC.  The project began in May 1995 and will be conducted in three phases on the
36-square-mile
Turtle Mountain Reservation in north central North Dakota. The goals are to develop a
model wind program for the Chippewa Tribe and determine the feasibility of building a
larger-scale
wind power plant to produce the reservation's electricity.<p>
<hr>
<h3>  Girl Scouts Explore Career Opportunities in Science at
the EERC</h3> 

     About 50 Girl Scouts from eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota gathered at the
EERC in
June.  They "shadowed" EERC researchers to learn more about career opportunities in science
and
participated in other activities to earn the Girl Scout "eco action" badge.  The activities at the
EERC
were part of a 2-day event sponsored by the Pine-to-Prairie Girl Scout Council, headquartered in
Grand Forks. <p>
<hr>
<h3>  EERC Hosts Project Learning Tree Environmental
Education Workshops</h3>

     More than 60 teachers, youth group leaders, and natural resource professionals from North
Dakota
attended workshops in January and June at the EERC as part of Project Learning Tree, a
nationwide
environmental education program.  The workshops provided an opportunity for the EERC to
become
more active in community outreach programs involving environmental education.  Project
Learning
Tree is a grassroots volunteer program that works in conjunction with local schools, state
agencies,
and natural resource organizations.

<font size=+2><b>T</b></font>he Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) and AGVISE Laboratories, Inc., have 
teamed to develop a water management program for the Red River of the North Basin.  A 
consortium of vested stockholders has been formed to assist in the development of the 
program, define current critical issues, and provide direction for the annual work plan.  
Fees obtained from consortium members will be used to perform work on issues pertaining 
to the development of a long-term watershed management strategy, to solve water-related 
problems that exist in the basin, and to obtain federal and state funds where a match is 
required.  Issues identified for the region will be addressed to find economical, 
practical, and timely solutions.  These solutions will be accomplished through optimizing 
and improving processes and practices currently being used, evaluating technology options, 
and identifying new or novel technologies to solve problems.  The overall goal of the 
program is to develop a long-term watershed management strategy focusing on water 
quality and quantity.

<h2><a href="/960828/mission.htm">Mission Statement</a></h2><p>
Converting energy resources cleanly and efficiently, cleaning up past environmental contamination, and preventing future environmental contamination will be some of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.
<p>
The EERC is recognized internationally as an expert in scientifically advanced energy systems and the prevention and cleanup of air, water, and soil pollution.
<p>
Established as a federal research and development facility in 1951, the EERC has been a part of the <a href="http://www.und.nodak.edu">University of North Dakota</a> (UND) since 1983. With a staff of more than 260  talented scientists, engineers, and support personnel, the EERC is one of the leading developers of energy and environmental technologies in the world.
<p>
A thriving environment and sufficient energy are essential for a high quality of life. The future depends upon our ability to extract energy and other resources in a manner that does not jeopardize the integrity and stability of the environment.  To do that, we need to understand the complex network of connections between energy and environment.
<p>
"Knowledge has replaced raw material and labor as society's key resource. But even more important than knowledge is imagination," says EERC Director Gerald Groenewold. "The EERC is a model for interdisciplinary teamwork, partnership building, and the development of imaginative solutions to critical issues."<p>

<HR SIZE=1>
<H4>National Alternative Fuels Laboratory (NAFL)</H4>
<H5>The NAFL is funded by the <A HREF="http://www.usda.gov">United States Department of Agriculture</A></H5>
<P>
     Current NAFL work includes an investigation of how the performance and
capacity of fuel evaporation <A HREF="naflcan.htm">canisters</A> are affected by vapors from fuels
containing ethanol.  The motivation for this work was provided by comparison
of NAFL data on evaporative emission compositions with data from other
researchers using "SHED" (sealed housing for evaporative determination) test
methodology.  While the NAFL data showed that the ethanol concentration in an
evaporative emission from a 10 volume percent ethanol/90 volume percent base
gasoline (E10) blend should be about 13 weight percent (wt%), published SHED
test results for ethanol concentration in E10 evaporative emissions were
significantly lower.  One possible explanation for this difference may involve
canister performance with E10 fuels.
<P>
     Other current work includes an investigation of how ethanol (in E10
blends) effects the evaporation of gasoline.  The investigation showed that in
2-hour evaporation tests performed under identical environmental conditions,
E10 fuels consistently lost more total weight to evaporation than their base
fuels, but less gasoline.  The increased weight was due to ethanol, which was
present in the E10 evaporative emissions at concentrations of about 13 weight
percent (wt%).  These data indicate that because ethanol displaces a
significant portion of gasoline in E10 evaporative emissions, the accuracy of
assessing the environmental impact of these emissions could be improved by
more understanding of the atmospheric activity and ozone-forming potential of
ethanol in relation to the gasoline components it displaces.
<P>
     Other NAFL work includes investigating the effects of different
additives and ethanol denaturants including <A HREF="naflgly.htm">glycerine and ethylene glycol</A> on
Reid vapor pressure (RVP).  One study found that RVP of E10 blends could be
decreased by as much as 0.3 psi by the addition of a small amount of ethylene
glycol.  The results of a study in which component analysis and RVP
measurement were performed on E10 and base gasolines before and after the
fuels were transported from a pipeline terminal to a gasoline station, showed
that even after a 60-mile transport, the splash blended ethanol was not
completely mixed in the E10 fuel.  The study also demonstrated the importance
of proper sampling to ensure compliance with EPA-recommended RVP limits, by
showing how RVP varied by as much as 1.0 psi for several samples obtained from
a tanker truck using different sampling techniques.

<title>EERC Partneship Opportunities in Research,
Development, Demonstration, and Commercialization</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>EERC Partneship Opportunities in Research,
Development, Demonstration, and Commercialization</h2>

<ul plain>
<h3> The Challenge and the Opportunity</h3>

     The EERC extends an invitation for partnership ventures to anyone seeking
research, development, demonstration, and commercialization opportunities
focused on energy and environmental technologies.  The greatest challenges of
the twenty-first century will include conversion of energy resources to
appropriate and environmentally acceptable forms, cost-effective remediation
of past environmental contamination, and prevention of future environmental
contamination.  The high quality of life we seek depends upon a thriving
environment and sufficient energy to meet our needs and wants.  As our need
for energy increases, so does the potential for adverse environmental impacts. 
Therefore, efficient energy production combined with pollution prevention
and/or pollution control is essential to maintain a high quality of life.  Our
future depends upon our ability to extract energy and other resources from our
environment in a manner that does not jeopardize the integrity and stability of
our environment.  These challenges present great business opportunities.<p>

<ul plain>
<h3>  EERC Philosophy and Team Approach</h3>

     The EERC is a self-supporting entity within the University of North Dakota.  The EERC's
staff of more than 260 scientists, engineers, and support personnel is dedicated to practical
problem-solving research, development, and demonstration activities leading to
commercial opportunities.<p>

     The EERC is committed to a team approach to commercializing energy and environmental
technologies through partnerships with industry.  Only effective partnerships poised to
solve the complex energy and environmental problems of today will develop the
opportunities vital for the thriving, dynamic society of tomorrow.  A single entity cannot
master and apply the wide range of skills needed to compete successfully in our emerging
world marketplace.  A synergistic team of distinctive talents, disciplines, and
organizational philosophies is needed to bring an idea through the multifaceted stages of
research, development, demonstration, and commercialization.<p>

     The EERC research team embraces a practical cradle-to-grave philosophy.  Because
energy and environment are intimately related and are cornerstones of our society, they
must be considered in a total context.  However, the magnitude of many energy and
environmental issues demands that they be treated as distinct components to facilitate
understanding.  EERC research areas are interrelated through commonalities in issues,
objectives, people, and facilities.  These commonalities provide an interconnecting web
that strengthens EERC multidisciplinary research programs.<p>


     The EERC philosophy for team building is to engage the best possible expertise.  If that
expertise is not available at the Center, it is obtained elsewhere.  The result is a large and
growing group of EERC research associates in the United States and abroad.<p>


     By the time an idea is commercialized, the project team will have grown to encompass a
wide variety of talent that may include government and private research organizations,
scientists, research managers, laboratory technicians, engineers, engineering technicians,
venture capitalists, investors, market analysts, entrepreneurs, marketers, business
managers, accountants, patent and copyright counsel, legal counsel, elected officials, and
regulatory agencies.  Even so, the technology must still be championed by a leader who
can bring the team together to produce the desired outcome, while keeping individual
members informed and focused on their specific roles in the overall plan.  <p>

 
<h3> Long-Term Investment and Risk</h3>

     The commercialization of energy and environmental technologies commonly requires
long-term investments with the potential for significant return.  Successful entrepreneurs
ignore today's societal aversion to risk by making calculated, long-term business decisions,
knowing that progress in any arena requires the willingness to take risks.  The EERC is
committed to taking advantage of long-term investment opportunities and is prepared to
take calculated business risks.<p>


<h3> Confidentiality</h3>

     Confidentiality is commonly a concern for industrial clients seeking to maintain a
competitive edge.  North Dakota law provides for practical and highly flexible
confidentiality agreements between the EERC and its partners.<p>

<h3> Education and Training Opportunities</h3>

     The rapid expansion of technology coupled with the competitive nature of the energy and
environmental industries has resulted in the need for very efficient ways to transfer
technology.  The EERC has developed a series of practically oriented short courses for
industry.  The short courses are designed not only to educate, but also to develop
relationships between the researchers in the energy and environmental industries who
actually apply technologies in commercial settings.  This cross-flow of information is
critical to the technology supplier and user alike. The industrial technology users cannot
afford to be ignorant of the latest advances that increase their ability to compete, while
those involved in research and development, as suppliers of new technologies, cannot
afford to be unaware of the changing needs in industry.  <p>

     Additionally, the EERC annually employs more than 125 highly motivated students from
the undergraduate to postdoctorate levels.  As these students graduate and move into the
private sector, they bring with them state-of-the-art understanding of a wide range of
energy and environmental issues and technologies.  EERC industrial partners have a
unique opportunity to attract new employees from this student group.<p>
</ul>

<h3> EERC Partnership Opportunities</h3>
     The EERC currently has more than 150 unique contractual agreements with a wide range
of domestic and foreign partners.  At present, over 70% of those contracts are with
industrial partners.  The period of performance for an individual contract can vary from
one week to over a decade in length.  The EERC maintains a very flexible business
approach that facilitates tailoring contractual agreements to the individual needs of clients. 
From this experience, a variety of very attractive and productive types of business
relationships have evolved.<p>

<ul>
<h3>  EERC-DOE Jointly Sponsored Research
Program</h3>

     The EERC is an agent for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Jointly Sponsored
Research Program. Through this program, the EERC provides up to 50% cofunding for
nonfederally matched projects that address a broad range of national energy and
environmental priorities.  Since 1990, the EERC has committed more than $9.5 million of
matching funds to over 90 projects.<p>

     The Jointly Sponsored Research Program provides a model funding vehicle that
encourages commercial entities to team with the EERC and DOE to demonstrate and
commercialize innovative energy and environmental technologies.  The Jointly Sponsored
Research Program has been a primary catalyst for the development of strategic U.S.
government, industry, and research-sector partnerships.  <p>

<h3>  EERC Consortium-Sponsored Research</h3>

     The EERC's consortium-sponsored research is a proven approach to addressing similar
needs of multiple clients.  In these programs, each member of the consortium obtains a
greater product than would have been possible with the same amount of funding invested
individually.  In many cases, consortium membership provides access to facilities that
would be prohibitively expensive for individual members to build, operate, and maintain.<p>

     Additionally, consortium-sponsored research is attractive to many sponsors because it
spreads research and financial risks over a larger base.  To date, the EERC has established
15 research consortia involving more than 120 sponsors to address a variety of energy and
environmental issues.<p>

<h3>  EERC-DOE Environmental Management
Program</h3>

     The EERC has a partnership with the DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center to
assist in the development and implementation of innovative new technology options to
clean up environmental legacies remaining from the U.S. nuclear weapons program.  The
EERC-DOE Cooperative Agreement focuses special attention on involving U.S. small
businesses and their technologies in solving the environmental problems at the U.S.
weapons sites.  The EERC's role is to work with small businesses on final development 
and demonstration of these technologies.<p>

<h3> EERC Memoranda of Understanding</h3>

     The EERC has executed several short-term, renewable memoranda of understanding
(MOU) with private- sector companies.  These memoranda are "agreements" to pursue
specific technology applications or other opportunities and serve as the basis for
subsequent formal contractual relationships.  For example, the EERC and firms in New
Zealand and Australia have an MOU to promote an underground coal gasification
demonstration project in the southwestern Pacific region.  Similarly, the EERC and an
American Indian-owned company have an MOU to pursue energy and environmental
technology applications on Indian lands in the American West.  In addition, the EERC has
developed an MOU with the Council of Energy Resource Tribes (CERT) focused on
addressing energy and environmental management needs on Indian lands.  An official
signing ceremony is being scheduled for the near future.<p>


<h3> EERC Foundation</h3>

     The EERC has established the EERC Foundation to aid in the development,
demonstration, and commercialization of energy and environmental technologies.  The
Foundation's role is to house and license technologies for which the EERC holds a unique
position by virtue of expertise, patents, or copyrights and to facilitate the formation of
spin-off technology companies that will commercialize EERC-derived technologies.<p>

</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"> <h3><b>6th Champion - Dr. Everett A. Sondreal</b></h3>
</font> <p>

<p>

     Dr. Everett A. Sondreal was honored as the sixth recipient of the Energy &amp; Environmental
Research Center (EERC) Energy Champion Award.  Over the past 40 years, his commitment
to excellence and his dedication to providing practical solutions to critical energy and
environmental problems have come to embody the EERC's philosophy and approach.  His
research on coal and clean coal technologies, as well as his leadership during the EERC's
transition from federal to state ownership, make him a worthy candidate for this award.<p>

<p>

Currently serving as principal research advisor at the EERC, Dr. Sondreal was the primary
architect of the Cooperative Agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and
the University of North Dakota (UND) when the Center was defederalized in 1983.  His
efforts helped smooth the  transition to state ownership while avoiding harmful impacts on
the Center's staff.  The Center also retained its mission capability as the leading authority
on low-rank coal technology, enabling it to develop a more diversified program of scientific
and engineering research, testing, and evaluation.<p>

<p>

More recently, Dr. Sondreal played a key role in the EERC's international outreach activities,
including two energy and environmental conferences in Prague and a training program with the
U.S. State Department's Agency for International Development conducted by the EERC for
high-level energy managers from East Central Europe.  In the research area, Dr. Sondreal's
principal interests and expertise are in coal properties and clean coal technology.  <p>

<p>

He has authored or coauthored more than 60 publications, and he holds a U.S. patent for
continuous liquefaction of coal. <p>

<p>

A native of Grand Forks, North Dakota, Dr. Sondreal first worked at the Center in 1955 as an
undergraduate student at UND.  After graduating with a degree in chemical engineering, he
served in the U.S. Air Force as a nuclear research officer from 1957 to 1959 and then was
hired as a development engineer for DuPont.  He came back to UND in 1960 and worked at
the EERC as a graduate student while earning his master's degree in chemical engineering. 
Dr. Sondreal joined the Center's full-time staff as a research engineer in 1962 and was later
promoted to research supervisor.<p>

<p>

After receiving a Department of Interior training award, he attended the University of
Michigan from 1969 to 1972, where he earned his Ph.D.  There, he applied his work on the
computer modeling of combustion to the afterburning of auto emissions.  His models were
used by Ford and General Motors in designing emission control systems for their cars and
trucks.  Upon returning to the Center in 1972, Dr. Sondreal assumed a greater leadership role
in its programs.  <p>

<p>

The 1973 Arab Oil Embargo created one of the most exciting and interesting periods in the
Center's history as America attempted to capitalize on coal, its most abundant energy resource. 
Dr. Sondreal spearheaded efforts to expand the Center's programs in the areas of gasification,
liquefaction, and emissions control.  These opportunities brought significant growth in the
Center's staff and budget.  In addition, the Center was also assigned DOE responsibility for
oversight of environmental processes during the design and construction of the Great Plains
Gasification Plant near Beulah, North Dakota, which remains the nation's only
commercial-scale coal gasification facility.<p>

<p>

Dr. Sondreal served as the Center's deputy director from 1978 to 1980 and as its director from
1980 to 1983.  He received DOE's Exceptional Service and Super Achievement Award in
1982 and 1983.  Following the defederalization of the Center in 1983, Dr. Sondreal served as
president of Coal Energy Technology Consultants, Inc., Grand Forks, from 1984 to 1991.  He
returned to work for the EERC on a part-time basis as a senior research advisor in 1987 and
was recently named principal research advisor.  He and his wife, Grace, live on the Sondreal
family farm south of Grand Forks.<p>

<p>

In great appreciation for Dr. Sondreal's dedication to making the EERC one of the world's
leading energy and environmental research facilities and for his pragmatic approach to
conducting focused, practical research, he is honored with the 1995 Energy Champion.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"> <h3><b>5th Champion - Thomas J. Clifford</b></h3>
</font> <p>

<p>

For his long-term commitment to North Dakota, for understanding that higher education must
evolve toward being more sensitive to the marketplace, for his vision, for his political savvy,
and for consistently demonstrating the courage of his convictions, the EERC awarded Thomas
J. Clifford, President Emeritus, University of North Dakota (UND), the Fifth Energy
Champion Award.<p>

<p>

President of UND from 1971 to 1992, his visionary leadership and recognition of the potential
for commercial development of energy and environmental technologies set the stage for a
brighter economic future for North Dakota.  His association with UND spanned more than 50
years, and he served more years at the University than any other full-time employee.  In 1983,
the EERC became part of UND under then-President Clifford's tenure.  He is credited with
having the wisdom and foresight to understand what the EERC meant to the University and its
potential for economic development and jobs creation.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"> <h3><b>4th Champion - Senator Kent Conrad</b></h3>
</font> <p>

<p>

To show our appreciation for Senator Kent Conrad's dedication, determination, and
support for the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center and the state of North Dakota,
the EERC recognized him as the fourth recipient of the Energy Champion Award.  The
EERC greatly values its close working relationship with Senator Conrad and his efforts to
base national energy and environmental policy on sound scientific information.<p>

<p>

Senator Conrad is among our nation's leaders in shaping American energy policy, serving
as a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as vice chairman
of the committee's subcommittee on Water and Power.  Recognizing the enormous
potential of markets in East Central Europe and the Pacific Rim, he has worked relentlessly
and tirelessly to create opportunities for the export of North Dakota's energy and
environmental technologies to those markets.  Senator Conrad has been a speaker and a
participant in such important EERC events as the biennial SynOps Conferences, the Low-Rank Fuels
Symposium,
and the April 1992 East Central European energy and
environment conference in Prague, Czech Republic.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"> <h3><b>3rd Champion - John MacFarlane</b></h3> </font>
<p>

<p>

For exceptional personal and corporate dedication and commitment, the Energy &amp;
Environmental Research Center proclaimed Mr. John MacFarlane, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Otter Tail Power Company, as the third Energy Champion Award
recipient.  Through an ongoing commitment of personal time, financial gifts, and genuine
involvement, MacFarlane has demonstrated his support for the Center, the School of
Engineering and Mines, and the University of North Dakota.  <p>

<p>

MacFarlane demonstrates extraordinary personal commitment to energy and
environmental research and development programs.  Under his leadership, Otter Tail
Power Company has been among the most progressive industrial sponsors of the Center's
research programs, including Project Sodium, the Coal Ash Resources Research
Consortium, the groundwater-monitoring program, the circulating fluidized-bed
combustion program, and others.  These research efforts will potentially lead to lower
operating costs for utilities, thus helping hold down electrical energy costs to residents of
the upper Plains states.  In addition to coal-related research, MacFarlane has demonstrated
a commitment to renewable energy technologies and regional economic development.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"> <h3><b>2nd Champion - Conrad Aas</b></h3> </font>
<p>

<p>

Mr. Con Aas, formerly Assistant Manager of Research at Northern States Power Company
(NSP) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, made outstanding contributions to the advancement of
energy technology and to the energy industry in North Dakota.  He actively initiated
sponsorship of a variety of energy-related research projects at the University of North
Dakota, including ground-coupled heat pump systems and monitoring background solar
and wind energy, as well as supporting Project Sodium and the Coal Ash Resources
Research Consortium, projects involving enhanced efficiency in coal combustion and ash
management studies.  These projects provided excellent research opportunities for UND
faculty, staff, and students, while helping to put NSP at the forefront of technology
development in the electric utility industry.<p>

<p>

Aas continually demonstrated the unique ability to shape a research concept to fit the
goals and interests  of  not  only  NSP,  but  also  of the electric utility industry as a whole. 
This perception and foresight, as well as the level of personal dedication to research
programs, distinguished Aas as the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center's second
Energy Champion Award.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"> <h3><b>1st Champion - U.S. Senator Mark Andrews</b></h3>
</font> <p>

<p>

Former U.S. Senator Mark Andrews, a member of the Appropriations Committee and a
strong supporter of fossil energy programs and the federal coal research program, was an
extremely deserving recipient of the first Energy <p>

<p>

Champion Award.  Former Senator Andrews was very involved with several areas at the
EERC, including the jet fuel study and the chemcoal project, and he provided generous
support for transitional funding during the Center's defederalization process through his work
on the Appropriations Committee.<p>

<p>

The Senator's strong belief that the federal coal research program would provide long-term
benefits to the American consumer as the result of more efficient utilization of coal, reduced
environmental impacts, and availability of substitutes for expensive oil and gas was very
apparent in his ongoing support, and the EERC recognized his achievements and foresight as
setting outstanding precedents for the first Energy Champion.

<h1>Center for Air Toxic Metals</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2> Background</h2>
     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the <a href="http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu">EERC</a> exemplifies international
research, development, demonstration, and commercialization partnerships between
government, industry, and applied science and engineering at a university research
center.  CATM receives funding from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
(EPA) and industry, and EPA coordinates CATM efforts with other government- and
industry-funded programs on air toxic metals.  CATM is focused on minimizing the
effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the environment.  The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing 189 substances, including
air toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM is working with industry and
government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a
theoretical basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate
and impacts of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  Regulation of
air toxic metals is being considered and implemented in Europe and elsewhere globally. 
CATM invites international participation in the program.  CATM programs are focused
on the development of methods to minimize the release of air toxic metals via practical
prevention and control methods based on scientific understanding and principles.<p>

<p>
 <h2>  Role and Activities</h2>

     The role of CATM is to act as a hub or focal point of activities for air toxic metal
research, working closely with the gas, oil, utility, and waste-to-energy industries and
regulatory agencies.  CATM plays a vital role in the process of integrating reliable
information related to preventing and controlling air toxic metal pollution.  CATM
activities are peer-reviewed annually by experts from industry, academia, and
government.  Current activities include the following:<p>

<Ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Identifying sources of toxic metals in the oil, gas, utility, and waste-to-energy
industries.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Examining all options to prevent the release of air toxic metals.</li>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Determining the partitioning of metals in process streams and determining the
amount, form, and ultimate fate.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing, demonstrating, and commercializing technologies and processes that
mitigate the release/toxicity of potentially toxic metals.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing techniques to sample and measure air toxic metals in feedstocks and
process streams effectively.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing computer-based technologies to compile the vast quantities of data
and
to predict the fate of air toxic metals.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing educational programs to foster environmental literacy in students.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Facilitating the development of mechanisms by which industry and government are
cooperatively working to solve air toxic metal problems through industrial affiliate
programs and jointly sponsored research programs that will lead to commercialization
of technologies and, hence, economic development.
</ul>
<p>
<h2> Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
     A closely coupled relationship between fundamental scientific knowledge and
technology development and commercialization is vital for maintaining a high standard
of living through environmental protection and economic development in the United
States.  The EERC is very proud of its success through CATM in applying scientific
and engineering principles to developmental issues faced by industry, government, and
regulatory agencies.  The primary accomplishments of CATM include the following:<p>
<p>

<ul>
  <IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM coordinated an international workshop on the fate of trace elements in
power plants, which was cosponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE).  The peer-reviewed papers and discussion have been published by Elsevier Science Publishers
for worldwide distribution.
<p>

   <IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM is currently working on a project in cooperation with DOE to determine the
fate of air toxic metals in gasification systems and to develop a computer model to predict the fate of air toxic
metals.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> <a href="http://www.doe.gov">DOE</a> has conducted testing at ten power plants in the United States and measured
the emissions of 189 potentially toxic substances.  The EERC, through CATM, has been
asked by DOE and EPRI to be a third-party reviewer of the data on air toxic substances.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM has a jointly sponsored research project with six industry partners to
develop methods to prevent and control the emissions of air toxic metals through fuel selection
and the enhancement of air pollution control systems.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM participates in Project Mercury, a coordinated effort focused on determining
the fate of mercury in air, water, and soil as it relates to gas, oil, utility, and waste-to-energy systems.
<p>

<h1>Environmental Management Program</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>  Background</h2>
<p>
     At numerous locations across the nation, the <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy</a> (DOE) is
facing the monumental task of cleaning up environmental contamination at nuclear
weapons facilities and other sites, a process that has been estimated to take 30 years and
cost hundreds of billions of dollars.  The <a href="http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu">EERC</a> is an active partner in DOE's
Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Program, which is aimed at
demonstrating and commercializing new technologies to characterize and clean up these
sites.  The EERC's Environmental Management (EM) program is working to
commercialize new cleanup technologies in two ways: 1) through research,
development, and demonstration of our own technologies, leading to partnerships with
the private sector in commercialization and 2) by providing the private sector
(especially small businesses) with the expertise and technical resources needed to take
their technologies to the marketplace.<p>
<p>
     Critical to this effort is the need to accelerate the commercial development of new
technologies.  The EM Program at the EERC is designed to assist the private sector in
advancing faster, safer, and cheaper analytical techniques and environmental cleanup
technologies toward demonstration and full commercial application.  Working in
cooperation with DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC), the EERC
provides technical support and serves as a broker in arranging and implementing jointly
sponsored research projects.  With capabilities in waste characterization, processing,
containment, site remediation, extraction, vitrification, pyrolysis, and plasma
remediation, as well as access to field sites where applicable cleanup technologies can
be demonstrated, the EERC is particularly well equipped to assist small business with
technical and logistical support in the development and commercialization of their
innovative environmental management technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2> Program Goals</h2>

<h2> Current Contract Activities</H2>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Extraction and Analysis of Pollutant Organics from Contaminated Solids Using
Off-Line Supercritical Fluid Extraction and On-Line SFE/IR - The EERC is evaluating and demonstrating
simple-to-operate field instrumentation and extraction methods capable of rapidly extracting organic
contaminants at parts per million  to parts per billion levels. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Pyrolysis of Plastic Waste - The EERC is developing a commercial process to
reduce the volume of low-level radioactive mixed-plastics/paper/resin waste that will depolymerize a variety of
bulk plastic materials to produce crude oil-type liquids and separable solid wastes.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Stabilization of Vitrified Waste by Enhanced Crystallization and Development of a
Protocol to Predict Long-Term Stability - The EERC is developing enhanced vitrification methods based on the
incorporation of toxic metals and radionuclides into crystallized phases that are environmentally stable under
disposal conditions over long periods of time.  Stability will be established based on the known geochemical
properties of mineral phases in nature and the EERC-developed synthetic groundwater leaching procedure  
(SGLP) and long-term leaching (LTL) procedure.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Extraction of Hazardous Metals from Mixed Solid Wastes by Chelation and
Supercritical Fluid Extraction - The EERC is proposing to use chelation of hazardous metals and extraction by
supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> in suitable combinations to separate various hazardous metals sequentially
from mixed wastes.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Subcritical Water Extraction of Organic Pollutants - The EERC is proposing to
demonstrate subcritical water extraction at low pressure and moderate temperatures of 200&#176; to
300&#176; C to be a rapid, low-cost method for selectively separating organic pollutants from wastes.  <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Demonstration of a Low-Temperature Plasma Remediation Technology - The
EERC's patent-pending plasma remediation technology will be demonstrated as a field-transportable,
low-temperature alternative to incineration for oxidative destruction of organic contaminants in soil without
producing problematic volatile by-products.  <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Centrifugal Membrane Filtration - The EERC is involved in a partnership with
Spintek, a small business with anovel centrifugal membrane filtration technology.  This project will demonstrate
the application of the Spintek technology in the remediation of liquid mixed-waste streams at DOE facilities. 
The technology is a uniquely configured process that combines ultrafiltration and centrifugal force to separate
suspended and dissolved solids from liquid waste streams, producing a filtered water stream and a
low-volume concentrate stream. Potential applications for the technology include remediation of groundwater
contaminant plumes and treatment of contaminated process waters from decontamination and
decommissioning activities.  </ul>
<p>
<h2>Future Direction</h2>
<p>
     The EERC will continue to advance joint initiatives with small business entities under
the EM program, with the objective of developing high-payoff technologies to manage
DOE-generated wastes faster, safer, and cheaper than currently available environmental
cleanup technologies.  The development of technologies for the safe and efficient
cleanup of mixed wastes will have a broad application worldwide.  New cleanup
technologies are a critical component of our expanding international opportunities.

<center>
<h1>Native American Initiative</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>
   The EERC is enhancing a longstanding University of North Dakota (UND) commitment to American Indians
through a program focused on responding to energy and environmental needs on Indian lands. Traditional
UND efforts include a nationally acclaimed "Indians into Medicine" (INMED) program, which has matriculated
20% of all Native American physicians practicing in our nation today.  UND's Center for Teaching and Learning
has prepared teachers and educational administrators for schools on reservations throughout the nation for
more than two decades.  Other established UND programs focus on recruiting and graduating Indians in the
fields of communications, psychology, nursing, and law.  The EERC recognizes the need to increase Native American
 enrollments in energy and environmental disciplines to broaden their employment opportunities.  The
EERC is responding to newly emerging energy and environmental needs in partnership with a growing
network, including tribal governments, American Indian-owned businesses, the Council of Energy Resource
Tribes (CERT), tribal colleges, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  Specific relationships include the
following:<p> 
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> <b>Alaskan Remote-Site Initiative</b> A
considerable percentage of Alaska's Native population is located in remote villages.  Heat and electricity for
residential and commercial energy needs in remote villages are often supplied by diesel engines powered by
diesel oil imported from the lower 48 states.  Because of the long distances that the fuel must be shipped, the
means of transport, the fuel storage requirements in harsh environments and the cost of installing power
equipment in these remote environments, the cost of energy in these communities is among the highest in the
United States.  In addition, the use and storage of diesel fuel creates environmental problems that Alaskan
residents would like to mitigate.  DOE's Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) and the EERC have
been working in partnership with Alaskan Native and state officials for several years to introduce technology
concepts to Alaska and create the atmosphere for the introduction of new technologies in the villages. 
Projects have progressed to demonstrate these small, easy-to-operate-and-maintain, environmentally friendly,
economically acceptable technologies using indigenous fuels and waste materials to produce electricity and
heat.  The lessons learned to date in Alaska are transferable to Hawaiian Native and Native American
communities throughout the United States and into international markets. <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"><b>The Devils Lake Sioux Tribe </b> , Fort
Totten, North Dakota, has contracted with the EERC to evaluate the environmental impact of the tribal
municipal landfill, wastewater treatment lagoons, and groundwater in the area of tribal water supply wells.
This project is providing information regarding potential environmental problems with respect to short- and
long-term tribal environmental goals. <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"><b> The Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe </b>
(TMCT) in partnership with the EERC has been awarded $248,000 from DOE's National Renewable Energy
Laboratory to demonstrate the production of electricity from wind on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. The
TMCT-EERC team will conduct an environmental impact assessment, identify the optimal wind energy sites, and
install and operate a Zond System wind turbine to produce power for tribal industry. <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"><b> Universal Technologies Corporation</b> 
(UTC), a 100% Native American-owned and - controlled environmental consulting firm located in Powell,
Wyoming, and the EERC have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) under which both parties offer
services relevant to a wide range of Native American issues, including resource characterization, energy
conversion, site assessment, groundwater geology, waste management, contaminant remediation, education,
training, environmental justice, and environmental enforcement.  <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> <b>Council of Energy Resource Tribes  </b>, an
organization of 53 federally recognized Indian tribes and four Canadian Indian nations, and the EERC have
developed an MOU focused on addressing energy and environmental management needs on Indian lands.  An
official signing ceremony is being scheduled for the near future.  This MOU enables CERT, members of CERT,
and the EERC to work together on specific research, development, demonstration, and commercialization
projects focused on resource assessment, energy conversion technology, reclamation of disturbed lands,
waste management, site cleanup, contaminant remediation technology, and training. <p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"><b>Standing Rock College, </b> Fort Yates,
North Dakota, CERT, and the EERC have signed an MOU under which the team has submitted a proposal to the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Environmental Justice Community/University Partnership Grants
Program. The proposed program is designed to articulate the Indian principles of environmental justice and to
translate those principles into education and training curricula that can guide Native Americans in the
planning, development, and implementation of environmental protection programs that comport with those
principles.<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"><b> Little Hoop Community College </b>, located
on the Fort Totten Indian Reservation, in partnership with the EERC, has submitted a proposal to the EPA
Environmental Justice program that focuses on identifying environmental justice issues on the Fort Totten
Indian Reservation, identifying a community action team, training the community action team in waste
management and water resource issues, and conducting community workshops on the reservation. <p> 

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The EERC, in cooperation with the UND Foundation,
UND Office of Native American Programs, UND Office of Enrollment Services, Turtle
Mountain Community College, Little Hoop Community College, and UTC, has designed
an education and training program focused on energy and environmental needs on Indian
lands. The intended product is to recruit Native American professionals at the associate
and bachelor levels to participate in a specially tailored curriculum combined with
on-the-job training and field experience relevant to problems on Indian lands.

<title>Energy and Environmental Issues Assessment</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Energy and Environmental Issues Assessment</h2>
<hr><h3>Background</h3> 
Energy industry decisions on resources, utilization technologies, and emission prevention and
control measures are made in reference to changing patterns of fuel cost and availability,
emerging technological choices, externality impacts, and government policies, statutes, and
regulations.  Research related to energy and the environment must be performed with an
awareness of the forces that shape these future trends and should anticipate needs in order to
compensate for developmental lead time.  <p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

The purpose of this activity was to understand the potentialities, limitations, and status of
competing energy technologies in terms of scientific basis, state of development, technical
barriers, cost, efficiency, policy treatment, and environmental performance in order to support
research program development.  Activities included critical literature surveys, surveys and
assessments of active research programs and information sources, comparative data
compilation, interpretive calculations, and tracking of regulatory, policy, and technical issues.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<ul plain>
<img src="gifs/bl_dot.gif"> A report entitled "Energy and Environmental Profile for Selected
East-Central
European Nations" was prepared which provides an overview of energy and the
environment issues in the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria. 
The report features a table, organized by subject and country and current through 1992,
that presents summary information on economics, energy consumption, environmental
priorities, energy resources, production and utilization, electrical generation and
transmission, district heating, briquettes, and environmental regulations.  The report
will be available in the summer of 1995 in the proceedings of the "Energy and
Environment:  Transitions in East Central Europe" conference held in the fall of 1994
in Prague, Czech Republic.
<p>

<img src="gifs/bl_dot.gif"> A review of North Dakota energy issues was presented at the State of
the State
Economic Conference on January 25, 1995, in Bismarck, North Dakota.

<title>Bulgarian Clean Coal </title>
</head>

<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Bulgarian Clean Coal Utilization Technology Assessment </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Background </h3>
     The nations of East Central Europe regained their political and economic freedom in 1989,
ending nearly half a century of centrally planned economies under the hegemony of the
former Soviet Union.  These nations are now emerging from economic conditions marked
by price distortions, a focus on heavy industry, isolation from world markets, and a lack of
occupational health and environmental safeguards.  Economic recovery, environmental
restoration, and political stability, as well as eventual entrance into the European
Community, require a reordering of policies and priorities, including those bearing on
energy and environment.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>

     Focusing on these needs, the EERC led a project funded by the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE).  The primary goal of this project was to introduce the Bulgarian energy
sector to technologies required to make better use of their indigenous lignite for least-cost
electric power generation and briquette production, while reducing emissions.  Specific
objectives were to help evaluate the clean coal technology options for Bobov Dol, Sofia,
and Maritsa East lignite-based power generation and domestic heating fuel production and
to facilitate the transfer of U.S. technologies to meet Bulgaria's needs for power
generation, domestic solid fuel, and reduced emissions at minimum cost.  The emphasis of
this work was on identifying opportunities for integrating near-term options into the long-term
development of
Bulgaria's lignite resources.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The EERC worked in close cooperation with the Bulgarian energy firms Energoproekt
and TOTEMA.  Their assistance was essential in identifying the needs of the Bulgarian
power industry, assessing the current conditions of equipment and fuel in Bulgaria, and
selecting and prioritizing the final technological areas for the investigations.  The most
urgent problems facing the Bulgarian energy sector are the low reliability and availability
of their thermal power plants, stemming from age, poor boiler maintenance, low-quality
coal, and interruption of coal supply.  Other major issues are high emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>,
NO<sub>x</sub>, and particulates and how to bring plants into compliance with environmental
standards at
reasonable costs.<p>

     The steps taken in evaluating these problems and formulating recommendations included
1) reviewing the current condition of power plant equipment and characteristics of the
fuels, 2) evaluating potential remedial options, 3) selecting and contacting vendors, 4)
developing a technology options handbook, and 5) hosting a workshop to introduce
representatives of the Bulgarian power sector to U.S. vendors.  The technological areas
considered, listed in the priority order determined by the Bulgarian energy firms, are as
follows:<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Particulate control<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Rehabilitation and life extension of existing units<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Fuel switching<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Advanced power systems<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Retrofit with circulating fluidized-bed combustors<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Flue gas desulfurization<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Coal beneficiation<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> NO<sub>x</sub> control<br>
</ul>
<p>

     The project culminated in a "Technology Options Handbook," which provides a matrix of
methods and problems relating to each of the technical areas studied.  Each method is
specifically discussed as it relates to Bulgarian lignites, with the focus being the Maritsa East
mine, which is the only low-cost source of indigenous Bulgarian coal.  Those clean coal
technologies that best meet the needs of the Bulgarians were identified.  Additionally, the
investigation deliberately avoided all-or-nothing approaches to meeting environmental
regulations, which reject technologies offering less than the approximately 98% sulfur removal
efficiency required to meet international standards.  Cost-benefit analysis was performed using
ICECAP, an integrated coal evaluation, cost, and performance model developed by DOE.<p>

     In addition to the technical evaluation provided by the EERC in the handbook, appendices
containing vendor qualifications, technical information, and points of contact are supplied.  The
intent of these appendices is to provide the Bulgarians with a "buyer's guide" to U.S.
technologies.

<title>Polish Power Industry Least-Cost Analysis for Power
Plant Upgrade</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Polish Power Industry Least-Cost Analysis for Power
Plant Upgrade</h2><hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     Ninety-five percent of Polish electricity production is from coal--hard coal and brown
coal.  Seventy-five percent of all energy consumption is from coal.  Unfortunately,
very few plants have desulfurization and NOx reduction technology, which contributes
to make Poland one of the most polluted countries in Europe.  A major contributor to
the pollution is the 32 GW of inefficient, aging power plants typically found in the
major population centers of Poland.  About 135 TWh of electricity was produced in
1991, along with 248 PJ of heat. <p>

     Recently, the Polish Ministry of Environmental Protection issued a set of national
emission standards that will be effective January 1, 1998.  Plants that exceed the
standards will have fines levied against them.  Consequently, Polish power stations
need extensive upgrading to meet these forthcoming standards.  Such upgrading
includes life extension of existing plants, improved availability of power, increased
efficiency, and pollution control.<p>

     Poland is currently evaluating the process it uses to produce, deliver, and set prices for
electricity.  A critical step in the evaluation process is the development and adoption of
analytical tools to conduct a "multivariant feasibility investigation" of Polish power
plants to provide a common basis for estimating the technical, environmental, and
economic performance or modifications needed to extend the life of aging power
plants, increase efficiency, and control emissions.  This is especially necessary so that
the Polish power plant industry can become an informed customer by establishing its
own requirements and deal effectively with the multitude of vendors of plant-upgrading
services and air pollution control equipment.<p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

     The objective of this work was to assist the government of Poland by undertaking a
cost-shared project to select, test, and adopt personal computer (PC)-based analytical
tools that can be used by Polish power plants to conduct the multivariant feasibility
studies needed to define cost-effective approaches to upgrade power plants and bring
them into compliance with 1988 emission standards.<p>
 <h3>Results</h3>

     The EERC participated in a one-day briefing of Polish power station personnel in
Warsaw, Poland.  Based on feedback from this visit, a site-specific feasibility study on
upgrade options was performed on a power plant selected by the Polish Power Institute
(PPI).  The EERC worked with PPI to make the final selection of technical options and
site information that made up the input for this study.  The EERC worked with PPI to
apply analytical models to evaluate the cost and performance of a series of upgrade
options.  The results of the model analysis and related information on the technical
options analyzed by the EERC and PPI were integrated by PPI into a comprehensive
written report on the feasibility study, including recommendations for implementing the
study findings.  The cost-benefit analysis was performed using ICECAP, an integrated
coal evaluation, cost, and performance model developed by the U.S. Department of
Energy.<p>

<h1>Technology Information Exchange - Commingling</h1> 
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Commingling with respect to gasoline is the art of mixing two or more fuels in an automobile fuel
tank.  This is recognized as a potential cause of increased emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOC).  Concern over commingling could result in a reduction of ethanol usage in reformulated
gasoline (RFG), since most of the attention on commingling is directed toward mixing ethanol and
nonethanol RFGs.  Because of the interest of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, oil
companies, and ethanol producers, scientific dialogue is mounting.  The controversy surrounding the
issue is largely based on scarce scientific data.  Most discussion centers on ethanol-gasoline blends
and their effect when added to partially filled automobile fuel tanks.  Because of the controversial
nature of the topic and the opposing views of the vested interests, it is important that the current state
of the technology be known and available to interested parties.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives of this project were to serve as an information source on the
subject of commingling and to facilitate communications on the subject
between the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and government and private
organizations with concerns over the issue.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     During 1993, the ethanol industry was faced with two major concerns in its
efforts to keep a share of the fuels market.  The first was the vapor pressure
increase resulting from blending gasoline and ethanol to get E10, which
received most of the public attention.  The second concern, commingling,
received less publicity although some interests believed it was no less
important.  The lower profile of this issue was, in large part, due to a lack of
sufficient hard scientific data.  Although related to the blending issue, there
was disagreement on the magnitude of the problem relative to blending.  The
RFA required up-to-the-minute information on the political status of E10 as
well as the most current technical information on the tank mixing of different
gasolines.  To accommodate its needs, the EERC performed detailed searches
of literature and government publications, attended national meetings
concerning ethanol, and kept abreast of current developments through the
news media and through contact with key individuals on both sides of the
ethanol issue.  The information was compiled and forwarded to the RFA
routinely and on a demand basis.  This information enabled RFA to effectively
plan strategies and promote the continued use of ethanol as an oxygenate in
gasoline.<p>

<title>Barriers to the Increased Utilization of Coal
Combustion/Desulfuization By-Products by
Government and Commercial Sectors</title>

<h2>
Barriers to the Increased Utilization of Coal Combustion/Desulfuization By-Products by
Government and
Commercial Sectors
</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Increasing costs and regulation of solid waste disposal are making ash disposal an undesirable
option. 
For this reason, Section 1334 of the Energy Act of 1992 charged the Secretary of Energy to
"conduct
a detailed and comprehensive survey on the institutional, legal, and regulatory barriers to
increased
utilization of coal combustion by-products by potential governmental and commercial users."<p>

     The EERC has performed numerous research projects that provide information to aid our
understanding of the technical and political issues related to increased coal by-product utilization. 
This program was conducted in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy
Technology Center (DOE METC) efforts to produce a report to Congress containing a detailed
survey
of the institutional, legal, and regulatory barriers to increased utilization of coal combustion
by-products and
recommendations for action to be taken to increase the utilization of coal combustion
by-products.<p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The overall objective of this project was to prepare a report for METC
summarizing the issues associated with the utilization of coal combustion by-products.  In order
to meet the
objective of this project, input from several
governmental and private agencies involved with coal by-product utilization
was solicited.  Data pertinent to the project goals were collected and
commented on by experts in the field of coal by-product utilization.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The information compiled by the EERC originated from the following sources: 
1) previous works in the literature to assess the current state of understanding
and to identify information gaps, 2) identification of the government agencies
and private concerns involved with coal by-product utilization, 3) personal
interviews to fill knowledge gaps and to assess issues of primary concern, 4)
two open forums designed to solicit input from industry, and 5) input from a
workshop designed to facilitate comments on the draft version of reports by
government and industry experts and to assist in shaping recommendations.<p>

     The EERC assessed of the current state of ash utilization in the United States. 
The investigation found that the nearly 90 million tons of coal combustion
by-products produced annually in the United States is a valuable national
resource that is vastly underutilized.  Current use of about 30% of the coal ash
and only 2% of the flue gas desulfurization products represents a failed
opportunity when compared to the utilization potential in the United States
and the nearly complete utilization already achieved in some western European
countries.  Future opportunities can be seized by concerted action to offer
substantial benefits to the nation's electric generation, construction, and
manufacturing industries, to agriculture, and to the environment, whereas
failure to act will create literally mountains of solid waste, an unnecessary
legacy of future energy production.<p>

     The investigation concluded that because of the profound economic and
environmental benefits of increased coal by-product utilization, it is critical
that we adopt by-product utilization as a key element of rebuilding our
national <b></b>energy infrastructure.  Actions must be taken now in order to remove
many of the regulatory, legal, and technical barriers to increased by-product
use.  Swift, decisive action is needed in order to ensure that we derive the
maximum environmental and economic advantages afforded by efficient by-product utilization. 
Although the
need for federal leadership in this area is
clear, an equal commitment is needed from state and local governments as well
as the industrial sector.  Partnerships with industry and state agencies are
necessary to ensure that appropriate regulations and specifications are used and
to ensure the commercial viability of new technologies and strategies developed
for by-product use.  Although a myriad of activities aimed towards increasing
by-product use is presently under way, a distinct lack of coordination of these
efforts exists within both the public and private sectors.  A coordinated team
effort is needed to achieve by-product utilization goals; this effort must be
championed by the federal government, with a single agency charged with the
responsibility of leading the effort and coordinating the activities of the
participants.<p>

<h2>A Review of Issues Related to the Subsurface Occurance of Selected Natural Gas Industry Chemicals
</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Subsurface contamination by volatile aromatic hydrocarbons has been the focus of
characterization and remediation activities at natural gas processing plants for some
time; however, subsurface contamination related to process chemicals such as glycols
and alkanolamines and process waste components such as organosulfur compounds has
only recently become the subject of significant concern and some attention.  In an
effort to aid both the natural gas industry and regulators in responding appropriately to
this growing concern, Dr. John Headley of the National Hydrology Research Institute
in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with funding from the Canadian Panel for Energy
Research and Development and the cooperation of the Canadian natural gas industry,
recently initiated a long-term research program to investigate analytical and transport
and fate issues related to subsurface contaminants other than volatile aromatic
hydrocarbons at Canadian natural gas processing plants.<p>
<p>
     In response to an invitation from Dr. Headley, the EERC has undertaken the task of
acquiring, evaluating, and synthesizing presently available information and data of use
to him in investigating some of the chemicals of interest, as well as to those involved in
assessing and mitigating subsurface contamination related to the same chemicals.  The
chemicals of interest include glycols and alkanolamines that are commonly used by the
natural gas industry and selected organosulfur compounds that result from industry
activities.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The objective of this project is to provide natural gas industry personnel,
researchers, and others with a summary of available information and data that
may be of use in addressing subsurface contamination issues involving selected
alkanolamines, glycols, and organosulfur compounds commonly associated with
industry activities. <p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Information and data from approximately 250 published and unpublished
documents and more than 50 personal contacts with experts in industry,
academics, and the government have been used to produce a draft document
that includes up-to-date summaries of those aspects of the alkanolamines and
glycols of interest that bear on their role as potential subsurface contaminants. 
Specifically, the document focuses on the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Use by the natural gas industry<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Potential sources and mechanisms of subsurface contamination<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Physical and chemical properties and their environmental implications<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Regulations and guidelines in the United States and Canada, both on the
national level and in selected states and provinces that are important in terms
of natural gas industry activity<br>
     <p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Subsurface transport and fate, with an emphasis on the controlling
processes<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Toxicological characteristics <br>
</ul>
<p>
     This draft document, which will be available for widespread distribution upon
completion, also includes recommendations for further research that holds
particular promise for helping to address subsurface contamination issues
related to the alkanolamines and glycols of interest.<p>
<p>
     Initially, similar information and data specific to the selected organosulfur
compounds were to have been included in the preceding document.  However,
only a very limited amount of work has been focused on these compounds,
thus producing significantly less that is of use in this context.  What is
available is being provided under separate cover to the funding entities for
their use and will not likely receive wider distribution.<p>

<title>Stratigraphic Evaluation of North Dakota Lignite</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center><h2>Stratigraphic Evaluation of North Dakota Lignite</h2>

</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     As a component of the National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS) program, this
project is designed to provide coal data to aid in the accurate determination of coal
resources in the United States.  The projected coal reserves of North Dakota are vast
and thus contribute significantly to estimates of coal availability.  Most of North
Dakota's coal-bearing strata have received some investigation, although the level of
detail and usefulness varies considerably.  Previous regional coal studies were
conducted prior to the availability of large-scale U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps, limiting the value of many observations.  Studies on North Dakota's
lignite resources were carried out by A.G. Leonard and others of the North Dakota
Geological Survey and summarized in 1925.  This work was subsequently revised by
USGS resource evaluations by M.R. Campbell in 1929 and R.A. Brant in 1953.  The
later investigation remains the definitive work after more than 40 years.  The resource
estimates from these early surveys were, quite naturally highly speculative in that many
assumptions were made on coal bed correlation, lateral continuity of thickness, and
inferred location to expedite calculations.  In all studies after Leonard, who evaluated
North Dakota's coal resources almost single-handedly, resource evaluations were
generalized and did not consider the details of coal bed correlation.<p>
     North Dakota coal is exclusively lignite, which occurs predominantly in Paleocene
strata in the western half of the state.  Lignite beds are interbedded with unconsolidated
to semiconsolidated claystones, siltstones, and sandstones, along with a few isolated
limestones.  These strata were derived from a variety of freshwater and marginal
marine environments.  The Paleocene section in North Dakota is made up mainly of the
Fort Union Group (= Formation of USGS usage), which includes in ascending order
the following formations:  1) The nonmarine Ludlow Formation, representing the basal
Paleocene unit in North Dakota, which has, in some areas, a thick coal at its top; 2)
The nonmarine Slope Formation (= upper Ludlow of the USGS), which contains
several coal beds and intercalates with the marginal marine and marine Cannonball
Formation (locally, well-correlated coals are found subjacent to tongues of the
Cannonball in western North Dakota); 3) The nonmarine Bullion Creek Formation (=
Tongue River of others), which contains mined coals in its lower portion, but has coal
beds throughout its thickness; and 4) The Sentinel Butte Formation, which also contains
important mined coal beds in north-central North Dakota.  The Fort Union Group
attains a maximum thickness of 568 m (1879 ft) (Carlson, 1985) near the center of the
Williston Basin in western North Dakota.  The most extensive exposures of Fort Union
strata occur in the drainages of the Missouri and Little Missouri Rivers.  Thus most
sedimentological and coal stratigraphic studies and nomenclature have been derived
from surface-based research.  Regional coal correlation problems will, however, be
resolved from a knowledge of subsurface coal stratigraphy.<p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

     For the purposes of the NCRDS program, the objective of this research was to compile
and annotate previously reported lignite observations in southwestern North Dakota,
focusing specifically on Bowman County.<p>


<h3>Results</h3>

     To date, a total of 711 surface and subsurface observations have been recorded for
Bowman County.  Previous work for the NCRDS program by Craig Schmit (EERC)
reported on the unpublished location and lignite beds of 440 of the 586 subsurface
records currently documented.  The locations of all observations were evaluated on
USGS 7.5-minute (1:24,000) topographic maps and digitized.  Locations were digitized
using the geographic information system program Atlas GIS<sup>TM</sup> (by Strategic
Mapping,
Inc.).  Reference, location, and stratigraphic data were computerized and entered in
EERC databases.  Using the relational database management program Access&reg; (by
Microsoft Corporation), reference and location data are merged with the geologic
section descriptions (LNO and MNO databases, respectively) into forms designed in the
NCRDS format.  The accompanying NCRDS form for measured Section M7775
represents a coal section made in 1952 in what was then the north wall of the Peerless
mine (Kepferle, 1955; Location 93).  Kepferle (1955) identified the three lignite beds
in the section as the Harmon lignite, which Leonard (1925) identified as the Scranton. 
As noted, compilations that reevaluate and reinterpret previous observations establish
precedent for consistent nomenclatural usage.<p>

<title>Red River Riparian Demonstration Project</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg"><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Red River Riparian Demonstration Project</h2> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2> 

     Riparian (streamside) wetland areas are valuable habitats and function to protect and enhance
water quality.  These ecosystems provide optimum food for stream communities and purify water by
removing sediments and non-point-source pollution.  <p>
<p>
     Riparian buffer strips will be restored at four research sites.  Restoration will include planting a
mixture of grasses and woody vegetation to decrease hydrologic sediment and nutrient inputs. 
Grazing will be restricted at some of the sites to promote vegetation growth and bank stabilization. 
Site monitoring will include a vegetation inventory and photo-point documentation to assess buffer
strip restoration during the project.  <p>
<p>
     Ground- and surface water interactions will be studied at two localities within one of the riparian
sites.  One area has been severely impacted by grazing, whereas the other exhibits a healthy,
undisturbed riparian ecosystem.  Fluxes of water, solutes, and fauna will characterize the
groundwater-stream water interface.  Meiofauna (stream invertebrates) will be identified and used as
bioindicators to determine community health at both riparian localities.<p>
   <p>
<h2>Objectives</h2> 
     The objectives of this research project are to identify and demonstrate Best
Management Practices (BMPs) by restoring riparian areas and subsequently
reducing non-point-source pollution and to transfer this technology to
producers and natural resource professionals throughout North Dakota.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2> 
     Riparian plantings are scheduled for the summer of 1995 at the four test sites. 
Instrumentation for the meiofauna investigation was initiated in May 1995.  Prior to
planting, sediment cores from this site were collected and described.  This information will
be used to assess the effects of riparian buffer strip restoration.<p>

<title>The Palenontology and Stratigraphy of the Uper
Cretaceous and Paleocene of the Mahajanga Basin,
Northwestern Madagascar</title>

<center><h2> The Palenontology and Stratigraphy of the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene of the
Mahajanga Basin,
Northwestern Madagascar </h2> 
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The origins of marsupial and placental mammals have not been well delineated by the
extensive research of paleontologists in the well-exposed strata of the Upper Cretaceous
of the Western Interior of North America and Mongolia.  Thus the hypothesis has been
put forward that the transition record from Early Cretaceous pantotheres to many
modern mammal groups took place during the Late Cretaceous on the Gondwanan
continents of Australia, India, Madagascar, Africa, South America, and/or Antarctica. 
The Late Cretaceous record of mammals from India includes a couple of teeth,
suggesting an affinity with Laurasian or northern hemisphere forms.  The relatively
rich South American record appears highly endemic, indicating isolation from
Laurasian faunas, and, therefore, not directly related to the major lines of mammalian
evolution.  No Late Cretaceous mammals were known from Africa, Australia,
Antarctica, or Madagascar.  Previous explorations in Madagascar by French and
Japanese paleontologists did not discover mammals, but other vertebrate fossils were
found in some abundance and diversity, suggesting, along with the record in India, that
mammals should or might be present.  In addition to these considerations, the diverse
and endemic subfossil and modern-day occurrence of lemurs in Madagascar strongly
indicates that these primates existed in Madagascar well before their oldest fossil record
of about 8000 years. <p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

     This investigation of Malagasy fossils and strata was undertaken to discover
additional records of Late Cretaceous mammals in the southern hemisphere
and place these finds into a litho- and chronostratigraphic context.  <p>

<h3>Results</h3>
     As a result of support from a "Small Grant for Exploratory Research" from the National
Science Foundation, a 6-week expedition was undertaken to northwestern Madagascar. 
Previous work by Malagasy paleontologists and stratigraphers had indicated the existence
of Upper Cretaceous rocks of nonmarine origin in the Mahajanga (Majunga) Basin.  These
strata were interpreted by Besairie and Collignon (1972) as Campanian in age and that
they were overlain by marine strata of Maastrichtian (uppermost Cretaceous) and Danian
(Lower Paleocene) age.  Through the course of field studies near the village of Berivotra,
a single mammalian tooth was discovered in strata referred to as the Maevarano
Formation (part of the Campanian map unit of C<sup>8-6</sup> of the Majunga-Ambalakida
geologic
quadrangle, 1960, produced by the Service de G&eacute;ologique).  The discovery of this tooth
was announced by Dr. David W. Krause at the Fourth Congress of the European Society
of Evolution and Biology in Montpellier, France, at the annual meeting of the Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology in Albuquerque (Krause, 1993; Krause and others, 1993) and in
<i>Nature</i> (Krause and others, 1994).  In addition to the surface-picked mammal tooth, bulk
samples, representing the screened concentrate from approximately 20 m<sup>3</sup> of
sediment,
were taken at three localities.  Individual Cretaceous mammal teeth are very small (1 to 2
mm) and are typically discovered through the examination of sediment with the use of a
microscope.  Bulk samples will hopefully contain additional evidence of Late Cretaceous
mammals in Madagascar.<p>

     Besides the oldest record of mammals in Madagascar by 70 million years, the crew also
discovered about 100 fossil localities that yielded many important nonmammalian
vertebrates and invertebrates.  Significant vertebrate finds include the collection of bony
fishes, sharks, rays, frogs, turtles, snakes, lizards, mesosuchian and eosuchian crocodiles,
and theropod and sauropod dinosaurs.  Besides the additions to the described vertebrate
fauna of the Campanian Marovoay and Maevarano Formations, many of the specimens
collected in 1993 represent the only existing specimens for a number of taxa.  Many of the
smaller specimens reposited in Madagascar by the French and Japanese are lost through
inadequate collection management.<p>

     In addition to the vertebrates, a number of invertebrate specimens were collected.  From
the beds of the Maevarano Formation, the first record of bivalved arthropods, known as
conchostracans, and nonmarine bivalves and snails were discovered.  Marine invertebrates
were found in some abundance in the overlying strata of the Berivotra Formation and
overlying unnamed map unit assigned to the Danian.  Collections are dominated by
mollusks, including neogastropod snails, gryphaeid, ostreid, and other bivalves, and
ammonite cephalopods.  Collections also include a number of echinoderms, represented
mostly by echinoids.<p>

     Fossil localities where located using a global positioning system (GPS).  In addition to
these observations, a number of GPS fixes were taken on formational contacts, photo
locations, and cultural features, such as kilometer posts, survey markers, and bridges. 
With satellite reception being generally available without difficulty, GPS technology
proved an invaluable tool for the location data gathering.  This information was imported
into geographic information system (GIS) programming (Atlas GIS<sup>TM</sup> by Strategic
Mapping, Inc.) to construct and revise previously published maps.<p>

     Field studies also resulted in an initial revision of the lithostratigraphy in the Berivotra
area.  Formational boundaries and nomenclature were reevaluated through the course of
the placement of fossil localities relative to formational contacts.  This effort will lead to
the determination of possible formational stratotypes to reform the admixture of
lithostratigraphic and geochronologic units traditionally employed in the Malagasy
literature (i.e., time or time-rock units used as map units in a vague formational
connotation).  As a result of 1993 collections,  studies are also under way that assess the
specific age of the Upper Cretaceous strata.  Vertebrate and invertebrate fossils from the
Marovoay and Maevarano Formations are being studied to compare them to faunas
elsewhere to directly interpret the age of the enclosing strata.  Fossils from the overlying
marine Berivotra Formation will be used to place a "youngest" age on the underlying
nonmarine strata.  Rock samples taken through the Berivotra Formation are being
analyzed for their paleomagnetic signature.  The resulting reversal stratigraphy will be
correlated with the global marine standards to provide an additional means to date the
nonmarine and marine sequence.<p>

<title>Timing of the Deposition of Uppermost Cretaceous
and Paleocene Coal-Bearing Deposits in the Greater

<h2>Timing of the Deposition of Uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene Coal-Bearing Deposits in
the Greater
Glendive Area, Montana and North Dakota </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Changes in paleoclimate and paleofloral patterns and past land and water configurations
produced both temporally and paleogeographically different coal depositional histories. 
The effective and efficient utilization of coal resources depends on accurate
characterization, which is best accomplished with a knowledge of a coal's geologic
setting.  To date, coal analysis and coal resource assessments have only rudimentarily
considered the temporal context of coal deposits from one coal-producing region to
another, thus significantly limiting our ability to interpret the regional geologic and
paleoenvironmental settings of coal occurrence.  In addition, coal composition and
quality are documented largely as analytical results without reference to their
stratigraphic correlation or paleoenvironmental significance.  Without temporal and
geologic context, coal sample characterizations have been treated as isolated
observations, which are generally incapable of providing information that can lead to
the determination of regional trends in coal distribution, geochemistry, preservation,
and thickness.  Expensive drilling programs provide valuable coal correlation data, but
provide no understanding of the timing of coal deposition.  Without temporal control,
the correlation and characterization of coal-forming environments may erroneously
compare coals originating at different times, which will necessarily result in inaccurate
resource interpretations.  Presently, an understanding of trends in coal quality is made
almost impossible by the absence of temporal and paleoenvironmental context for
many, if not most, coal sample observations in the Fort Union Coal Region (Hartman,
1992).<p>
     This jointly sponsored research program supports a number of activities that directly
bear on providing a more thorough understanding about the timing of sedimentation
through the transition from the Cretaceous to Tertiary (K/T) periods.  This time
boundary is well known to the scientific community and general public because of its
association with the extinction of the dinosaurs (and many other plant and animal
groups) and possible bolide (large meteor) impact(s).  The transition from Cretaceous
to Tertiary strata is also coincident with the onset of extensive coal-forming
paleoenvironments in many areas in the northern plains.  In the Glendive area, the
sequence of formations exposed along the Yellowstone River and its tributaries are (in
ascending order) the Fox Hills, Hell Creek, Ludlow, Slope, and Tongue River
Formations.  In this area, the K/T boundary is relatively accurately marked by a bed,
known as the contact coal, occurring at the contact between the Hell Creek and
overlying Ludlow Formations.  A working "field" definition to stratigraphically locate
the beginning of the Tertiary has been based on determining the occurrence of the
lowest, laterally persistent coal bed occurring above the highest dinosaur fossils. 
Present studies indicate this field method works well in the Glendive area.  Current
geological practice delimits the K/T boundary on the presence and absence of certain
palynomorphs in conjunction, where possible, with an anomalously high concentration
of iridium.  Even with these criteria and the generally well-marked lithic differences
between formations, the reasons for the change from noncoal to coal-forming
paleoenvironments is not well understood.<p>
     Following the extinction of dinosaurs at or near the end of the Cretaceous,
mammals underwent a major radiation during the Paleocene (about 10 million
years in duration) to form the lineages that will give rise to all of the major
mammalian groups living today.  The Paleocene also represents a time of major
peat accumulation, yielding the vast lignite and subbituminous coal reserves of
the Western Interior of North America.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     This research was concerned with the determination of the timing of coal deposition in
the Fort Union Coal Region, as developed in Glendive and adjacent areas in Montana
and North Dakota.  The project objective was to develop a framework that allows for
the temporal comparison of coal deposits and, thus, the occurrence of coal-forming
conditions, through the transition from strata largely barren of coal in the Hell Creek
Formation into the coal-bearing strata of the Ludlow and Slope Formations in the Fort
Union Coal Region.  The development of a regional coal chronostratigraphic
framework permits both local and regional interpretations of the paleoenvironmental
conditions leading to coal formation.  An understanding of the controlling factors of
coal quality and thickness contributes significantly to effective resource evaluation and
utilization.  <p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Ongoing research (Hartman, 1991a, b; Hartman and Kihm, 1991; Kihm and Hartman,
1991; Hartman and Kihm, 1992) has provided chronostratigraphic control for various
portions of the Fort Union Group in the Fort Union Coal Region.  To date, most of this
research has focused on coal-bearing deposits of the middle and upper Paleocene.  This
collaborative research project, with Dr. David W. Krause of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, was focused on the transition from environments essentially devoid
of peat accumulations to those in which peat-forming areas are an important component of
the paleoenvironment.  Very frequently, this transition is lithostratigraphically marked by a
laterally extensive coal bed, such as the Z coal (or coal bed complex) in the western
portion of the Fort Union Coal Region.  This bed and its stratigraphic equivalents appear
to represent a very nearly isochronous horizon, as indicated by paleontological and
geochemical data.  In the area of Glendive, the coal near the K/T boundary is referred to
as the contact coal, in reference to its placement at the contact between the Hell Creek and
Ludlow Formations.  The K/T transition in the Fort Union Coal Region is, however, quite
controversial and far from being understood precisely, because of problems interpreting
the stratigraphic setting due, in part, to incomplete or complex geologic sections.  The
geologic section of the Makoshika State Park was chosen, in part, because the
stratigraphy representing the K/T transition is sufficiently complete to avoid the
controversies often associated with the proper sequencing of fossil occurrences and
paleomagnetic samples in less continuous sequences.<p>
     Research has resulted in the recognition of the K/T boundary on the basis of pollen in two
stratigraphic sections in Makoshika State Park in Dawson County, Montana (Kroeger and
others, 1993).  Associated with this research was the discovery of a fern spike.  The brief
dominance of ferns is believed to represent the rapid flourishing of opportunistic species
after the "catastrophic destruction of existing plant communities" (Fleming and Nichols,
1990), followed by reintroduction of angiosperm taxa that soon diminish the significance
of ferns in the Paleocene paleoflora.  In the Makoshika sections, the palynomorph-based
recognition of the K/T boundary and fern spike occur just below (5 to 25 cm) the lignite
used to stratigraphically mark the contact between the Hell Creek and overlying Ludlow
Formations.<p>
     Ongoing studies have resampled and discovered uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene
mammalian and molluscan fossil localities in the greater Glendive area.  Mammals are
known from the uppermost Cretaceous Muddy Tork (L6205) and QV (L6261) localities
and the early and middle Paleocene Hiatt (L5418) and School Well (L6256) localities. 
The most important nonmarine molluscan occurrences are Localities L6206, L6207, and
the School Well locality (L6256).  Also found was a single, poor impression of a
freshwater clam (L6260) from beds directly overlying the Contact coal.  In addition to the
temporal control that will be provided by the fossils, paleomagnetic samples have been
collected in the geologic section that includes the fern spike.  These samples will be
analyzed for paleomagnetic signature by Dr. Steven P. Lund of the University of Southern
California.  Using biochronologic control provided by the palynomorph, mammalian, and
molluscan fossils, the paleomagnetic reversal stratigraphy will be interpreted for
Makoshika State Park.  A well-founded paleomagnetic section will provide the
opportunity to correlate the sequence of fossils and coal beds in the greater Glendive area
with other similar paleomagnetic studies elsewhere in the United States and Canada.<p>

<title>Biochronology and Evolution of Latest Cretaceous

<h2> Biochronology and Evolution of Latest Cretaceous and Paleocene Nonmarine Mollusca of the Northern
Great Plains: The Riverside Locality of North Dakota </h2> </center> 
<hr>
 <h3>Background</h3>
     The precision to which the geologic record can be interpreted and understood is limited
only by our ability to resolve time in earth history.  The resolving power for geological
interpretation is based on the quality and quantity of paleontological observations in any
given stratigraphic section.  Nonmarine mollusks are among the most abundant animal
macrofossils in the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene sedimentary record of western
North America and, along with other fossil groups, make possible the correlation of
geologic events and previous earth configurations within relatively narrow time
constraints.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3> 
     The overall objective of this project was to construct a nonmarine molluscan
biostratigraphic zonation of uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene strata in the
northern Great Plains.  Research specifically concerned the cocorrelation of
molluscan and mammalian localities and their constituent taxa through the
Lancian (uppermost Cretaceous), Puercan, Torrejonian, Tiffanian, and
Clarkforkian (lower, middle, upper, and uppermost Paleocene, respectively) in
portions of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota, northeastern
Montana, and southern Saskatchewan; the Powder River Basin in northeastern
Wyoming and southeastern Montana; and the Crazy Mountains Basin of
south-central Montana.  Studies also included research on the character of the
transition of nonmarine molluscan faunas through the end of the Paleocene
and into the Lower Eocene.  This work encompassed faunas from the Powder
River and Williston Basins and northern Bighorn Basin of northwestern
Wyoming and south-central Montana.  Each area contains strata and fossils
that best define or delimit a particular portion of the overall span of geologic
time.  Sufficient overlap exists between each area to provide a composite
biostratigraphically controlled biochronology for nonmarine mollusks for the
northern Great Plains.  <p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Studies focused on establishing the stratigraphic distribution, geologic context,
and correlation with mammalian local faunas of molluscan localities and taxa
in the northern plains.  The results of research undertaken on the Riverdale
Locality are given here as an example of the nature of studies undertaken to
construct a nonmarine molluscan biostratigraphic zonation.  This locality was
selected for review because its analysis is both typical of work on many
localities, but also unusual in its individual significance and collecting history.<p>
     The original Riverdale Locality (L1) was discovered by vacationers in the early
1960s on the shores of Lake Sakakawea near Riverdale in McLean County,
North Dakota.  Although this fossil occurrence has been known primarily for
its well-preserved skull of the mammal, <i>Titanoides primaevus</i> (Gidley), a few
interesting terrestrial mollusks and mammal teeth were part of the original
collections (Holtzman, 1978; Hartman, 1976).  The Riverdale Locality was
subsequently destroyed by water being trapped by the Riverdale Dam, but low
lake levels of the late 1980s exhumed a comparable molluskiferous lithology at
slightly higher elevations at the same location in the Sentinel Butte Formation. 
The Riverdale sites discovered over the last few years (e.g., L5507 and L6200)
are stratigraphically slightly above the original Riverdale Locality.  What
distinguishes the combined Riverdale local fauna from other northern plains
localities of similar age is its diverse pulmonate assemblage (air-breathing
mollusks).  An average number of species at a Paleocene locality in the Fort
Union Coal Region is about four, typically representing an assemblage of
freshwater snails (mesogastropods) and clams (unionids).  In contrast, the Riverdale fossil assemblage
contains at least 26 taxa and is dominated by aquatic and terrestrial pulmonates.  The investigation of this
terrestrial mollusk portion of the assemblage is undertaken in collaboration with Dr. Barry Roth, an associate
of the Museum of Paleontology of the University of California at Berkeley.  Many, if not most, of the taxa, are
undescribed.  The named taxa, <i>Viviparus leai</i>, <i>V. retusus</i>, <i>Grangerella mcleodensis</i>, and
New Genus T <i>planoconvexa</i> indicate a late Paleocene age (Hartman and others, 1993).  In addition, the
terrestrial assemblage is remarkable in that it shares no taxa in common with the middle late Paleocene-age
(Tiffanian 3 biochron) Judson local fauna from near the Slope-Bullion Creek formational contact in Morton
County, North Dakota.  The record of <i>G. mcleodensis,</i> known previously from Paleocene formations of
Alberta, is its first report in the United States.  The record of New Genus T <i>planoconvexa</i> is its first
report in North Dakota since it was first described in 1857 from the Sentinel Butte Formation near Fort
Berthold on the Missouri River by Meek and Hayden (1860).  <p>   

     A preliminary evaluation of slightly younger molluscan assemblages dominated
by terrestrial taxa in the latest Paleocene (Clarkforkian 2) of the Hoback Basin,
northwestern Wyoming (Barry Roth, 1994, written comm.), and the latest
Paleocene and early Eocene (Clarkforkian and Wasatchian) of the northern
Bighorn Basin (Hartman, 1993; Hartman and Roth, in progress) suggests
virtually no species in common with the Riverdale Locality (Tiffanian 4).  The
temporal control on the molluscan record is on the basis of a revised
interpretation of the ages of the mammalian localities in North Dakota
(Hartman and Kihm, 1991; Kihm and Hartman, 1991; Hartman and others,
1993; Kihm, 1993).  The distinctiveness of the molluscan faunas through time
is significant and indicates that apparently dramatic changes began to occur in
the composition of molluscan assemblages and evolutionary lineages in the
later part of the Paleocene in the northern plains.  These changes are probably
associated with a change from subtropical to more temperate conditions.  This
transition to a terrestrially dominated molluscan fauna may be foreshadowed
by the generally terrestrial nature of the older middle Paleocene (Torrejonian)
molluscan fauna to the south in the Nacimiento Formation of the San Juan
Basin of New Mexico (Hartman, 1981).<p>

<h2>Subsurface Remediation Technology Research and Demonstration </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Recognizing the potential impacts of sour gas plant operations on the subsurface
environment, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), formerly the
Canadian Petroleum Association (CPA), and Environment Canada initiated a
multiphase investigation focusing on research related to the development and
demonstration of remedial technologies for soil and groundwater contamination at these
facilities.  The first phase of the project was completed in 1990 and consisted of a
comprehensive review of all soil and groundwater monitoring data submitted to Alberta
Environment by sour gas plants in accordance with the Canadian Clean Water Act
(1980).  That review indicated that all but one of the 45 sour gas plants for which data
were available exhibited some form of impact on soil and groundwater quality.  The
investigation identified the most frequently occurring contamination situations at the
sites and classified them according to sources and types of contaminants and the
hydrogeological characteristics of the contaminated setting.  The project steering
committee subsequently selected the Strachan Gas Plant, located near Rocky Mountain
House, Alberta, as a field research and remediation technology demonstration site.<p>

<p>
    The next phase of the work consisted of a detailed review of available subsurface
remedial technologies that could be applied to specifically identified problems. 
Established and innovative technologies were assessed, and those with the most promise
for dealing with the type of contamination situations at sour gas-processing facilities
were recommended for further development and/or demonstration.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     This current research is being conducted in response to the direction provided    in the
previous phases.  The overall objective is to assist industry in selecting and applying
remediation technologies that will most efficiently, effectively, and economically solve
their subsurface contamination problems at the sites in question.  This will be
accomplished by demonstrating not only appropriate new technologies and techniques,
but also approach and methodology.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3> Bioventing</h3>
<p>

     The EERC is working jointly on this task with Komex International, Inc., of Calgary,
Alberta, Canada.  Bioventing is the process of enhancing in situ, aerobic
biodegradation of contaminants in the unsaturated zone by providing oxygen to the
subsurface.  Field demonstrations at the Strachan Gas Plant have indicated significant
increases in rates of contaminant biodegradation through bioventing.<p>
<p>
     Two types of bioventing tests were performed.  The objective of the first bioventing
test was to determine the optimum air extraction rate at which biodegradation was
maintained and volatilization was minimized. During the test period, biodegradation
accounted for significantly greater mass removal, with approximately 1150 kg of hydrocarbons removed by
volatilization as opposed to an estimated 11,800 kg of hydrocarbons removed by biodegradation.<p>
<p>
     The second test consisted of respiration testing during the winter, where the
biodegradation rate was determined by monitoring the oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production rates.  Biodegradation rates were substantial, averaging
approximately 200 kg of hydrocarbon biodegraded per day, throughout the winter
months when subsurface temperatures dropped from 9&#176; to 4&#176; C. <p>

<h3> Ex Situ Bioremediation of Groundwater</h3>
<p>

     Biological treatment of groundwater is used to remove organic compounds and certain
inorganic compounds through biochemical oxidation to carbon dioxide, water, and
other end products.  Bench-scale treatability testing of groundwater samples collected
from the Strachan site showed that effective groundwater treatment was feasible using a
two-stage attached-growth system in a coupled nitrification-denitrification
configuration.  At the bench scale, the system did not require pretreatment to control
scale formation and equipment fouling associated with air-stripping operations.  The
system exhibited high removals of biodegradable organics and ammonia.<p>
<p>
     Beginning in the spring of 1995, pilot-scale groundwater treatability will be conducted
using the coupled nitrification-denitrification concept.  The goals of pilot-scale testing
are to demonstrate the efficacy of the biological treatment system under field
conditions, obtain process performance data under a range of hydraulic and
contaminant-loading conditions, and provide a preliminary economic evaluation.<p>
<p>
<h3> Laboratory Assessment of In Situ Bioremediation</h3> 
<p>
     The overall goal of this task was to determine conditions under which the rate and
extent of microbial degradation of hydrocarbon compounds within contaminated soils
could be enhanced.  The results of this work could then be used to assist in selecting
operating conditions for technologies to be applied for remediation of subsurface
contamination at natural gas-processing facilities.<p>

     Aerobic and anoxic respirometry tests were conducted using contaminated soil samples
collected from a depth of 6 meters at the Strachan Gas Plant.  A statistical analysis was
performed using sample carbon dioxide production results to determine the overall
effectiveness of each test parameter in conjunction with all other parameters.  The
parameters evaluated included temperature, moisture content, and nutrient addition for
aerobic respirometry testing and temperature, nutrient addition, and nitrate addition for
anoxic respirometry testing.  Gas chromatographic analyses were conducted on the
samples to verify the degree of contaminant destruction.<p>
<p>
     Significant reductions of petroleum hydrocarbons were observed under a variety of
conditions and enhancements.  Temperature showed the greatest effect in contaminant
degradation under aerobic conditions.  While this is not surprising, it does indicate that
the subsurface microorganisms are not strict psychrophyles (cold-loving bacteria) and
that thermal enhancements would be expected to dramatically increase the rate and
extent of hydrocarbon degradation during bioventing.<p>
<p>
     Moisture content also influenced the rate of contaminant biodegradation under aerobic
conditions, but to a limited extent under the conditions tested.  Nutrient levels did not
appear to have a significant effect on biodegradation rates, except under low-temperature conditions.  At
7&#176;C, the average subsurface temperatureat the Strachan Gas Plant, the highest rates of
biodegradation were associated with samples incubated under conditions where moisture and nutrients were
the highest.<p>
<p>
    Samples incubated under anoxic, nitrate-reducing conditions exhibited biodegradation
rates comparable to those observed under aerobic conditions.  Anoxic samples had
hydrocarbon removals of greater than 90% after 90 days of incubation.  Anoxic
respirometry data suggest that nitrate addition to the subsurface could also be a viable
enhancement to bioremediation.<p>
<p>
<h3> Freeze Crystallization</h3> </font> 
<p>
     Freeze crystallization is a physical treatment process that uses freezing to concentrate
and remove contaminants from water.  As the contaminated water is gradually frozen,
pure water ice crystals are formed and removed, while contaminants are concentrated in
the remaining solution.  An artificial freeze crystallization process was developed under
subcontract to Resource Technology Corporation of Laramie, Wyoming.  A 6-gal/hr
prototype unit has been designed, fabricated, and shaken down.<p>
<p>
     Shakedown testing has shown the system to be capable of effectively concentrating both
organic and inorganic contaminants.  Field testing at the Strachan Gas Plant began June
1995.

<title>Analytical Methods Development: Center for Air Toxic
Metals Program Area 2</title>

<center>
<h1>Analytical Methods Development: Center for Air Toxic Metals Program Area 2 </h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2> 
     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the Energy &amp; Environmental Research
Center (EERC) of the University of North Dakota (UND) emphasizes research,
development, demonstration, and commercialization of innovative environmental
cleanup technologies through partnerships between government, industry, and the
EERC in the areas of applied science and engineering.  CATM was established by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is focused on minimizing the effects
of air toxic metal pollutants on the environment.  The Clean Air Act Amendments
(CAAA) of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing 189 substances, including air
toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM is working with industry and
government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a scientific
basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate and impacts
of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  CATM-related programs
are focused on the development of methods to minimize the release of air toxic metals
via practical prevention and control methods based on scientific understanding and
principles.  To facilitate research efforts and dissemination of information, CATM is
organized into five integrated program areas:  Program Area 1 - Air Toxic Metals
Transformation Mechanisms, Program Area 2 - Analytical Methods Development,
Program Area 3 - Control Technologies, Program Area 4 - Modeling and Database,
and Program Area 5 - Technology Commercialization and Education. <p>
<p>
     When the CAAA were released, little up-to-date information on the behavior of trace
metals in energy systems was available, partly because of the inadequacy of the existing
analytical techniques.  Program Area 2 is aimed at developing sufficiently versatile
instrumentation methods with the appropriate sampling procedures to detect and
quantitatively measure atomic and molecular species, solid or gaseous, that are present
at a variety of locations throughout bench-, pilot-, and commercial-scale conversion
systems.  Trace metals that are most likely to be subjected to increased regulatory
control, such as mercury, are emphasized. <p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The major objective of CATM Program Area 2 is to advance the understanding of the
transformation of major, minor, and trace inorganic species associated with fuels and
wastes during combustion and pollution control processes.  The steps chosen toward
meeting that goal include determining the abundance and association of trace metals in
fuels and wastes and in combustion, incineration, and gasification products; developing
a continuous emission monitor to make on-line measurements of solid and gaseous
atomic and molecular species in process streams; and developing quality control "flags"
to use in assessing data.<p>
<p>
     Program Area 2 efforts were initially planned by discussing analytical needs with
investigators working under other program areas.  The approach is two-pronged:  1)
analytical methods suitable for determining a wide range of the trace metals identified
in the CAAA will be identified, with the intent of obtaining basic information useful     in
initial investigations of substances of possible concern and 2) once an element of
particular interest has been identified, efforts will focus on determining the best
methods for measuring it in all of its forms.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2> <p>
     In response to industry's need for convenient, real-time mercury measurements, CATM
has devoted a major part of its Program Area 2 efforts to the evaluation and
development of an on-line mercury analyzer.  Of the several possible approaches, an
ultraviolet (UV) absorption technique appears to be the most promising.  An on-line
UV analyzer with detection limits of approximately 0.3 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> has been developed at
the EERC.  The analyzer is intended to provide an easy-to-use alternative to EPA
Method 29.  The analyzer has initially been developed to detect vapor-phase elemental
mercury (Hg<SUP>0</SUP>) in a flue gas environment.  The mercury analyzer was
tested using a permeation tube Hg<sup>0</sup> source.  A known, calibrated mercury source of
very low concentration is critical to the successful development of the analyzer.  The
permeation tube source is calibrated in terms of mass lost per unit time, in this case
835 ng/min.  The rate of mercury emission from the source is very sensitive to
temperature, and so a water bath is used to maintain the permeation tube at a constant
temperature of 100&#176;C.  Exact measurement of gas flow rates is also critical to proper
operation of the analyzer.  A bubble flowmeter is used to measure flow rates to within
&#177;0.01 cm<sup>3</sup>/min.  The next phase of this work will be development of the capability for
differentiation of Hg<SUP>0</sup> and mercury compounds.<p>
 <p>
     Manufactured mercury analyzers have also been investigated for possible use with flue
gas.  Although a number of commercial mercury analyzers are available, none
presently is capable of tolerating the wide ranges of temperature and atmosphere found
in a power plant environment, while simultaneously achieving the low detection limits
necessary for flue gas monitoring.  Most mercury analyzers designed to monitor
ambient air have the requisite detection limits, but cannot tolerate a hot, dirty boiler
setting.  Investigations of several promising commercial mercury analyzers are ongoing
at the EERC.<p>
<p>
     In order to better understand the behavior of trace metals during fuel conversion, it is
necessary to comprehend their form of occurrence in coal, ash, and other fuels and
wastes.  Several analytical methods have been tested and applied for this purpose. 
Three coals, Blacksville bituminous and Absaloka and Comanche subbituminous, and
ten corresponding ash samples produced in pilot-scale combustion testing were used for
development of the analytical methods.<p>
<p>
     Energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis shows that the three coals are
generally similar in their major element compositions.  Wavelength-dispersive x-ray
fluorescence, a technique being developed specifically for measurement of trace metals
in coals, ashes, sorbents, and other materials, however, showed differences in the Cr,
Ni, and Pb levels in the Absaloka, Blacksville, and Comanche coals.  The Absaloka
sample is highest in Nix (15 ppm) and in Pb (8 ppm).  The Blacksville sample is highest
in Cr (14 ppm).  Cr is thought to occur in similar mineral associations as does Hg, and
thus the elevated level of Cr in the Blacksville coal corresponds to the greater amounts
of Hg associated with minerals in that fuel.<p>
<p>
     Individual mineral grain analyses of the four coal samples were obtained using
computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy.  Blacksville coal contains the
highest levels of iron oxide (4.6 wt%), pyrite (26.2 wt%), pyrrhotite (3.1 wt%), and
oxidized pyrrhotite (6.1 wt%).  These minerals are associated with Hg, As, Cr, and
other trace metals, as determined using scanning electron microscopy with wavelength-dispersive
spectrometry, a technique which is being developed for determination of
trace metals in individual mineral grains in coal and ash.<p>
<p>
     Hg has also been measured in individual particles of Absaloka ash at levels of 0.01 to
0.07 wt% (on a C- and O-free basis).  Hg was found in 24% of individual ash
particles, each from 5 to 20 &#181;m in diameter.  The Hg-bearing ash particles were mainly
Ca- and Al-bearing silicates with some S present.  Hg was not detected in individual
particles in a second sample of Absaloka ash to which a lignite-based activated carbon
sorbent had been added, suggesting that the sorbent was effective in trapping Hg and
possibly other trace metals.<p>
<p>
     X-ray diffraction (XRD), used to identify crystalline phases in bulk solids, showed that
the Blacksville ash contained approximately 6 wt% hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).  Hematite
was notdetected in the Absaloka or Comanche ash samples.  Hematite and other Fe-rich
minerals such as pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) are often associated with Hg and other trace metals, and
these results thus make sense considering the higher levels of Hg found associated with
minerals in the Blacksville coal.  Major elemental data, obtained using EDXRF, show
that Blacksville ash is high in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (approximately 21 wt%), corroborating the
XRD results.

<title>Verification of Method 29 for Mercury
Speciation: Phase I</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Verification of Method 29 for Mercury Speciation: Phase I  </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments require that the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) assess the health risks associated with mercury emissions.  Therefore, it may
be necessary that mercury emissions from power plants and combustion facilities, such as
municipal solid waste incinerators, be controlled.  However, before control strategies can
be evaluated, mercury measurement methods that have been proven to be reliable and
accurate at the very low mercury concentrations found at the exit of coal combustion
power plants must be developed.  In addition, it also appears that the rate of mercury
deposition from the atmosphere and the type of control strategies used may depend upon
the type of mercury emitted (i.e., whether it is in the oxidized or elemental form).  It has
been speculated that EPA (Draft) Method 29 can speciate mercury by selective absorption;
however, this claim has yet to be proven.  The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have contracted with the EERC to evaluate EPA
(Draft) Method 29 at the pilot-scale level.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of the work is to determine whether EPA (Draft) Method 29 can reliably
quantify and speciate mercury in the flue gas from coal-fired boilers.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Bench-scale results indicate that HCl does not influence mercury speciation by EPA (Draft)
Method 29 when injecting either elemental or oxidized mercury.  At the pilot-scale level, it has
been shown that very precise mercury measurements with little bias can be obtained with EPA
(Draft) Method 29.  Also, it was found that when elemental mercury is spiked into a flue gas
stream while a medium-sulfur bituminous coal is fired, a substantial portion is collected in the
peroxide impingers.  The question, then, is whether EPA (Draft) Method 29 is speciating the
mercury correctly or some type of conversion of the elemental mercury is occurring in the flue
gas stream prior to sampling.  Further testing is necessary to answer this question.<p>

<title>Evaluation of Supercritical Fuid

<h1> Evaluation of Supercritical Fuid Extraction for Analysis of Petroleum Industry Waste </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>

     Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) provides a potentially rapid and quantitative method to
extract fuel components from complex matrices, while reducing technician time and the
production of toxic waste solvents.  Analytical-scale SFE is also useful for determining
optimal conditions for industrial processes ranging from supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning
of contaminated solids to polymer fractionation.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The use of SFE and SFE directly coupled with capillary gas chromatography (SFE-GC) for
the rapid and quantitative extraction of fuel hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a variety of important petroleum-related samples was investigated. 
Supercritical extraction utilizing CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub> containing
organic modifiers under
different pressure/temperature conditions was optimized for samples ranging from the
extraction of fuel components from contaminated soils, to diesel oil in drilling muds, to
heteroatom-containing aromatics on poisoned catalysts.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Quantitative SFE methods were developed and successfully tested to determine total petroleum
hydrocarbons (TPHs), BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), PAHs, and
heteroatom-containing PAHs in petroleum industry wastes.  SFE conditions were developed
that were appropriate for extracting a broad range of solids, including soils and sediments,
waste sludges, drilling muds, and source rock.  SFE gave quantitative recovery of organic
pollutants in less than 30 minutes (compared to conventional methods requiring several hours)
and reduced or eliminated the use of hazardous organic solvents.  An on-line SFE-GC method
was developed for volatile and semivolatile fuel components (gasoline to diesel range) that
yields ppb sensitivities and eliminates all solvent usage.  SFE methods were also demonstrated
in the field for determining total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Peer-reviewed publications
describing the results of this investigation are available upon request.<p>

<title>Hot-Water Extraction of Nonpolar
Organic Pollutants from Soils</title>

<h1>Hot-Water Extraction of Nonpolar Organic Pollutants from Soils </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Supercritical water is an effective extraction fluid for polar and nonpolar organic pollutants, but is
corrosive and requires pressures (&gt;221 bar) and temperatures (&gt;374&#176;C) that make its use
prohibitive.  However, the attractive solvent characteristics for organic pollutants in water can be achieved at
much lower pressures (a few bars) and temperatures (e.g., &lt;250&#176;C).  Preliminary experiments have
demonstrated that many polar and nonpolar organic pollutants can be solvated in water under these
relatively mild conditions.<p> 

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The temperature and pressure ranges that can effectively use  water to extract organic pollutants
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Results demonstrated that PAHs and PCBs can be efficiently extracted from soil using pressures aslow as
50 bar and temperatures as low as 250&#176;C.  More polar pollutants can be extracted at even lower
temperatures.  When water is pressurized to the liquid state at 250&#176;C, the extraction is very selective for
PAHs, and alkanes of similar vapor pressures are not extracted.  However, when the pressure is dropped so
that the water is steam, both PAHs and alkanes are extracted.  PCBs can be extracted in as little as 5 minutes
from soil using only hot water as the extraction fluid.  This preliminary work demonstrated that hot water has
great potential for both analytical- and remediation-scale extractions of organic pollutants from soil.

<title>Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Extraction at Elevated
Temperatures</title>
</head>
<body>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1> Supercritical CO<sub>2 </sub>Extraction at Elevated Temperatures  </h1></center>
<hr>

<h2>Background</h2> 
<p>
     Extraction of organic pollutants from soils and sediments with supercritical carbon dioxide has
been shown to be greatly enhanced at higher temperatures (e.g., up to 200&#176;C).  This enhancement
was not expected since the density of the supercritical fluid drops as the temperature is raised (if
pressure remains constant).  Unfortunately, there are no solubility data in the literature for
environmental pollutants at elevated temperatures to support theoretical and engineering studies
on the use of supercritical carbon dioxide for the extraction of organic pollutants.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The solubility of several common organic pollutants in supercritical carbon dioxide will be
determined at temperatures from 50&#176; to 250&#176;C and pressures from 150 to 400 bar.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2> 
<p>
     Contrary to accepted beliefs, the solubility of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
has been shown to increase with higher temperatures much more dramatically than with higher
pressures.  For higher-molecular-weight PAHs such as benzo[<i>ghi</i>]perylene, the solubility at
conventional extraction conditions (e.g., 450 atm and 40&#176;C) is so low that efficient extraction
cannot be achieved.  However, when the temperature is raised to 250&#176;C at the same pressure, the
solubility increases by more than 1000-fold.  These results demonstrate that high-solubility
conditions can be achieved with elevated temperatures at relatively low pressures of supercritical
carbon dioxide; therefore, the use of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> for remediation and chemical synthesis
may be enhanced more by designing systems capable of higher temperatures than higher
pressures.  Peer-reviewed publications describing the results of this investigation are available
upon request.

<title>Supercritical Fluid Extraction
Methodology for Laboratory and Field
Use</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg"><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1>Supercritical Fluid Extraction Methodology <br>for Laboratory and Field Use </h1>
</center><hr>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) has the potential for providing rapid and quantitative
extraction of priority pollutants from water, soil, and air samples prior to instrumental
analysis.  SFE has the additional potential to reduce the cost and the use of toxic solvents
required by conventional U.S. Environmental Protection Agency extraction methods.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     Rapid and cost-effective methods for measuring organic pollutants in the field are needed
to provide information for emergency response to chemical spills as well as to support the
cleanup and characterization of spill and hazardous waste sites.  The mobile analysis of
pollutants in air, soil, and water samples is primarily limited by the slow and cumbersome
liquid solvent extraction methods (e.g., Soxhlet extraction) used to prepare the samples for
analysis.  In contrast, supercritical fluids have several characteristics that should make them
superior to liquid solvents for extracting analytes from environmental samples, both in the
laboratory and in the field.  SFE has been shown to yield quantitative extraction and
recovery of organic pollutants from a variety of environmental matrices, including soils, air
particulates, and sorbent resins in 10 to 30 minutes, while yielding a concentrated sample
immediately ready for analysis.  This project investigated and developed the use of SFE and
SFE coupled with gas chromatography (SFE-GC) for the rapid and quantitative extraction
and analysis of organic pollutants from environmental matrices related to chemical spills,
including soils and sediments, water, and air samples collected on resins.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     SFE methods were developed that are suitable for the extraction of many organic priority
pollutants from the samples listed above.  SFE methods were shown to be 10 to 100 times
faster to perform and virtually eliminated the need for the hazardous solvents that are
required for other extraction techniques.  SFE was demonstrated to be easily field-portable. 
Several important fundamental processes that control SFE rates from heterogeneous
environmental solids were identified and exploited to increase SFE extraction efficiencies. 
These include the following:  1) matrix-analyte interactions are often more important than
the identity of the analyte to determine extraction behavior, 2) the commonly used practice
of "spiking" studies to determine analytical extraction efficiencies is completely invalid
regardless of whether conventional liquid solvent extraction or SFE methods are used, and
3) raising temperature is the single most effective approach to increasing extraction
efficiencies of most organic pollutants from environmental solids.  Peer-reviewed
publications describing the results of this investigation are available upon request.<p>

<title>Sulfur Forms in Coal</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Sulfur Forms in Coal </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3> 
     Methods presently used to determine the forms of sulfur in coal rely heavily on indirect
measurements of the individual sulfur forms and thus result in a poor degree of
understanding of the chemical types of sulfur in various coals.  Organic sulfur, which is the
most difficult form to remove, is determined by difference, compounding all of the other
errors.  Better analytical methods are needed in order to support coal-cleaning technologies
aimed at the removal of sulfur prior to utilization.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3> 
     This investigation was a continuation of promising work to develop an analytical method
to permit direct determination of organic sulfur in coal and char.  The objectives were as
follows:<p>

<ul plain>
 <IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To develop reliable methods of quantitating the organic sulfur forms as well as
the major inorganic forms (i.e., pyrite, sulfate, sulfite, sulfide, and elemental) based on direct (not indirect or
calculated) measurements of each sulfur type.  These methods should be capable of achieving mass balance
with conventional total sulfur analysis.
<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To investigate the interconversion of sulfur forms (e.g., the possible incorporation
of elemental sulfides and polysulfides or pyritic sulfur into organic sulfur during pyrolysis) that occur during
coal processing (e.g., gasification and combustion).
</ul><p>
 <h3>Results</h3>

     Conventional ASTM methods for determining sulfur forms were found to give poor mass
balance as well as to misassign some sulfur forms (e.g., assigning elemental sulfur to the organic
fraction).  In this project, reliable methods for determining all major sulfur forms by direct
measurement were developed and validated by mass balance and sulfur isotope studies. 
Extraction with supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> followed by gas chromatography with atomic emission
detection gives accurate determinations of elemental sulfur.  Sulfatic sulfur is then extracted with
formic acid.  Next, pyritic sulfur is extracted using chromous acid (which is more specific than
the traditional nitric acid extraction).  Pyrolysis combined with supercritical fluid extraction is
used to determine the reactive organic sulfur species, and the nonreactive sulfur organic species
are determined in the residue.<p>
     The results of this work have also shown that selective removal of sulfur using combined
supercritical fluid extraction and pyrolysis can be achieved.  For example, both CO<sub>2</sub> with added
methanol and water can be used as extraction fluids to remove ca. 75% of total coal sulfur.<p>

<title>Analysis of Plastics Decompostion
Liquids</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Analysis of Plastics Decompostion Liquids  </h2> </center> 
<hr>
 <h3>Background</h3>
     The Energy and Environmental Research Corporation (EER) in Santa Ana, California, is
investigating continuous processes for the thermal depolymerization of waste plastics. 
One aspect of the research involves generation of liquids that could be processed at oil
refineries as gasoline or diesel fuel feedstocks.  This requires that the liquids meet
volatility, density, pourability, and chemical composition requirements to ensure their
compatibility with processing conditions and equipment.  One important requirement is
that feedstocks contain no more than trace levels of chlorine (maximum tolerable chlorine
levels may vary depending on upgrading conditions, but a good estimate is 200 parts per
million).  Higher concentrations of chlorine can corrode reactor components and/or
deactivate catalysts, resulting in costly repairs and replacements.  Chlorine is a component
of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which constitutes a significant portion of waste plastics
streams (PVC is used to make pipe and clear plastic bottles).  In order to effectively
develop technologies to utilize waste plastics, plastic decomposition liquid must be
characterized by analytical methods to accurately quantitate both organically and
inorganically associated chlorine that may be present in waste plastics depolymerization
products.  The EERC has the analytical capability to quantify organic chlorine in plastics
depolymerization products using gas chromatography coupled with atomic emission
detection.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this project was to quantify organic chlorine in depolymerization products
from the thermal depolymerization of waste plastics.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Organic chlorine concentrations in the EER liquids ranged from 0 to about 11,000 &#181;g/g. 
The results of the analyses also showed that the bulk (about 75%) of the organic chlorine
content in each of the liquid samples was contributed by the same five compounds
(identified by boiling point only).  The number of organic chlorine-containing compounds
detected in the samples ranged from 0 to about 75.

<title>Gas Industry Groundwater Research
Program</title>

<h1>Gas Industry Groundwater Research Program </h1> 
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Many current regulations governing waste management focus on the protection of groundwater
quality, particularly the quality of shallow groundwater, because of its significance as a source
of water for drinking and agriculture.  Gas industry activities, including exploration,
production, gas conditioning and processing, and product transmission and distribution result
in a variety of waste streams, many of which are managed at or near the earth's surface and
are, therefore, subject to those regulations.  At the same time, the shallow subsurface (up to
300 ft in depth) is the zone where adverse impacts related to gas industry wastes have most
often been observed.  In response to these observations and other pressures, stricter and
potentially more costly groundwater-related regulations are now being developed that will
likely play an increasing role in gas industry waste management issues.<p>
<p>
     In order to enable the gas industry to be responsive to, and a knowledgeable and active
participant in, relevant, evolving, waste-related groundwater issues, a long-term, laboratory-
and field-based research program has been identified as necessary. Specifically, such a
program must first develop a fundamental understanding of both gas industry wastes and
waste-site interactions with relevance to the gas industry.  In turn, this understanding must be
utilized to develop the "tools" required for the gas industry to manage its wastes in ways that
effectively protect groundwater, while at the same time being efficient and economical.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objective of the program is to undertake activities fundamental to the design and
execution of complementary laboratory and field phases of a long-term research program
focused on groundwater as it relates to gas industry waste management issues.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Activities during the last 2 years have evolved from the information/data acquisition and
evaluation phase to the integrated laboratory and field testing phase and the remediation
evaluation phase of the program.  Much of the research focus has been on mercury
contamination at gas metering sites.  The highlights of these activities are detailed below.<p>

<title>An Assessment of the Subsurface Fate of
Monoethanolamine at Sour Gas
Processing Plant Sites</title>
</head>

<h1> An Assessment of the Subsurface Fate of Monoethanolamine at Sour Gas Processing Plant Sites </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2> 
<p>
     Alkanolamines are commonly used by the natural gas industry to remove hydrogen sulfide,
carbon dioxide, and other acid gases from the natural gas in which they occur ("sour" gas if
hydrogen sulfide is present).  At sour gas processing plants, as at all plants that use
alkanolamines for acid gas removal, spills and the on-site management of wastes containing 
alkanolamines and their thermal reaction products have commonly resulted in subsurface
contamination that is the focus of some environmental concern.  Generally, adequate data exist to
confirm the presence of alkanolamines and at least some of their thermal reaction and biological
degradation products in soils, sediments, and groundwater at the sites in question.  However,
analytical and other difficulties have typically prevented the nature and extent of alkanolamine-related
contamination from being delineated in detail at individual sites.  At the same time,
limited work has been done on the behavior of the chemical species in question in the subsurface;
therefore, little is known about their subsurface transport and fate.  This places the natural gas
industry in the difficult position of having to effectively address a contamination issue that is
neither well defined nor well understood.<p>
<p>
     The research project presently under way is the initial phase of a three-phase program designed
to investigate the natural attenuation processes that control the subsurface transport and fate of
alkanolamines commonly used by the natural gas industry.  The intention is to provide the
natural gas industry with data and insights that will enable it to 1) significantly improve the
assessment of subsurface alkanolamine-related contamination at sites where it is known or
expected to occur and 2) make soundly based decisions concerning the remediation of that
contamination.<p>
<p>
     This project, which is specifically focused on monoethanolamine (MEA), includes activities that
can be grouped into three areas as follows:  1) laboratory-based activities investigating the
biological fate of MEA, 2) laboratory-based activities investigating the interaction of MEA with
soils and sediments, and 3) activities focused on adapting selected analytical capabilities,
particularly for the analysis of MEA in groundwater, soils, sediments, and various experimental
residues.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The objective of this project is to investigate the natural attenuation processes that control the
fate of MEA in an effort to provide the natural gas industry with presently unavailable data and
insights that will enable MEA-related contamination to be more effectively addressed where it is
known or suspected to occur in the subsurface.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Project activities have thus far accomplished the following:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  A series of samples for project activities have been obtained from a presently
inactive sour gas processing plant site in Alberta.  This plant has a history of MEA use for acid gas removal; is
extensively characterized in terms of geology, hydrology, and subsurface contamination; and is the present
focus of a variety of other research activities focused on the subsurface contamination that has been
observed.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Experiments designed to determine the effects of temperature and
concentration of MEA on the rate of MEA biodegradation in soil/sediment have been completed.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Experiments designed to estimate the biodegradability of organic compounds in
soil/sediment exposed to MEA-containing "sweetening" wastes have been completed.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Experiments designed to determine whether high concentrations of MEA are
toxic or inhibitory to microorganisms in soil/sediment are under way.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Experiments designed to determine the impact of alternative electron acceptors
on the biodegradation of MEA in soil/sediment are under way.  The electron acceptors being investigated are
oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, and carbonate.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The experimental design has been completed for an assessment of the role of
interactions between MEA and soil/sediment in the transport and fate of MEA in the subsurface.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Available ion chromatography (IC) capabilities have been adapted for the
quantitation of MEA in liquids at levels down to 10 ppb.  Some work has also been done on adapting these
capabilities for the quantitation of MEA thermal reaction products in liquids at ppm levels.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  An effective method for the extraction of MEA from soil, sediment, and solid
experimental residues for IC analysis has been developed.  This method involves the use of a dilute
methanesulfonic acid solution.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> A joint effort is under way with Dr. John Headley (National Hydrology Research
Institute) to compare liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry methods with IC methods for the detailed
analysis of MEA and MEA-related compounds in selected liquid and solid samples.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Selected analytical support has been provided to other investigators who are
more comprehensively evaluating the toxic effects of subsurface contaminants at the noted sour gas
processing plant site. <br>

<title>Feasability Study for Underground Coal
Gasification at the Krabi Coal Mine Site,
Thailand</title>
</head>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">

<center>
<h1>Feasability Study for Underground Coal Gasification at the Krabi Coal Mine Site, Thailand </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a clean coal technology that converts in situ coal into a
low- to medium-grade product gas, thus eliminating the expense of mining and reclamation. 
Accordingly, UCG can be used to extract energy from coal resources that are not economically
recoverable or that are otherwise unacceptable for conventional coal utilization processes. 
Conceptually simple, UCG involves drilling two or more holes into a suitable coal seam and
ensuring that the holes are "linked" by natural or induced permeability.  Injected air, oxygen,
and/or steam are used to initiate and maintain coal combustion.  The injected gases, together with
the heat produced by combustion, in turn, promote both pyrolysis and gasification of the
remaining coal.  The extracted product gas, which consists mainly of methane, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen, can be used as a fuel and/or chemical feedstock.  Critical to the successful
application of UCG are careful site selection and site-specific process design, both based on a
detailed knowledge of the site.<p>
<p>
     Research and development on UCG has taken place for more than 100 years, although
commercial application has been limited to the former Soviet Union.  However, the future of
UCG on a commercial scale will be largely based on the results of an extensive series of U.S.
field tests, most of which have been conducted since 1970.  These tests, which have focused
primarily on subbituminous and lignite coal in the western United States, culminated in the
Rocky Mountain 1 test program in south-central Wyoming.  This program, in which the EERC
was a key participant, provided a unique opportunity to assess the interrelationships between the
UCG process and the environment and resulted in insights that will significantly enhance the
technical and environmental acceptability of new commercial UCG initiatives wherever they
might be considered.<p>
<p>
     Thailand's Krabi coal deposits, which are located 620 miles (990 kilometers) south of Bangkok,
consist of five lignite-bearing areas that have been targeted for possible exploitation.  Three of
these areas (Bang Pu Dum, Bang Mark, and Wai Lek) have been surface-mined to feed a local
electric power-generating plant with an initial production capacity of 60 MW.  As coal extraction
reaches a depth of over 60 meters in the most recent mining area, Wai Lek, the limit of
economical surface mining under prevailing conditions is being reached.  In order to meet the
continued need for power in the region, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
is reviewing a number of options for power production once surface mining at Krabi ceases. 
Included among the options being considered is the utilization of gas from the in situ gasification
of the substantial coal resources that remain unmined in the five deposits.  Preliminary
indications suggest that there is significant potential for the successful application of UCG
locally, and EGAT, with funding from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA), has
selected the EERC to undertake a detailed evaluation of the feasibility of developing a
commercial-scale UCG operation utilizing Krabi coal.<p>

<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     To determine the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of developing,
demonstrating, and commercializing UCG at the Krabi mine site in southern Thailand.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     The project was initiated in January 1995 and focused on the review of readily available
geologic, hydrologic, climatic, and other information and data specific to the Krabi coal mining
area.  This review enabled the development of a preliminary work plan and schedule and
provided the basis for a trip to Thailand to discuss project details and logistics with EGAT
personnel and to make a reconnaissance visit to the Krabi area.  The principal EERC project
participants made this 2-week trip in May, following the finalization of formal agreements
involving TDA, EGAT, and the EERC.  The results of the trip are presently being used to
complete the work plan and schedule for the remaining project activities, which will include a
variety of selected site characterization activities designed to supplement existing information
and data, followed by the detailed evaluation of all relevant, site-related information and data to
determine the feasibility of applying UCG at the site.  The final project report will review the
design, conduct, and results of all project activities, and if feasibility is established, will provide
UCG process design recommendations, as well as recommendations for subsequent
demonstration activities at the site.<p>

<title>Impacts of Agricultural Chemicals on
Groundwater Quality</title>
</head>
<body>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1>Impacts of Agricultural Chemicals on Groundwater Quality </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Agriculture is a highly successful industry in the United States, with pesticides and fertilizers
playing a key role in increasing the food production and overall standard of living.  After
agricultural chemicals are applied to the landscape, their environmental fate is determined by a
number of factors, including the types of pathways into the subsurface and their potential to
transport the chemicals to groundwater.  We urgently need to identify the conditions that lead
to groundwater contamination because groundwater forms 99% of our total freshwater
supplies, with 90% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population dependent on it as
their primary supply of fresh water.<p>
<p>
     Not very long ago, the nature and extent of groundwater contamination due to agricultural
chemicals were poorly understood, and as a result, arguments were made for and against the
role of these chemicals as a source of groundwater quality problems.  With the availability of
significant new information from field research projects in the past 5 years, this picture is
becoming more clear, with both favorable and unfavorable results emerging.  Under certain
field conditions, the potential for groundwater degradation is much higher than previously
thought, and the pathways by which chemicals are transported are more varied.  Our research
program seeks to add to the information available on agricultural chemicals in groundwater
through long-term, comprehensive studies of multiple field sites in the northern Great Plains. 
This type of research program will provide a scientific basis for effectively managing these
chemicals and a model to resolve specific problems experienced by the agricultural
community.<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The overall objective of this groundwater research program is to generate information that is
needed to understand the occurrence, transport, and fate of agricultural chemicals in
representative field settings in the northern plains region.  This information will be used to
conserve and protect our vital irrigation and drinking water resources, increase agricultural
efficiency, improve chemical management practices, and provide a scientifically valid basis for
meaningful regulation of the chemicals.  The approach focuses on defining and understanding
the geologic, hydrogeologic, geochemical, and microbiological conditions and processes along
vulnerable pathways from land surfaces into the subsurface at representative field sites and the
relationship of these conditions to the transport and fate of applied chemicals.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2> 
<p>
     To date, eight field sites in the northern plains region are being examined to determine the
potential for groundwater contamination from agricultural chemicals.  These sites vary as to
geology, hydrology, climatic conditions, crops grown, and farm management practices.  Specific
factors being investigated include chemical and biological processes occurring in the subsurface
environment, effects of irrigation or type of irrigation on agricultural chemical movement, the
role of preferential flow mechanisms on pesticide transport and fate, the role of denitrification on
nitrate occurrence and fate, the function of wetlands in agricultural settings, and the importance
of focused recharge on agricultural chemical movement and resulting implications for
monitoring.  Work at the field sites is being supplemented by laboratory studies on soil
characteristics, pesticide partitioning, denitrification, and airborne particulate pesticide transport.<p>

<p>
     Key findings from the current research program significant to both the agricultural industry and
regulatory agencies are briefly summarized here.<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Nitrate contamination of groundwater is of greater concern than pesticide
contamination of groundwater in the northern plains region.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> An understanding of agricultural chemical occurrence in groundwater requires a
knowledge of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the soil affecting transport and fate, as well as
management practices and climatic factors.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Denitrification plays a significant role in the occurrence and distribution of
nitrates in aquifers in the northern plains region.  Dissolved organic matter in groundwater, normally the
limiting factor for (heterotrophic) denitrification, has been found to be sufficient to allow denitrification to
occur.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> An alternate denitrification process (autotrophic), in which inorganic compounds
serve as the electron source rather than organic matter, appears to also play a role in nitrate occurrence and
distribution.  This finding is important because it provides an additional mechanism by which nitrate may be
naturally remediated and also provides an alternate mechanism for the geochemical evolution of
groundwater.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Preferential flow studies at two of the field sites indicated this to be an important
mechanism for movement of water and contaminants.  The relative importance of preferential flow
mechanisms varied with depth at the two sites and was found to be dependent on factors such as lithology,
stratigraphy, climate, and agricultural practices.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> At a glacial till site, fractures provided the primary pathway for water movement
until textural boundaries were encountered and funnel flow became important.  Over 90% of preferential flow
occurred along fractures, with minor flow occurring along root channels and through finger flow.  Funnel flow
became important at the 2- to 4-m depth.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> At a glaciolacustrine site, about 80% of preferential flow occurred through
fractures and as finger flow to depths of approximately 80 cm.  Beyond this depth, approximately 90% of flow
was along root channels, with funnel flow also being important.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Wetlands were found to act as a barrier between nitrate-contaminated runoff
and groundwater.  Denitrification is believed to be responsible for the degradation of nitrate in the
wetlands.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Nitrate contamination was found to be associated with land use in the wetland
setting.  Nitrate-contaminated groundwater was associated with agricultural fields but not pasture lands.
<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Laboratory studies relating partitioning coefficients of pesticides to soil
characteristics indicated a good correlation between soil organic matter and Kd values.  Similar soil
samples/types gave similar analytical and Kd values, indicating good precision.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Rapid adsorption of malathion to soil was found to be followed by an increase of
malathion (or degradation products) in the water phase.  This suggests that adsorption and desorption
mechanisms need not be reversible and raises the question of which soil/water partitioning coefficients should
be used in modeling pesticide movement.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Kd values for trifluralin indicate little potential for movement through soils. 
Trifluralin occurrence in groundwater was consistent at a glaciolacustrine field site, indicating the importance
of  preferential flow at this site.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The use of flow models that do not account for preferential flow could severely
underestimate the rapidity and depth of pesticide movement in soils (e.g., trifluralin at the glaciolacustrine
site).<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Studies of pesticide transport on airborne particulates indicate this to be an
important transport mechanism.  Over a 4-year period, 22 different pesticides were detected in our sampling
program, with several being consistently found during the summer months and from year to year.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The magnitude of pesticide concentrations in airborne particulate samples would
tend to indicate that this transport mechanism could be important in the movement of contaminants to
recharge areas where groundwater could then become potentially contaminated. <br>

<h1>Nitrate Stratification in Sand Plain Groundwater Systems under Irrigated Corn Production </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Nitrate contamination of shallow aquifers continues to be an important water quality issue,
both in terms of health and as an indicator of anthropogenic impacts on groundwater.  The
goal of this research program is to understand the occurrence and distribution of nitrates in a
sand plain groundwater system under irrigated corn production.  This will provide a
scientifically valid basis upon which the best management practices can be developed and used
to avoid nitrate contamination of groundwater and provide the most productive use of the land
for agricultural crop production.<p>
<p>
    Research activities are focusing on the microbiological characterization of two sites (one with
subsurface tile drains and one without subsurface drainage) and on modeling groundwater flow
in response to subsurface drainage.  Characterization of the microbiology of the saturated zone
will allow the determination of the role of biological denitrification in controlling nitrate
contamination in the aquifer.  Modeling groundwater flow will allow the determination of the
effect of subsurface drainage on nitrate transport and fate.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     This work is part of a cooperative effort between North Dakota State University and the
EERC.  The objectives of this cooperative effort are to:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Assess the temporal and spatial variability of nitrate concentrations in
groundwater as a result of irrigation and subsurface drainage in irrigated cornfields.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Determine the effect of subsurface drainage on the distribution of nitrate in the
top 4 ft of the saturated zone.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Quantify the biological and chemical processes which control nitrate
concentration in the top 4 ft of the saturated zone in an irrigated sand plain aquifer.<br>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Instrumentation was installed at the two sites in May 1994.  Sediment cores were collected in
June 1994 to determine the different physiological groups of microorganisms present at each
site.  Water samples were collected in August 1994 and May 1995 and analyzed for biological
oxygen demand and total bacterial counts and denitrifiers.  Preliminary results are pending.

<title>Preliminary Environmental Assessment
of the Devils Lake Sioux Reservation: 
Phase I</title>

<h1>Preliminary Environmental Assessment of the Devils Lake Sioux Reservation:  Phase I </h1> 
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     In response to the short- and long-term environmental goals of the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe,
studies were initiated to evaluate the environmental impact of the municipal landfill, wastewater
treatment lagoons, and groundwater in the area of water supply wells.  The studies were to
provide factual information on the potential environmental problems associated with these
facilities.  The Phase I research effort focused on gathering baseline data to provide for the
development of a comprehensive plan designed to provide sufficient information for managing
these facilities in an environmentally sound manner.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
     <p>
     The Phase I work plan for the environmental assessment of the Devils Lake Sioux Reservation
consisted of three objectives.  Each objective was designed to provide preliminary data for
assessing the scope and magnitude of potential problems related to current and proposed
facilities and developing a plan for managing these facilities in a manner consistent with state
and federal regulations.  <p>
<p>
     The first objective related to the potential groundwater impacts due to the tribal landfill.  The
second objective concerned problems related to operation of the reservation wastewater treatment
lagoon system, with a primary focus on developing an operation and maintenance plan and a
secondary focus on the impact of the lagoons on groundwater.  The third objective related to
concerns about potential impacts on groundwater quality due to nitrate occurrence in the vicinity
of the tribal water supply wells. <p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Work performed at the landfill consisted of drilling and installing groundwater-monitoring wells.
The monitoring network was designed to provide information on site stratigraphy, groundwater
occurrence, direction and rate of groundwater flow, and groundwater quality.  Drilling and
installation of monitoring wells were also performed in the vicinity of the wastewater treatment
lagoons for the determination of potential groundwater impacts.  Several monitoring wells were
installed in the vicinity of the tribal water supply wells to supplement the existing monitoring
network in this area.  These wells will be used to determine the vertical distribution of
agricultural nitrates and the potential role of denitrification on nitrate distribution.<p>
<p>
     Sampling and analysis are being performed on the groundwater from the  monitoring wells at the
above areas.  The resulting data are currently being compiled and evaluated to interpret the
geologic, hydrogeologic, and geochemical conditions in the vicinity.  Results of these efforts will
be used to estimate the scope and magnitude of impacts to groundwater and to provide data
needed to develop plans for sound environmental management of these facilities on the
reservation.  <p>

<title>Ultraclean Coal Preparation and
Evaluation</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2> Ultraclean Coal Preparation and Evaluation </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     North Dakota lignites, because of their availability and low cost, are a potential fuel source for
fluid-bed combustion (FBC) applications.  Because of the inherent alkali elements (sodium and
calcium) and the lower temperatures of FBC (relative to pulverized coal firing), the potential for
attaining compliance levels for SO<sub>2</sub> emissions is high because of in-bed sulfur capture.  Grand
Forks Activation Technologies has proposed that incorporating ionic calcium into the coal
structure on an atomic level can improve the efficiency of sulfur capture during combustion. 
Further, it is proposed that a significant level of calcium-for-sodium substitution will occur, with
the resulting fuel having a reduced propensity for bed agglomeration or heat-transfer surface
deposition.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this program is to evaluate the potential for preparing a low-sulfur, low-fouling
lump fuel using a North Dakota lignite.  The specific goals of this project are to 1) perform
calcium addition and/or physical cleaning on the select lignite, 2) evaluate the combustion
characteristics (SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, fouling, and agglomeration) of the fuels in
a fluid-bed reactor (FBR), and 3) characterize the FBR combustion residues for their potential
engineering/construction applications.<p>
 <h3>Results</h3>
     Upgraded lump fuel was prepared from a seam lignite from Beulah, North Dakota.  The
upgrading methodologies included stage crushing, classifying, and physical beneficiation
(cleaning).  Beneficiation was performed using a pilot-scale dense-media (suspended, pulverized
magnetite slurry) separator to effect a reduction in ash and sulfur (via removal of pyrite).  A
pretreatment step was also incorporated into the process, whereby the crushed coal was contacted
with a calcium additive to effect a calcium-sodium exchange.  The upgraded fuels (and their
high-temperature ashes) were subjected to chemical and physical analysis.<p>

     Preliminary results indicate that sulfur reduction by wet physical cleaning, impressive at 40 wt%,
was insufficient to produce a 1.2 lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu emission-compliant fuel.  Bench-scale
washability tests performed in 1995 confirmed these pilot-scale results.  In contrast, tests
associated with the program "North Dakota Lignite Upgrading," performed in 1994,
demonstrated that an SO<sub>2</sub> emission-compliant fuel could be made with lignite procured from the
same mine.<p>

     Results of the pretreatment process are inconclusive regarding uptake of calcium.  Further
bench-scale tests are being performed by the project sponsor.  Combustion tests are pending the
outcome of the pretreatment phase.

<title>Physical Cleaning of Lignite</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Physical Cleaning of Lignite </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     North Dakota lignites have unique properties differentiating them from most other coals except
Saskatchewan lignites.  Fresh from the mine, they contain approximately 40 wt% moisture. 
During air-blown hammer milling, this is reduced to about 30 wt%.  Further air drying reduces
the moisture to 15-20 wt%.  However, lignite becomes more pyrophoric as the water content
decreases.  Mineral matter is very finely dispersed or present as ion-exchangeable cations
associated with organic matter.  However, bands of pyrite can collect along seam fractures in the
mine, resulting in nodules high in pyrite.  Methods for reducing ash and sulfur need to be
supplemented for some lignites to reduce their sodium content, since excess sodium increases ash
fouling during combustion.  Conventional processes for upgrading coals are generally successful
when applied to lignites.<p>
     Typically, no process has been found to economically clean a run-of-mine stream of lignite.  In
this work, the concept of inexpensive, single-pass grinding followed by splitting the coal into
separate size fractions was studied.  The possibility of producing a specification-grade product by
drying a selected fraction or by drying and briquetting or pelletizing was also studied. <p>
<h3>Objectives</h3> 
     The objective of this project was to produce a cleaner fuel from lignite (lower sulfur, ash, and
sodium contents and higher Btu) in approximately 1-in. lumps using physical cleaning,
briquetting, and drying methods.  The goal of the project was to determine the best conditions
under which to produce a specification product.  These conditions could then be used to produce
a ton quantity for use in combustion testing.<p>
<h3>Results</h3> 
     A large quantity (about 1500 lb) of run-of-mine lignite from the Beulah mine was successfully
pulverized, screened, physically cleaned, briquetted (about 300 lb), dried, and treated to produce
a product that meets sulfur emission requirements and represents a higher-heating-value product. 
High yields of about 80% were achieved.  With optimization, these should approach 92%.  The
lignite was physically cleaned from about 1.2 wt% sulfur based on a moisture-free coal basis
(mf) and 9.5 wt% ash mf to as low as 0.5 wt% sulfur mf and 6.1 wt% ash mf.  The sodium
content of the ash was 4.5 wt%, determined as sodium oxide.  Locally available binders (feed
wheat [4 wt%] and waste newspaper [3 wt%]) were investigated and found to produce briquettes
with compressive strength values of 50 psi even after soaking in water.  Surface spray treatment
with oil or emulsified asphalt at a rate of 0.5 to 1 wt% per ton of briquettes was found to help
preserve strength during soaking in water.  Equilibrium moisture values were about 18-20 wt%. 
Product heating values were 9754 Btu/lb at 9 wt% moisture and 9208 Btu/lb at 14.8 wt%
moisture.  Predicted sulfur emissions would be about 1.0 lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu based on the sulfur
content of the product, which makes this a compliance fuel.<p>

     In follow-on work, the processing conditions determined in this work were used to produce a ton
quantity of briquetted product to be used in combustion tests by Babcock &amp; Wilcox.

<h2>North Dakota Lignite Upgrading </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3> 
     Presently, many utilities with bituminous-design power plants are investigating coal blending
as one of several options for achieving present and future Clean Air Act Amendment-mandated
sulfur dioxide emission levels.  Coal blends being touted include those incorporating
low-sulfur subbituminous coals from the western United States and low-sulfur bituminous
coals from the eastern United States.  North Dakota lignite, if upgraded to the desired
specifications, could be substituted for the higher-Btu-content eastern bituminous coals.<p>
     Marketing studies have indicated that upgraded North Dakota lignites have the near-term
potential to secure a market of up to 3.5 million tons per year in Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
Factors contributing to this potential include the low mining cost and shorter rail haul
distances of the lignites relative to the bituminous coals.  However, prior to their acceptance,
blends incorporating upgraded North Dakota lignites must meet specific performance criteria
for fuel handling, pulverizing, combustion, and emissions.  Preliminary evaluation for
attainment of these criteria can be performed by pilot-scale combustion tests.  The EERC was
contracted to prepare upgraded North Dakota lignites for evaluation by Babcock &amp; Wilcox
(B&amp;W).<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this project was to produce, from each of two select North Dakota lignites, 1
ton of upgraded fuel meeting targeted specifications for strength, stability, and composition as
a blending feedstock.  The goal was to demonstrate the preparation of the upgraded lignites
using pilot-scale technologies that have a high potential for commercial viability.  <p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     A Beulah mine lignite and a Falkirk mine lignite, each from North Dakota, were upgraded at
the EERC and then shipped to B&amp;W for combustion testing.  Both upgraded lignite fuels met
or exceeded several property target specifications for sulfur, ash, and sodium contents, size,
and theoretical sulfur dioxide emissions.  The delivered upgraded Beulah mine lignite had the
following analysis:  0.45 wt% sulfur, 8.9 wt% moisture, 5.6 wt% ash, 9850 Btu/lb, 0.91 lb of
SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu, and 3.5 wt% sodium (as oxide) in ash.  The delivered Falkirk mine lignite had
the following analysis:  0.56 wt% sulfur, 14.3 wt% moisture, 5.2 wt% ash, 9580 Btu/lb, 1.16
lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu, and 0.2 wt% sodium (as oxide) in ash. <p>
     The processing scenario for the upgraded Beulah mine lignite included crushing and
classifying, physical cleaning to remove liberated minerals and pyrite, briquetting to improve
density and handling, and thermal drying to improve heating value.  The processing scenario
for the upgraded Falkirk mine lignite included crushing and classifying, physical cleaning,
hot-water drying for irreversible moisture removal, and briquetting.

<title>Compliance Coal Production for
Fluidized-Bed Combustion</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Compliance Coal Production for Fluidized-Bed Combustion </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from coal-fired boilers are generally acknowledged to
contribute to acid rain formation.  Most methods for controlling SO<sub>2</sub> emitted from combustion of
noncompliance coal involve reaction with limestone-derived calcium to yield calcium sulfate
(CaSO<sub>4</sub>).  Commercial calcium-based SO<sub>2</sub> control technologies include
high-efficiency (high-cost) wet scrubbing, lower-cost spray drying, and low-efficiency, low-cost furnace or duct
injection of sorbents.  These techniques all involve the association of calcium from an injection source with
SO<sub>2</sub> from coal, either during or after combustion.  This project was performed to investigate the
effectiveness of an economical precombustion calcium treatment process in capturing SO<sub>2</sub>
emissions, using a small-scale fluid-bed combustor (FBC).  The economics of the technique are based on
utilization of waste calcium carbonate from a water treatment facility (this material is normally landfilled) in a
low-tech, "stockpile" calcium treatment process.  The process was designed to be less mechanically intensive
and less expensive than current commercial FBC SO<sub>2</sub> control technologies and to increase
calcium utilization efficiency and reduce sodium-related ash fouling by calcium-for-sodium ion exchange. 
Commercialization of the process would enable simplification of FBC design and lower operation and
maintenance costs, since a separate calcium feed system would not be required to meet SO<sub>2</sub>
emission compliance requirements.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of the project were to 1) quantitate the effect of the proposed calcium ion-exchange
process on SO<sub>2</sub> control during combustion of North Dakota lignite in a research-scale FBC unit,
2) investigate the minimum level of technology required for the process to work, 3) investigate the effect of
increased ionic strength of the processing solution on calcium incorporation into the coal matrix, and 4)
estimate the technical feasibility of utilizing landfill-destined calcium to control SO<sub>2</sub> in a small- to
medium-scale, commercial FBC unit.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The project demonstrated that coal ash modification by calcium ion exchange can change ash fusion
temperatures and increase sulfur capture during combustion and that waste calcium-rich water treatment
sludge applied to lignite can result in ash fusion temperature increases of 100&#176; to over 400&#176;F. 
Increasing ash fusion temperature to a level significantly higher than the optimum FBC operating temperature
is beneficial in that it reduces ash fouling of heat-transfer surfaces.  FBC testing of calcium carbonate
sludge-treated raw lignite resulted in sulfur emissions of 1.26 lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu, which just
exceeds the current compliance specification of 1.2 lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu.  However, a slight
processing difference (not rinsing excess sludge) further reduced FBC emissions to 0.36 lb of
SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu, and FBC testing with a physically cleaned (via an economical dense-media pyrite
separation technique), calcium-treated lignite resulted in measured emissions of only 0.27 lb of
SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu.  These latter two results qualify these fuels as compliance fuels.

<title>Coal-Upgrading Program for &Uacute;st&iacute; nad
Labem, Czech Republic</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Coal-Upgrading Program for &Uacute;st&iacute; nad Labem, Czech Republic </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is working with the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) to assist many countries in East Central Europe with energy and environmental
issues.  A critical concern for &Uacute;st&iacute; nad Labem in the Czech Republic is the substantial pollution
created by three large district heating systems as well as small, residential, coal-fired stoves.<p>

     As part of a larger investigation in association with Gilbert/ Commonwealth, Inc., Reading,
Pennsylvania, to explore methods to reduce sulfur pollution from coal, the EERC conducted a
program to upgrade low-rank coals (LRCs) mined in the region of Northern Bohemia and used in
the city of &Uacute;st&iacute; nad Labem.  One part of this program involved reviewing the technologies used
in
upgrading coals of the region and the existing and proposed emission standards for residential and
commercial heating systems.  The North Bohemia Economic Association (NBEA) provided
assistance with this part of the program.  The program also included a limited technical
investigation of the potential for upgrading select Czech Republic coals.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The overall goal of the investigation was to assist the city of &Uacute;st&iacute; nad Labem in
developing cost-effective alternatives, including the upgrading of LRC for reducing emissions from the district
heating systems and other polluting stationary sources.  The objectives of the EERC program
involving NBA were to 1) review the cost-effective LRC upgrading technologies for reducing
particulates and gaseous pollutants and 2) undertake a brief experimental investigation of the
potential for upgrading up to six LRC samples from the Northern Bohemia region of the Czech
Republic.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Three coals from the Czech Republic, including B&iacute;lina and Nastup lignites from North Bohemia
and Ostrava bituminous coal from Moravia, were subjected to a limited technical investigation at
the EERC to assess the potential for upgrading.  All coals were analyzed for ash and sulfur
contents, forms of sulfur, and ash composition.  B&iacute;lina and Nastup lignites were treated by wet
and dry physical cleaning methods to reduce ash and sulfur content.  Physically cleaned B&iacute;lina
lignite and raw Ostrava bituminous coal were carbonized to reduce volatile matter content.  Select
raw, physically cleaned, and carbonized coals were aggregated (tableted) with a starch binder (and
calcium carbonate as a sulfur capture agent).  The aggregated fuels were analyzed for ash and
sulfur contents and ash composition, then subjected to bench-scale combustion tests to evaluate
their potential application as district heating and home heating fuels.<p>
     The ash and sulfur contents of the B&iacute;lina lignite were reduced by 42 and 36 wt%, respectively,
at
Btu yields of 90% using float-sink testing.  Further, dry physical cleaning via rare earth magnetic
separation (REMS) produced significant sulfur reduction (27 wt%) at a Btu recovery of 95%. 
Nastup lignite was not amenable to sulfur reduction at 1/4-in.  20 mesh via float-sink or REMS.<p>

     The tablet fuel analyses were compared to quality standards established in the Czech Republic for
the allowable maximum sulfur content (g/MJ basis) of indigenous briquettes.  Fuels prepared from
raw Ostrava bituminous coal and float-sink-cleaned B&iacute;lina lignite would qualify as fuels for steam
raising in business and energy installation applications.  Further, tablet fuels prepared from
carbonized Ostrava bituminous coal and carbonized B&iacute;lina REMS product would qualify as
smokeless fuels for home heating applications by virtue of their sulfur and volatile matter
contents.  The B&iacute;lina lignite-derived fuels have potential emission-effective sulfur contents
comparable to the Ostrava fuels because of the sulfur capture agent.

<title>Biodesulfurization</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Biodesulfurization </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Conventional catalytic hydrodesulfurization involves high costs largely due to hydrogen
consumption and heavy metal deactivation of the catalyst.  A potentially lower-cost treatment is
microbiological or enzymatic desulfurization.  Advances at the EERC improved the understanding
of sulfur-specific microbial desulfurization pathways in Rhodococcus bacteria, but further work
was needed to develop a practical technology based on biodesulfurization.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The main focus of this project was the application of desulfurization enzymes to remove sulfur
from crude oil, diesel fuel, or resid precursors for needle cokes.  The most important question to
be answered was how to utilize the Rhodococcus desulfurization complex in a nonaqueous
solvent or medium, such as the oil itself.  Successful application of nonaqueous enzymology to
this problem involved finding ways to stabilize the active conformations.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The pathway for desulfurization of the model compound dibenzothiophene (DBT) was completely
elucidated for nongrowth Rhodococcus bacteria.  Experiments with <sup>18</sup>O-enriched intermediates
were successful in demonstrating which of three potential pathways linking several intermediates
was the correct one.  This knowledge was needed for subsequent experiments in enzyme isolation
and determination of regulatory mechanisms.<p>
     The 4S pathway for DBT degradation in Rhodococcus utilized one enzyme to convert DBT to
the sulfoxide and subsequently the sulfone.  The sulfone is converted by a second enzyme to
2-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate, which is cleaned by a third enzyme to 2-hydroxybiphenyl.  A
nonenzymatic reaction of the sulfuric acid forms the sulforic acid via a dimer mechanism.  The
sulforic acid is converted to 2,2<sup>1</sup>-dihydroxybiphenyl by the same enzyme that converts the
sulfone to the sulforic acid.<p>
     The problem with the pathway is that two of the reactions require a reducing cofactor, NADH,
which must be supplied if the enzymes are removed from the interior of the bacterial cell.  Present
efforts are directed toward improving the efficiency of this process.<p>

<title>Organic Sulfur Removal from Coal with
Super- and Subcritical Water</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Organic Sulfur Removal from Coal with Super- and Subcritical Water </h2> </center> 
<hr>
 <h3>Background</h3>
     One of the major problems that still eludes the coal utilization industry is the lack of
cost-effective methods for precombustion sulfur removal from coal.  With the diminishing
supply of low-sulfur coal and more restrictions imposed on the use of high-sulfur coal, sulfur
removal from coal prior to combustion has become important.<p>
     Despite numerous attempts to remove sulfur from coal for low-sulfur clean coal combustion
applications, physical methods (e.g., selective agglomeration, flotation, or magnetic separation)
have enjoyed limited success for pyritic sulfur removal, and similar physical separation methods
are ineffective for organic sulfur removal from coal.  Cost-effective and technically sound
methods for removing organic sulfur from coal are not available.  While, in principle,
high-concentration chemical reagents (e.g., molten caustic leaching method) are effective for
removing organic sulfur from coal, little attention has been given to the economic feasibility and
the potential environmental impacts associated with their use.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The main objective of the investigation is to develop an economically feasible method for the
removal of organic sulfur from Illinois Basin high-sulfur coals for clean coal and niche market
applications.  Subcritical water will be used as an extraction fluid rather than the traditional
liquid solvents.  The proposed work will take advantage of subcritical water (acting as both
solvent and reactant) for the removal of organic sulfur by simply controlling the extraction
temperature and pressure.  Previous drawbacks of using supercritical water, such as the high 
temperatures (&gt;374&#176;C) and pressures (&gt;221 atm) required, high corrosivity of supercritical
water, high engineering costs, and significant coal mass loss through dissolution, can be avoided. 
In addition, water is inexpensive, widely available, nontoxic, and environmentally acceptable.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>

     Preliminary results indicate that physical cleaning (column flotation) of Coal IBC-101 reduced
the total sulfur content by &lt;10%, an amount approximately equal to the sulfatic content of the
coal.  However, the supercritical water extraction removed nearly three-fourths of the pyritic
sulfur and one-half of the organic sulfur while increasing the Btu/lb for extracted physically
cleaned coal.  Less severe conditions (subcritical water conditions) are being tested to determine
whether similar sulfur removals can be accomplished while retaining more of the volatile matter.<p>

<title>Resid and Bitumen Desulfurization</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1>Resid and Bitumen Desulfurization </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     In a previous EERC project, molybdenum sulfide impregnated in a synthetic clay and in a
hydrotalcite clay were demonstrated to be very effective catalysts for hydrodesulfurization of
coal-derived products.  Further demonstration of their activities and stability for desulfurization
of petroleum resids and bitumens was needed.  Resid desulfurization catalysts used currently
experience severe deactivation due to plugging of the catalyst pores or sintering of the metal
sulfides.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     This project was undertaken to determine how effective the molybdenum-impregnated clay
catalysts and the molybdenum-exchanged hydrotalcite catalysts are for hydrodesulfurization of
resids and bitumens.  The activity and stabilization were assessed to determine their potential for
commercialization and patent protection.<p>
<h3>Results</h3> 
     Investigations of the catalytic hydrodesulfurization of Venezuelan bitumen and its water
emulsion (Orimulsion) were carried out.  This material contained a large amount of sulfur and
organometallics, such as vanadium and nickel compounds.  A variety of nickel and molybdenum
catalysts were prepared.  These, as well as two commercial catalysts, were tested with
Orimulsion and vacuum-dried, pentane-insoluble and -soluble bitumen.  Catalytic
hydrotreatment removed up to 75% of sulfur from the bitumen.  Hydrodesulfurization was found
to be affected by reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst, and feed material.  Moisture-free
bitumen and a pentane-soluble bitumen fraction were desulfurized more effectively than
Orimulsion
<p>
     Two catalysts that had previously exhibited activity for hydrocracking coal tar constituents were
active for hydrodesulfurization of the high-sulfur Venezuelan bitumen.  The most active catalyst
for hydrodesulfurization was a nickel- and molybdenum-impregnated Y-zeolite-aluminosilicate
cogel.  This catalyst removed 75% of the sulfur from the moisture-free bitumen and 58% of the
sulfur from the Orimulsion.  A nickel-molybdenum catalyst supported on uranium oxide gave
slightly better results than desulfurization with the commercial catalysts.  Other catalysts that had
exhibited activity for desulfurization of coal-derived liquids were less active for desulfurization
of the bitumen than the commercial hydrotreating catalysts.<p>

<title>Stability Issues with Upgraded Low-Rank
Coals</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Stability Issues with Upgraded Low-Rank Coals</h2> 
</center>
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     Low-rank coal (LRC) utilization has largely been restricted to power generation at the mine or
within a short hauling distance because of the high moisture content and low heating value of
this coal type.  Continuing a trend of the last decade, bituminous-fired utilities in the midwestern
and eastern United States are investigating low-sulfur subbituminous coals for switching and/or
blending to achieve SO<sub>2</sub> emissions compliance.  A major challenge for coal producers is the
development of cost-effective coal-drying processes to enhance LRC heating value and reduce
transportation costs.<p>
     The LRC-upgrading technologies currently demonstrated include evaporative and
nonevaporative drying and mild pyrolysis/gasification.  An obstacle facing their development is
the stability of the product with regard to dusting, moisture reabsorption, and spontaneous
combustion.  Upgrading may enhance the instability of the product with respect to spontaneous
heating and dusting.  Because stability phenomena are often given only minor attention, the
development of improved stability-testing methods was deemed a necessary and complementary
component in the successful demonstration of upgrading technologies.  Currently, American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedures which address the physical stability of
coal or coal-derived products concern equilibrium moisture, abrasion resistance, Hardgrove
grindability, drop shatter, and impact resistance.  To date, an accepted procedure for the
determination of propensity to dust does not exist, and the stability of the equilibrium moisture
procedure for raw and upgraded LRCs has been questioned.<p>
     The EERC has participated in the assessment and development of a variety of LRC-drying
technologies.  With the development of these drying technologies, the EERC has commenced a
systematic program to investigate the major stability issues of dried LRCs.<p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The objective of this project was to develop methods and modify existing ASTM standards used
to evaluate coal and coal products in terms of their propensity to dust.  Dust generation is a major
concern for the future integration of LRC and its treated products.  The impact of various stress
levels experienced during handling and transporting severely affects the stability and uniformity
of the fuel, especially for dried products.  The height of loading and unloading equipment,
distance and methods of transport, climate and location, and the type of utilization station must
be taken into consideration in the design of a coal-upgrading facility.  Laboratory- and pilot-scale
systems were designed based upon existing ASTM and coal-handling procedures to evaluate the
handling characteristics of raw and dried LRCs.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Three raw coals and their dried coal products were evaluated by various strength and stability test
methods.  Three drying methods (air, hot water, and saturated steam) were used to generate
low-moisture, upgraded products for physical stability measurements.  Standard test methods as
well as methods developed at the EERC were used to evaluate the propensity of lump western
LRCs (raw and dried) to produce dust and absorbed water.  <p>
     Indices for dust generation and friability were generated for raw and upgraded coals to observe
the effect of moisture removal and upgrading methodology on coal stability.  A pilot-scale
conveyor test loop was developed at the EERC to more accurately simulate actual handling
operations to appreciate viability and slacking tendencies and a drop point to simulate the coal
loadout or transfer areas all in one system.  The conveyor test offers a procedure for use with
larger coal volumes and an environment in which to review the effectiveness of dust suppression
techniques.<p>
     The results show that the moisture content is decreased and the amount of dust generated is
substantially increased to unacceptable levels (i.e., fines less than 0.5 mm not to exceed 10 wt%). 
Tests performed to evaluate the tendency for moisture reabsorption of dried LRCs indicated that
coals tend to reabsorb the moisture during air drying, whereas hydrothermal treatment processes
do not allow reabsorption.<p>
     Through development of these laboratory techniques, there is the potential for improving the
prediction of stability of LRCs when subjected to transport handling and storage procedures. 
This is extremely important when marketing the virtues of a particular western coal type, as the
coal is transported long distances to eastern or foreign markets.  If commercial drying of LRCs is
to be successful, efforts must continue on stability analysis and the development of
cost-effective, stable products.

<title>Powder River Basin Coal Enhancement
Program</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Powder River Basin Coal Enhancement Program </h2> </center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The purpose of the program was to simulate coal drying/fluidized-bed pyrolysis at low
temperatures with partial oxidation.<p>
    The tests were conducted in two stages.  The first stage included a drying step using the EERC
controlled spontaneous reactor.  500 lb of feed coal was processed in this step.  The dried
material was then pyrolized at various conditions using a 1-4-lb/hr bench-scale continuous fluid-bed reactor
(CFBR) to determine tar yield from a Powder River Basin (PRB) Cordero mine coal.<p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of the program were to determine the yield of tar from the PRB coal to as high a
degree as possible in a fluid-bed reactor under particular conditions.  The following were specific
objectives:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Determine the difference in tar yield with wet vs. dry quench/condensation<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Determine the difference in tar composition with wet vs. dry
quench/condensation<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Collect char for use in future test programs<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Acquire samples of water streams for analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <h3>Results</h3> 
     Because of the proprietary nature of the program, detailed results cannot be described.  During
the drying tests, 440 kg of product was produced.  The dried product had a moisture content less
than 0.2%.  Analysis of the wastewater indicated the TOC was about 1600 mg/L, due entirely to
coal fines, and the gas contained only N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, which indicates that
devolatilization was not occurring.  25 material balances were completed under the second stage of the
program.  Statistical analysis of the results indicated the char, condensables, water, and gas yields were
reproducible within &#177;2.5%, &#177;0.9%, &#177;1.8%, and &#177;2.3%, respectively.<p>

     Even though the coal was dried in the first stage, there were significant amounts of water
produced in the pyrolysis step because of Fischer water.  Typically, moisture tests only analyze
for surface moisture, while pyrolysis releases chemically bound or adsorbed moisture.  The
yields of moisture were typical for a Wyodak coal.  Char, condensables, water, and gas yields
were within the range generally observed for a Wyodak seam coal.

<title>Alaskan Low-Rank Coal-Water Fuel
Environmental Attributes and
Combustion Test Marketing</title>

<h1>Alaskan Low-Rank Coal-Water Fuel Environmental Attributes and Combustion Test Marketing </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Pilot-scale tests at the EERC established that premium coal-water fuels (CWFs) could be made
from hot-water-dried (HWD) subbituminous coal from Alaska's Beluga coalfield at costs
competitive with imported oil and bituminous CWF in Japan.  LRCWF contains no chemical
additives; it is simply coal particles suspended in water and, as such, should pose no
environmental threat if spilled on land or in a body of water.  LRCWF is nonflammable and not
explosive and, therefore, avoids costly handling and transportation procedures usually required
for hydrocarbon liquids.  The next step in developing a commercial low-rank coal-water fuel
(LRCWF) plant in Alaska is a commercial-scale demonstration of LRCWF production and
utilization to allow potential end users to see firsthand LRCWF production followed by
combustion in an oil-designed boiler.  They will then be able to make their own economic
projections, as well as test excess LRCWF in their own facilities.  Early end-user involvement in
the demonstration will hasten the acceptance of this new fuel form and encourage users to seek
equity positions in the first LRCWF commercial plant in Alaska.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2> 
<p>
     The objectives of this program were to build on contacts developed by the Alaska CWF
Consortium with a number of foreign and U.S. boiler makers/users and to develop interest for
testing Alaskan LRCWF in potential user facilities.  Based on experience to date, potential
opportunities include the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Hawaii Electric Company<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  U.S. companies, including TRW and Donlee Tech, Inc., that are developing a
slagging combustor and atmospheric fluid-bed combustors (FBCs), respectively, for Alaskan applications<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Mexican utilities looking at existing oil-fired and new dual fuel-fired facilities<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Advanced combustion systems, including Cooper-Bessemer's CWF-fired
diesels<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Selected potential users in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan</li>
</ul>
<p>
     The project sought documentation from environmental protection agencies, including the
Alaskan Division of Environmental Conservation and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, on the environmental attributes of LRCWF use as compared to oil.  Documentation of
the nonhazardous nature of CWFs in comparison to the problems associated with the spill or
leakage of petroleum-based fuels will be a valuable asset to assist marketing LRCWF.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     A one-page brochure describing in nontechnical terms LRCWF production, utilization,
environmental attributes, its potential role in opening the Beluga coalfield, and the proposed
demonstration project was prepared, and over 1500 copies were distributed.  It was well received
and proved invaluable in developing broad-based support for the demonstration project in the
Alaskan Legislature.<p>
<p>
     Numerous domestic and international entities interested in developing the technology to
commercial scale were identified, including coal companies, industrial and utility boiler vendors,
advanced power system developers, and various countries interested in expanding the uses for
indigenous coal supplies.  These contacts will be maintained throughout demonstration project
development.<p>
<p>
     An order-of-magnitude economic evaluation was performed on commercial development of
LRCWF.  The production cost ranged from $0.77 to over $2.00 per million Btu.  The range of
cost estimates vividly illustrates the need for demonstration-scale testing to narrow the
uncertainty in process costs and to define actual performance in oil-designed boilers.  It also
illustrates the need for private and government cost sharing to reduce the risk of providing
definitive financial and performance data needed by potential LRCWF producers and consumers.<p>

<title>Evaluation of Methanol-Coal Slurries</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2> Evaluation of Methanol-Coal Slurries </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     The EERC has investigated numerous drying and conversion technologies that can be applied to
low-rank coals (lignite and subbituminous) to upgrade coal quality.  Moisture removal may occur
by evaporative or nonevaporative drying processes.  Evaporative techniques have the advantages
of being both low-cost and simple; however, the product quality can be a drawback. 
Conventional evaporative drying can economically remove all moisture to produce a dried fuel
that is acceptable if consumed immediately by using flue gas produced at the utility. Two
evaporative drying methods, air drying and oven drying, have been tested with a selected Alaskan
Beluga subbituminous coal.<p>

 <h3> Objectives</h3>
     The objective of this project was to determine the options available for converting raw, pulverized
subbituminous coal into a viable liquid fuel by initially drying the coal and then adding methanol to
produce coal-liquid fuels.  The work focused primarily on the rheological characteristics of the
fuels and the effects of changing methanol concentration, particle size, and moisture.  Three tasks
were identified to evaluate the potential for coal-methanol fuels.  The initial specific tasks were
conceived in three phases:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Phase I     Evaluation of raw Beluga coal and coal-methanol fuels<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Phase II    Evaluation of air-dried Beluga coal and coal-methanol fuels<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Phase III   Evaluation of oven-dried Beluga coal and coal-methanol fuels<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Testing with raw Beluga coal was used to determine baseline rheological characteristics of the
fuel with reference to solids loading, stability, and particle-size distribution.<p>
     Moisture analysis, specifically equilibrium moisture, of the three samples tested indicates that no
significant changes to the coal structure occurred between Phase I and Phase II samples. 
Analysis of the Phase III sample possibly indicated some structural changes in the coal because
the equilibrium moisture content was approximately 40% lower than for Phase I and II samples.<p>
     Stability of the fuels varies greatly, depending on the solids concentration of the fuels.  The fuels
with solids concentrations yielding viscosities between 500-650 cP appear to be very stable. 
However, the initial yield stress necessary to get these fuels to flow is so great that it is not
possible to produce a pumpable fuel at these conditions.  When further blending takes place, the
higher-viscosity fuels are more stable and could be pumped more easily.  At lower viscosities,
settling occurs more readily, but the fuels are much more pumpable, with further blending not
having nearly the effect it has at higher viscosities.  Energy densities of the fuels at 250 cP
indicate that Phase II and Phase III fuels have heating values greater than 9000 Btu/lb.  The
higher inherent moisture content of the Phase I fuel leads to a heating value of less than 8000
Btu/lb.

<h2>Evaluation of a Bituminous Coal-Water Fuel </h2>
</center>
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

     Coal fines produced during normal operation of a bituminous coal-washing facility are discarded
at considerable cost.  Recovery of these coal fines as a coal-water fuel to provide supplemental
heat to steam generators and utility boilers appears to be the most cost-effective approach.  The
current emphasis is to recover washing fines and blend them with the washery product to prepare
a stable coal-water fuel.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     Project objectives include the following:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">Prepare a stable bituminous coal-water fuel and evaluate its rheological
properties</br>

<title>Pilot-Scale Production of Refuse-Derived Slurry Fuel</title>
</head>
<body>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1>Pilot-Scale Production of Refuse-Derived Slurry Fuel </h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
As public concern grows and government regulations become increasingly strict, numerous municipalities and
industries face exorbitant costs for solid waste disposal that run head-on into bottom-line profits. 
Concurrently, markets for lignite coal have been limited primarily because of its high moisture content, which
results in a low heating value per unit of weight and a high transportation cost per unit of energy.  In addition,
most of the North Dakota lignite reserves have sulfur contents that produce emissions that exceed the 1990
Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) Phase II emission limits of 1.2 lb of SO<sub>2</sub> per MMBtu for power
plants.
<p>
To address these issues, EnerTech Environmental, Inc., and the EERC collaborated to develop a new method of
using both low-rank coals and low-sulfur solid waste materials.  The technology, called slurry carbonization,
was investigated as a means to efficiently produce homogeneous, high-energy slurry fuels with reduced
SO<sub>2</sub> emissions relative to that of the coals, offering a much more environmentally conscious
means of utilizing the energy potential of the solid waste.
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
The overall objective of this research program was to demonstrate the EnerTech-EERC process of slurry
carbonization for producing homogeneous, pumpable fuels from refuse-derived fuel (RDF) with pilot plant
facilities.
<p>
<h2>Results</h2> 
Carbonized RDF slurry fuels were produced with the EERC 7.5-tpd (wet basis) pilot plant facility.  A hose
diaphragm pump pressurized a 7-10 wt% feed RDF slurry, with a viscosity of 500 cP, to approximately
2500 psig.  The pressurized RDF slurry was heated by indirect heat exchangers to 585&#176;-626&#176;F,
and its temperature and pressure were maintained in a downflow reactor.  The carbonized slurry was flashed,
concentrated in a filter press, and ground in an attritor.  During operation of the pilot plant, samples of the
feed RDF slurry, carbonization gas, condensate, carbonized solids, and filtrate were taken and analyzed.
<p>
Pilot-scale slurry carbonization experiments with RDF produced a homogeneous pumpable slurry fuel with a
higher heating value of 3000-6600 Btu/lb (as-received basis) at a viscosity of 500 cP at 100 Hz decreasing
and ambient temperature.  Greater-heating-value slurry fuels were produced at higher slurry carbonization
temperatures.  During slurry carbonization, polyvinyl chloride plastics in the feed RDF also decompose to form
hydrochloric acid and salts.  Pilot-scale slurry carbonization experiments extracted 82%-94% of the feed RDF
chlorine content as chloride salts.  Higher carbonization temperatures and higher alkali additions to the feed
slurry produced a higher chlorine extraction.

<title>Feasibility Study for Slurry Carbonization
of Automobile Shredder Residue</title>
</head>
<body>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1>Feasibility Study for Slurry Carbonization of Automobile Shredder Residue </h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Used cars are extensively recycled for ferrous and nonferrous metals, generally using
shredding and air classification technologies.  However, a waste residue, referred to as
automobile shredder residue (ASR), is generated that is high in plastics, including polyvinyl
chloride (PVC).  Hence, thermal recycling and utilization of ASR are costly and
environmentally opportunistic because of its high PVC (chlorine) content.<p>
<p>
     EnerTech Environmental, Inc., and the EERC have developed a technology, slurry
carbonization, to decompose and extract organically bound chlorine and, concurrently,
improve the heating value of low-rank fuels and wastes.  In the simplest description of
slurry carbonization, raw ASR is mixed with water to form a pumpable slurry.  The ASR
slurry is then pumped and heated to specific temperature and pressure conditions
(225&#176;-350&#176;C and pressure sufficient to keep the slurry substantially liquid) in the absence
of air or oxygen.  At these conditions, the ASR molecularly rearranges, and PVC
decomposes to hydrochloric acid, so that, upon cooling, the carbonized ASR can be
dewatered and washed to remove the chlorine.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To establish the effects of slurry carbonization on the chemical and physical
properties
of the ASR slurry.</li>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To establish optimal operating conditions to minimize the chlorine content of the
carbonized ASR slurry fuel.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To characterize the gas and water effluents produced from bench-scale slurry
carbonization.<br>
<p>
</ul> 
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Raw ASR contained a significant chlorine content at approximately 2.9 wt% (dry basis). 
During slurry carbonization, chlorine was extracted from the ASR as soluble chloride salts. 
On average for the bench-scale experiments, the slurry carbonization treatment extracted
over 87% of the feed ASR chlorine, with a maximum extraction of approximately 90%. 
The percentage of chlorine extraction was slightly dependent on the maximum slurry
carbonization temperature.<p>
<p>
     Unexpectedly, raw ASR contained a significant oxygen content (dry basis) and a low
heating value.  On average, the slurry carbonization treatment improved the heating value
of ASR by approximately 16% on a moisture-free basis and over 68% on a moisture-ash-free basis.  Based
upon these preliminary data, the heating value of the carbonized ASR
appears to be independent of the slurry carbonization temperature or percentage of alkali
added to the feed slurry.<p>
<p>
     The carbonized ASR was reconstituted with water and its rheology determined.  On
average for bench-scale experiments, the solids loading of the carbonized ASR slurries was
52.1 wt% total solids at a viscosity of 500 cP (@ 100 Hz decreasing), over 110% higher
than the feed slurry at a similar viscosity.  This solid loading is comparable to coal-water
slurry fuels.  This resulted in carbonized ASR slurry fuels with an average heating value of
4900 Btu/lb (wet basis), which is slightly lower than the raw solid ASR (dry basis).  It is
expected that these slurry fuels would exhibit excellent combustion characteristics.

<title>Prefeasibility Study for the Production of
Form Coke from Indian Low-Rank Coals</title>
</head>
<body>

<center>
<h2>Prefeasibility Study for the Production of Form Coke from Indian Low-Rank Coals </h2> <hr>
</center>
<h3>Background</h3>

     India has estimated coal reserves of over 176 billion tonnes; however, only a small fraction is
metallurgical grade.  Consequently, India has become a major importer of coke and/or
metallurgical coal.  These imports amount to over 5 million tons per year and are increasing in
response to growth in the steel industry.<p>

     The Formcoke&reg; process, developed in the United States by FMC Corporation, was designed to
make a metallurgical coke substitute using low-cost low-rank coals (LRCs).  During
development, several full-scale blast furnace tests were conducted using Formcoke&reg; made from
LRC, which proved to be a suitable replacement for the more costly, conventional coke produced
in coke ovens from bituminous coals.<p>
     The ability to produce formed coke from all ranks of coal takes on added significance in areas
like India where indigenous coking coals are scarce or of poor quality, but quantities of
reasonably good-quality LRCs exist.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     Using the EERC database on coproduct yields from gasification of LRCs, the objectives are to
estimate Formcoke&reg;  yields from representative Indian LRCs and estimate the economics of
Formcoke&reg;  production in India and develop a commercialization program.<p>
<h3>Results</h3> 
     Several Indian lignites from the states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu were low enough in ash and
had sufficient predicted yields to be considered as Formcoke&reg; feedstocks.<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Capital costs for a Formcoke&reg; plant are expected to be below those for a
conventional coke plant.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Plant economic projections are enhanced with cogeneration of electricity.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> With a nominal 15% internal rate of return, Formcoke&reg; is projected to be
competitive with conventional coke, even in today's depressed coal market.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Bench-scale testing at the EERC was proposed as the next step to validate
theoretical estimates of product yields and quality.

<title>Novel Briquette Binders</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Novel Briquette Binders </h2></center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     Recent advances in the processing of lignocellulosic material to provide inexpensive
intermediates afford an opportunity to devise an inexpensive polymeric binding material for
making coal briquettes or coal logs from coal fines, as a way of transporting and using this
lower-value coal.  The recent environmental interest in pyrolysis conversion of plastic waste to
usable feedstocks has generated some unique gels that were investigated for the preparation of
briquette binders.  Markets are urgently needed for products resulting from both of these
technologies.<p>
 <h3>Objectives</h3>

     The objective of this project was to produce high-strength coal briquettes using inexpensive
binders derived from waste plastic pyrolysis tars and from lignocellulose hydrolysates.<p>

<h3>Results</h3>
     Lignin has been known to be a good binder for producing coal briquettes.  Hot pressing methods
gave pellets with high compression strength (236 psi).  Cold pressing was generally not
successful with any of the binders, nor was hot curing after cold pressing.  Conversion of lignin
to a cross-linked Novolak structure by adding one-carbon linkages via formaldehyde gave a
viscous material that proved to be a poorer binder than the original lignin.<p>

     High-strength pellets were produced from phenol Novolak using a hot press method.  Here the
cross-linking is essential to bonding the coal particles together.  Low-rank coal chars were also
strongly bonded by the Novolak.  Mixing the phenol Novolak with lignin gave a strong pellet,
but did not offer any additional strength.  A composite Novolak prepared from a mixture of
lignin and phenol was an ineffective binder.<p>
    Several binders prepared from calcium tall soap, a polyurethane prepared from diphenolic acid,
and some starch graft copolymers were reasonably good binders.  A number of coal-derived tars
and low-severity liquefaction products and the Orimulsion bitumen were poor binders.<p>
     Using a proprietary process, high-strength pellets were prepared from waste plastic packing
materials.  A plastic-derived binder was the only binder that could be used with the bituminous
char.  Waste plastic pyrolysis tars were not very effective binders.<p>

<title>Direct Liquefaction of Low-Rank Coal</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Direct Liquefaction of Low-Rank Coal </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     A multistep direct liquefaction process designed to take advantage of the inherent reactivity of
low-rank coals has been developed at the EERC.  The process consists of 1) a preconversion
treatment to prepare the coal for solubilization, 2) solubilization of the coal in the solvent, and
3) polishing using solubilization solvent to complete solubilization of the remaining material. 
The product of these three steps can then be upgraded during a traditional hydrogenation step. 
Positive results of research on this process indicated that additional studies should be performed
to more fully develop the process.<p>
<h3> <b>Objective</b></h3>

     The project objectives are to determine the recyclability of the solvent used during solubilization
and to determine the minimum hydrotreatment severity required to upgrade the liquid product of
the multistep EERC process.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Testing is scheduled to be performed in two tasks.  The first task consists of ten cycles of the
multistep process in which the solubilization solvent is recycled from the polishing step of one
cycle to the pretreatment step of the next cycle.  A composite solvent consisting of cresylic acid
and hydrotreated coal-derived anthracene oil was prepared to use as the solubilization solvent for
the ten test cycles.  It is expected that both Tasks 1 and 2 will be completed in June 1995. 
Preliminary results of Task 1 indicate that 1) the composite solvent works well in the process,
2) the conversions attained for each cycle are very consistent, and 3) the solvent appears to be
lining out as it continues to be recycled through the process.

<title>Investigations of Novel Methods for
Production of Iron-Based Catalysts Used
in Coal Liquefaction</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Investigations of Novel Methods for Production of Iron-Based Catalysts Used in Coal Liquefaction </h2>
</center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel resource in the world.  The major use of coal in the U.S. is
for the generation of electricity.  A variety of options have been considered for transforming coal
into liquid fuels.  Although this transformation is possible technically, economics have precluded
the use of liquid fuels produced from coal under normal market conditions.<p>
    To improve the economics of catalytic coal liquefaction, work has been focused on developing
more efficient and economical catalyst systems.  Problems with molybdenum-based systems
include short life times, high cost, and system material disposal.  Iron-based catalyst systems
may offer an opportunity to overcome many of these shortcomings, improving the economics of
coal liquefaction options.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project are to investigate novel methods for preparing iron-based catalysts
and to investigate the catalytic activity of these catalysts with coal samples.<p>
<h3>Results</h2>
     Several options for preparation of iron-based catalysts were investigated.  Materials were
produced that demonstrated yields of coal liquids similar to or better than those noted with
conventional systems.  Activities were comparable to those noted with the more expensive
molybdenum catalysts.

<title>Effects of Coal Chemistry on Gasification
at the Great Plains Gasification Plant</title>
</head>
<body><center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Effects of Coal Chemistry on Gasification at the Great Plains Gasification Plant</h2> </font> 
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The Great Plains Gasification Plant, owned and operated by the Dakota Gasification Company,
has demonstrated many technological advances in the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG). 
Test data have indicated correlation between gasification rates and some chemical
characteristic(s) of the coal fed to the gasifiers.  While extensive plant data are available, testing
to identify more economical and efficient plant operating conditions is limited by the variability
between gasifiers and production needs.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h2>
     The objective of this project was the optimization of the gasifiers at the Great Plains Gasification
Plant.  Previously, more than 50 analytical methods were used to determine properties of six coal
samples to identify correlations with observed gasifier operability and SNG production.  The
next phase of that work was to examine the promising properties for 42 additional samples to
improve the value of any statistical correlations with observed gasifier operability.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
     The larger group of samples collected from different areas of the mine increased the variability of
characteristics of the coal.  The highest correlations with plant performance were found for the
energy of activation of the char-steam reaction and the Btu content of the coal.  While the
statistical correlations were significant, whether they are strong enough to help guide plant
operations is yet to be determined.<p>

<title>Chlorine Removal from Recycled Plastics</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Chlorine Removal from Recycled Plastics</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     This project is a follow-on to the project entitled "Thermal Recycling of Plastics," whose purpose
was to examine the thermal decomposition products of plastics.  While the thermal recycling
process shows promise, several key areas must be examined before commercialization of thermal
recycling is pursued:  the elimination of organochlorides, the measurement of organochlorides,
and the industrial specifications of the process products.  Since essentially all end uses of these
products will be in chemical applications (e.g., introduction into a refinery or fuel blending),
organic chlorine in the product liquids is unacceptable.  Identification of where organochlorides
form is necessary before a decision can be made on where chlorine will be removed in the
process.  If it is found that organochloride formation occurs in the decomposition process, then
chlorine removal would be necessary either in the bed or in the feed system.  If formation occurs
during condensation, postreactor filters would be possible.<p>
     Presently, no applicable analytical methods are standard (e.g., American Society for Testing and
Materials [ASTM]) for measuring organochlorides in these types of liquids.  Total chlorine is
measured using a variation of ASTM Method D808-91.  Organically associated chlorine is
measured using gas chromatography-atomic emission detection.  A database will be established
to support these techniques.  Characterization of the product liquids according to refinery and
fuel standards is also planned.  The resulting liquid products should be characterized according to
these standards to help facilitate acceptance of this novel product.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this program are to identify where organochloride formation occurs (i.e.,
during condensation or decomposition), verify and document the analytical methods for
organochloride quantitation, and characterize the product liquids in terms familiar to the
petroleum and fuel industries.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Tests completed were very successful in precluding organochloride formation using both an in-bed
and postreactor filter.  Organochlorides were reduced from 3000 ppm to less than detection
limits of 10 ppm.  Sorbent utilization varied with CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, ranging from 30%-100%. 
Product liquid characterization indicates the distribution of liquids produced varied from diesel
fuel and JP4 (jet fuel).  This distribution can be shifted with temperature or bed material choice,
as can the aliphatic-to-aromatic ratio.
     A round-robin of organochloride analytical techniques was completed between the EERC,
British Petroleum, and Conrad Industries.  This work was conducted to establish whether
particular analytical techniques were reliable and consistent.  Final reports on the sorbent testing
and round-robin research are available.

<title>Utility Experience Blending Eastern and
Western Coals</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Utility Experience Blending Eastern and Western Coals </h2> </center>
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments have forced a number of utilities currently firing high-sulfur
coals to find methods to reduce emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> to levels mandated by current law. 
Methods of compliance include flue gas desulfurization, fuel switching, fuel blending, and
emission allowance trading.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this project was to review the current status of coal blending as a compliance
strategy.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The final report for this project provides an overview of the experience of those utilities that have
investigated or have elected to blend low-sulfur subbituminous coals from the Powder River
Basin (PRB) with higher-sulfur bituminous supplies to attain compliance.  The report includes
power plant descriptions and performance data collected from 12 units at 11 sites, representing 9
utilities.  Methods used to obtain the data reported included questionnaires, site visits, interviews,
and telephone and mail correspondence.  The units surveyed included seven Combustion
Engineering (CE) (six tangentially fired and one wall-fired, all dry bottom) and five Babcock and
Wilcox (B&amp;W) (four wall-fired [one wet-bottom] and one cyclone-fired) units.  The potential
areas affected by the blends included fuel transportation, coal handling and storage, mill
performance, furnace wall slagging, convective pass fouling, particulate collection/emissions,
and gaseous emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>.  In addition, modifications to existing
equipment or operating procedures required or under consideration as a result of firing the blended fuel were
documented.  The key findings of the investigation are summarized as follows:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Sulfur emissions can be reduced to meet regulations by blending PRB coals with
bituminous coals.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> PRB coal transportation, handling, and storage can be accomplished without
major modifications to equipment or procedures.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Blending can be successfully accomplished by a variety of methods, including
off-site blending at the rail-to-barge transloading facility, on-site blending on the conveyors by control of belt
speeds (or using weigh feeders) from separate reclaims, or in the boiler by controlling the distribution of
bituminous coal to the lowest pulverizer/burner sets and using one or more of the upper pulverizer/burner
sets for combustion of the PRB coal.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The pulverizer is generally the first area affected by the blend, which may impose
a limitation to achieving rated load.  The higher-moisture PRB coal tends to suppress the mill outlet
temperature below the design minimum for bituminous boilers.  Attempts to maintain this temperature result in
boiler derate.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Mills that use higher levels of carrier gas can accommodate higher blend ratios
of subbituminous coal without boiler derate, because the carrier gas has a greater capacity for moisture,
preventing significant reductions to mill exit temperatures.  <br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> There is a characteristic change to the distribution of heat in a bituminous-design
boiler firing a blend containing subbituminous coal.  More heat is carried out of the furnace because of
inadequate surface area in the furnace, lower flame temperatures (reduced radiation of heat to surfaces),
and higher flue gas heat capacity.  Some boiler operators reported a "reflective" ash on waterwalls that may
also contribute to this phenomenon.<br>

<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Furnace wall slagging and convective pass fouling of heat-transfer surfaces may
increase.  Increased furnace wall blower and convective pass sootblower operation can effectively be used to
manage the blend deposits.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Baseloaded units tend to have more difficulty with deposition than those
incurring regular load swings.  Decreasing temperatures in the convective pass allows for shedding of
deposits at reduced load.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Finned-tube economizers may present a problem.  Chunks of sootblown
convective pass ash-fouling deposits and fly ash tend to collect between these surfaces, insulating them and
potentially blocking the flue gas flow through these difficult-to-sootblow regions.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Particulate collection can be impaired by the blend because of the lack of
SO<sub>3</sub> present in the flue gas.  Larger electrostatic precipitators (ESPs, with specific collection area
[SCA] greater than 300 to 350 ft<sup>2</sup>/1000 acfm) tend to provide adequate collection of the
resultant fly ash.  Smaller precipitators require the addition of new fields or the use of flue gas conditioning to
achieve adequate collection.  Intermediate blend ratios present the greatest impairment to ESP performance
because of the transition from SO<sub>3</sub> conditioning (100% bituminous coal) to Na<sub>2</sub>O
conditioning (100% subbituminous coal) of the fly ash.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Flue gas NO<sub>x</sub> emissions may decrease, in large part, because of the
lower combustion flame temperature.<br>
<p>
</ul>
Recommendations or suggestions for use of PRB coals in boilers designed for bituminous coals
include the following:<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  On-site storage of PRB coals should be accomplished by compacting the
stockout piles to reduce the potential for air infiltration, which could lead to problems with self-heating during
storage of the higher-reactivity PRB coal.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> In general, increased housekeeping around transfer points can alleviate any
potential problems with self-heating of the higher-reactivity PRB coal in spillage areas of the coal-handling
system.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Mill safety procedures should be reviewed and considered where none exist to
alleviate the chance for mill fires and puffs, particularly during start-up and shutdown.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Utilities should check with their boiler vendors to determine the minimum mill
outlet temperature (for a given coal pipe size) that will allow adequate transport of the fuel to the burners. 
The higher reactivity of the subbituminous coal will allow for adequate flame stability even at
lower-than-design mill outlet temperatures.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Sootblower maintenance and increased boiler inspection may be required to
maintain/sustain boiler operation.  <br>

 <p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Units with smaller ESPs should perform parametric testing of existing capacity to
determine whether additional fields or flue gas conditioning is required to adequately collect the blended coal
fly ash.<br>

<title>Pilot Plant Assessment of Blend
Properties</title>

<h2>Pilot Plant Assessment of Blend Properties </h2></center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Many eastern and midwestern utilities are considering coal blending or switching as a means to
reduce sulfur emissions to gain compliance with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  One
option utilities have is to blend their current high-sulfur bituminous coal with low-sulfur
subbituminous coal from the Powder River Basin (PRB).  While the subbituminous coal provides
greatly reduced sulfur contents, it also has other characteristics that may lead to boiler derate
when fired in a blend with a bituminous coal in a boiler designed for bituminous coals.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     Program objectives were to establish the effects of blending eastern bituminous coal with
western subbituminous coal on mill performance, furnace wall slagging, convective pass fouling
(both high- and low-temperature), and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) performance.  Flame
stability characteristics for the parent coals and blends were also evaluated.<p>
<h3> Results</h3>
     A series of tests were performed to determine the effects of blending eastern bituminous coals
with western subbituminous coals on utility boiler operation.  Mill performance tests were
performed by CONSOL, Inc., at its facility in Library, Pennsylvania, while all other testing was
performed at the EERC in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  The work was sponsored jointly by the
U.S. Department of Energy, the Electric Power Research Institute, Empire State Electric Energy
Research Corporation, CONSOL, and Franklin Coal Sales, Inc.  <p>

     Mill performance tests indicated that at design pulverizer conditions (relative to pulverization of
bituminous coal) the decreased thermal input of the subbituminous coals resulted in derates on
the mill of up to 55% of the maximum thermal input of the bituminous coals.  One Pittsburgh
seam bituminous coal, one Illinois No. 6 seam bituminous coal, and two PRB subbituminous
coals were tested.  By raising the mill outlet temperature between 5&#176; and 25&#176;F, thermal
throughput for the subbituminous coals could be increased by 10% to 20%.  Increasing the
air/fuel ratio also tended to increase thermal throughput, although at the expense of a coarser
product.  At the maximum thermal throughput for the subbituminous coals at the highest air/fuel
ratio, product fineness decreased up to 15 percentage points (less than 200 mesh).  Interestingly,
the lowest-heat-content subbituminous coal indicated the lowest thermal derate of the two PRB
coals tested, but required much higher mill energy input.<p>

     Testing at the EERC determined the effects of blending one Pittsburgh seam bituminous coal
with two PRB subbituminous coals.  The tests were performed to determine high-temperature
fouling (at both 2000&#176; and 2200&#176;F) propensity, low-temperature fouling (1500&#176; to
1600&#176;F) propensity, flame stability characteristics, and gaseous and particulate emissions
characteristics.  High-temperature fouling tests indicated comparable fouling rates for each of the parent
coals, with the blends exhibiting a lower ash-fouling rate.  The lower fouling rate of the blends was attributed
to interactions between the two ash types.  However, in each case, the strength of the deposit was increased
irrespective of the fouling rate as the percentage of subbituminous coal in the blend was increased.  The
highest-sodium-content subbituminous coal produced consistently stronger deposits than its 
lower-sodium-content counterpart.<p>
    Low-temperature fouling tests indicated similar deposition rates for each of the coals tested, with
a slight increase in rate noted as the percentage of subbituminous coal in the blend was increased. 
Higher-strength deposits were expected as the percentage of subbituminous coal was increased
because of the sintering behavior of the high-calcium-content ash from the subbituminous coal. 
Results were inconclusive to support this theory, as the parent coals exhibited much lower
strength than either of the blends tested.  There would appear to be some interaction between ash
types to create these stronger deposits, although the mechanism was not easily discernible from
the data generated.<p>
     Flame stability testing indicated that each of the parent coals and coal blends would exhibit
excellent fuel ignitability and flame stability characteristics over a wide range of burner settings. 
There was a general trend toward lower carbon-in-ash values as the percentage of subbituminous
coal in blend with the bituminous coal was increased.  Based on the results obtained here, the
addition of subbituminous coal in blend with the bituminous coal should increase overall carbon
conversion and provide adequate or improved flame stability, which may tend to offset some of
the limits to grinding efficiency noted above in the mill performance tests performed by
CONSOL.<p>
    Flue gas emissions of SO<sup>2</sup> were dramatically reduced as the percentage of subbituminous coal
was increased in blend with the bituminous coal tested here.  In general, the emission reductions
followed the decrease noted in the input sulfur concentrations.  However, there was evidence of
increased sulfur capture in the ash as the percentage of subbituminous coal in the blend was
increased.  This trend was even more pronounced for those tests performed at the lowest furnace
exit gas temperature, indicating a temperature dependence on the level of sulfur capture in ash. 
Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<sup>x</sup>) were also decreased as the percentage of subbituminous coal
in the blend was increased.  Levels noted during testing of the parent subbituminous coals were
roughly one-half that of the parent bituminous coal.  Particulate emissions testing indicated
similar results for all fuels tested under similar conditions.  There was no apparent trend toward
decreased collection efficiency for either of the sets of bituminous/subbituminous coal blends,
although one of bituminous/subbituminous coal blend sets indicated a slight reduction in
collection efficiency as the percentage of subbituminous coal in the blend was increased.<p>
     Relative to the baseline bituminous coal, there were significant impacts to boiler performance
due to the blending of the eastern and western coals indicated by the testing reported here. 
Results indicated that fuel blending can be used to adequately control flue gas emissions of both
SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> at the expense of reduced milling efficiency, increased sootblowing in
the high-temperature and low-temperature regions of the boiler and, to a lesser extent, decreased
collection efficiency for an ESP.  The higher reactivity of the subbituminous coal increased the
overall combustion efficiency, which may tend to decrease the impact of the milling efficiency
loss.  The extent of these impacts was directly related to the percentage of subbituminous coal in
the blend.  At the lowest blend ratios of subbituminous coal, the impacts were greatly reduced.

<title>Prediction of Ash Behavior During Coal
Conversion</title>

</head>
<body>

<h2>Prediction of Ash Behavior During Coal Conversion </h2></center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The behavior of inorganic components in coal is the most important factor determining
combustion system design for utility boilers.  Great interest exists in mathematically modeling
coal behavior during combustion as a tool for research and design.  To this end, the National
Science Foundation has funded a major program, the Advanced Combustion Engineering
Research Center (ACERC) at Brigham Young University and the University of Utah to produce
a three-dimensional code for a full-scale, coal-fired boiler.  A major component of this program
will be submodels to describe mineral matter behavior during combustion.  Because of the
EERC's strong background in this area, Dr. Steven A. Benson has been asked to head up
activities concerned with mineral behavior in the ACERC program.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objective of this program is to obtain information on the combustion behavior of the mineral
matter in a selected suite of test coals to serve as the basis for development of mathematical
models.  To this end, the following goals are being pursued:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Characterization of the inorganic portion of the selected coals, including both
chemical fractionation to determine organically bound cations and computer-controlled scanning electron
microscopy to determine discrete mineral phases.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Determination of the characteristics of intermediate ash materials and deposits
formed during conventional combustion, low-NO<sub>x</sub> combustion, and advanced coal conversion
using bench-scale drop-tube furnace (DTF) reactors.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Management of all mineral matter activities in the ACERC program, including
determination of priorities and long-range goals.<br>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Combustion testing was performed to examine mineral and ash transformations under
low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions.  The approach was to combust several ACERC coals of varying rank in a
bench-scale DTF system under both conventional and low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions.  Fly ash from these
coals was collected on bulk filters and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the size,
morphology, and composition of the ash particles.  Three coals were prepared as 70% to 80% -200-mesh
samples and combusted in a bench-scale DTF under both conventional and low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions. 
On-line gas analysis was used to monitor CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub>
concentrations.  Samples of the fly ashes were collected on bulk filters for subsequent analysis.  Ash
particle-size distributions and carbon carryover were determined by Malvern and thermogravimetric analysis,
respectively.  Detailed analyses of the fly ashes were performed using a modified version of the EERC scanning
electron microscopy point count (SEMPC) program to determine mineral phases and elemental compositions of
individual particles.  The particles analyzed were also manually sized by measurements from SEM
photomicrographs.  In collaboration with Dr. C.H. Bartholomew of Brigham Young University, portions of the fly
ash will be examined by M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy to determine the iron oxidation states present.<p> 
     For conventional combustion, the DTF system gas temperature at the coal injection point was
maintained at 1530&#176;C, a gas temperature at the deposition point of 1230&#176;C with a residence
time of approximately 3.5 seconds, and an air level of 19%.  Low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions were simulated
by lowering the furnace temperature profile to 1430&#176;C and introducing 3% air with the secondary gas
stream.  Nitrogen was used to transport the coal in the primary gas stream.  The lower temperature and
slower mixing of fuel and air extended the burning time and significantly reduced both the thermal and fuel
NO<sub>x</sub> produced for a total NO<sub>x</sub> reduction of about 50%-60%, while still maintaining
an acceptable level of carbon burnout.  Samples of each fly ash were collected on a bulk filter; particle-size
distribution was determined by Malvern sizing and degree of carbon carryover by thermogravimetric
analysis.<p>  
     Results of particle-sizing analysis of the fly ash indicated a small but consistent increase in mean
particle size for the low-NO<sub>x</sub> as compared to conventional combustion conditions.  This may be
the result of the longer, cooler burning time, reducing coal particle fragmentation and allowing
increased coalescence of the mineral matter under low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions.  The major effect of
low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions on ash mineral composition appears to be a decrease in the amount of pure
mineral phases present, with a concurrent increase in mixed phases.  The ash of the subbituminous Powder
River Basin coals that were tested showed a decrease of quartz, calcium oxide, and kaolinite phases, along
with an increase in calcium aluminosilicate, under low-NO<sub>x</sub>  conditions.  A significant increase in
amorphous mixed-silicate mineral phases was observed.  No similar trends were obvious for the bituminous
Illinois No. 6 coal.  Liquid-phase viscosities, calculated based on the SEMPC chemical analyses of individual fly
ash particles, did show slightly lower values for the low-NO<sub>x</sub> fly ash for all coals tested.<hr>

<title>Development of Fireside Combustion
Performance Indices: Convective Pass
Fouling and Fly Ash Collectibility</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2> Development of Fireside Combustion Performance Indices: Convective Pass Fouling and Fly Ash
Collectibility </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
     A number of purely operational options are available to reduce ash-related problems in coal-fired
boilers,
including switching or blending coals, using additives, or changing the temperature profile of the boiler. 
Predicting the effects of a proposed operational change is difficult, because although a variety of empirical
indices involving simple American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) analyses are available, the
complex nature of coal means that finding the most economical solution involves some experimentation. 
However, experimentation with a 500-MW boiler is a complicated proposition because failures can be
expensive and the solutions chosen may not be the most efficient.  For these reasons, computer simulations
of key parameters affecting ash deposition are often used first to reduce the size of the experimental matrix. 
The EERC is developing advanced indices that rank coals according to their fouling and slagging propensity
in utility boilers.  The indices are termed "advanced" because they are based on more sophisticated
analytical techniques for identifying and quantifying coal inorganics, greatly improving their reliability
compared to conventional indices.<p>
<h3> Objectives</h3>
     The goal of this consortium project was the reliable prediction of coal-related aspects of boiler
performance, including slagging and high- and low-temperature fouling (for both conventional and
low-NO<sub>x</sub> burners); slag tapping; stack emissions opacity; steam tube erosion; and mill
performance.  These indices are intended to provide an economical means of reducing the amount of full-scale
testing needed to determine the best approach to minimize ash-related problems encountered when coal is
burned in pulverized coal-fired boilers.  The index calculations were performed by a single IBM PC-compatible
computer program, termed "PCQUEST," an acronym for Predictive Coal Quality Effects Screening Tool.<p> 
     Extensive bench-scale testing, analysis of coal and ash, and operational data were used to formulate
the
index algorithms.  At the completion of the project, PCQUEST contained enough data to allow the
evaluation of entirely new coals with the input of the appropriate chemical and mineralogical data and
selected boiler parameters.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The first step in formulating the advanced indices is to obtain complete characterization of
discrete minerals and organically associated inorganic components in selected coals and then to
compare these characteristics to the performance of the coals in full-scale systems.  The optical
drop-tube furnace (ODTF) at the EERC has the ability to generate slagging and fouling deposits
and fly ash samples from a variety of coals using conditions similar to those in full-scale
systems.<p>
     The index value calculations are based on data from coal inorganic content and limited
combustion conditions.  Certain quantifiable coal inorganic parameters, which are considered the
most important factors governing the formation of utility boiler deposits, have been assembled
into an algorithm that outputs an index value expressing the degree of fouling or slagging
propensity.  A higher number represents more fouling or slagging.  Assumptions used in
weighing the relationship between the key inorganic constituents are based on years of
investigating coal inorganic content and ash deposition mechanisms in a variety of coal
combustion systems.  The indices are not based on complex or comprehensive mechanistic
modeling concepts.  The software is designed to be relatively simple to use, with a minimum
amount of computer processing time.  Criteria used in developing the indices and their relation to
combustion behavior include the quantities of key mineral forms such as small included clays
and quartz, pyrite, and calcite and the quantities of organically bound constituents such as
sodium, calcium, and magnesium.<p>
     The EERC conducted site visits to each utility sponsor in order to obtain samples of feed coal at
the power plant under normal operating conditions, measure gas temperatures in selected regions
of the boiler under normal operating conditions while the test coal is being burned, document
fouling and slagging at temperature measurement locations, and obtain grab samples of deposits
that form during combustion of the test coal.  The temperature measurements and observations,
combined with pertinent boiler operating data logged at the time of the measurements, provide an
elementary database to assist in development of the performance index algorithms.  Four site
visits were completed:  Union Electric's Labadie Station, Minnesota Power's Clay Boswell
Station,  Kansas City Power and Light's Iatan and Hawthorn Stations, and Northern States
Power's Sherburne County Station. <p>
     Preliminary results confirmed PCQUEST as a simple yet powerful screening tool with the
potential to save utilities and consumers thousands of dollars by preventing inefficiencies and
unscheduled plant shutdowns that can occur because of poor coal selection.  The fouling and
slagging indices contained in PCQUEST have performed reasonably well in predicting the
deposition behavior of seven sponsor-selected coals.  PCQUEST is capable of calculating seven
parameters:  1) a fouling index to predict fouling propensity for both high- and low-temperature
zones; 2) an opacity index which uses fly ash resistivity calculated from computer-controlled
scanning electron microscope data; 3) a slag formation index based on the results of chemical
analyses and bench-scale testing; 4) a slag-tapping index based on predicted slag viscosities; 5) a
grinding index to evaluate the potential for mill abrasion based on maceral, mineral, and moisture
variations; 6) a steam tube erosion index founded on both bulk and individual particle
characteristics of the coals; and 7) a sootblowing index to predict the ease or difficulty of
sootblowing for deposits produced when a coal of interest is burned in a particular boiler, based
on coal and ash composition and particle size.  The indices are designed to apply to either
conventional or low-NO<sub>x</sub> conditions and also include more boiler-specific parameters, allowing
for more reliable prediction of the performance of coals in various boilers. <p>

<h2>Combustion Characterization of Beneficiated Coal-Based Fuels </h2> </center> 

<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The ash formed when a coal is burned in a boiler system can reduce process efficiency,
damage equipment, and form potential environmental pollutants.  Some of the problems can be
reduced a priori by specifically designing the boiler system to reduce them.  However,
predictions of specific problems are difficult because the inorganic matter in coal undergoes a
complex series of interactions during combustion as it is turned into ash.  Although a variety
of measures can be taken  to limit the individual difficulties as they occur, removal of the
inorganic material from the coal prior to combustion provides a single solution to many of the
ash-associated operational problems.  All coal beneficiation processes leave behind a portion of
the inorganic material.  In order to investigate the changes in combustion performance and
ash-related problems caused by coal cleaning, the U.S. Department of Energy Pittsburgh
Energy Technology Center has contracted with ABB Combustion Engineering, Inc. (CE), to
determine the combustion characteristics of beneficiated coal-based fuels (BCFs).<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The two main objectives are to develop an engineering database that will provide detailed
information on the properties of BCFs that influence combustion, ash deposition, ash erosion,
and particulate emissions and to apply this technical database to predict the performance and
economic impacts of firing the BCFs in various commercial boiler designs.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The EERC has been working with two other major subcontractors,  the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and PSI Technology Company, to provide experimental, analytical, and
technical assistance to CE in determining the effects of coal beneficiation on combustion
behavior of the fuels.  Approximately fifteen fuels have undergone bench- and pilot-scale
combustion testing to date, including five parent coals and ten beneficiated fuels.  Three
beneficiation processes have been investigated:  the microbubble flotation process, the
spherical oil agglomeration process, and microagglomeration.  In all cases, beneficiation
reduced the ash content of the fuels.  However, some minerals were removed more efficiently
than others, thereby changing the chemical composition and behavior of the remaining ash.  In
some cases, the ash became more problematic than that from the parent coal.

<title>FT-IR Spectroscopic Investigation of
Fireside Deposits in a Pilot Plant
Combustor</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2> FT-IR Spectroscopic Investigation of Fireside Deposits<br> in a Pilot Plant Combustor </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The increasing emphasis on control and, where possible, the elimination of the formation of ash
deposits on heat-exchange surfaces of coal combustion boilers and turbine blades has highlighted
the need for improved understanding of the formation processes and enhanced analytical
techniques.  The type and strength of the deposits formed are dependent on the nature of the coal
(rank, type, mineral composition), the combustion/reducing conditions, the temperature of the
radiant and convective surfaces, and the location and material of the heat-exchange surfaces.<p>
     Low-rank coals in particular, as a consequence of the presence of alkali and alkaline earth
materials, can lead to severe fouling and slagging, but even bituminous coals can yield low-melting-point
phases (e.g., pyrite and illite) that form significant ash deposits on radiative and
convective surfaces.  For most coals, the recalcitrant deposits are largely composed of sulfates or
silicates.  The primary techniques for deposit analysis have been x-ray diffraction and scanning
electron microscopy.  These techniques require samples to be removed from the combustion
system.  Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry has been demonstrated elsewhere to be
a powerful technique for monitoring deposit changes in a bench-scale environment, but its
applicability with an appropriate deposit-viewing geometry at the pilot-scale requires
investigation.  With an FT-IR spectrometer, the EERC has set up a deposit-viewing system
typical of those found in combustion systems, allowing application to field testing.  This project
was undertaken to set up and test an FT-IR spectrometer on a fully operating pilot-scale coal
combustor.<p>
<h3>Objectives </h3>
     The objective of this project was to examine the applicability of an FT-IR spectrometer to
monitor in situ the mineral species causing fouling and slagging deposits in a pilot-scale
coal-fired combustor.  The specific objectives were to correlate spectral changes in the reflected
and emitted energy from deposits to their mineral constituents and to relate the deposit character
to the combustor operating conditions.  This research  also provided information allowing design
of remote-sensing deposit detection techniques, which will be utilized in deposit control
measures.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     In April 1995, the infrared emission sampling probe (IESP) was used to monitor deposits during
16 hours of coal-fired combustion testing.  This test used Antelope (Powder River Basin)
subbituminous coal fired at 1200&#176;C.  Coal-fired tests revealed a minor flaw in the design of the
IESP, causing the objective lens to become covered with fine ash particles.  During the test, the
IESP was modified to eliminate ash buildup on the probe by increasing the lens temperature
above the dew point.  Results of this test have identified  IR wavelengths, which are useful for
determining the thickness of ash and slag deposits.  This type of detection technique will not
require a spectrometer, since it is based on a two-wavelength measurement in the IR. Therefore,
a relatively simple two-wavelength detector system can be designed that uses the IESP as an
interface to the furnace and that can act as a deposit monitor.<p>
     Assuming successful field testing with the IESP-FT-IR spectrometer, it is envisaged that this
new technology be applied to power generation facilities for control of sootblowing.  The probe
would be modified to use flexible fiber-optic cables to transfer infrared emissions from the IESP
to the spectrometer. Several IESP units may be multiplexed to a single spectrometer, allowing
monitoring of several points in the combustion system.  Information obtained from the IESP
would be used by process control hardware in the combustion system to control sootblowing.<p>

<title>Root Cause Analysis for the
Independence Plant Explosion</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Root Cause Analysis for the Independence Plant Explosion </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     On Wednesday, August 11, 1993, the Unit Two boiler at the Entergy Independence Plant
exploded, resulting in severe structural damage.  Fortunately, no one was seriously injured.  At
the time of this work, the cause of the explosion was not clearly known or understood.  To assist
Entergy in determining the root cause of the problem/incident, the EERC was contracted to
analyze four ash samples in hopes that information discovered during the investigation could be
used to provide insight into the circumstances/conditions that led to the failure.  The four
samples studied were extracted from different locations throughout the Unit Two boiler after the
explosion.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     Specific objectives for analyzing these ash samples were as follows:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Characterize physical and chemical properties of the ash samples<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Identify mechanisms of formation<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Estimate combustion conditions under which the samples were formed<br>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Four ash/deposit samples were analyzed to aid in evaluating the cause of the explosion at the
Independence Plant.  The following is a brief description of the Independence Plant and the ash
samples that were received by the EERC.<p>
<h3>Plant Description</h3>

     The Independence Plant consists of two Combustion Engineering 800-MW pulverized coal units
firing western subbituminous coal at a maximum firing rate of 492 tons/hour.  The boilers are
tangentially fired and have a furnace division wall extending from the bottom ash hopper to the
nose.  Furnace zones are referred to as Furnace A and Furnace B.  Each boiler has a total of 64
burners evenly divided among eight burner levels.  Because of the division wall, there are eight
burners per level:  four at the outside corners and four at the division wall corners.  Each boiler is
capable of producing 6,023,000 lb/hr of steam at 1000&#176;F and 2400 psi at turbine throttle
conditions.  Coal is provided to each burner level by a separate pulverizer, for a total of eight
pulverizers.  Each pulverizer is rated at 100 tons/hr, with six of the eight pulverizers normally
needed in service for full load, one in ready reserve standby, and one out for routine
maintenance.  Bottom ash is conveyed through a wet sluice system manufactured by United
Conveyor System.  The bottom ash is removed through one of two sluice lines fed from the three
bottom ash hoppers via one of six clinker grinders.<p>
<h3>Location of Ash Samples </h3>
     A total of four ash samples were collected by personnel of Arkansas Power &amp; Light (AP&amp;L),
a
subsidiary of Entergy, and shipped to the EERC for analysis.  The samples were collected at
strategic locations from the Unit 2 boiler after the explosion.  One sample was collected from the
slope tubes just above the Hopper C opening, and the other three samples were taken from
Hoppers A, B, and C.<p>
<h3>Appearance of Ash Samples</h3>

     All ash samples were visually inspected, and observations are summarized below.<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Furnace B sample.  This sample is brownish yellow (somewhat rusty) in color,
exhibiting an irregular, coarse surface typical of sintering ash particles.  <br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Hopper A sample.  This sample is light to dark brown in color and has a granular
(or sandlike) particle structure.  Throughout the sample, there are larger, friable agglomerations.  <br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Hopper B sample.  This sample is gray in color, with a uniform surface structure.
A cross-sectional view of the sample shows internal and external mineral structure to be similar. <br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Hopper C sample.  This sample is gray to dark black in color, with a somewhat
glassy appearance and a uniform surface structure.  A cross-sectional view of the sample shows internal and
external characteristics to be similar, but highlights the existence of large gas bubbles during formation.  <br> 
</ul>

 The EERC applied advanced analytical methods to investigate the characteristics of four ash
samples.  Analytical lab data/results for each sample were interpreted and studied in an attempt
to determine the mineral transformations that occurred during combustion and the conditions
under which the samples were formed.  Each sample was examined to determine its crystalline
and/or amorphous phases and chemical composition distribution.  The morphology of each
sample was investigated to determine the mechanism of formation (i.e., impaction, coalescence,
condensation) and the degree of sintering that occurred.  With these data and the chemical
composition data provided from microbeam analysis, the viscosity of each sample was calculated
for various compositions to determine the temperature under which the samples formed. 
Thermochemical equilibrium computer models were run under simulated combustion conditions
to support phase formation analysis.  <p>

     In short, the four samples analyzed contained no evidence of volatile components or explosive
matter that would have contributed to the explosion at the Independence Plant Unit Two boiler. 
In particular, there was no evidence of surface incorporation of carbon or reduced species, which
would indicate burner flameout or an unburned coal and/or a gasification zone.  However, such
evidence simply may not have been present in the samples received for investigation.

<title>Combustion and Ash Characterization   of Selected Coals</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Combustion and Ash Characterization of Selected Coals </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Coal fly ash quality and consistency are of the utmost importance to successful commercial
marketing of fly ash.  It is well documented that coal fly ash characteristics vary with different
feed coals, utility systems, and operating parameters; however, coal fly ash characteristics can
be expected to be consistent within a range from a single electric generation facility given a
consistent feed coal.  Changes in coal type or characteristics have the potential to greatly
impact the characteristics of the coal by-products produced.  Since coal fly ash is the most
commonly utilized by-product, the characteristics, quality, and consistency of that specific
material are very significant to the coal by-product industry.  Changes in the quality of the
coal fly ash are a concern to both the producer and marketer.  Historical evidence has shown
that the unsuccessful use of coal fly ash has a broad-reaching impact on the coal fly ash market
within a region.  Since changes in the coal result in changes in the by-products, it is a
reasonable precaution to pretest a coal for ash production prior to implementing its use by a
station currently utilizing and marketing its by-products.  Characteristics and utilization of coal
fly ash are widely researched, and numerous publications are available on a wide variety of
applications.  The most common use of coal fly ash is in cement and concrete products.<p>

     The Rosebud SynCoal Partnership produces a beneficiated coal (SynCoal) from a Montana
subbituminous coal for use in coal-fired electric utilities.  The Rosebud SynCoal Partnership
believes the SynCoal will provide benefits to the utilities when blended and combusted with
the subbituminous coal.  Rosebud SynCoal is produced from coal obtained from the Rosebud
mine.  Coal from the same mine and seam is utilized in the Montana Power Corette Station. 
The Corette Station coal fly ash is successfully marketed and used in Montana and throughout
the region.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project were to produce fly ash from the Rosebud SynCoal in a
bench-scale reactor at the EERC and to compare the characteristics of that fly ash to Corette
Station fly ash.<p>
     The EERC has bench-scale combustion facilities that can provide information regarding the
behavior of a fuel under specific combustion conditions.  One such bench-scale combustor, the
atmospheric drop-tube furnace (ADTF), can produce fly ash for chemical and mineralogical
characterization at a low cost.  The EERC has an experienced coal by-products research staff
familiar with these materials and conventional as well as advanced use applications.  <p>
<h3>Results</h2>
     Limited chemical and mineralogical characterization techniques applied to the Rosebud SynCoal
ash produced in the ADTF provided information to indicate the potential impact on utilization of
ash produced at a pulverized coal-fired unit using Rosebud SynCoal blended with subbituminous
coal.  The bulk chemical compositions of the SynCoal ash and the Corette fly ash are very
similar.  Some differences can be noted in the concentrations of the major components; however,
these differences are within the range typical over time in coal fly ash samples from a single
electric generation unit firing a single coal.  According to American Society for Testing and
Materials chemical specifications, the Corette fly ash chemical composition fits the Class C
designation, while the SynCoal ash fits the Class F designation.  The calcium content of both
materials, reported as CaO, is relatively high and indicates that these materials may have the
potential to be self-hardening or cementitious.  Cementitious behavior is typical of Class C fly
ash.  The qualitative, empirical hydration test performed indicated that the SynCoal ash as well
as the Corette fly ash may have some cementitious properties.  The empirical heat of hydration
test required a subjective evaluation of both heat generation and hardening, and the results should
only be given limited consideration.  The two materials did appear to behave similarly on
hydration, but larger quantities of ash should be evaluated in a more objective and quantitative
procedure to provide definitive information on the cementitious nature of the materials.  Overall,
the bulk chemical composition of the two ash samples was very similar, and the chemical
composition of the SynCoal ash is similar to other samples of low-rank coal fly ash represented
in the EERC's Coal Ash Properties Database (CAPD).

<title>Predicting Fireside Performance of
Powder River Basin Fuels</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Predicting Fireside Performance of Powder River Basin Fuels </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     Knowledge of the propensity of a coal to form fouling and slagging deposits in coal-fired utility
boilers is of great practical and economic interest to coal suppliers and users, particularly when a
new coal is being considered for use.  The EERC has developed a set of indices that are
calculated using a newly developed software package called Predictive Coal Quality Effects
Screening Tool (PCQUEST).  PCQUEST uses advanced coal analysis techniques to predict
fouling and slagging behavior without the necessity of expensive pilot- or full-scale test burns. 
PCQUEST was used in this project to evaluate the fireside performance of coals in pulverized
coal-fired boilers.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of the work performed here was to analyze several Powder River Basin (PRB)
coals and use the analyses for calculation of PCQUEST slagging and fouling indices.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Five PRB coals were evaluated for ash deposition behavior.  Coal samples were ground to a
standard combustion grind of 70%-80% -200 mesh and then analyzed using proximate/ultimate,
ash fusion, computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM), SEM image analysis
(SEM-IA), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), and chemical fractionation.<p>
     CCSEM yields information on the quantity and size distribution of mineral grains within the
coal, whereas  chemical fractionation quantifies the finest size fraction (less than 1 micron in diameter) of
minerals and other inorganic material in coal.  In general, the proximate/ultimate analysis and ash
fusion analyses were typical of  western subbituminous PRB coals.  XRF analysis showed that
silicon, aluminum, calcium, and sulfur are the dominant elements present, along with lesser
amounts of magnesium and iron.  Chemical fractionation results indicated that the bulk of the
calcium, magnesium, and sodium were organically bound.  A significant portion of potassium
and phosphorus was also organically bound, as was a small portion of iron and titanium. 
Approximately half of the total mineral content was equally divided between quartz and
kaolinite.  Montmorillonite, pyrite, and calcium-aluminum phosphate species were also present
in significant amounts. <p>
     The results of the preceding analyses were used to calculate fouling and slagging indices for the
coal samples.  High-temperature fouling indices indicated low to moderate fouling in the front of
the convective pass for all of the coals analyzed.  Low-temperature fouling was predicted to be
high for two of the coals.  Blends of the coals showing greater low-temperature deposit formation
with two of the low-fouling coals were nearly identical in predicted fouling and slagging
behavior.  The slagging indices, which are an indication of the slagging propensity in the lower
furnace box, indicated medium slagging potential for all of the coals.<p>

<title>Combustion and Environmental Control
System Performance Evaluation</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Combustion and Environmental Control System Performance Evaluation </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background </h3>
     Information relating coal quality to the performance of boiler and environmental control
equipment is critical to both the coal producer and user.  Of particular concern is the impact of
coal mineral matter on boiler fouling and particulate emissions.  Pilot-scale testing can
significantly aid in developing needed information, but requires the existence of defined
correlations between pilot- and full-scale systems.  To assist electric utilities, industrial coal
users, and mining companies interested in coal combustion behavior, the EERC operates a
combustion test service to provide basic pilot-scale data on individual coals and coal blends.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The test service provides standardized test data that can be used to evaluate new coal supplies,
assess coal quality impacts on proposed and existing combustion systems, and predict the effects
of coal blending, switching, and beneficiation on combustor performance.  Services provided to
previous customers included the determination of ash-fouling rates and the strength,
composition, and structure of fouling deposits; the evaluation of the effectiveness of additives to
mitigate boiler tube and ash fouling; the evaluation of electrostatic precipitator (ESP)
performance; the evaluation of combustion characteristics of coal-water slurries; the
investigation of high-temperature baghouse operation and performance; the evaluation of sorbent
injection for SO<sub>2</sub> control; and the evaluation of flame stability as a function of swirl under full
load and turndown.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Combustion tests were performed on the EERC's combustion test facility (CTF), a bottom-fired,
refractory-lined furnace that generates between 130 and 160 scfm of flue gas, depending on the
firing rate.  Various combustion tests have been performed for the clients listed.  Since most of
the projects involved proprietary information, results of individual test programs cannot be
presented here.  The following is a general description of the procedures used to evaluate
combustion characteristics of solid fuels.  Although some of the procedures described do not
apply, coal-water fuels have also been evaluated extensively in the CTF.<p>
    To assess fouling potential, each fuel was fired at a rate sufficient to maintain a specified furnace
exit gas temperature and excess air level, usually between 2000&#176; and 2200&#176;F at 20% to 30%
excess air.  Fuel feed rates and air flows were adjusted accordingly to maintain the specified
operating conditions.  Fouling deposits were collected on steam-cooled probes for a duration of
5.25 hours on each fuel.  Typically, the deposits were removed, weighed, and analyzed using
standard ASTM techniques and advanced, scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. 
Deposit characteristics, composition and morphology were compared with fuel characteristics to
determine the transformations resulting in deposit growth and strength development.  The
majority of the more than 700 tests performed to date were performed to characterize the
differences between a baseline fuel and a new fuel or fuel blend.  Where appropriate, deposit
characteristics were compared with previous, nonproprietary results to give a relative indication
of fouling potential.  Pilot-scale deposits have compared favorably with those formed at full
scale.<p>
     To assess ESP performance, dust-loading measurements were taken at the inlet and exit of the
pilot ESP using EPA Method 5.  The pilot ESP is a single-wire, tubular precipitator that is 8 ft
tall.  A portion of the flue gas was diverted through the ESP to maintain a velocity of
approximately 5 ft/sec, resulting in a specific collection area of approximately 160 ft<sup>2</sup>/1000
acfm. 
The voltage was set at the maximum level attainable without sparkover, usually about 60 kV. 
Sampling was performed concurrently with fouling tests over a 5.25-hr test period.  Inlet and
outlet samples were isokinetically extracted simultaneously during each of three sampling
periods.  One of the inlet samples taken during each test was performed using a multicyclone to
establish the fly ash size distribution.  The ESP was rapped at the completion of each sample
period, and ash was collected in a hopper for analysis.  Similar to fouling deposits, ash samples
were submitted for standard ASTM analyses and advanced SEM analyses.  Fly ash resistivity
was determined by laboratory methods to determine resistivity as a function of temperature.<p>

     To assess flame stability, the standard burner was replaced by a secondary air swirl generator
designed to International Flame Research Foundation (IFRF) specifications.  The IFRF-type
burner uses movable blocks to impart a swirl to the secondary air.  Swirl is defined at the ratio of
radial momentum to axial momentum.  Swirl was adjusted to determine the range of stability for
each fuel at full load and turndown.  Measurements were taken at each swirl setting to establish
combustor operating conditions including air flow rates, fuel feed rates, gas composition, flame
temperature, and furnace wall heat flux.  Photographs of the flame were also taken at each setting
to provide a visual record of flame shape, location, and intensity.  Fly ash samples were collected
to establish carbon levels as a function of swirl setting.<p>
    Fuels tested have come from domestic and international sources and have represented all ranks of
coal (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignitic coals), as well as petroleum coke and other
process-derived fuels.  In addition to the standard tests described, special tests have also been
devised, such as a 100-hour test designed to investigate corrosion in conjunction with fouling and
ESP performance.  <p>
     Much of the current work has centered around the effects of fuel blending.  One ongoing project
is a multiclient joint venture to determine the effects on boiler operation of blending eastern
noncompliant bituminous coals with subbituminous coals from the Powder River Basin.  The
project will evaluate the effect of the blend on mill performance, flame stability, furnace wall
slagging, boiler tube ash fouling, and ESP performance.  There has also been considerable
interest in the utilization of petroleum coke as a supplemental fuel for power production. 
Combustion testing of petroleum coke has been performed on various blends with lignites and
subbituminous coals as well as at 100%.<p>

<title>Slagging and Fouling Assessment of Coal
and Coal Chars</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Slagging and Fouling Assessment of Coal and Coal Chars</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     In the past several years, the Illinois Clean Coal Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) have funded research programs to produce premium liquids by the mild gasification of
coal.  The principal by-product is a char which still contains a considerable amount of sulfur. 
Reducing the sulfur level could create a market for the char as a utility fuel blend.  A program to
reduce the char sulfur level was instituted by the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) through
an integrated process of physical coal cleaning, mild gasification, and char desulfurization.  A
portion of this program was an evaluation of the slagging and fouling propensity of the chars and
coal-char blends, which would impact their suitability as a fuel feedstock.<p>

     A coal and two coal-char blends were submitted by the ISGS for evaluation of their fouling and
slagging propensity.  The coal was an Illinois Basin coal designated IBC-102.  One of the
coal-char blends was made from this coal by a low-temperature oxidation process, followed by
blending with the original coal.  This blend was designated LTO char + IBC-102 blend.  The
second coal-char blend was produced by adding hydrated lime, oxidizing under
high-temperature conditions, and blending with the original coal.  This second char was
designated HSAHL CFCO char + IBC-102 coal.  For the purposes of this summary, the materials
are referred to as "coal," "LTO char blend," and "HSAHL char blend."  This project was
undertaken as a joint venture program in collaboration with the DOE Morgantown Energy
Technology Center.  <p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of the project was to evaluate the fouling and slagging propensity of the coal and
coal-char blends as part of a determination of the suitability of the coal-char blends as a utility
boiler feedstock.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The coal and blends were examined with conventional proximate/ultimate analysis, Malvern
particle sizing, and x-ray fluorescence analysis (XRFA), as well as by advanced
computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM).  Deposits from the coal and blends
were produced in an optical drop-tube furnace (ODTF) combustion facility.  Deposit growth
rates, sticking coefficients, and crushing strengths were determined under simulated fouling and
slagging conditions, and initial slagging temperatures were determined under simulated slagging
conditions.<p>
    The results of the analyses were used as input to PHOEBE, a program that predicts mineral
phases and viscosities as a function of temperature, based on equilibrium thermodynamics and
XRFA.  The coal composition data obtained from proximate/ultimate, XRF, and CCSEM
analysis were entered into an in-house EERC program which produces a fouling and slagging
index.  This index produces a unitless number indicative of the degree of fouling or slagging
propensity.  The index results were then compared with those of other Illinois Basin coals.  All
diagnostic tests and calculations showed that the HSAHL char blend would cause severe
slagging, high-temperature fouling and, possibly, low-temperature fouling problems.<p>
     The coal was seen to be slightly worse than the LTO char blend for slagging and high-temperature
fouling behavior.  Both the coal and LTO char blend slagging behaviors were
similar to that of an Illinois No. 6 coal and are controllable.  <p>
     If considered as a boiler feedstock, the LTO char blend would be the most attractive because of
lower slagging and fouling potential, lower sulfur content, and higher Btu content than the parent
coal.<p>

<title>Preparation and Combustion of
Yugoslavian Lignite</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Preparation and Combustion of Yugoslavian Lignite </h2></center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Coal-water fuels are the most promising of all alternative coal-based fuels.  The traditional
coal-exporting countries of East Central Europe have a strong interest in this new market for
coal.  Converting coal into an easily transported liquid fuel could make it an ideal candidate to
displace not only costly imported oil, but also the more polluting high-sulfur coal from other
mines in Eastern Europe.  The economic merits of coal-water fuels are attractive because on a
heating unit basis, coal is cheaper than oil.  The quasi-liquid form maintains that differential,
since the higher cost of dry bulk coal handling and storage is avoided.  The technology opens up
new markets to coal producers, while it offers price stability and security of supply for the fuel
end users.<p>
     Yugoslavia's interest in lignite-water fuel (LWF) stems from its involvement in an unusual
power project at Kovin in northern Serbia.  In the early 1980s, Electric Power of Serbia (EPS)
proposed constructing a 600-MW power plant that would be fueled by lignite found in deposits
along and under the Danube River.  Trial coal-dredging operations have successfully been
completed.  The government of Serbia and EPS have decided to continue developing the
dredging technique and investing in the mine over a 6-year period.<p>
     Since dredging methods produce a coal slurry containing 85% to 90% water, a consortium of
Yugoslavian companies has entered into a scientific agreement with the EERC to assess the
conversion of dredged lignite into a LWF using hot-water-drying (HWD) technology.  HWD is a
high-temperature, nonevaporative drying technique carried out under high pressure in water that
permanently alters the structure of low-rank coals.  Changes effected by the drying process
include irreversible removal of moisture, micropore sealing by tar, and enhancement of heating
value by removal of oxygen, thus enhancement of the slurrying ability of the coal with water.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this project was to determine the response of Kovin lignite to physical cleaning
and hydrothermal treatment.  An assessment of the fuel performance was to be made, using an
integrated scenario that included cleaning prior to HWD in order to produce premium
replacement fuel for retrofitted oil-fired boiler systems.  The evaluation included combustion
characteristics and combustion efficiencies of the potential fuels.  The prospective fuel behavior
of the mixtures was also to be determined with respect to a review of the potential pipeline
system as well as a preliminary technical and economic evaluation for producing and
transporting HWD LWF from Kovin lignite.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Two lignite samples were received from the Danube dredging test area for bench-scale testing
using EERC equipment.  Physical cleaning results on one sample indicated a 51 wt% reduction
in ash content, with a 76 wt% yield for the lignite.  In addition, physical cleaning produced a
cleaned slurry that had a higher attainable solids loading than a raw, uncleaned coal slurry. 
Combustion studies were then performed on the raw and physically cleaned samples, with the
results indicating both samples were very reactive, making them excellent candidates for HWD. 
Bench-scale results showed that HWD increased energy densities of the two raw lignite samples
by approximately 63% and 81%.<p>
     An order-of-magnitude cost estimate was conducted by the EERC to evaluate the HWD and
pipeline transport of Kovin LWF to domestic and export markets in Europe and to determine
selling prices of the fuel.  The delivered selling price of LWF per MMBtu, assuming a 10%
return on investment, was estimated to be US$3.90, US$2.90, and US$2.55 for a 1-, 3-, and
5-MMton/yr plant, respectively.  Alternately, for these respective plant sizes, the delivered
selling price per ton was estimated at US$46.80, US$34.80, and US$30.60.  <p>
     The Yugoslavian energy sector has been devastated by ongoing war, reshuffling energy flows
into several separate zones.  Whatever the outcome of the civil war, major concerns will be,
again, imported oil and increasing environmental restrictions on conventional power plants. 
Accordingly, dredging and HWD now make LWF a viable fuel option for electric power
generation in Yugoslavia.<p>

<title>Lignite Resource Characterization and
Evaluation for Mitigation of Ash
Deposition</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2> Lignite Resource Characterization and Evaluation <br>for Mitigation of Ash Deposition </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. (MDU) Coyote Station near Beulah, North Dakota, is a one-unit,
400-net-MW cyclone-fired boiler.  The unit has been experiencing costly ash slagging and
fouling.  The plant is a minemouth plant burning lignite from the Knife River Coal Mining
Company (KRCMC) Beulah mine, with no alternative fuel source.  The EERC is coordinating a
research effort to evaluate and optimize plant and mine operations with respect to ash-fouling
and slagging occurrences as they relate to characteristics inherently found in lignite from the
Beulah mine.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The overall goal of this project is to maximize the quality of the  coal delivered from the Beulah
mine and to minimize the slagging and fouling severity at the Coyote Station.  Two key
deliverables are required to meet this goal:  1) development of a reliable indicator and/or
predictor of coal quality in terms of fouling and slagging behavior and 2) identification of
optimum fuel blends and plant operating conditions and procedures that will minimize
problematic slagging and fouling.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     A planning meeting was held at the Coyote Station to coordinate a future on-line boiler test for
determining the root causes of problematic ash deposition at the station.  Boiler sampling
locations were identified during a lengthy boiler tour.  A boiler survey is being put together by
EERC engineers  and MDU operators to assess current boiler operation.  A site visit was also
made to the mine.  Several core samples of coal were acquired from KRCMC for two currently
mined pits.  The coals are representative of fuel that will be fed to the boiler within the next two
years.  Work has begun on devising an algorithm that will predict slagging and fouling potential
for coal, which corresponds to specific locations in the mine.  This algorithm will be used to
develop blending strategies and to institute planned, controlled fouling and slagging mitigation
measures.

<title>Commercialization of the Controlled
Spontaneous Reactor</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Commercialization of the Controlled Spontaneous Reactor</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     A novel concept was developed during previous programs at the EERC.  This fuel upgrading
system takes advantage of several of the unique properties of western subbituminous coals and
lignites.  It is projected that this system, which can use low (stack)-temperature flue gas as the
primary working fluid, can be customized to serve a number of facilities as a primary fuel
conditioner.  The process centers around a controlled spontaneous reactor (CSR).<p>
     The system can be operated and controlled over a wide range of temperatures, and offers an
excellent opportunity to provide users of subbituminous and lignite coal with an effective,
inexpensive tool to accomplish the following:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  A fuel conditioner to regain unit capacity in bituminous units switching to
subbituminous coals</br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> A fuel conditioner to improve subbituminous coal accommodation in cyclone-fired
boilers designed for bituminous coals</br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Reburning for NO<sub>x</sub> control in cyclone-fired boilers</br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  A dryer for subbituminous coals and lignites<br>

 <IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> A fuel conditioner for all types of fluid-bed combustors (FBCs) to increase
capacity, provide greater fuel flexibility, and improve turndown, start-up, and shutdown characteristics<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Char production from subbituminous coals and lignites<br>
</ul>
In addition to the use of flue gas as the primary working fluid and operation over a wide range of
temperatures (100&#176;-1300&#176;F), the CSR has several unique characteristics:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Very high throughput--relatively small size<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Simplicity of operation and control<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">   A wide range of feedstock particle sizes (up to 4-in. top size) accepted<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Significant moisture reduction achievable at relatively low operating
temperatures<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Product particle size affected by design and operating parameters<br>
</ul>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The EERC has taken the CSR through the proof-of-concept stage and has a patent pending on the
technology.  The overall objective of the EERC and Otter Tail Power Company is the
commercialization of the CSR.  The steps by which this new technology can be moved in a
timely fashion from the proof-of-concept stage to and through installation and operation in a
commercial plant have been identified.  The objective of this effort is to ensure performance of
the necessary steps in an effort that develops a product to serve the widest possible market in the
most cost-effective manner (maximum attractiveness to utilities) and, upon completion of the
technical development program, results in a product that can quickly move into the marketplace. 
Specific goals of Phase I are to establish a vendor/manufacturer as a commercialization partner,
assess the market potential for the various applications, perform preliminary budgetary
calculations, and perform the first-level design effort for a pilot plant to develop scaleup data.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     One segment of the market targeted early in the program was cyclone-fired boilers.  These
boilers currently have limited options for NO<sub>x</sub> control, with the CSR potentially offering a low-cost
option. 
Current uncertainty in the regulatory statutes have caused this option to be
temporarily put on hold.  If regulations are put into effect for cyclones, over 100 units producing
over 26,000 MW of electricity will be affected.<p>
     The second segment of the market addressed was those utilities suffering derates as the result of
switching from bituminous to low-sulfur subbituminous coal.  It is anticipated that
approximately half of those utilities required to lower sulfur emissions to meet Phase I and II
standards will switch fuels.  The CSR will be an attractive option for regaining lost capacity at a
time when competition between power producers is increasing.<p>
     The EERC currently has not actively pursued markets for the other potential uses of the CSR.  A
pilot-scale design of a 3-ton/hr CSR has been completed.  This design not only provides the
flexibility to obtain the final data required for scaleup, but also integrates a test furnace to allow
testing of the reburn applications.<p>
     Otter Tail Power Company and the EERC are working together to find a partner to help
commercialize the CSR. <p>

<h1>Mitigation of SO<sub>3</sub> During Combustion of Venezuelan Flexicoke</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The Lagoven Amuay refinery in Venezuela is one of the world's largest oil refineries. 
Processing of the crude at this facility produces a petroleum coke by-product that has a high ash
content composed mainly of vanadium and nickel.  The high vanadium content of the coke
makes it an attractive source of this element.  Past operations have generated massive quantities
of the high-vanadium-content coke, which are currently stockpiled at the refinery site.  To reduce
the stockpile, produce some process steam, and recover the vanadium in the coke, the refinery is
in the process of building two pulverized coke-fired boilers.  The fly ash generated will be
collected in a pulse-jet baghouse facility.  Previous work performed at the EERC determined the
combustion properties of the fuel, the ash fouling and slagging propensity, and the corrosion
potential during combustion.  The work also indicated a potentially troublesome application for a
baghouse, with very acidic ash species collected on the fabric filter and accumulated on metal
surfaces of the baghouse and postbaghouse ductwork.  The acidic ash species were the suspected
result of increased flue gas SO<sub>3</sub> content resulting from the presence of vanadium pentoxide in
the fly ash.  Vanadium pentoxide will act as a catalyst in the flue gas ductwork, converting SO<sub>2</sub>
to SO<sub>3</sub>.  Condensed acid species and vanadium sulfate compounds were found to have been
formed either prior to collection or upon reaction with flue gas SO<sub>2</sub>/SO<sub>3</sub> in the
baghouse.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives </h2>
     The goals of this project were to determine the level of SO<sub>3</sub> present in the flue gas, its
mechanism of formation, and baghouse performance with and without using a hydrated lime sorbent precoat
for control of the flue gas SO<sub>3</sub> content.  Pilot plant studies and laboratory tests and analyses
were performed to fulfill project goals.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Two 100-hour tests were performed on the particulate test combustor (PTC) at the EERC
combustion pilot plant. During the first test, the flexicoke was fired to determine the baseline
concentrations of SO<sub>3</sub> and the collectibility of the fly ash in a pulse-jet baghouse.  Baghouse
operating parameters were established through discussions with the baghouse vendor, ABB
Environmental Systems.  Results indicated that the baghouse would perform adequately with no
hydrated lime precoat; however, levels of SO<sub>3</sub> generated were at or near their dew point at the
expected operating temperature of the baghouse.  During the second week of testing, hydrated
lime was used to precoat the fabric filters to capture the SO<sub>3</sub> in the flue gas, preventing these
species from corroding baghouse components.  Baghouse performance was shown to improve
with the precoat, and levels of flue gas SO<sub>3</sub> leaving the baghouse were reduced.  <p>
<p>
     Laboratory analyses were performed to provide insight into the mechanism of formation and also
to characterize fly ash properties.  Hygroscopicity testing was performed to determine the degree
to which the fly ash will sorb moisture from the air as a function of temperature.  The acidic
nature of these ash species had been shown to form sulfate hydrates that are very hygroscopic.  In
fact, a sample of dry ash exposed to ambient conditions in the combustion pilot plant sorbed
enough moisture from the atmosphere to form a liquid phase.  Therefore, the nature of the ash
will have a significant impact on ash-handling systems at the refinery.  In addition, the heat
capacity of the fly ash was also determined as a function of temperature for use in heat balances
surrounding the ash-handling system.  To determine the extent of SO<sub>3</sub> formation in the baghouse,
a series of laboratory tests were performed exposing the ash generated during pilot tests to a
constant SO<sub>2</sub> level.  Results indicated that SO<sub>3</sub> can be formed at normal baghouse
operating  temperatures from the catalytic reaction of SO<sub>2</sub> over a supported  vanadium catalyst
(fly ash held by the fabric filters).  For this reason, it was recommended that periodic injection of the sorbent
be performed at full scale to capture any SO<sub>3</sub> present in the flue gas entering the baghouse and
that portion generated in the baghouse.

<title>Power Generation from an Alaskan
Low-Rank Coal-Water Fuel (Little Tonzona Creek Coal)</title>
</head>

<h1> Power Generation from an Alaskan Low-Rank Coal-Water Fuel (Little Tonzona Creek Coal)  </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Alaska's estimated coal resources total over 5 trillion tons.  Almost all those of immediate
significance, those close to year-round ports or to the Alaskan Railroad, are low-rank coals
(LRCs).  Like their counterparts worldwide, Alaskan LRCs suffer from high inherent moisture,
which usually restricts their use and has, until the breakthrough in LRC beneficiation technology
at the EERC, prevented their use in the expanding coal-water fuel (CWF) market.  Conventional
evaporative drying processes are useful only if the dried coal is used immediately; otherwise
moisture reabsorption or severe handling problems arise, including dust generation and
spontaneous combustion.  The extremely low sulfur content of most Alaskan coals, usually
below 0.2 wt%, would make them a highly sought fuel if they could be converted into
concentrated CWFs or stable, dried LRC aggregates.<p>
<p>
     Hot-water drying (HWD) is a nonevaporative drying process that offers an efficient means to
dewater LRCs while producing a safe, easily transported liquid fuel.  HWD is a high-temperature/high-pressure
process that causes chemical changes, reducing the equilibrium
moisture levels in LRCs to levels comparable to those of bituminous coals.  HWD enables the
production of low-rank coal-water fuels (LRCWFs) with solids loadings rivaling those made
from high-rank coals and with energy densities approaching those of the raw coals, without the
requirement for costly additives.<p>
     LRCWFs are designed to replace heavy oil and/or bituminous CWF in existing oil-fired boilers,
not to replace bulk steam coal.  The use of CWFs is being aggressively pursued by both Japan
and Korea to produce a lower-cost, more stable supply of liquid fuel.  The magnitude of the
potential market for CWFs can be gauged by the consumption levels of heavy oil in electric
utilities in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan alone.  In 1990, the combined total of 200 million barrels of
oil used by utilities in these countries was equivalent to about 80 million tonnes of LRCWF.  In
addition to the enormous export market potential, there is a growing need to develop a low-cost
substitute for the costly, highly subsidized fuel oil used in remote North American communities.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives of the first phase of the project were to determine the technical feasibility of
producing clean-burning LRCWF from Beluga Coal Company's subbituminous coal, located
west of Anchorage, Alaska; to assess the process economics and export market potential; and to
design a commercial demonstration program.  The second-phase objectives were to assess the
potential of HWD interior Alaskan LRCs to produce stable bulk coal and/or LRCWF, to
determine the combustion efficiencies of the beneficiated coal, and to assess transportation
options for remote Alaskan applications.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
<h3>Phase 1</h3>
<p>
     The technical feasibility of producing a premium LRCWF from the Beluga coal was
demonstrated in the EERC HWD pilot plant.  The LRCWF was tested in the EERC combustion
test facility, giving almost complete carbon burnout, low boiler tube fouling, and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions
well below even the most stringent air quality standards.  A preliminary economic assessment
indicates that Alaskan LRCWFs could be delivered to Japan at costs well below those for
imported fuel oil and competitive with imported bituminous CWFs made in China.  Based on
these encouraging economics, the Alaskan Low-Rank Coal Consortium was formed by the
EERC, Hobbs Industries, Inc., and Usibelli Coal Mine, Inc., and has developed a program to
demonstrate the technology in a small commercial power station in Anchorage, Alaska. 
Cofunding for the demonstration project is being sought from the state of Alaska, the Department
of Energy, and a number of private end users in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim countries. <p>
<p>
<h3>Phase 2</h3>
<p>
     A team composed of the EERC, the Mineral Industry Research Laboratory (MIRL) of the
University of Alaska- Fairbanks, Doyon, Ltd., an ANCSA Corporation, and the Alaska Division
of Energy, formerly the Alaska Energy Authority, has initiated characterization and HWD tests
of Doyon's Little Tonzona Coalfield (LTC) coal, a subbituminous coal from Alaska's interior.<p>
<p>
    After field work by Doyon, Ltd., and MIRL, bench-scale testing was performed at the EERC
with the following conclusions:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The easily recovered reserves in the LTC coal are sufficient to warrant continued
efforts on Doyon's part to use LTC as a fuel for local boilers.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  It would be feasible to develop a small, local mine to supply several villages near
the LTC.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Use of a local indigenous fuel would significantly lessen the impact of the loss of
Power Cost <br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Equalization subsidies, while providing additional jobs in the region.<br> 
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Most of the ash in LTC coal is inherent rather than extraneous and, therefore, 
not easily removed by conventional physical cleaning techniques.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> LTC coal responded well to HWD, and LRCWFs with solids content over 60% were
easily achievable.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  LTC, with or without HWD, showed high reactivity and nearly complete carbon
burnout even at reduced residence times in the drop-tube furnace.<br>
</ul>
<p>
     Approximately 600 kg of LRCWF made from HWD LTC coal was produced in the EERC
7.5-ton/day continuous HWD unit.  Results from pilot-scale HWD indicated a reduction in
equilibrium moisture from 30 to 16 wt%, with the heating value increasing from 7080 to 9400
Btu/lb and the LRCWF energy density improving by over 36%.  Bench-scale HWD results had
indicated an energy density increase of 45% for similar temperature and pressure treatment.  The
difference was caused by the extended residence time above 200&#176;C for bench-scale testing.<p>
<p>
     Pilot-scale testing in the CTF indicated excellent combustion properties, with carbon conversion
greater than 99.25%.  The fouling deposits collected were very low in weight and indicated a
very low fouling potential for the Little Tonzona CWF.  The low fouling potential was attributed
to the low sodium content of the CWF. <p>
<p>
     Sulfur dioxide emissions were reported at 1025 ppm (1.94 lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu).  Compared with
the input sulfur content of 2.63 lb of SO<sub>2</sub>/MMBtu, there is an apparent 26% sulfur retention in
ash.  NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were recorded at 531 ppm (0.72 lb of NOx/MMBtu) and indicate the
potential for higher NO<sub>x</sub> levels at full scale.  Electrostatic precipitator (ESP) performance tests
indicated a somewhat lower collection efficiency (98.66%) for Little Tonzona CWF.  This most
likely reflects the low sodium content of the fuel (0.2% Na<sub>2</sub>O in ash) and the small size of the
pilot-scale ESP (SCA=159 ft<sup>2</sup>/1000 acfm).  It is recommended that care be taken to adequately
size the full-scale ESP or provide for SO<sub>2</sub> conditioning.<p>

<title>Fuel Evaluation for Fluidized-Bed</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Fuel Evaluation for Fluidized-Bed Combustion</h2> </center> 

<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The design fuel and any potential fuels that may be used in an atmospheric fluidized-bed
combustor (AFBC) system must be specified prior to the design of the system, as fuel
properties can have a significant impact on design and operation.  These design-point
conditions can be projections from pilot-scale tests, extrapolations from similar fuels or
systems, or copies of existing successful systems.  Care must be taken to ensure that the fuel
system is designed to handle not only the typical properties of a particular coal supply, but
also the extremes.  With proper information, experienced designers and operators can exercise
independent control of many parameters to achieve desired performance and costs, while
taking into account fuel type and fuel properties.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The overall objectives of this program are to perform test burns to obtain information for the
design of new units, to provide air and solid waste emission data for permitting, to evaluate
the impact of switching fuel or limestone type in an existing unit, and/or to investigate and
resolve a particular operating problem.  The test burn can be performed in either a bubbling or
circulating mode.  The objectives of the test burns performed included  1) obtaining
information to finalize a design for contracted units, 2) obtaining design information for
feasibility studies, 3) generating design information to issue bid specifications and start the
permitting process, and 4) evaluating the impact of switching fuels in an existing unit.  <p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     For each test, fuel and limestone are shipped to Grand Forks from the mine to supply the
proposed or operating plant.  Test burns are typically 120 hours in length and include several
different test periods, as specified by the client.  To quantify the effect of FBC design and
operating parameters and the effects of fuel and sorbent properties, a number of important
performance variables are measured.  Environmental performance is evaluated by measuring
sorbent addition and utilization to achieve the designed SO<sub>2</sub> control; NO<sub>x</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O, and CO emissions; particulate collectability; and waste characterization and disposal. 
Evaluation of thermal performance is accomplished through measurement of combustion efficiency; heat flux;
moisture, ash, and sorbent thermal losses; and fouling in the convective pass.  Operational performance is
qualitatively assessed by examining for fouling and deposition on heat-transfer surfaces, agglomeration or
sintering of ash or bed material, changes in coal or ash particle size, and evidence of erosion or corrosion. 
Detailed final reports are prepared that can be used to complete feasibility studies, to issue to vendors for bed
specifications, or to use in obtaining environmental permits.  Tests can be performed in either bubbling or
circulating test units.  Fuels evaluated include all ranks of coal from the United States, lignites from Pakistan
and Thailand, petroleum coke, and wood.<p> 

     Examples of recently completed projects are summarized below:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) commissioned two test burns in the
EERC circulating fluidized-bed combustor (CFBC) facilities to generate emissions data and ash samples to aid in
permitting a power plant repowering project.  WEPCO estimated a $7.1 million savings in capital cost, schedule
reduction, and reduced operator risk resulting from the pilot plant testing.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand  used the EERC CFBC for a test
burn to determine the feasibility of burning Mae Moh lignite using CFB technology.  To date, two units of 300
MW each are under construction, with several more in the planning stage.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Suncor, Inc./CU Power Canada, Ltd., used the EERC CFBC facilities for a test burn
of their petroleum coke to obtain solid samples and emissions data to support permitting activities.  Several
boiler vendors had representatives on sight to observe and obtain information to use in formulating their
proposals to Suncor.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County used the EERC CFBC to
generate solid samples for support in permitting activities for its CFBC boilers designed to burn dried municipal
sewage sludge and to gain engineering and operating data on the combustion characteristics of their
fuel.<br>

<title>Fluidized-Bed Combustion Deposition
and Agglomeration</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Fluidized-Bed Combustion Deposition and Agglomeration</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Agglomeration and deposition in fluidized-bed combustors (FBCs) have been noted by users of
several different FBC designs firing a number of different fuels.  These ash-related phenomena
have been shown to cause a loss in steam temperature, operating difficulties and, in some
cases, unplanned shutdowns.  To predict and ultimately mitigate ash-related problems,
information must be gathered on the abundance and association of ash-forming constituents in
the fuel and the ash transformations that occur under the typical operating conditions of the
fluid bed.  Responding to these needs, the EERC has begun a 3-year program to determine the
factors that influence ash partitioning, agglomerate formation, ash deposition on heat-transfer
tubes and refractory, and deposit strength development.  The ultimate goal is to develop a
method to aid in the prediction of ash behavior prior to firing the fuel in an actual system and
to provide methods to reduce or mitigate agglomeration and deposition associated with
problem fuels.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The overall objective of this program is to advance the knowledge of ash behavior in FBCs so
that methods can be generated to predict and ultimately mitigate ash-related problems in FBCs. 
Specific goals are as follows:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  To determine the mechanisms of inorganic transformation that lead to inorganic
partitioning, ash deposition, and bed material agglomeration<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To determine the factors that influence the sintering behavior and strength
development of agglomerates and deposits under FBC conditions<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To develop a means of predicting the behavior of inorganic components as a
function of fuel composition and bed material selection<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To develop methods that can be used to reduce or mitigate ash-related problems
associated with particular fuels<br>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
     During the first two years of this program, a number of major activities were completed. 
Highlights include the following:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> A sampling protocol was developed that provides FBC operators with a
systematic method for determining the source of their ash-related problems.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Samples were collected from three full-scale FBCs.  Analyses of these samples
were used to determine the mechanisms causing the ash-related problems and to validate the work being
performed at the bench scale.<br>

<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> A bench-scale reactor was built to provide a cost-effective method of
determining the ash-related problems with particular fuels prior to firing them in full-scale units.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Bench-scale testing was performed to determine mechanisms and rate of
deposition of agglomeration as a function of fuel variables and operating conditions.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Computer models are being developed that can be used to determine relative
differences in deposition and agglomeration tendencies.<br>
</ul>
     Preliminary conclusions derived from the first two years of this program are as follows:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The mechanisms of adherence and growth of deposits and agglomerates appear
to be via a molten sulfate matrix, through the fluxing action of sodium with calcium.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> There is a definite interaction between the bed material and the ash that forms
agglomerates.  Proper selection of bed material is one potential method of mitigating agglomeration.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Factors which enhance the formation of agglomerates include local reducing
conditions in the bed, high temperature, increased pressure, and the presence of a fluxing agent.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Methods to predict the effect of coal properties and operating conditions on
deposition for conventional coal-fired systems can be tailored to predict problems in FBCs.

<title>Sorbent Regeneration from CFBC</title>
</head>

<h2> Sorbent Regeneration from CFBC</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The use of circulating fluidized-bed combustors (CFBCs) is an efficient method for burning
high-sulfur fuels to meet stringent SO<sub>2</sub> requirements.  One concern when burning
high-sulfur coal is the large volume of limestone required and, consequently, the relatively large
amounts of solid waste for disposal.  Community Energy Alternatives (CEA) is the operator of
several CFBC facilities in California that use petroleum coke as fuel.  CEA conceived a process to
significantly increase the 30% to 50% utilization of the available calcium in the limestone for a
once-through system.  This two-step process involves regeneration of spent bed material and
pelletization of fly ash, with recycle of these materials back to the CFBC.<p> 
     Iowa State University (ISU) and Argonne National Laboratory have demonstrated a process to
convert CaSO<sub>4</sub> to CaO.  The process uses a fluid-bed reactor and has been
demonstrated to recover SO<sub>2</sub> and lime from waste gypsum.  A regenerator based on
this process coupled with the EERC CFBC pilot plant system was used to investigate the regeneration
and recycling of the spent sorbent bed material.  Regeneration allowed the reduction of waste by a
factor of 15, compared to a maximum of about 3 times with a recycling process.  Petroleum coke
was a good candidate for this process, because of its high sulfur content and low ash content. 
Reducing limestone consumption was especially attractive, both economically and environmentally,
with a high-sulfur fuel.  Low amounts of ash allow for less dilution and potential interference for
regeneration of the bed material composed mostly of calcium sulfate.<p> 
     To ensure that all of the limestone is utilized in the CFBC, the portion that escapes with the fly
ash must be collected and processed in such a way that it is a usable sorbent material.  If
recycled as fine fly ash, the material would simply blow out of the system again, without a
chance for any significant sulfation.  To further maximize the use of material, fly ash can be
pelletized before it is fed back into the CFBC.  The EERC also studied how pelletizing could
be used to make the recycling and regeneration process more efficient.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project were to 1) demonstrate the sulfation capacity of pelletized fly ash
pellets compared to limestone while burning petroleum coke; 2) design, construct, and test a
regenerator meeting CEA specifications based upon EERC results from Phase 1 testing along
with available design information from ISU; and 3) perform testing with the EERC CFBC pilot
plant system to investigate the regeneration potential, incorporating the elements of CFBC
operation, fly ash pelletizing, bed material regeneration, and the overall recycling process.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Testing proceeded in three phases.  During Phase 1, the EERC successfully demonstrated the
effectiveness of pelletizing and recycling fly ash for reducing limestone consumption and solid
waste disposal by over 25%.  For Phase 2, a bubbling FBC was successfully modified and tested
for use as a fluidized-bed material regenerator.  For Phase 3, cyclic operation of the CFBC,
pelletizer, and regenerator was investigated, demonstrating a potential reduction in limestone
consumption ranging from 65% to 85% for five cycles of testing.<p>
     Fluid petroleum coke and limestone used for all EERC testing for CEA were from the same
source as that utilized by CEA's GWF Power Systems (GWF) CFBC facilities.  Based upon the
success of Phase 1 testing with pellets made from GWF fly ash, Phase 1B testing proceeded
using the fly ash generated during combustion in the EERC 1-MWth CFBC.  The fly ash was
collected, pelletized, and recycled back to the CFBC to enhance the sorbent utilization.  Using
only limestone for sulfur capture to establish a baseline condition, 0.37 lb of limestone per lb of
coke (Ca/S of 3.1) was required to achieve 89.9% retention of the sulfur in the coke.  For the
fourth cycle, using EERC fly ash pellets, the limestone consumption was reduced by 21.6% to
0.29 lb of limestone per lb of coke to achieve 91.7% sulfur retention (Ca/S of 2.7).<p>
     Phase 2 shakedown conditions for the regenerator were selected to obtain optimal removal of
sulfur from the sulfated bed material.  Shakedown tests were successfully conducted with EERC
bed material from Phase 1B testing and then with GWF bed material.  This resulted in about 90%
conversion of calcium sulfate to calcium oxide for both types of bed material tested.<p>
     For Phase 3 testing, each CFBC test cycle was approximately 24 hours in duration.  The spent
bed material and fly ash collected from any given cycle were respectively regenerated and
pelletized during the following 24 hours before being reintroduced back into the CFBC for
additional sulfur capture.  Fly ash was pelletized in the same manner as for Phase 1B testing. 
Regenerator thermocouple failures were numerous and at times difficult to detect.<p>
     Baseline limestone usage for Phase 3 was 0.31 lb of limestone per lb of coke (Ca/S of 2.9),
achieving 89.6% sulfur retention.  During the fourth cycle of testing, limestone consumption was
reduced 85.5% to 0.045 lb of limestone per lb of coke (nearly a sevenfold reduction in limestone
consumption) when fly ash pellets and regenerated bed material were used to achieve 89.3%
sulfur retention at a total Ca/S ratio of 3.9.  Although the pilot-scale tests clearly demonstrated a
significant reduction in limestone consumption by combining fly ash pelletization and bed
material regeneration, it is doubtful that the test was of long enough duration to reach a true
steady-state condition.<p>

<title>Test Burn of Dried Municipal Sewage Sludge</title>
</head>
<body>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">

<h1>Test Burn of Dried Municipal Sewage Sludge </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (CSDLAC) has three Babcock and
Wilcox (B&amp;W) circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers designed to burn dried municipal
sewage sludge (DMSS).  Representative solid samples generated from combustion of DMSS in
the boilers were required for analysis in support of CSDLAC permitting activities.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives of this project were to generate solid samples under representative CFB test
conditions for solid waste disposal characterization to support CSDLAC solid waste permitting
activities and provide engineering and operating data on the combustion characteristics of the
fuel.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     The EERC successfully conducted a test burn with its 1-MW pilot-scale CFB combustor using
DMSS supplied by CSDLAC.  Three complete sets of solid samples at different operating
conditions were obtained and analyzed according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
guidelines.  Overall, good results were obtained for fuel combustion efficiency, operational
and thermal performance, and flue gas emissions.<p>
<p>
     Bed inventory control is an important parameter with DMSS.  Because the configuration of the
B&amp;W boilers that will burn this fuel is designed to operate with a relatively high percentage of
secondary air, the ratio of bottom ash to total ash will also be high, based on the results seen
at the EERC.  In general, the higher the cyclone efficiency, the greater the bottom ash removal
rates.<p>
<p>
     Combustion temperature control will have a significant effect on emissions.  Both
SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increased with increasing temperature
during the EERC test burn.  Sulfur retention of 94% could be achieved at high temperatures, but a
much greater calcium-to-sulfur ratio is required.<p>
<p>
     Temperature is also an important factor during start-up.  For the EERC test, fuel feed was
initiated at a combustor temperature of 770&#176;F, which is near the limit of the unit's preheat
capabilities.  The fuel burned readily, but the resulting odor was unpleasant until the
combustor temperature reached about 1100&#176;F. Starting fuel feed at a higher furnace
temperature would alleviate the odor problem.<p>
<p>
     Based on ash-fouling probe temperatures during the run and postrun inspections of the ash-fouling
section, there appeared to be some deposition on the probes early in the run, but the
deposits that formed during this test dropped off under their own weight.  At full scale,
sootblowing may be required to keep boiler tubes clean.  There was no evidence of
agglomeration in the drained bed material or upon postrun inspection of the combustor and
external heat exchanger distributor plates.

<title>Investigation of Tidd PFBC
Agglomeration :  Chemical
Characterization</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Investigation of Tidd PFBC Agglomeration:  Chemical Characterization </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP) and Ohio Power Company observed that
egg-shaped agglomerates formed during operation of the pressurized fluidized-bed combustor
(PFBC) at the Tidd Station PFBC demonstration plant.  A few of these agglomerates formed
during a majority of the testing when dolomite was used as a sorbent.  The agglomerates could
be removed from the bed using the normal bed drain without causing major operational
problems due to poor fluidization quality.  In contrast, when the sorbent type was switched to
limestone, these egg-shaped agglomerates formed at a much higher rate, causing a decrease in
fluidization quality that eventually led to shutdown of the unit.  Severe agglomeration was also
noted with the dolomite sorbent when the unit was operated at full load.  The EERC
performed a detailed chemical characterization of material from the Tidd PFBC.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The overall objective of this project was to perform a detailed chemical characterization of
material from the Tidd Station PFBC to determine the mechanisms of formation of the
agglomerates and the differences between the limestone and dolomite sorbents.<p>
<h3>Results </h3>
     To develop a good understanding of the problem, the coal, sorbents, eggs, and spent-bed material
were characterized.  Analyses were performed on the fuel, limestone, dolomite, spent bed
material, and dolomite and limestone eggs.  After the chemical analyses were completed, an
interpretation was made.  This interpretation focused on the chemical composition on a
microscopic scale of the dolomite and limestone eggs.  Some limited thermochemical
equilibrium work was performed to look at the free lime, CO<sub>2</sub>, and the water-vapor
reactions that had been proposed by others.  This work involved finding appropriate phase
equilibrium diagrams to model the system and evaluating the fit of the AEP data.  Some detailed 
modeling  was performed using PHOEBE, a computer modeling program for complex
gas/liquid/solid phases.  The potential cause for differing degrees of agglomeration between dolomite
and limestone was identified, and mitigating measures were recommended.<p>

<h2> Transport Reactor Demonstration Unit </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) electricity generating plants are currently under
development to provide a clean, highly efficient coal-fueled generating option.  The gasifier
system converts coal into a clean, combustible gas that fuels a combustion turbine.  The
combustion turbine exhaust heat is used to produce steam, which drives a steam turbine
generator.  The primary area of integration involves the recovery and transfer of heat from the
gasifier syngas coolers to the combined cycle block.  In addition to the heat recovery system,
the gasifier section also contains a raw gas cleanup section that includes particulate and sulfur
removal systems.  <p>
    In order to provide process and mechanical data for the development and scaleup of hot-gas
cleanup devices, a nominally 2-ton/hr gasification facility with hot-gas cleanup capability was
constructed and operated at Wilsonville, Alabama.  The gasifiers that were under consideration
were the KRW fluidized-bed gasifier and the transport gasifier.  The transport technology is
based on a high-velocity circulating fluidized-bed reactor being developed by M.W. Kellogg. 
The EERC constructed and operated a 200-lb/hr intermediate-scale transport reactor
demonstration unit (TRDU) to provide the engineering information used in the Wilsonville
gasifier design.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The overall objective of this program was to obtain scalable kinetic, hydrodynamic, and
integrated data from the TRDU for the design of the transport reactor that was to be built in
Wilsonville, Alabama.  The TRDU was to address the two-stage gasification-adiabatic dense-phase
mixing
concepts.  The six parameters that were to be studied included temperature, riser
density, calcium-to-sulfur ratios, coal feed size, coal feed staging, and riser gas velocity.  The
parameters were to be compared to overall gasifier operation.  <p>
<h3>Results</h2>
     The TRDU was installed and two extended shakedown runs occurred.  The unit was operated
in combustion mode during heatup and gasification mode using Wyodak coal.

<title>Hot-Gas Filter Testing</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Hot-Gas Filter Testing</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h2>
     The U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) has a Hot-Gas
Cleanup (HGC) program intended to develop and demonstrate gas stream cleanup options
for use in combustion- and/or gasification-based advanced power systems.  One objective of
the METC HGC program is to support the development and demonstration of barrier filters to
control particulate matter.  The goal is not simply to meet current New Source Performance
Standards (NSPS) with respect to particulate emissions, but also to protect high-efficiency gas
turbines adequately and control particulate emissions to sufficiently low levels to meet more
stringent regulatory requirements anticipated in the future.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this work is to demonstrate acceptable performance of hot-gas filter elements
in a pilot-scale system prior to long-term demonstration tests.  The general approach is a
phased effort involving modifications and upgrades to the existing transport reactor
demonstration unit (TRDU) and the assembly, installation, and operation of a filter vessel
capable of operating at elevated temperatures and pressures.  This filter vessel will be used in
combination with the TRDU in order to evaluate the performance of selected hot-gas filter
elements for gasification applications.<p>
     The primary focus of the experimental effort will involve testing hot-gas filter elements. Filter
element performance will be evaluated as a function of particulate collection efficiency, filter
differential pressure, filter cleanability, and durability as a result of short-term operation
(&lt;200 hours).<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Phase I and II efforts are currently ongoing.  Phase I efforts are focused on upgrading the TRDU
based on past operating experiences.  Additions and upgrades being installed include a nitrogen
supply system purge, LASH auger, coal feed line, coal hopper system, disengager, seventh-floor
addition, J-leg fluffing gas system, and other minor subsystems.  Instrumentation upgrades will
be conducted in order to integrate the hot-gas filter system.<p>
     Phase II includess filter vessel assembly and installation.  Design of the filter vessel is complete. 
The completed system will include a filter vessel capable of operating at elevated temperatures
(1650&3176;F) and pressures (130 psig), heat-transfer requirements to control gas stream
temperature at the inlet to the filter vessel, ports for sampling HAPs, and options for varying
particulate mass loading to the filter vessel.  The initial piping design will allow operation of the filter
vessel system at temperatures ranging from 1000&#176;-1300&#176;F.<p>
   Phase III, which is planned for the fall of 1995, will be the first hot-gas filter test using the
TRDU operated in a gasification mode.  Filter elements from Industrial Filter &amp; Pump, 3M
Company, and Pall Advanced Filter Technologies will be tested.<p>

<title>Hot-Gas Cleanup</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Hot-Gas Cleanup </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is promoting the development of coal-based advanced
power systems under the direction of the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC). 
This activity covers a broad range of technologies involving combustion, gasification, and the
integration of combustion and gasification technologies. The objective is to maximize cycle
efficiencies and to provide for a stable, secure, and environmentally sound energy future.<p>
     Specific combustion program areas include the development of heat engines such as direct
coal-fired turbines and diesels and pressurized fluidized-bed combustors (PFBC).  Gasification
technology development includes mild gasification for coproducts and hydrogen and methane
production for fuel cell applications.  Integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC)
technology promotes high cycle efficiencies by combining coal gasification with direct product
gas firing in turbines.  In all these cases, hot-gas cleanup systems are required to achieve
acceptable process performance and to meet current and future environmental emission
standards.<p>
<h2>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project at the EERC were to design and build a bench-scale hot-gas filter
vessel to be operated in conjunction with the bench-scale pressurized fluid-bed reactor (PFBR),
to design and build a hot-gas sampling system to be used in conjunction with bench- and pilot-scale
advanced
systems currently in operation at the EERC, to design and initiate construction
of a pilot-scale hot-gas filter vessel to be operated in conjunction with one of two pilot-scale
gasification systems, to determine and model the various ash-alkali corrosion mechanisms for
ceramic barrier filter materials, and to develop corrosion-mitigating options.  The
corrosion-mitigating options
focused primarily on gettering techniques.  Eventually these techniques will
be verified at the pilot scale using a hot-gas filter vessel.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The bench-scale filter vessel was designed to operate at a temperature of 1550F and a pressure
of 150 psig with external heating in order to adequately control temperature.  Process gas flow
rates from the PFBR are expected to be roughly 30 scfm.  The filter vessel was designed  to
house three candle filters roughly 2.75 in. in diameter by 20 in. long and permit operation at filter
face velocities of 4 to 12 ft/min.  The intent is to clean the filters on-line using a heated nitrogen
backpulse (up to 1500&#176;F and 800 psig).<p>
     A high-temperature, high-pressure particulate-sampling system was developed for use with
bench- and pilot-scale advanced systems at the EERC.  The particulate-sampling system was
designed to sample at pressures up to 150 psig at a temperature of 1800&#176;F under both oxidizing
and reducing conditions.  A sampling probe is inserted into a process gas stream, and a
particulate-laden gas sample is withdrawn isokinetically.  The sampling probe is considered to be
disposable (based on wear).  Different materials are used for different operating conditions.  The
gas sample passes through a multicyclone train and/or borosilicate filter to remove all particulate
matter, then through a quench train to remove any condensables, followed by gas meters to
determine flow.  The probe, cyclone, and filter assembly are electrically heated to maintain the
gas temperature until it reaches the quench train.<p>
     Initial activities focused on reviewing the availability of existing filter vessels that may meet the
requirements for use with the transport reactor development unit  (TRDU).  The purpose for
reviewing the availability of existing filter vessels was to potentially minimize the cost of
designing and constructing a new vessel.  Three existing filter vessels were originally considered. 
The first vessel was designed and built by the Allison Gas Turbine Division of GM Corporation. 
Based on an on-site inspection and information provided by Allison personnel, EERC personnel
determined that the Allison filter vessel would not be a cost-effective alternative to designing and
constructing a new vessel because of its condition.  The second vessel was salvaged from the
former KRW test facility and is currently owned by Stanton Energy Industry Consultants, Inc. 
However, the filter vessel was too long for the available space in the gasification tower, and the
owner was not interested in selling the equipment but preferred a lease arrangement.  Therefore,
EERC personnel elected to not pursue this option.<p>
     A third existing filter vessel is currently being considered for use.  This vessel was built by
Aerodyne Development Corporation in the late 1970s.  The vessel was originally built for use as
a pressurized filter vessel in support of a pilot-scale PFBC system operated at the NASA Lewis
Research Center.  The EERC acquired the pressure vessel as surplus equipment in the late 1980s. 
Initially,  this vessel appeared to be an alternative to designing and constructing a new vessel. 
However, after completion of a preliminary design, EERC personnel determined that estimated
modification costs for this were significantly higher than originally anticipated.  As a result, a bid
package was prepared and issued to vendors for the construction of a new filter vessel.<p>
     The only significant difference in the new vessel design versus the modified vessel design was an
increase in diameter from 36 in. to 48 in.  A larger diameter was chosen to permit greater vessel
flexibility and eliminate design constraints relative to refractory selection and wall thickness,
shroud design and installation, and filter diameter and spacing.  Responses to the bid package
were received from six out of nine potential fabricators, with cost estimates ranging from
$14,700 to $33,200.  Based on the bid packages received, the EERC determined that
manufacturing a new, slightly larger filter vessel was a more prudent approach than modifying
the NASA Lewis vessel.  Therefore, a purchase order was issued to Arrow Tank &amp; Engineering
Company (Cambridge, Minnesota) to construct the new filter vessel at a cost of $14,700.  The
new vessel has been received.<p>
     Filter element performance will be evaluated in future tasks as a function of particulate collection
efficiency, filter differential pressure, filter cleanability, and filter durability.  Important operating
parameters to be evaluated include gas stream composition, temperature, face velocity, inlet dust
loading, and approach to filter cleaning.<p>
     A hot-gas reaction furnace was constructed and shakedown testing completed.  The furnace is
used to simulate the environment inside hot-gas cleanup vessels in order to perform long-term
corrosion and sintering tests of candidate ceramic barrier filters.  The reactor consists of a mullite
retort 6 in. in diameter and 6 ft long, with a 48-in. heated length.  The end caps have ports to
allow introduction and exhaust of gases and ports for introduction of water vapor, the
measurement of pressure, and the measurement of exit gas temperature and relative humidity. 
The retort pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and relative humidity data are acquired by
computer for overnight monitoring of changes in the system during the course of experiments.<p>
     The furnace has three independently controlled temperature zones:  one 24-in. center zone and
two 12-in. end zones.  The total 48-in. heated length provides a uniform heated length of
approximately 30 in.<p>
     The furnace has a maximum operating temperature of 1100&#176;C.  Simulated coal combustor
flue gas saturated with sodium sulfate and sodium chloride vapor is passed through sections of a
barrier filter coated with a thin layer of fly ash for up to 500 hours at 900&#176;C.  The filter is then
cut into C-rings 1 in. wide for compressive strength testing.  The C-ring tests are performed at
900&#176;C in the same atmosphere using an Instron 8562 universal testing machine fitted with a
high-temperature muffle furnace.  Scanning electron microscopy analyses are used to determine
interactions between the gas, ash layer, and the filter material.<p>
     An electron beam evaporator was used to determine if electron beam deposition was a valid way
to apply thin coatings of tantalum pentoxide to silicon carbide-based barrier filters to give them
corrosion protection.  Tantalum pentoxide was investigated because it has a similar coefficient of
thermal expansion to silicon carbide and because of reports in the literature that it affords
protection from alkali salt corrosion.  Extremely uniform and amorphous coatings from 0.1 to
several microns thick could be obtained on dense silicon carbide coupons.  Any degree of
oxidation could be obtained from pure tantalum metal to fully oxidized tantalum pentoxide. 
Experiments with anodic oxidation of metal coatings were performed to determine its effect on
the crystal morphology of the final oxide.  However, tests with liquid coal ash at 1300&#176;C (used
to
speed corrosion) showed that the tantalum pentoxide coatings were prone to corrosion in the
presence of silicate ash.<p>

<title>Gas Separation and Hot-Gas Cleanup</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2> Gas Separation and Hot-Gas Cleanup</h2> </center> 
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     Catalytic gasification of coal to produce H<sub>2</sub>-, CO-, and
CH<sub>4</sub>-rich gases for
consumption in molten carbonate fuel cells is currently under development; however, to optimize the
fuel cell performance and extend its operating life, it is desired to separate as much of the inerts (i.e.,
CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>) and impurities (i.e., H<sub>2</sub>S and
NH<sub>3</sub>) as possible from the fuel gas before it enters the fuel cell.  In addition, the
economics of the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) can be improved by separating as
much of the hydrogen as possible from the fuel, since hydrogen is a high-value product.  Researchers
at the EERC are currently investigating pressure-driven membranes as a method for accomplishing
this gas separation and hot-gas cleanup. These membranes are operated at temperatures as high as
800&#176;C and pressures up to 300 psig.  These membranes have very small pore sizes which
separate the undesired gases by operating in the Knudsen diffusion region (30-50 &#197; ) or in the
molecular sieving region (&lt;5&#197;) of mass transport phenomena.<p>
     Technological and economic issues that must be resolved before these membranes are
commercially viable include improved gas separation efficiency, membrane optimization,
sealing of membranes to metal vessels, high burst strength of the membrane, pore thermal
stability, and material chemical stability.  Hydrogen separation is dependent on temperature,
pressure, pressure ratio across the membrane, and ratio of permeate flow to total flow.  For
gas separation under Knudsen diffusion, increasing feed pressure and pressure ratio across the
membrane should increase the gas permeability, and decreasing temperature and permeate-to-total
flow
ratio should also increase the gas permeability.  In the molecular sieving regime of
mass transport, the inlet pressure and pressure ratio should have no effect on gas permeability,
but increasing temperature should increase permeability.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The selectivity of the ceramic membranes for removing the undesired gases while allowing the
desired gases to be concentrated in the permeate stream must be determined.  Specific questions
to be answered included:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> What are the effects of ceramic membrane properties (i.e.,
surface area, pore size, coating thickness) on permeability and selectivity of the desired gases?<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  What are the effects of operating conditions (i.e., temperature,
pressure, and flow rate) on permeability and selectivity?<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  What are the effects of impurities (i.e., small particulate,
H<sub>2</sub>S, HCl, NH<sub>3</sub>) on membrane
performance?<br>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
     A 4-lb/hr continuous fluid-bed reactor (CFBR) was used for the fluidized-bed gasification tests
with a Wyodak subbituminous coal from the Powder River Basin, since its low sulfur and ash
levels would allow the lower contaminant levels to reach the Bend Research, Inc., membranes. 
The Bend Research membranes tested were either 0.03-mm-thick palladium-silver or 0.06-mm-thick
palladium
membranes of approximately 0.2 ft<sup>2</sup> of surface area.  The hydrogen separation
membrane was repiped into the existing gasification system along with a set of gas-sampling
lines for measuring gas concentration upstream and downstream of the fixed-bed zinc oxide
sorbent vessel utilized to control the H<sub>2</sub>S gas concentration entering the membrane. 
Gas samples
of the permeate and raffinate streams were also obtained for analysis by gas chromatography.<p>
     Initially, short-term performance tests were conducted using the membrane to separate hydrogen
from the mixed-gas stream.  Subsequent tests looked at the effects of H2<sub>S</sub> impurities
via injecting a known amount of H<sub>2</sub>S into the gas stream.  Further testing then
looked at the effect of other impurities (i.e., H<sub>2</sub>S, HCl) by operating the membrane
using actual coal-derived fuel gases from the same CFBR equipment.  The gas composition of the
coal-derived gas stream was adjusted by adding some bottled hydrogen gas to the gas stream entering
the reactor.  Results indicate that high separation factors can be achieved with these membranes,
since the permeabilities of the undesired gases (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub>, CO,
H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>) are very low.  However, the permeability of hydrogen
gas is also much lower than those reported for ceramic membranes.  The change in hydrogen
permeabilities indicates how sensitive the palladium-based membranes are to hydrogen sulfide in
the feed gas.  The permeability also is significantly affected by membrane temperature and
hydrogen partial pressure, but does not appear to be significantly affected by product gas feed
rate through the membrane.<p>
     X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed on a prototype hydrogen-permeable membrane
produced by Bend Research.  The membrane was exposed to hydrogen sulfide in the CFBR
reactor during a test to simulate coal gasification conditions.  The objective of the analysis was to
determine the composition of a thin white coating which was deposited on the retentate side of
the membrane during the test run.  From this analysis, the coating appears to be predominantly
elemental sulfur, with a small quantity of a sulfatelike compound also detected.

<h1>Small Power-Generating Systems</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The EERC has worked in the development and operation of fluidized-bed combustors and
gasifiers for the past 20 years.  The EERC sees a market opportunity for small-scale power
generation systems based on these technologies for application in remote areas such as Alaska,
Indonesia, and the Philippines and other areas where constructing electrical lines is not practical. 
This includes certain regions in China, India, Central and South America, and the United States. 
The EERC is engaged in the development and promotion of power systems tailored to the needs
of small, remote sites.  The goal is a highly flexible system that burns a variety of solid fuels and
can be configured to meet site-specific issues and conditions such as climate, load patterns, and
fuel choices.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The development activities for small power systems are designed to incorporate a number of
elements that are important to any energy solution:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> An integrated solution that addresses energy, heating,
transportation, and waste disposal needs<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> An emphasis placed on improving the health of community
members<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Attention centered on the environment and identifying power
systems that are environmentally friendly<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Power generation options that are more cost-effective than diesel
generators<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The use of local resources to create more jobs and keep more
dollars in the local economy<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Demonstration of technologies that can meet many or all of these
needs<br>
</ul>
<p>
 <h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Development of an energy system for a particular site will involve tailoring existing systems or
developing new systems.  The generic attributes that the EERC is promoting for these power
systems include the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Size range of 0.2 to 20 MW<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Ability to burn environmentally benign solid fuels<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Ability to generate electricity, steam, and/or hot air<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Control of gaseous and solid pollutants<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Reliability and ease of operation and maintenance<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Levelized cost of electricity competitive with diesel
generators<br>
</ul>
<p>
     The EERC has developed a strategy to incorporate these attributes into a system for remote
applications.  This strategy is based on experience gained over the past 20 years on similar-sized
systems at the EERC.  Components of this strategy are listed below:<p>
<p>
<ul palin>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Focus on overall system functionality<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Capitalize on existing commercial designs and EERC experience
for subsystem design<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Use a "smart" control system to eliminate the need for
around-the-clock supervision<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Design a system to burn a variety of indigenous fuels, including
coal, oil, coal bed methane, municipal solid waste, wood wastes, and sewage sludge, either alone or
any combination<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Control SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> within
the main combustion or gasification system, with a back-end system to control particulates<br>
</ul>
<p>
     Within the scope of the EERC's current plans, the potential customers for the small-scale power
systems include remote community, town, and village governmental agencies and service
organizations; utility firms and cooperatives; industrial firms; schools; hospitals; and other
institutions.  The EERC is seeking financial participation in the development program leading to
a demonstration of a small power system.  This may include teaming arrangements that will lead
to installation of a power system tailored to meet the specific demands of the end user.

<h1>Remote-Site Power Generation Opportunities for Alaska</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), together with the Alaska Division of Energy (ADE),
Doyon Limited, and a number of native corporations, has undertaken a project to develop
alternative small-scale power generation technology options for application in remote villages of
Alaska.  The EERC is working with the DOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC)
to assess options for using the tremendous reserves of high-quality coal found in Alaska in small-scale
power units fired on indigenous resources such as coal, coal-bed methane, and municipal
solid waste.<p>
<p>
     Typically, remote villages in Alaska use diesel generators fueled with expensive fuel oil for
electricity production.  The high cost of diesel power in rural Alaska is heavily subsidized by the
state through the Power Cost Equalization program (PCE), which amounts to about $20 million
annually.  Fuel oil is also used extensively for residential and public building heating.  The goal
of this activity will be to reduce the use of fuel oil in Alaskan villages by developing small, low-cost
power generation applications.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate viable technology options for providing
power to remote areas of Alaska.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     The Small Alternative Power Generation Workshop was held in Anchorage, Alaska, as a first
step in the development of safe, reliable, and efficient energy systems throughout Alaska.  The workshop
was a success; it established good three-way communication among government policymakers,
suppliers of technology, and end users, the rural Alaskans.  As a result of the interactive
presentations and breakout discussion groups during the workshop, the needs of the Alaskans were
heard and a number of technology options were offered that could meet their needs.<p>
<p>
     The technology options that appear to offer the best opportunity today are fluidized-bed
combustion, using both indigenous coal and municipal solid wastes as fuel, and coal bed
methane coupled to a fuel cell.<p>
<p>
     The role of the EERC in this project has recently been expanded to include overall project
management.  The goal remains the same, namely, demonstration of viable technology options for
providing power to remote areas of Alaska.  The goal is to begin the demonstration activity in 1996. 
Successful demonstration will create opportunities for export of these technologies to many parts of
the world with similar needs for remote power generation.<p>
<p>
     A second workshop, entitled "Alaska Native, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian Remote-Site
Power Generation Workshop:  Transferring the Alaskan Experience" will be held in Seattle,
Washington, on September 25-26, 1995.<p>
<p>
     The goal of the workshop is to share the results of activities undertaken to meet the energy needs
of remote villages in Alaska and to explore the opportunities that exist to commercialize the
technologies and transfer related information to other indigenous communities.<p>

<title>Combustion 2000:  Engineering
Development of Coal-Fired, High-Performance Power-Generating Systems</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Combustion 2000:  Engineering Development of Coal-Fired, High-Performance
Power-Generating Systems
</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Modern pulverized coal-fired utility boilers are approximately 35% efficient at converting the
chemical energy in coal into electrical energy.  The most limiting step in the process is the
steam cycle that requires water to be boiled to make steam, which is expanded through a
turbine, then condensed so that it can be pumped back into the system.  The condensation
process occurs at such a low temperature that capturing the energy released is not practical,
and so the heat of vaporization is lost to the environment.  To improve efficiency and
subsequently reduce fuel costs as well as the production of environmental pollutants, advanced
systems will employ energy cycles that do not require the production of steam.  One effort to
develop such a system is being funded by the U.S. Department of Energy through the
Combustion 2000 program, a multiphase program to develop a commercially viable, advanced
coal-fired combustor by the year 2000.  It must be designed to increase efficiency by one-third, while
producing very low levels of environmental pollutants.  For the first phase, two
awards of over three million dollars each were made for two years of work.  One was received
by United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), the other by Foster Wheeler Development
Corporation.  The EERC is aiding the UTRC effort.  At the end of two years, a proposal with
a test plan for a demonstration of the feasibility of key system components in a 50-million-Btu/hr
demonstration coal combustor was submitted to DOE.  At least two awards for a total
of approximately fifty million dollars will be made for testing in Phase 2.  If the UTRC group
is one of the awardees, the EERC is slated to host the construction of a 2-MMBtu/hr slagging
coal combustor that will be used to test slag control, materials properties, and ceramic
engineering issues under slagging conditions. <p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objective of Phase 1 of Combustion 2000 is to develop a design and test plan for a
demonstration high-temperature advanced furnace (HITAF), which will then be constructed
under Phase 2 of the project.  The furnace will be the primary component of the high-efficiency
electricity production system.  To reach such high efficiencies, the furnace will employ a ceramic
heat exchanger that will be used to heat air to 2500&#176;F before it passes through a new
high-temperature turbine.  A ceramic heat exchanger is also being developed for an all-coal system
which will heat air to 2500&#176;F.  The EERC role in the UTRC effort is to help in the design of
the HITAF so that problems related to the formation of molten coal ash in the furnace are reduced. 
The EERC is also providing testing of alloy and ceramic materials in a coal-fired pilot-scale
combustor and developing corrosion-resistant refractory coatings for the air heater. <p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Initial design of the HITAF system has been completed.  It is intended to reduce the emissions
of environmental pollutants by over 80% of present levels and be approximately 49% efficient
at converting the chemical energy in coal to electrical energy.  The efficiency increase will
decrease the emission of greenhouse gases by approximately 39% over present systems.  It
will employ two ceramic air heaters:  one operating at high temperature (3000&#176;F) and the
other at low temperature (2000&#176;F).  Examination of the reactivity calculations of the
thermodynamic equilibrium of ash species at these temperatures shows that the high-temperature
heater will be prone to direct corrosion by the coal slag, whereas the low-temperature heater will be
attacked by alkali sulfates condensed from the gas stream.  A pilot-scale test will be performed at the
EERC to test the durability of alloy heat-exchanger components and refractory coatings. 
Long-duration experiments have been performed to determine the resistance of different forms of
silicon carbide (SiC) and SiC-alumina composites to corrosion by coal slag at 2000&#176; and
2300&#176;F for the all-coal ceramic heat exchangers.  Strength measurements were also performed
to determine strength loss due to slag corrosion.  Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray
photoelectron spectrometry were used to determine mechanisms of corrosion and failure.  In general,
the composite materials showed little strength loss after the experiments.  Other SiC ceramics,
especially SiC that contained residual metal, showed excessive corrosion and strength degradation at
the higher temperature.<p>
     In addition to these experiments, many monolithic refractories have been tested for slag
corrosion resistance to determine their applicability as protective coatings for the air heater. 
Two SiC-based refractories have been found to be suitable for temperatures up to 2600&#176;F in
the presence of either iron-rich slags from eastern bituminous coals or calcium-rich slags from
Powder River Basin subbituminous coals.<p>
     Another aspect of the project is to perform an overall economic evaluation of by-product
utilization.  For this work, a vicinity near Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been selected for the site
of the high-performance power system power plant.  The site was selected because of its
proximity to major U.S. cities which utilize significant amounts of coal combustion by-products and
because of the availability of water transportation.  An important aspect of assessing marketability of
by-products will be the use of an integrative technology data manipulation software known as Atlas
Geographic Information Systems (GIS)<sup>TM</sup>.  Information regarding by-product
characteristics, plant location, transporting of materials, and competing materials will be put into the
GIS system to completely evaluate utilization potential.<p>
<h3> UTRC Alloy Panel Test</h3>
     UTRC contracted with the EERC to provide a 100-hour combustion test to determine the
level and extent of slag corrosion for an alloy panel covered with various refractory
materials as an add-on to existing work in support of the Combustion 2000 program.  The
test fired an Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal obtained from Illinois Power Company's
Baldwin Station.  The fuel was fired at a rate sufficient to achieve a furnace exit gas
temperature of 2400&#176;F at an excess air level near 20%.  These conditions were previously
used to simulate a wet-bottom boiler in the EERC's pilot-scale combustion test facility
(CTF).  The CTF is a bottom-fired, refractory-lined furnace that uses a balanced draft.  To
achieve the specified test conditions, a 2-in. refractory liner was poured to minimize heat
loss through the furnace walls and elevate the flame temperature and flue gas temperature
leaving the furnace.  A flame temperature between 2600&#176; and 2700&#176;F was expected. 
Combined with fuel properties, these conditions provided adequate slag generation and
flow to simulate the characteristics of a wet-bottom boiler.  Testing was performed the
week of June 19, 1995.

<title>Coal Ash Behavior in Reducing
Environments</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Coal Ash Behavior in Reducing Environments</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     A key factor in the successful design and operation of coal gasification and advanced
combustion systems is the ability to control and mitigate ash-related problems.  Some of the
major ash-related problems are slag flow control, slag attack on the refractory, ash deposition
on heat-transfer surfaces, corrosion and erosion of equipment materials, and emissions control. 
Such problems are closely tied to the abundance and association of the inorganic components
in coal and the system conditions.<p>
     In general, the inorganic components are associated in the coal as minerals or organic
complexes (salts of carboxylic acid groups or organic coordination complexes).  The minerals
associated in coal vary widely in size, composition, and juxtaposition.  Juxtaposition refers to
the association of the mineral grains with other mineral grains and coal particles.  These
associations directly influence the chemical and physical transformations that occur during the
gasification process.  Depending upon the type of gasification system, the inorganic
components are initially partitioned into intermediate species in the form of inorganic gases,
liquids, and solids.  The state of these species at any position in the gasifier directly influences
their behavior at that stage.  The transformations and partitioning of the inorganic species
directly influence slag flow behavior, extent and type of slag attack on the refractory, and
corrosion and erosion of materials, as well as growth rate, quantity, and type of ash deposition
on heat-transfer surfaces. <p>
     Conventional analytical methods for coal and coal ash materials do not provide adequate detail
regarding their complex chemical and mineralogical properties.  Advanced analytical
techniques are currently being used to determine the association and forms of inorganic
components in coals and coal ash-derived materials.  In addition, other laboratory-scale
techniques are routinely used to determine viscosity, surface tension, sintering behavior, and
deposit strength development.  Reducing environments can be simulated in pressurized drop-tube
furnace
systems to produce intermediate species that can be used to determine inorganic
transformations.  Utilization of advanced analytical techniques, coupled with laboratory
methods, can potentially provide significant advances in understanding the behavior of
inorganic components during gasification that will ultimately lead to better methods to predict
and mitigate ash-related problems.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The Coal Ash Behavior in Reducing Environments (CABRE) project was a 4-year, multiclient
program to determine the behavior of coal inorganic components in reducing environments using
advanced methods of analysis coupled with laboratory experiments.  The objectives were as
follows: <p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To further develop advanced ash and deposit characterization
techniques to quantify the effects of the liquid-phase components on strength development in ash
deposits<Br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To determine the mechanisms of inorganic transformations that
lead to inorganic partitioning, ash deposition, and slag formation under gasification conditions<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To determine the factors that influence the sintering behavior of
coal-derived ashes under gasification conditions<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To develop a better means of predicting the behavior of inorganic
components as a function of coal composition and reducing conditions<br></ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The CABRE project recently completed its fourth and final year of research.  The four years of
experimental and theoretical research have provided a large amount of information pertaining to
the interactions of inorganics during coal gasification.  Significant advancements have been
made in the three foundational areas of the project:  analytical characterization, inorganic
transformations and deposition, and physical and chemical properties.  The analytical
characterization of samples produced under gasification conditions was enhanced by taking
advanced techniques previously used in combustion research and adapting them for gasification
samples.  The advanced techniques developed utilize a scanning electron microscope/microbeam
to provide particle-by-particle chemical and physical information on the micron scale.  Two
software packages were developed to aid in the characterization of gasification materials: 
MINCLASS and VISCALC.  MINCLASS was designed to interpret data from advanced
analytical techniques to allow the user to define the chemical transformations under gasification
conditions.  VISCALC takes the information produced from MINCLASS and predicts the
viscosities of the phases to allow the user to predict the slagging and fouling properties of the
ash.<p>
    The transformations of inorganic species during gasification and the deposition processes were
studied using a state-of-the-art pressurized drop-tube furnace capable of high temperatures and
pressures.  This furnace system allowed gasification samples to be produced under closely
controlled conditions which provided valuable information on the transformation mechanisms
and identified differences between organically associated and mineral form inorganic materials.<p>
     The investigation of chemical and physical properties of gasification samples provided major
breakthroughs in and understanding of the development of strength in deposits and phase
interactions.  Indices were developed for ranking the effects of high- and low-temperature
deposition problems for several coals.  Much of this work has application beyond the research of
coal gasification.<p>
     The fundamental results gained from this project are expected to provide a basis for future
applied research activities.<p>

<title>Testing of Sodium Bicarbonate as an
Entrained-Flow Chloride Sorbent</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Testing of Sodium Bicarbonate as an Entrained-Flow Chloride Sorbent </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
     General Electric is proposing to use a moving-bed system to clean contaminants from the
product gas of coal gasifiers.  Zinc titanate sorbent material is used to capture hydrogen
sulfide from the gas stream.  It has been found that hydrochloric gas in the stream reacts with
zinc in the sorbent to form zinc chloride, which vaporizes when the sorbent is heated in the
bed regenerator.  As the gas leaving the regenerator is cooled, zinc sulfate condenses from the
gas steam, forming deposits that can grow to reduce the flow of gas through the system.  In
order to prevent the hydrochloric gas from vaporizing the zinc, it has been proposed to use a
powdered additive injected into the duct upstream of the zinc titanate bed.  However, the high
concentration of sulfur dioxide in the regenerator product gas makes the commercial
production of sulfuric acid viable.  Therefore a hydrochloric acid-absorbing material that does
not absorb sulfur is preferred as the additive.  In-duct injection of sodium bicarbonate is one
proposed method to absorb the chlorine.  The sodium bicarbonate decomposes in situ to form
a high-surface-area sodium carbonate, which then reacts with HCl vapor to form sodium
chloride solid.  The spent particles can then be separated from the gas stream.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The overall objective of the work was to determine the chlorine absorption efficiency of sodium
bicarbonate under pressurized gasification conditions.  The EERC pressurized drop-tube furnace
(PDTF) system was used as the reactor.  Several different reaction times, sorbent/vapor ratios,
and sorbent particle sizes were tested.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
     Operation of the PDTF went routinely after several issues were resolved.  First, the high level of
moisture in the gas stream forced operation of the filter to nearly its maximum capacity of
130&#176;C, which may have led to some chloride absorption by the particles on the filter.  The
introduction of the water and hydrogen chloride below the point of syngas introduction allowed
the syngas to reform, making soot.  The soot sometimes dislodged and was collected on the filter. 
It also increased the cost of running the tests by clogging insulation and generally increasing
cleanup costs.<p>
     Thermogravimetric analysis showed that calcination of the bicarbonate to carbonate was
essentially complete, even at the shortest residence time with the largest particles.  Chloride
capture was monitored by scanning electron microscopy analyses of the spent particles collected
on the system filter.  Capture efficiencies of between 16% and 92% were measured, although
some of this capture occurred after collection on the filter.  Scatter in the chloride capture
efficiency data was great, but did indicate several trends.  At residence times of around
0.4 seconds, about half of the chlorine was captured by the Grade No. 3 DF material at a
sodium-to-chlorine
feed rate of 2 or 3 to 1.  Approximately 90% capture was measured at 5 to 1. 
Although the porosity of the particles increased from around 5% to 20% to 30% during
calcination, chlorine was not captured in the internal pores.  Only surface capture was detected,
indicating that smaller particles with their higher surface-area-to-volume ratios would be more
efficient at removing chloride.  This was borne out in the PDTF testing.  Fragmentation of the
larger Grade No. 2 particles during calcination occurred inconsistently and not nearly so much as
to reduce the overall size distribution to that of the Grade No. 3 DF particles.

<title>Catalytic Coal Gasification</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Catalytic Coal Gasification</h2> </center> 
<br>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Catalytic steam gasification of low-rank coals under mild, near-atmospheric conditions to
produce a hydrogen-rich gas stream has been investigated with bench and continuous
equipment at the EERC.  Reasonable gasification rates were obtained using alkali and some
alkaline earth catalysts, but only with low-rank coals.  Bituminous coals were found to be
relatively unreactive with even the best-known catalysts at optimum conditions.  An economic
assessment performed by Black and Veatch suggested that a promising application for catalytic
gasification would be to provide hydrogen for fuel cells.<p>

     Subsequent work with the Energy Research Corporation (ERC) and Fluor-Daniel showed that
electrical generation efficiency could approach 60% by close-coupling a catalytic gasification
process with a fuel-flexible molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC).  This process uses hydrogen
and methane as fuel and would rely on a hot recycle stream of hydrogen, superheated steam,
and an exothermic hydrogenation reaction to provide process heat.  Close-coupling effectively
limits gasification temperatures to around 650&#176;C.  To date, marginally acceptable gasification
rates have been achieved with known gasification catalysts, but only with low-rank coals.  In
the effort to obtain suitable gas production at 650&#176;C, a brief investigation of some nickel and
iron catalysts was undertaken.  The catalysts tested were nickel-substituted synthetic mica
montmorillonite (NiSMM), NiSMM-supported molybdenum, iron hydroxyoxide, iron nitrate,
iron-calcium-impregnated salts, and nickel uranyl oxide (Ni-U).  All catalysts except the
Ni-U were tested for their effect on the reaction ratio of steam gasification.  The NiSMM and
the Ni-U were tested for their tar-cracking properties.<p>

     In previous parametric studies at the EERC, all tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure. 
However, when the production of a gas stream for fuel cell feed was studied, it was found that
pressure plays a major role in providing proper gas composition.  Thermodynamics predict that a
change in pressure during the steam gasification of coal will increase the methane content of the
gas.  Since methane plays a major role in temperature control of the operating fuel cell, this
laboratory-scale work on catalytic gasification was carried out under increased pressure, i.e., 50
psig, and the product gas was analyzed on-line with Fourier transform infrared analysis.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     Work on catalytic gasification directly supports efforts to integrate gasification and MCFCs. 
The primary goal was to identify a suitable hydrogasification catalyst to achieve coal residence
times on the order of minutes in a gasifier operating on naturally reactive low-rank coals at
nominal conditions of 650&#176;C and increased pressure (up to 150 psi) under hydrogasification
and steam gasification conditions.  The EERC gasification model will be integrated into
existing state-of-the-art codes.<p>
<h3>Results </h3>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Synthetic pillared-clay transition metal catalysts developed at the
EERC showed little positive effect on the rate of steam gasification of coal apart from increasing
methane production.<br>
 <br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">   Earlier tests using nickel- and nickel-molybdenum-loaded
synthetic clays slightly showed that they do not sinter, because nickel is incorporated into the
synthetic clay structure and it retains hydrocracking activity even when sulfided.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Both nickel and iron catalysts were successful in raising methane
production.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The steam/oxygen/hydrogen-coal gasification equilibrium model
has been developed as a macro-driven Lotus spreadsheet to calculate the equilibrium gas composition
and heat balance for coal gasification with steam, oxygen, and/or hydrogen.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Fe-Ca catalysts showed promise as a steam-coal gasification
catalyst.  Methane production was also enhanced in the presence of this catalyst.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Fe-Ca is the least expensive of the catalysts tested.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Ni-U increased methane production more than other catalysts
tested.  It, like the pillared catalysts, was not easily poisoned and did not sinter at the test
temperatures, i.e., up to 600&#176;C.</li>

<title>Catalytic Tar Cracking</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2> Catalytic Tar Cracking</h2> </center> 
<hr><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The need for on-line cracking of gasification tars is common to many types of gas stream
cleanup systems.  Aerosol tars are not readily removed from gas streams by conventional
means and, as a consequence, often end up plugging filters or fouling fuel cells, turbines, or
sorbents.  Catalytic cracking of these tars to molecular moieties containing ten or fewer carbon
atoms would prevent the problems commonly attributed to the tars.  As an example, a moving
fixed-bed gasifier, by virtue of its efficient countercurrent heat exchange and widespread
commercial use, may offer the lowest-cost integrated gasification combined-cycle system, if tar
generation and wastewater contamination can be minimized.  This project investigated the use
of selected catalysts to crack pyrolysis gases and vapors from two coals.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project were 1) to determine if selected catalysts such as zeolite or
dolomite would yield products which do not contaminate filtering devices or turbines and 2) to
investigate the feasibility of obtaining a desired liquid and/or gas stream from the use of the
selected catalysts.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>

     The cracking catalysts selected for testing were dolomite and Engelhard extruded and finely
divided zeolites.  Lignite from Beulah, North Dakota, was gasified with steam at each of five
temperatures, i.e., 250&#176;, 400&#176;, 550&#176;, 700&#176;, and 800&#176;C, in the
integrated bench-scale gasifier.  Volatile tars as well as gaseous products were passed through a bed
of dolomite at 50&#176;-100&#176;C below the reactor temperature.  Tests under the same
conditions were performed with the zeolite catalyst.  Similar tests with both catalysts were carried out
on Beluga subbituminous coal from Alaska.  The results indicate that the dolomite is a better cracking
catalyst than the zeolite at the conditions tested.

<h1>Underground Coal Gasification Environmental Assessment Research</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2></font>
<p>
         In general, U.S. underground coal gasification (UCG) tests have focused on the development
of the process itself.  Comparatively little effort has been devoted to the critical issues of site and
materials characterization and environmental monitoring.  These issues must be addressed if the
development of UCG as a viable coal utilization alternative is to continue.<p>
<p>
         The recent Rocky Mountain 1 (RM1) UCG test in Carbon County, Wyoming, was designed
to include, for the first time, many activities critical to adequate preburn site and materials
characterization, as well as an extensive set of multidisciplinary tasks focusing on the
identification, assessment, and prevention/minimization of the environmental impacts associated
with the test.  The technical assistance and research involvement of the EERC were designed to
address specific key aspects of these issues that were not included in the original RM1 test
program.<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
         The objectives of this project were to:<p>
<p>
<ul plain> 
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Provide technical assistance to aid the Gas Research Institute
(GRI) program manager in maintaining the quality, scope, and timeliness of all activities related to
the environmental assessment portion of the RM1 UCG test program in south-central
Wyoming.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Perform research supplementary to other contracted RM1
environmental assessment activities in order to maximize the overall assessment effort.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Synthesize the results of all environmental and process activities
in order to develop an understanding of process:site interactions related specifically to the RM1 test
and to in situ gasification in general.<br>
</ul><p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
         Research activities during the past two years have resulted in the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Completion of a plan to more thoroughly evaluate the
UCG-related hydrothermal regime at the RM1 site through the collection of additional groundwater
temperature data and the more rigorous analysis of all available subsurface temperature data utilizing
previously unavailable advanced computer capabilities.  (See "Supplementary Research Related to the
Rocky Mountain 1 Underground Coal Gasification Test Program.")<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Completion of a report reviewing the design, conduct, and results
of the effort to 1) describe and chemically and mineralogically characterize the available thermally
altered materials from the RM1 site and 2) use the characterization data to reconstruct the test-related
thermal history of the site.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Completion of a plan to complement the noted characterization
report with an "atlas" of mineral and amorphous phases identified during the characterization
activities.  (See "Supplementary Research Related to the Rocky Mountain 1 Underground Coal
Gasification Test Program.")<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Completion of a draft report reviewing the design, conduct, and
results of the laboratory investigations of 1) the short- and long-term leaching potential of
UCG-related, thermally altered materials from the RM1 test site and 2) the chemical attenuation

RM1 test cavities.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Completion of the integrated evaluation of all available process

which has been undertaken largely by John Boysen (formerly of Resource Technology Corporation,
Inc.) under subcontract to the EERC, is primarily intended to improve the present understanding of
UCG-related process:site interactions so that future UCG operations can be better designed, sited,
conducted, and evaluated.  Specifically, activities in this regard have resulted in the following:<br>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Completion of an energy balance model for the RM1 test based on
process data and observations and incorporating a consideration of the effects of site-related
geological and hydrological factors.<br>
<p>

<h2> Supplementary Research Related to the Rocky Mountain 1 Underground Coal Gasification
Test Program
</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Since 1986, the EERC has been involved in providing technical assistance and performing
research as part of the Rocky Mountain 1 (RM1) underground coal gasification (UCG) test
program sponsored by a consortium headed by the U.S. Department of Energy and Gas Research
Institute.  During the course of evaluating the activity-specific results, producing the attendant
reports, and progressing with the integrated data evaluation effort for the program, several
mechanisms were identified for enhancing the utility and/or accessibility of certain program
results, thus increasing the contribution of the RM1 program to the overall development of UCG. 
The result was two additional RM1-related initiatives, each of which builds upon work that has
already been completed as part of earlier program activities.<p>

     The first of these initiatives was an expansion of work initially done for  the EERC by Dr.
William Gosnold on the analysis of the UCG-related hydrothermal regime at the RM1 site,
utilizing PC-based computer capabilities.  Specifically, this initiative involved the more rigorous
analysis of the RM1 hydrothermal regime utilizing previously unavailable, enhanced computer
capabilities in the form of the University of North Dakota (UND) Cray X/MP supercomputer
system.  This additional analysis will allow insights into UCG-related process:setting interactions
that are presently not possible, yet which may have important implications in the design, siting,
and conduct of long-term UCG operations in particular.<p>

     The second initiative was focused on the development of an "atlas" of mineral and amorphous
phases that were identified during the EERC efforts to chemically and mineralogically
characterize unaltered and thermally altered subsurface materials recovered from the RM1 site. 
This document will make available, in a readily usable form, all the phase-related data,
information, and insights that may be of some value to those charged with designing, siting,
conducting, and evaluating future UCG operations.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project were to:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Expand the analysis of the UCG-related hydrothermal regime at
the RM1 site through the application of previously unavailable, advanced computer capabilities
utilizing all subsurface temperature data collected during the test program.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Produce an "atlas" of the mineral and amorphous phases that
were identified during the characterization of available unaltered and thermally altered materials from
the RM1 site.<br>
</ul><p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     The initiative focused on the UCG-related hydrothermal regime at the RM1 site has resulted
in:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Acquisition of an additional detailed set of subsurface
temperature data from the site and a comprehensive review of all site-related temperature
data.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Completion of 1) the conversion, for use on UND's Cray system,
of the PC-based computer code that was developed and used for the initial analysis of the RM1
hydrothermal regime; 2) the compilation and testing of the transformed code on the Cray system; and
3) the refinement of the Cray-based code to address execution problems, reduce the execution time,
and more accurately simulate the physical phenomena related to the RM1 hydrothermal
system.<br> 

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Development of visualization routines to represent the model
output utilizing the visualization capabilities associated with the Cray system.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Completion of the development of a three-dimensional simulation
of the heat flux from the two RM1 cavities for the late posttest period, that is, after the second cavity
cleanup effort in August 1989. The predominant heat source during that period was the residual heat
in the cavities, while the primary heat distribution mechanism was the groundwater moving through
the target coal seam.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Completion of a draft report comprehensively reviewing this
analysis of the UCG-related hydrothermal regime at the RM1 site.<br>
</ul>
 Activities related to the "atlas" initiative have resulted in the completion of an initial draft of the
document, the primary focus of which is more than fifty sections specific to the significant
phases that were identified during the RM1-related materials characterization effort.  Each of
these sections consists of:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The phase name (mineral, mineral group/series, other).<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The chemical formula(s).<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Identification criteria for relevant techniques, which typically
include x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence, optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and electron probe microanalysis.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Selected illustrative material to supplement the identification
criteria, typically including representative chemical analyses, XRD patterns, and OM and SEM
photomicrographs.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Observations on the mode of occurrence in unaltered RM1
near-cavity geological materials and in test-related thermally altered materials along both the heating
and cooling paths.  This section also includes comments on the origin of the phase, the phases with
which it is typically associated, and the frequency of occurrence.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Comments on the UCG-related implications of the phase, that is,
what the knowledge of the phase can contribute to 1) the reconstruction of conditions at or near the
gasification site during the time that the phase was formed and 2) the assessment of environmental
impacts resulting from UCG process:setting interactions. </ul>

<title>Modeling of Gasifier Operations at the
Great Plains Gasification Plant</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Modeling of Gasifier Operations at the Great Plains Gasification Plant</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     The Great Plains Gasification Plant (GPGP), owned and operated by the Dakota Gasification
Company (DGC), is strongly interested in understanding plant operation for the purposes of
optimization and control.  The two possible routes to that understanding are direct
experimentation or modeling. Plant experimentation is very expensive (in terms of time and
money) and very limited in terms of the variables that can be studied and their allowable ranges. 
Therefore, modeling the plant on a computer is a far better alternative if it can be done.  GPGP
selected ASPEN/SP from Simulation Sciences (SimSci) as the framework for this computer
model and asked that an existing ASPEN module (called RGAS) be modified to adequately
describe gasifier operations.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     There were two objectives for this project, which approached modeling from the two opposite
extremes:  modeling from first principles and "curve fitting" of plant data.  The first objective
was to improve the ASPEN (RGAS) model, which is based on first principles.  Specifically, the
parameters in the model (reaction rate constants, activity coefficient of the coal, heat-transfer
coefficient, heat of devolatilization, and devolatilization schedule) were to be changed to
correspond to the coal actually being used.  The second objective was to use neural networks to
see if information could be gleaned from historical plant data that could be used for process
control.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<h4>ASPEN/RGAS</h3>
     Great strides were made in improving the RGAS model.  Now all responses are being predicted
within the accuracy of the data:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The RGAS program was modified so that parameters could be
optimized automatically.  Formerly, this was a three-month effort.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The reaction rate model was expanded to include an activity
coefficient for the coal.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The linear devolatilization temperature profile was examined and
found to be adequate.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Neural Nets</h4>
     Daily data from over 2 years of plant operation were used to train a neural network to predict gas
liquor flow rate from levels of operating variables and coal properties.  If that could have been
done with any precision, then the steam/oxygen ratio could have been maximized, which, in turn,
would maximize profit.  The results were disappointing, the neural net did not perform any better
than the linear regression model.  More data (or perhaps more relevant inputs) are being sought
from DGC.  Examination of these data may result in a neural network with the ability to
effectively predict gasifier performance.  This activity is suggested as a future project.<p>

<title>Fuel Utilization Properties</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Fuel Utilization Properties </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The mission of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the EERC Cooperative Agreement
is to promote the clean and efficient use of energy resources through a program of research
and development efforts.  These efforts include research characterization, air quality impacts
and controls, advanced power systems, and advanced fuel forms.  The goals of the
Cooperative Agreement are energy efficiency, preservation of the environment, securing the
domestic energy supply, diversifying the coal industry, and fortifying the foundations in
research, education, and technology commercialization.<p>

     The purpose of this project is to determine the impacts of specific coal properties and additives
on ash formation and deposition in advanced power systems.  The first year focused on
integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC)-type systems, whereby small-scale furnaces
were employed to simulate gasification or highly reducing conditions in order to produce
entrained ash and deposits for analysis.  A lesser emphasis was placed on analyzing deposits
from a small-scale pressurized fluid-bed reactor (PFBR).  Limited work was also directed
toward surveying the types of ash partitioning and ash deposition that could occur in PFBRs.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The overall objectives of this project are to determine key fuel properties and mechanisms that
impact ash formation and deposition in advanced power systems and to propose and test
measures for mitigating ash deposition.  Specific goals for this year's work in the area of ash
formation and deposition in advanced power systems include:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Determining the general chemical and physical properties of
simulated entrained ash and deposits that may lead to operational problems.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Identifying and testing methods to mitigate deposition in
IGCC-type systems.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<h4>Inorganic Transformations under Gasification or Highly
Reducing Conditions</h4>

     Determination of mechanisms of coal inorganic transformations under reducing or gasification
conditions is being accomplished using a pressurized drop-tube furnace (PDTF).  Entrained ash
is produced from coal using gas compositions, pressures, and temperatures similar to those used
in current IGCC systems, and the composition of the ash is compared to original inorganic
constituents in the coal.  A first-generation model of inorganic transformations under gasification
conditions will be formulated by revising an existing EERC model called ATRAN, which
predicts entrained ash particle-size and composition distribution for a conventional pulverized
coal combustion system.  The ATRAN code will be enhanced with currently available data at the
EERC as well as with data generated from the PDTF ash production tests.  The initial
enhancements to be made to the ATRAN model will focus on the kinetics of the decomposition
of sulfides and carbonates.  A preliminary assessment has been made, and the current ATRAN
code does have the structure and flexibility to be converted so that it can be used for predicting
ash transformations under reducing environment conditions.  The coals have been tested  in the
PDTF under atmospheric pressure and a series of different reducing environments.  Black
Thunder subbituminous coal shows decreased interaction of organically associated calcium with
clays and quartz during coal conversion under reducing conditions.  Illinois No. 6 coal shows
decreased interaction of iron with aluminosilicates but more production of iron sulfide species
during coal conversion under reducing conditions.<p>

<h4>Mechanisms of Deposit Formation in IGCC-Type
Systems</h4>

     Deposits have been generated in a DTF for three coals to determine the effects of coal
characteristics, system aerodynamics and transport mechanisms, pressure, temperature,
and gas composition on the degree of deposit severity.  Deposit severity was assessed
based on the hardness, growth rate, and liquid-phase viscosity of the deposits that are
formed.  Deposit analysis was accomplished using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray
fluorescence,
x-ray diffraction, and physical strength analysis.  Generally, deposits from
low-rank coals such as the Black Thunder (Wyoming) subbituminous coal showed lower
amounts of oxidized mineral species, but the bulk of the deposit-forming material was
similar to what was observed for conventional deposits.  Calcium aluminosilicate material
dominated the deposits.  Deposits formed from higher-rank bituminous coals such as the
Illinois No. 6 did show more reduced iron species and iron aluminosilicates.<p>

<h4>Fouling Deposit Mitigation Measures</b>
</h4>
     Mitigation measures were proposed based on their ability to reduce deposit physical strength or
accumulation rates.  A kaolinite additive was used in the precombustion mode to try to render the
alkali ineffective for depressing melting points of entrained ash and deposit material.  It is the
lower melting point and lower-viscosity phases that cause entrained ash to stick and deposits to
form and acquire strength.  This additive and lime may also act to physically weaken deposits by
diluting the bad-acting components or by creating a more porous and weakened deposit structure. 
One baseline coal and several coal additive mixtures were tested in the drop-tube reactor under a
limited set of gasification conditions to produce deposits with the addition of kaolinite and lime
additives.  Physical and chemical-mineralogical analysis of the deposits using SEM techniques
showed that the kaolinite and lime additives do reduce deposit strength and cohesiveness at
higher-zone collection temperatures.  Lower-temperature-zone collection tests produced deposits
that were very friable and weak for both types of coals.  Impacts of additives on the
lower-temperature
deposits were neglible.

<h1>Wind Resource Assessment for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians on the Turtle Mountain Reservation </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The wind industry has progressed significantly in the last 12 years and may be on the verge of
major expansion into the midwest region of the United States.  Wind resources in North Dakota
are among the highest of any state.  The Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, which is located in
north-central North Dakota just below the Canadian border in the Turtle Mountains, has winds
rated at a power class of  5 or higher.  The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians Tribe is
interested in developing its wind energy resources and the potential environmental and economic
benefits that will result from this activity.<p>
<p>
     This project consists of three major tasks:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  An environmental impact assessment to determine any adverse
impacts to local wildlife that may occur if a large-scale wind farm were to be constructed and
operated. <br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> A resource assessment of the Turtle Mountain
Reservation.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  A demonstration turbine installed and operated by the tribe for a
period of one year.<br>
</ul>
<p>
     Following one year of operation and wind data collection, an assessment will be made to
determine the economic feasibility of constructing and operating a large-scale wind farm.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The primary goals of this wind energy project are the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To perform the resource assessment of the wind energy potential
of the Turtle Mountain Reservation and to collect the microsite wind data that will be necessary to
strategically site wind turbines in the future.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To perform an environmental assessment of the Turtle Mountain
Reservation with regard to potential wildlife impact from wind farms.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To provide actual performance data and hands-on experience for
students, instructors, researchers, political leaders, and tribal planners with regard to the development
of large-scale wind energy projects.<br>
<p>
To perform the preliminary economic assessment of a large-scale wind farm site on the Turtle
Mountain Reservation.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To increase the awareness and acceptance of wind energy
development on the Turtle Mountain Reservation and to provide a working example of current wind
energy conversion technology.<br>

<h1>National Alternative Fuels Laboratory</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2></font>
<p>
     The National Alternative Fuels Laboratory (NAFL) at the EERC was founded in 1988 to serve as
the "Underwriter's Laboratory" for oxygenated fuels through the support of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture.  NAFL efforts have included work with the Governors Ethanol Coalition, the
National Corn Growers Association, the American Coalition for Ethanol, and producers.  The
NAFL's problem-solving approach recognizes the uniquely linked needs of growers, producers,
consumers, industry, and the environment.  An NAFL program linked with industry will
integrate ethanol-related projects with other alternative energy projects.  The driving forces for
alternative fuels development and utilization and issues that the NAFL is concerned with are
highlighted below.<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> There is a national desire to enhance markets for U.S.
agricultural products.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Alternative fuels based on agricultural products are a key
component of energy independence for the United States.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established a gasoline
program mandating the use of oxygenates in areas of the United States with high carbon monoxide
levels.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Biomass-based alternative fuels have the potential to minimize
the
environmental impacts of an expanding society.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Some oxygenates currently used to reduce carbon monoxide
emissions and ozone formation are nonbiodegradable and have been detected in precipitation and
groundwater.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The formation and the degree of toxicity of airborne pollutants
due to gasoline evaporative emissions are dependent upon the type of oxgenate used.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The health effects of the use of the oxygenate MTBE (methyl
<i>tertiary</i>-butyl ether) have been questioned.  The potential for adverse health effects and
detrimental performance with the use of MTBE and other oxygenates must be more clearly
understood.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Ethanol and ethanol-based oxygenates are produced mainly from
corn grown by U.S. farmers, while MTBE (26% of which will be imported in 1995) is derived
largely from natural gas.  Imports of MTBE are projected to reach 90,000 barrels per day in the near
future.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives of the program are as follows:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To collect and disseminate information on alternative fuels, with
an emphasis on fuels derived or partially derived from renewable resources.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To perform experimentation on motor fuel component behavior
and properties for use in the regulatory process.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To develop, demonstrate, and commercialize processes and
products to expand the use of alternative fuels.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To develop alternative oxygenates to meet stringent
environmental
requirements on fuels.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results </h2>
     <p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> NAFL has working partnerships with industry, including the
National Corn Growers Association, ethanol producers, and the Pellet Fuels Institute, to develop
information on efficient and environmentally acceptable use of alternative fuels.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Various ethanol denaturants have demonstrated their potential to
reduce the increased vapor pressure of 10% ethanol fuels.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Automobile fuel evaporation canisters have been demonstrated
and compared with ethanol-blended (and other oxygenated) fuels and base fuels.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> NAFL has developed partnerships with other laboratories and
institutions in research programs, resulting in data sharing, literature tracking, and database
development.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> At-the-pump survey and analysis of fuels sampled from across
the
United States comparing advertised with actual fuel compositions were performed by NAFL.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> NAFL performed compositional analysis of evaporative

for improving the understanding of atmospheric activity and ozone formation.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Future Directions</h2>
<p>
     The NAFL program will evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of alternative fuel
use on our nation, focusing on the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Continuing the test program on fuel evaporative emissions to
determine the effects of oxygenates and denaturants on environmental and performance issues. 
Overall environmental issues to be addressed include solubility and partitioning characteristics,
cosolvency, and biodegradation of oxygenates.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Providing objective criteria for the public and industry regarding
evaluation of environmental and economic aspects of alternative fuel use.  These include involvement
in programs of the Governors Ethanol Coalition, the North Dakota Alternative Fuels Task Force, the
American Coalition for Ethanol, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Pursuing research and development leading to commercialization
opportunities in partnership with industry to determine the chemical and physical characteristics of
oxygenates, remediation technologies affecting the alternative fuels industry, and development of
improved and new oxygenates.</ul> <p><hr>

<h1>Reactivity and Analytical Support for Oxygenate Project </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The addition of oxygenates to gasoline has been mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Act
Amendments to lower pollution caused by deleterious exhaust emissions in urban areas.  This
project contributed to the development of a new technology for production of the tertiary ether
oxygenates, methyl <i>tertiary</i>-butyl ether (MTBE) and <i>tertiary</i>-amyl methyl
ether (TAME), whose
addition to gasoline will give a cleaner-burning fuel with lower hydrocarbon and carbon
monoxide emissions.  Agricultural and waste products were used to achieve this environmental
improvement.  Thus renewable energy sources can contribute substantially to reformulated fuel
production.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     Ether oxygenates that will be in high demand for addition to reformulated gasoline can be
prepared from agricultural products or by-products.  The objective of this work was to evaluate
new catalysts for the conversion of the biomass precursors to olefins with a branched structure
which are required for preparation of tertiary ethers, such as MTBE and TAME.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     The catalysts were successful in removing oxygen from the biomass precursors, as well as in
reforming the structures to the desired branched isomers without converting much of the biomass
precursor to aromatics.  This project developed a concept for an economical process to produce
these important fuel components from renewable energy sources.  Feed materials for the process
included starch, hemicellulose, and cellulose components, and thus a wide variety of agricultural,
forestry, and waste products can be utilized.<p>
<p>
     The best results were obtained using 2-butanone as an intermediate in the process.  This is
produced by bacterial fermention and acid treatment of the aqueous medium.  The 2-butanone
was converted catalytically to hydrocarbon mixtures in 90% yields.  The products were mainly
the C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>5</sub> olefins, with about equal amounts of isobutylene and
butylenes.<p>

<title>Effect of Ethanol Denaturant on Gasoline
RVP</title>

<h1>Effect of Ethanol Denaturant on Gasoline RVP</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Background </h2>
     Preparation of a mixture of 10% ethanol in gasoline (E10) results in a vapor pressure (VP) that
is higher than either the ethanol or the gasoline individually.  As a result of the increased
vapor pressure, increased levels of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are released to the
atmosphere causing a reduction in air quality.  However, the hydrophilic nature of ethanol and
the choice of the denaturant added to the ethanol to make it unfit for human consumption may
be at least partially responsible for the increased VP.  Denaturants legal for use in gasoline are
light hydrocarbons, which themselves have high Reid vapor pressure (RVP) relative to
gasoline.  Actual denaturants used in denaturing commercial fuel ethanol are liquified natural
gas and regular unleaded gasoline.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The objective of this project was to determine the role of water and ethanol denaturant in
increasing the RVP of a gasoline-ethanol blend.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Both water and some of the legal denaturants were shown to cause an increase in the vapor
pressure of both gasoline and gasoline-ethanol blends.  The addition of absolute (undenatured)
ethanol to gasoline resulted in a 0.8- to 1.0-psig increase in RVP.  Addition of denatured ethanol
tended to increase the RVP 0.1 to 0.3 psig above the initial 0.8 to 1.0 psig.  The additional
increase in RVP was attributed to the presence of denaturants in the alcohol.  Addition of water
to E10 blends resulted in a 0.1- to 0.4 psig increase in RVP.<p>
<p>
     The protocol followed and the results of this work were summarized in an article entitled "Vapor
Pressure Response to Denaturant and Water in E10 Blends," in the January 1995 edition of the
<i>Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association</i>.<p>

<title>Preparation and Combustion of
RDF-Coal Slurry Fuels</title>
</head>
<body>
<body background = "../gif/drops1.jpg">
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h1>Preparation and Combustion of RDF-Coal Slurry Fuels</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     In 1992, the EERC and EnerTech Environmental, Inc., began conducting research using an
innovative municipal waste reuse technology developed by EnerTech to address a major
environmental challenge:  disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW).  The refuse-derived fuel
(RDF) carbonization process produces an enhanced slurry fuel, reporting increases in energy
density of 400%, reductions in chloride concentration of 80%, and reductions in the sulfur
content of 50%.  Based on these results, in 1993, the EERC and EnerTech developed a
RDF-lignite slurry fuels project to integrate the waste reuse technology with methods currently
under development at the EERC for converting low-rank coals to energy-dense liquid fuels. <p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The goal of this project was to evaluate a new and innovative process to make better use of solid
waste materials by disposing of them in an environmentally benign way, while simultaneously
generating energy.  This program was intended to assess the feasibility of blending a MSW slurry
with lignite in an aqueous phase:  specifically, blending an upgraded North Dakota lignite slurry
fuel with a low-sulfur, carbonized RDF slurry and reviewing combustion characteristics in a
bench-scale pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) unit.  Use of the blend not only
reduces the SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the fuel but also utilizes the energy from
MSW.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     EnerTech supplied a dried, pelletized sample of RDF from Thief River Falls, Minnesota, having
an as-received heating value of about 8000 Btu/lb.  Slurry samples were carbonized in a batch
autoclave, resulting in a fuel with a dry heating value of about 13,000 Btu/lb, thus increasing the
heating value of the solid fuel by 50%.  The carbonized RDF could be slurried with water to
about 42 wt% concentration.  The energy density of a slurry of pumpable viscosity was improved
about 400%.  In addition, the chloride concentration of the RDF material was also reduced by
over 60%, most of which transferred to the aqueous phase.  This reduction is extremely
important, since high chlorine concentrations lead to the formation of furans and dioxins during
combustion.  A similar carbonization investigation was also completed on a lignite with an
as-received heating value of 6300 Btu/lb.  Carbonization tests with the lignite indicated that the
lignite slurry heating value increased by over 60%, with an achievable solids concentration of
over 55 wt%.<p>
<p>
     Approximately 40 pounds of carbonized RDF slurry fuel, RDF-lignite slurry fuel, and lignite
slurry fuel was produced using a 2-gal autoclave system at the EERC.  This fuel will be used for
the combustion test program to be completed at a later date.<p>

<title>Combustion Characterization of Carbonized Refuse-Derived Fuel</title>

<h1>Combustion Characterization of Carbonized Refuse-Derived Fuel </h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
   As public concern grows and governmental regulations become increasingly strict, numerous
municipalities and industries face exorbitant costs for solid waste disposal.  According to the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the national cost of waste disposal is more than $30
billion per year.  Established landfills are reaching capacity at an alarming rate, and owners are
escalating the "tipping fees" they charge to accept municipal solid waste.  It is critical that
out-of-date, expensive waste disposal methods be replaced by more efficient and cost-effective
technologies.  That is the primary goal of this project.  By converting up to 70% of the solid
waste that arrives at the landfill to a pumpable slurry fuel, the amount of solid waste requiring
disposal can be reduced, and a competitive fuel source can be produced.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
   The main objective of the test program was to establish the effectiveness of the
EERC-EnerTech
carbonization process to produce a liquid fuel with desirable combustion properties.  Specific
objectives included the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Quantify flue gas concentrations of SO<sub>2</sub>,
NO<sub>x</sub>, and hazardous air pollutants<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Evaluate the fuel's fouling and slagging characteristics<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Evaluate particulate collection properties by electrostatic
precipitation<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Characterize the fly ash leaching potential for disposal and
reuse<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
   A refuse-derived fuel (RDF) obtained locally was converted by the EERC-EnerTech
carbonization process to a pumpable slurry fuel for use in a pilot-scale combustion test in the
combustion test facility located in the EERC combustion pilot plant.  The fuel was fired at a rate
sufficient to maintain a furnace exit gas temperature of 2000&#176;F at an excess air rate near 25%. 
Results indicated excellent combustion efficiency, as more than 99.5% of the carbon was
converted to CO&#176;2 and water.  The fuel exhibited a very low ash-fouling potential, and fly ash
resistivity measurements indicated that adequate collection could be achieved using an
electrostatic precipitator.  The fly ash was also tested to determine the degree to which toxic trace
elements would be leached from the fly ash in a disposal or reuse scenario.  Analyses indicated
that these toxic trace elements would not be leached from the fly ash above current standards.  <p>
<p>
   Future work will focus on producing a carbonized slurry with a greater energy density,
optimizing other slurry properties.  Combustion testing will determine the effects of varying
processing parameters on the fuel's fouling potential and on fly ash properties.  In addition,
blends of the carbonized RDF with North Dakota lignite will be investigated.  It is the goal of
future work to perform the engineering and economic analyses required to establish a
commercial-scale demonstration project at the Grand Forks municipal landfill.

<title>Wastepaper Pellets as a Source of Fuel

<h1>Wastepaper Pellets as a Source of Fuel for Auxiliary Home Heating</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Paper and paper products make up the largest part of the municipal solid waste stream.  Solid
waste diversion through recycling is effective at reducing the quantity of material which requires
ultimate disposal.  However, supply and demand dictates the total quantity of material which can
be economically recycled. Currently only certain types of paper products are acceptable for
recycling, and the markets for many of these are depressed because of oversupply.  An
opportunity exists to reduce the volume of paper entering the waste stream and to produce a
salable product.  The technology exists to produce densified refuse-derived fuel pellets from
various grades of paper and paper products for use in pellet stoves for auxiliary home heating. 
However, because of a limited amount of available data, various parameters such as ash, sulfur,
chloride, and heavy metals contents must be quantified and actual combustion data must be
generated so that the combustion performance of wastepaper pellets can be compared to that of
existing, commercially available wood pellet fuels.<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
     The objectives of this project are to determine the types of waste paper that would make the best
pellets from a combustion standpoint and to define the combustion characteristics of one or two
types of wastepaper pellet fuels in a representative combustion system.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>

     A representative wood pellet stove has been obtained and instrumented for the proposed work. 
Three types of wood pellet fuels have been procured and used for shakedown testing of the stove. 
Laboratory and combustion testing of the wastepaper pellet fuels will be completed as soon as
they can be produced and delivered.

<title>Value-Added Carbons</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Value-Added Carbons </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Coal is a versatile material from which a variety of value-added products can be produced. 
Current research at the EERC is focused on investigating special carbon products derived from
coal to which value is added.  These carbons have application, for example, in the power
generation, municipal waste incineration, metal, and automotive industries.  Substantial
environmental benefits are afforded from their use through conservation of energy and resources,
reduction in gaseous emissions, and prevention of water and soil pollution.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The pivotal question to be addressed is whether unique, cost-effective activated carbons can be
produced by taking advantage of the inherently porous and reactive structure of low-rank coals,
e.g., lignite and subbituminous coals.  Carbon products will be evaluated in relation to their use
in air toxic control and other applications.  In addition to developing carbons for specific market
needs, the program also seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of the extent and quality
of the porous surface required to achieve rapid, high-capacity adsorption of gaseous and toxic
metal pollutants and the processing conditions for converting coal into superior carbon
products.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     A rotary kiln was constructed and used for activation of North Dakota lignite with potassium
hydroxide (KOH) at high temperatures (900&#176;C).  However, highly porous carbons were not
formed, and difficulties with plugging were encountered.  A new high-temperature stirred reactor
was designed and built.  Carbons prepared with powdered KOH have high iodine values (1100
mg/g).  Carbons prepared by making a paste with KOH and NaOH had lower iodine values. 
Methods for preparing ultraporous carbon for supercapacitors are under investigation.

<h2>Evaluation of Carbon Products </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Inverse gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography methods can be used for the
determination of surface energies or adsorption characteristics.  Free energies, enthalpies and
entropies of adsorption, acidic or basic characteristics (strengths) and distribution (quantitation),
hydrophobicity parameters, sorbent polarities, and deformation polarizabilities will be
determined for carbon samples produced in this and other projects.<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
     The objective of this project is to set up inverse GC instrumentation and obtain a set of
measurements useful for determining the thermodynamic properties of chars and carbons from
low-rank coals with respect to adsorption of mercury, sulfur dioxide, and other organic probe
species.  The long-range goal is the development of models for low-rank char porosity and
surface energies that relate to char and carbon stability and effectiveness for sorption of polar and
nonpolar substrates.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>

     Instrumentation for liquid injection of probe molecules into the heated, packed column and the
appropriate detection of eluted organic probes was assembled.  A variety of probes will be
utilized to determine the thermodynamic properties of carbons, including polar and nonpolar
probes for determining surface hydrophobicity and polarity parameters, which can be related to
earlier work with other carbons.  A detector for a mercury pulse is not currentlly available, but
we expect one to be available in the near future.  The SO<sub>2</sub> pulse will be detected by
infrared
spectrometry.

<title>Carbon Molecular Sieves</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Carbon Molecular Sieves</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Separations of gas components can be effected with molecular sieves made from carbons by
developing a pore-size distribution in the subnanometer range.  The required pore-size
distribution can be achieved by filling the numerous larger pores in a coal char with a liquid
phase, which is a good precursor for carbons when thermally activated.  This technique was to
be performed with some recently available materials from waste and coal pyrolysis.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objective was to examine the feasibility of preparing microporous composite carbons from
inexpensive or waste products that exhibit high selectivity properties suitable for gas
separations.  Although many tarry and polymeric materials had been investigated previously,
the pore-filling materials utilized in this project were unique.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     Two new methods for cross-linking coal tars and plastic pyrolysis tars were developed.  Both the
methylal condensation product and the aluminum phenoxide-catalyzed alkylation product were
waxy resins.  The resinous products from these processes have potential as binders for pelleting
as well as pore fillers for making molecular sieves.  The molecular sieves were prepared by
impregnation of macroporous chars with the resinous materials and thermal activation to develop
the micropore structures.  The chars that were impregnated with these materials were heated to
activate them and convert them to molecular sieve materials.<p>
     Carbons were impregnated with biomass-derived resins and recarbonized.  They were tested for
catalytic reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> with ammonia at 150&#176;C.  The carbons effectively
catalyzed the reduction of NO<sub>2</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>, but the reduction of NO
was partial.  Further testing of molecular sieve carbons for gas separation is in progress.<p>

     The set of molecular sieve carbons being prepared by pore-filling the char with plastic pyrolysis
resin and activating at various temperatures will be tested for selective gas adsorption.  Further
work is needed to understand and improve the selective catalytic reduction ability of these
carbons.<p>

<title>New Methods for Preparation of
Stabilized Carbons</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>New Methods for Preparation of Stabilized Carbons </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The use of chars and carbons as adsorbents and catalyst supports could be expanded if their
stability to reactive gases were improved.  The purpose of this project was to develop methods
for applying surface coatings of boron carbide, silicon carbide, and titanum carbide on the char. 
Formation of these composites will increase stability and improve structural strength and,
consequently, resistance to abrasion.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The first objective of this project was to develop methods for coating low-rank coal (LRC) chars
and carbons by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to produce high-surface-area composites that
are inert to reactive atmospheres.  The proposed coating layers were to be formed from elements
known to form extremely hard and stable carbide materials.<p>

     The second objective was to determine the feasibility of using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE)
to prepare an activated carbon with a very high surface area.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>

     CVD treatments of carbons and chars with boron carbide gave coated carbon products with
substantially higher resistance to oxidation in an air stream.  Products were stable to 600&#176;C,
whereas carbons initially decomposed at 350&#176;-500&#176;C in air.<p>

     Previous SFE experiments generated low-porosity chars with areas of 175 m<sup>2</sup>/g,
owing to collapse of pores during depressurization.  Pore collapse was reduced by dropping the
pressure very slowly while maintaining the critical temperature.  The new procedure gave chars with
surfaces as high as 361 m<sup>2</sup>/g from a North Dakota lignite.  Inorganic pillars were
introduced into the pores by injecting soluble precursor reagents under supercritical conditions.  The
pillars prevent some of the pore collapse during depressurization and give char with surface areas as
large as 328 m<sup>2</sup>/g.<p>

<title>Upgrading Coal Chars and Coal Liquids</title>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Upgrading Coal Chars and Coal Liquids </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     Current technology for the production of activated carbon involves a two-step process.  The first
step is carbonization, usually in an inert atmosphere.  The second step, activation, usually
involves mild oxidation with CO<sub>2</sub>, air, or steam, although chemical activation may
also be used. 
Activation parameters include heat treatment conditions, reagent gas, residence time, and
inorganic content.  The naturally high reactivity of low-rank coals, because of their relatively
high surface area and oxygen content, is advantageous for producing activated carbons tailored to
gas and water treatment applications.  Activated carbons are used to remove sulfur and nitrogen
oxides, trace metals, and heavy organics from stack gas.  Water and wastewater treatment
consumes large quantities of activated carbon.  However, the optimum technology for realizing
this potential for activated carbon is still lacking.<p>

     Coal liquids produced during mild gasification of coals are known to be unstable and to
polymerize during recovery, storage, or secondary upgrading.  Primary devolatilization products
can undergo additional fragmentation by the extension of residence time at temperatures over
300&#176;C in the presence of catalysts such as limestone, dolomite, or iron compounds.  For
instance, calcium-based catalysts increase the dehydroxylation of phenolics to simpler aromatics. 
The CO<sub>2</sub> acceptor gasification process, which uses a dolomite bed material,
reported essentially no tar formation, implying that the bed material was catalytic.  In the catalytic
steam gasification of low-rank coals at the EERC using a limestone bed, only light hydrocarbons and
naphthalene were formed.  The presence of iron can aid in hydrogen scrambling from long-chain
paraffins to decrease coking.  In order to improve liquid quality, an in-process (close-coupled)
reaction system is needed essentially to complete the reformation in the gas phase before reactive coal
liquids condense and have the opportunity to form refractory polymers.<p> 

<p>

     Compounds containing nitrogen functionalities in coal liquids are the most difficult and costly of
the compounds that must be removed during refining.  These troublesome compounds, on the
other hand, contain valuable chemicals which, if separated inexpensively, could yield substantial
income to the process.  Preliminary tests have shown that they can be selectively adsorbed onto
spent nickel-based catalysts.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of the project were to 1) assess preparation/activation methods and characteristics
of low-rank coal char that contribute to its adsorptivity for pollutants in wastewater and/or gases,
2) determine methods of enhancing the activity of the char, and 3) investigate the feasibility of a
catalyst bed close-coupled to a fluid-bed carbonizer to crack the emerging coal liquids into more
valuable products.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     This project has been completed, and the three objectives have been accomplished.  One Alaskan
(Beluga) subbituminous coal and two North Dakota coals (Beulah lignite and leonardite) were
pyrolyzed under nitrogen and activated with steam and carbon dioxide-argon atmospheres in the
EERC-constructed integrated bench-scale gasifier (IBG) of nominal 100-g capacity.  Staged
heating, i.e., dropping the coal charge in at 500&#176;C, heating to a final temperature of
850&#176;C, and activating with steam, tended to give chars with enhanced adsorption.  In the case
of Beulah lignite, staged heating produced increased methane and carbon monoxide in the gaseous 
products.  However, preliminary experiments indicated that rapid heating to lower temperatures
yielded more adsorptive chars.  The steam-activated leonardite char exhibited substantially greater
adsorption of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) at 100&#176;C than the steam-activated Beulah
lignite and Alaskan char, but the latter two showed SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption comparable to
commercially available activated coal chars.  Pellets formed from the steam-activated Beulah lignite
char and polyvinyl alcohol showed improved water resistance and apparent hardness.<p>           

<p>

     Preliminary tests on activating leonardite with potassium hydroxide indicated increased
SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption at 100&#176;C for freshly prepared char under rapid heating
conditions.<p>
     Coal liquid upgrading was carried out in the IBG by passing all hot gases formed during
pyrolysis through a catalyst bed.  The solid catalyst was supported in a heated module flanged
directly to the top of the reactor.  The module was heated by the reactor and was typically
50&#176;-100&#176;C below that of the reactor.  Fourier transform infrared on-line analysis of the
pyrolysis
gases indicated an increase in light hydrocarbon gases in the gas stream after passing through a
Ni catalyst bed compared with that of the raw stream, indicating that catalytic cracking of tars is
accomplished.  In the follow-on project, less expensive catalyst forms will be tested in an attempt
to find more economical, less easily poisoned catalyst materials.

<title>Coke Evaluation and the Development of
a Tailored Form Coke for the Foundry

<h2> Coke Evaluation and the Development of a Tailored Form Coke for the Foundry Industry
</h2> </center> 
<hr>



<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Cupolas are used to produce over 70% of iron castings.  Coke is essentially the universal fuel
for cupola melting.  The increasingly stringent environmental regulations, beginning
1998-2003, will lead to supply problems of coke from traditional coke ovens.  Form coke is
the most viable alternative to foundry coke.  It is produced in a closed system from low-cost
(often low-rank) coals.  This project evaluated the applicability of form coke for foundry use
and the development of a tailored form coke incorporating iron waste and alloying agents as a
means to use these materials more efficiently in the cupola operation.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective was to produce, via environmentally friendly processes, a low-cost
alternative fuel--form coke--for cupola melting.  The aim was to produce form coke
briquettes having superior properties to those of conventional foundry coke.  The work was
divided into five phases.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The EERC procured three foundry cokes and two metallurgical cokes for evaluation.  The
foundry cokes included one domestically produced slot oven coke, a Korean form coke produced
by stamping and then calcining a coke breeze-anthracite-pitch binder mixture, and a U.S. form
coke produced by briquetting and then calcining a coal char-coal pitch-caking coal mixture.  The
metallurgical cokes included a Japanese form coke produced by briquetting and then calcining a
coal char-coal pitch binder mixture and a South Korean coke which is prepared by briquetting a
noncoking coal and then calcining the briquettes with a coking coal in a slot oven.<p>

<p>

     Property (chemical, physical, mechanical) determinations included sulfur, ash, volatile matter,
and carbon contents, composition of coke ash, heating value, ash fusion temperatures (reducing
atmosphere), true and apparent densities, surface area and pore volume, reactivity (by Japanese
"I" test), abrasion (tumble) resistance, and tensile strength.  Abrasion resistance, tensile strength,
and organic vapor emission measurements were performed on coke exposed to reactive
atmospheres or elevated temperatures that simulate cupola operating conditions.<p>

<p>

     Preliminary results indicated that when chemical, physical, and mechanical properties are
considered together, none of the form cokes are equivalent to the traditional oven coke.  The
chemical properties (sulfur, ash, and carbon contents) of the form cokes (foundry and
metallurgical) were typically inferior to the oven coke, but the mechanical properties (abrasion
resistance and tensile strength) of the form cokes were similar or better.  However, the
mechanical properties of foundry form cokes exposed to a simulated cupola atmosphere were
somewhat diminished relative to the oven coke.  The chemical, physical, and mechanical
properties of the form cokes can be modified to the desired levels by proper feedstock selection
and by processing adjustments.<p>

<title>Sorbent Carbon Development</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Sorbent Carbon Development</h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     Increasing attention is being directed towards carbons in powdered, granular, and pelletized
form for environmental applications associated with energy production, by-product recoveries,
and waste incineration as well as water purification and wastewater cleanup.  Typically,
carbons are activated to increase the surface area and, hence, the sorption capacity.  This
physical activation is usually carried out with steam or carbon dioxide at elevated
temperatures, whereas chemical activation involves treatment, e.g., with potassium hydroxide,
phosphoric acid, or zinc chloride, followed by pyrolysis at temperatures generally lower than
those used in physical activation.  <p>

     Sources of sorbent carbons include coals of various rank, coal-derived chars and cokes, and
carbonized bone, wood, and coconut shell.  A significant margin exists to reduce the
production cost by producing carbons from low-cost, highly reactive low-rank coals (LRCs). 
However, several aspects of sorbent carbon production, activation, and utilization from LRCs
are unclear, including how adsorption capacity and chemical/mechanical stability relate to coal
rank, coal properties, inherent or added cations, and carbon preparation conditions. Models
relating carbon properties to adsorption effectiveness for specific species are also lacking.  A
systematic development program on LRC-derived carbons is now being undertaken at the
EERC.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The primary objective of this work was to transform LRCs economically into effective sorbent
carbons for gas- and liquid-phase contaminant removal.  Initially, the aim of the work was to
compare the sorption of carbons prepared from a North Dakota lignite or leonardite with that
of coal-derived commercial carbons and to examine the relationship between coal properties
and adsorption characteristics of coal-derived carbons.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     A reaction vessel was designed to produce up to 20 lb of char in a single batch at a maximum
temperature of 1000&#176;C.  Steam or carbon dioxide activation of the char can be carried out in
the vessel, denoted as the "kiln" reactor.  Shakedown testing of the kiln reactor using 25 lb of North 
Dakota lignite indicated that the system performed according to the design criteria.  20 lb of char
was prepared from a North Dakota leonardite under optimal conditions for later activation
development.<p>
     The kiln reactor was assembled from a Cress Model X31TC kiln containing a stainless steel
cylindrical vessel wrapped on the outside with stainless steel tubing.  The kiln is rated for
2500&#176;F (1370&#176;C).  The vessel has a capacity of 2700 in.<sup>3</sup> (44,480
cm<sup>3</sup>) and is designed to be operated in the fixed-bed mode.  It has a distributer plate
on the bottom through which gas, preheated by the kiln as it passes through the external coils on the
vessel, enters to permeate the coal bed.  The tars, oils, moisture, and effluent gases exit through the
top of the vessel and pass through a series of two air-cooled condensers before being vented to the
outside of the building.  Georesources leonardite (-10  +30 mesh), received in June 1994, was used
as feed to the reactor.<p>

Washability testing was performed on raw leonardite and leonardite char prepared in the kiln
reactor at 450&#176;C under flowing N<sub>2</sub>.  The results indicated that physical
cleaning will reduce the ash in either the raw or carbonized leonardite by more than 55% with
72%-75% recovery of the feed (on a dry basis) in the float fraction.<p>

     The mineral content of the leonardite was quite high.  The presence of the large amount of ash
substantially reduced the available sorbent carbon per unit mass.  Therefore, to evaluate the
sorbent characteristics of the carbon, ash was reduced 55% by physical means (float-sink) and
98% by chemical means.  The physically cleaned char adsorbed 10.9 char wt%
SO<sub>2</sub>, while the chemically cleaned char adsorbed 8.1 char wt%
SO<sub>2</sub> at ambient conditions.<p>

     Steam activation for 20 minutes at 750&#176;C produced an SO<sub>2</sub> sorbent
superior to one produced at 20 minutes of steam followed by 5 minutes of 3.5% oxygen.  Oxidation,
even if slow as in the case of the low-oxygen activation gas, resulted in loss of pore surface area and
a corresponding loss in sorption sites in the char.  Similarly, steam activation for 20 minutes at
750&#176;C  resulted in more SO<sub>2</sub> sorbent than a char activated for 20 minutes
with steam at 850&#176;C.<p>

     Char was prepared at three carbonization temperatures, 350&#176;, 480&#176;, and
550&#176;C, to determine the effect of this operating parameter.  A slightly greater
SO<sub>2</sub> sorption was obtained with char which was carbonized at 350&#176;C than
that prepared at 550&#176;C.  Lower carbonization temperature gave slightly better carbonized
product for activation.  It appears that the tars, when heated and then cooled without volatilizing,
undergo change such that when heated to activation temperature, they carbonize and provide
additional active sites.<p>


     Char-steam contact time carried out indicated that activation with steam probably does little to
increase the sorptive capacity for SO<sub>2</sub>.  The SO<sub>2</sub> sorption (9 wt%)
obtained at ambient temperature at low or no steam activation time approximated those obtained in
work on previous projects involving char preparation.  Optimum SO<sub>2</sub> sorption was
obtained with char which had been activated with steam between 0 and 20 minutes.<p>

     Char prepared from the 1.4 float fraction of the physically cleaned leonardite adsorbed 10.9% of
its weight in SO<sub>2</sub> and had an iodine number of 435.<p>

<title>Evaluation of Sorbents for Volatile
Organic Compound Evaporation Control</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<center>
<h2>Evaluation of Sorbents for Volatile Organic Compound Evaporation Control </h2>
</center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

     Automobile evaporative emission canisters contain activated carbon sorbents that trap and store
fuel vapors emitted from automobile fuel tanks during periods of hot ambient temperatures and
after engine operation.  When a vehicle is started, combustion air is pulled through the canister,
and adsorbed vapors are removed from the sorbent and routed to the intake manifold for
combustion along with fuel from the tank.  The two  primary requirements of an effective
canister sorbent are that 1) it must be a strong enough adsorbent to hold onto the fuel vapors that
contact it and 2) it must be a weak enough adsorbent to release the captured vapors in the
presence of the air flow required by the engine for fuel combustion.  Most currently available
commercial canister sorbents are made from wood, which is reacted with phosphoric acid and
heat to yield an activated carbon with optimum pore size for gasoline vapor adsorption.<p>

     Although current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations regarding
automobile fuel vapor emissions are concerned primarily with evaporation due to ambient or
engine operation temperatures, regulations are being prepared that will require capturing
refueling emissions, which are generated by displacement of fuel vapors (present in the head
space of a partially empty tank) with liquid fuel.  Meeting these regulations, which are scheduled
to be initiated in 1998 and phased in over two years, will involve the use of onboard refueling
emission canisters.  Because of size, aerodynamic, and weight considerations important for
optimum mileage, the mandated addition of refueling emission canisters to automobiles will
create a need for sorbents that can meet higher vapor capacity and loading rate requirements. 
Work is ongoing at U.S. and Japanese auto industry and sorbent manufacturing laboratories to
develop more efficient activated carbon and synthetic polymeric sorbents for automotive
applications.<p>

     In addition to automobiles, other major sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
include chemical manufacturing plants, painting, cleaning, degreasing, and dry cleaning
operations, and any facility that uses volatile organic solvents.  Methods for controlling VOC
emissions from these and other sources will become increasingly more important as EPA
promulgates more air quality regulations.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>

     The objectives of this research were to 1) design and construct a test system for evaluating the
performance of different sorbents in trapping and releasing butane, gasoline, and other organic
vapors; 2) investigate the use of lignite char (made from North Dakota coal) as an automobile
fuel evaporation canister sorbent; 3) compare the adsorbing and desorbing characteristics of
lignite chars with those of several commercial sorbents using different VOC emissions; and 4)
investigate whether the presence of ethanol (or other oxygenates) in fuel vapors affects sorbent
performance in any way.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>

     A sorbent test system was designed and built around a gasoline vapor (or other desired VOC)
source that supplies a regulated vapor flow to a sorbent bed.  Calibrated mass flow controllers
were used to measure nitrogen flow to a VOC source, nitrogen-plus-fuel-vapor flow into the
sorbent bed, and nitrogen-plus-fuel-vapor flow out of the sorbent bed.  The output of the sorbent
bed is passed through a 10-cm-path-length, 50-cm<sup>3</sup> gas cell mounted in the sample
compartment
of a Bomem Model B-100 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, which is used to detect and
analyze breakthrough vapor emissions and purge emissions.<p>

     Tests were performed to compare several EERC-prepared lignite-derived chars to commercial
activated carbon and synthetic sorbents on the basis of gasoline working capacity.  These tests
indicated that the lignite-derived chars may be better suited to other applications in which the
VOC stream is made up of components that contain more "heteroatom" species such as alcohols,
ketones, aldehydes, organic chlorides, nitrogen compounds, and organic solvents.  Future testing
to investigate sorbent effectiveness using a simulated (multicomponent) VOC stream from an
industrial painting operation will build on the findings of and use equipment constructed for this
project.

<title>Hot-Gas Filter Ash Characterization</title>
</head>
<body><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h2> Hot-Gas Filter Ash Characterization </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3> Background </h3>
     Large-scale hot-gas filter testing supported by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) over the past 10 years has revealed numerous cases of
cake buildup on filter elements that has been difficult, if not impossible, to remove.  Physical
factors--including particle-size distribution, particle shape, and the aerodynamics of
deposition--certainly contribute to the difficulty in removing the cake.  However, circumstances
have also existed where critical temperatures and subsequent irreversible effects appeared to have
played a role.  Possibly, chemical and physical effects are helping to bond the ash to the filter or
to itself.<p>
     Therefore, both the physical and chemical aspects of ash formation and detachment from hot-gas
filters must be investigated.  EPRI has organized a consortium of companies in partnership with
DOE to fund the research necessary to determine the factors that cause hot-gas cleanup filters
either to be blinded by ash or to develop deposits that can bridge the filters and cause them to
fail.  The EERC is the sole contractor for this research.<p>
     This project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology
Center and a consortium of companies, which includes Westinghouse, Lurgi Lentjes Babcock,
Netherlands Energy Research Foundation, PowerGen, Schumacher Filters America,
Electicit&eacute; de
France, and ABB/Carbon AB.  The Electric Power Development Corporation of Japan is
strongly interested in joining the consortium.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The objectives of this project are threefold:  to determine the mechanisms by which a
difficult-to-clean
ash is formed and how it blinds or bridges hot-gas filters, to develop a method to determine
the rate of blinding or bridging, based on analyses of the feed coal and sorbent and the operating
conditions, and to provide suggestions for ways to prevent filter blinding and bridging by the
troublesome ash.<p>
    The work is investigating both the physical and chemical processes that are occurring within the
filter cake of high-temperature filters for a variety of coal and sorbent combinations and is
developing a predictive methodology to identify fuel characteristics and process conditions that
produce tenacious ashes.  The predictive capabilities will be organized into a user-friendly
computer model.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     This work is ongoing and the project is expected to be completed in March 1997.  Plans are to
examine 1) ashes from large-scale operating filters, 2) ash originally from a large-scale
pressurized fluidized-bed combustor (PFBC) or gasifier that has been reentrained in a
laboratory-scale rig
and deposited on a filter in a simulated environment, and 3) newly generated ashes from
small pilot- or bench-scale facilities where parametric evaluations will be employed.  The
problem will be defined through full-scale sampling.  Then parametric testing will be done at the
laboratory
and bench scale to determine the factors leading to the problem.  Finally, the data will
be used to develop a user-friendly computer model to help predict the occurrence of the problem,
choose appropriate fuels or operating conditions, or design the system to reduce the blinding and
bridging problems.  Solutions predicted by the model will be tested on the bench scale with
single-filter elements.<p>


     To identify and evaluate the mechanisms of ash interaction that may be occurring, laboratory-
and bench-scale test facilities and advanced analytical scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
equipment will be used to generate the ash and to determine the quantities and composition
distributions of inorganic phases in the coal, fly ashes, deposits, and system materials.  An
advanced SEM method, fine-particle technique (FPT), to determine particle-size and composition
distributions of submicron ash is being developed as a part of this project.  In parallel studies,
physical properties of the cakes will be measured in an attempt to relate both physical and
chemical phenomena to the ability to clean a hot-gas filter.  The physical properties data will be
enhanced by that provided by EPRI and DOE contractors in public reports.<p>



     Because interactions in the ash involve inorganic species whose basic chemistries are not well
understood, fundamental studies may also be required to fill these gaps.  Therefore, the analyses
of the ash will include developing a profile of the physical and chemical species as a function of
the depth of the deposit.  To achieve this goal, a sampling protocol will be developed to collect,
intact, a cake deposit from an operating filter, whether it be in the laboratory or in the field.  Both
problematic and easy-to-clean filter cakes will be reproduced in the laboratory to better
understand their formation mechanisms.  This will be done using both pressurized fluidized-bed
combustor and gasifier test facilities to generate new ashes.<p>



     Five tasks will be performed:  Task 1 - Field Sampling, Task 2 - Laboratory-Scale Testing, Task
3 - Bench-Scale Testing, Task 4 - Computer Modeling, and Task 5 - Reporting.  The following
parameters will be considered for investigation at each scale:  ash size and composition
distributions, coal/sorbent (sulfur, ash composition, chlorine), gaseous species
(H<sub>2</sub>S, HCl, SO<sub>2</sub>, alkali), additives, dust loading, face velocity,
temperature, pressure, time, operating change in pressure, oxidizing/reducing environments, and
fluid dynamics of dust and gas.<p>


     These primary variables affect the cleanability of the dust cake.  A subobjective will be to
determine the importance of these variables and their relationship to each other.  Test plans will
be developed by the EERC for each of these testing tasks, detailing the number and range of
parameters to be evaluated.  These test plans will be distributed to the sponsoring organizations
for approval at the semiannual meetings prior to commencing work.<p>



     To date, samples of coal, sorbent, and ashes from several test series at the American Electric
Power (AEP) Tidd Station PFBC, in Brilliant, Ohio, have been analyzed for chemical and
physical properties.  Results of the analyses indicate that with regard to ash particle size and
composition, ashes that have larger particle-size distributions and have experienced less sulfation
produce less problematic ash.  Therefore, controlling the particle size of ash entering a filter
vessel may result in less sticking and sintering of the ash.  Surface analyses of the filter ashes are
also being conducted to determine the effects of surface chemistry on ash sintering behavior. 
Analysis of archive samples from the Grimethorpe PFBC are also under way.<p>

<title>Engineering Performance of Advanced
Structural Materials</title>

<center>
<h2>Engineering Performance of Advanced Structural Materials </h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Background</h3></font> <p>

     The structures inside advanced coal-fired energy systems will be exposed to much higher
temperatures and much more corrosive environments than in today's steam cycle systems.  These
conditions require the use of advanced structural materials such as ceramics for construction of
subsystems.  Advanced ceramics such as silicon carbide (SiC) are resistant to corrosion and are
very strong at much higher temperatures than today's metals.  For example, SiC sublimes
without melting at temperatures over 2000&#176;C.  This makes SiC difficult to use in the
fabrication of large structures, because pieces made from SiC cannot be joined together in the same
way that metals can be welded.  Therefore, the size of the monolithic ceramic structures that can be
manufactured is limited by the size of the sintering furnaces (approximately 10 ft for sintered alpha
silicon carbide).  In order to make larger objects such as directly fired turbine parts or large heat
exchangers, many small ceramic pieces must be fused or joined.  In addition, field repair of the
objects will require the use of field joining techniques.  At present, no joining techniques for
high-temperature structural ceramics are routinely available.<p>

     The primary work of this project is to develop data and techniques that will promote the use of
advanced structural materials in the construction of advanced energy systems.  Currently, the
focus is to develop new methods of joining silicon-based nonoxide ceramics in field applications. 
The work will include testing the corrosion resistance of the joints and joined materials in
high-temperature
coal utilization environments. The corrosion behavior of the materials and joints will
be incorporated in the Fuel Quality Advisor computer model being developed under another
project.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font>


     The overall objective of this work is to develop a patentable technique for joining large,
silicon-based
advanced ceramics in the field.  The key to a successful technique will be the use of
reactive joining compounds to ease the creation of the joint.  Special efforts will be made to
transfer the developed technologies to the materials industry via licensing agreements through
the EERC Foundation.<p>

     Test bars of sintered silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon nitride
(Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) will be bonded together using joining agents that will fuse
when heated.  The joining materials will be formulated to sinter at temperatures below
1500&#176;C, forming compounds that will bond the ceramics and have a similar coefficient of
thermal expansion.  The joining materials will be prepared by forming high-viscosity slips of
mixtures of near-micron-sized powders or by using sol-gel techniques.  They will then be fashioned
into a ceramic tape and cut in a green state to fit the joint.  SiC joints will be heated by attaching
electrodes to the bars on either side of the joint and passing current between them to heat the joint
(Joule heating).  Both high- and low-frequency AC will be used.  The
Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> bars and joints will be heated in a muffle furnace.  The
joints will be tested for strength at 1400&#176;C using a fully articulated, high-temperature
four-point flexure tester in an Instron 8562 universal multitester and compared with the strength of
the bulk material.  Joining conditions will then be optimized to produce the strongest joint by varying
the composition of the joining agent and the reaction time, temperature, and atmosphere.<p>


     There will be two main efforts this year.  The first is joining of silicon carbide using Joule
heating with reaction- sintered joining compounds and resistive heating.  The most successful
joints will be chemically and physically tested.  The reaction products in the joining compound
and between the compound and the SiC will be determined by x-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning Auger electron analysis of joints fractured in ultrahigh
vacuum.  Strength will be determined in four-point flexure at 1400&#176;C. 
Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> will be joined with SiAlON compounds by heating in a
furnace. <p>

     The relative resistance of the ceramics and their joints to coal slag attack will be determined by
heating joined bars in slag baths at 1400&#176;C for up to 100 hours.  The corrosion data will be
supplied to the investigators developing the Fuel Quality Advisor computer model being
constructed under another project.<p>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Results </h3></font> 
     The electrical resistance of silicon carbide is inversely related to temperature so that as it is
heated, its resistance drops.  When resistive heating is used, the drop in resistance causes a
greater electricity flow for a given voltage.  Therefore, if a simple voltage controller is used to
vary the power to the bars to be joined, the temperature is prone to runaway, i.e., uncontrolled
heating at rates of over 300&#176;C/min.  Therefore, we have developed an experimental power
supply to successfully control the temperature of silicon carbide after SiC specimens have been
preheated to a temperature of about 300&#176;C.  Methods of controlling temperature without
preheating are being investigated.<p>



     Pellets of joining material composed of silicon carbide, silicon powder, and graphite powder
were prepared for use as a joining material.  They contain only 2.1 wt% binder and have an
average porosity of 17%, which is considered very low.  SEM analyses showed good particle
distribution but possible problems due to a high percentage of excessively large silicon and
graphite particles.

     To increase national self-sufficiency for the near future, energy systems will be required to fire
low-grade fuels efficiently.  The steam cycle employed at present uses a maximum steam
temperature of 550&#176;C and has an energy conversion efficiency of 35%.  To boost efficiency,
higher working fluid temperatures are required. Subsystems must operate at much higher
temperatures and in much more corrosive environments.  Problems of concern are corrosion and
fatigue of high-temperature heat exchangers and hot-gas cleanup filters.  To prevent subsystem
failure, advanced materials (ceramics) must be used for construction. <p>



<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives</h3></font> <p>



     The EERC is working with researchers funded through the Advanced Research and Technology
Development Materials Program administered at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to
design tests of ceramic materials that simulate the corrosive conditions occurring in advanced
coal-fueled energy systems.  Combustion and gasification systems will be studied, primarily
those being developed in U.S. Department of Energy programs.  Two types of corrosion
conditions are being investigated:  those in hot-gas cleanup systems where alkali vapor may
contribute to corrosion and those in high-temperature heat exchangers where the main corrodent
is coal ash slag.<p>



<font color="#990066"><h3>Results</h3></font> 

     Ash produced at the American Electric Power Tidd Station pressurized fluidized bed was chosen
for hot-gas filter corrosion testing.  Subbituminous coals were chosen for heat-exchanger
corrosion testing:  an Illinois No. 6 coal slag, to represent the eastern U.S. bituminous coals, and
a Powder River Basin coal slag, to represent the western U.S. coals.  To assure that the slags
were at thermodynamic equilibrium for testing, they were  collected from cyclone-fired utility
boilers.<p>



     A 55-gal drum of hot-gas filter ash was received from the Tidd Station and analyzed by x-ray
fluorescence and x-ray diffraction.  Suggested conditions for corrosion testing with this ash are
900&#176;C (although many other researchers do not go above 850&#176;C) in 15%
CO<sub>2</sub>,
15% H<sub>2</sub>O, 3% O<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% SO<sub>2</sub>, and 10 ppm of
NaCl, with a balance of N<sub>2</sub>.  Samples were distributed to Penn State University,
West Virginia University, and 3M Company.<p>


     A 55-gal drum of slag was received from each of three power plants.  The Northern States Power
Company provided slag from its Riverside plant produced while burning a coal from the Powder
River Coal Company Rochelle mine, Wyoming.  A drum of Illinois No. 6 slag was provided by
the Central Illinois Public Service Coffeen plant.  Analyses showed abnormally high calcium
concentrations caused by limestone additions to the coal to reduce slag viscosity.  Therefore,
another drum of Illinois No. 6 slag was requested from the Illinois Power Company Baldwin
plant.  Viscosity versus temperature and composition determinations were performed on each of
the three slags, and samples were distributed to researchers at Penn State University, Argonne
National Laboratory, and ORNL.  Suggested initial conditions for slag testing are 1090&#176;,
1260&#176;, and 1430&#176;C in air, although the viscosity tests show that water vapor may
significantly affect slag viscosity and so, perhaps, should be included at a level of about 15%.  This
effect is still being investigated.  The slag layer thickness should be approximately 5 mm.

<font color="#990066"><h3>Background</h3></font>

     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center
(EERC) of the University of North Dakota (UND) emphasizes research, development,
demonstration, and commercialization of innovative environmental cleanup technologies
through partnerships between government, industry, and the EERC in the areas of applied
science and engineering.  CATM was established by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and is focused on minimizing the effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the
environment.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing
189 substances, including air toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM is working
with industry and government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a
scientific basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate and impacts
of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  CATM-related programs are
focused on the development of methods to minimize the release of air toxic metals via practical
prevention and control methods based on scientific understanding and principles.  To facilitate
research efforts and dissemination of information, CATM is organized into five integrated
program areas:  Program Area 1 - Air Toxic Metals Transformation Mechanisms, Program
Area 2 - Analytical Methods Development, Program Area 3 - Control Technologies, Program
Area 4 - Modeling and Database, and Program Area 5 - Technology Commercialization and
Education. <p>

     The form and quantity of trace elements emitted from a fuel energy conversion system are a
function of the trace metal concentrations, forms, and associations in the fuel, the conversion
process, and operating conditions.  System conditions such as oxygen fugacity, gas-phase
composition, pressure, and temperature can be controlled in bench-, intermediate-, and pilot-scale
combustion
and gasification systems.  Thus fuels can be tested using the same conditions
to deduce the effects of fuel properties on trace metal transformations.  Alternatively, the same
fuel can be tested using various conversion processes and operating conditions to examine the
effects of parameters independent of the fuel.<p>
     Program Area 1 will provide the information essential for developing pollution prevention and
control strategies.  As a result of gaining knowledge about trace metal transformation
mechanisms, additional goals can be accomplished, such as 1) development of air toxic metal
pollution prevention methodologies, 2) development of models that predict trace element
emissions, and 3) development of effective strategies to control air toxic metal emissions.<p>
<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives</h3></font>

     The primary objective of Program Area 1 is to decipher the fundamental trace metal
transformation mechanisms that occur during coal and waste conversion processes.  Specific
secondary objectives are as follows:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Determine trace metal transformation mechanisms by conducting
combustion and partial gasification experiments in bench- and pilot-scale systems.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Construct an intermediate-scale combustion and gasification
system that is designed specifically for trace metal transformation studies and perform combustion
tests on this unit using coal, oil, and other non-fossil fuel oil fuels to elucidate trace element
transformations.  Rigorous testing will be done initially to determine some of the important factors in
mercury speciation during coal combustion.<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Validate theories developed and proposed through the bench- and 
pilot-scale testing at the full scale.<br>
</ul>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Results</h3></font>

     Transformations of trace metals were conducted using bench-scale drop-tube furnace (DTF)
equipment for both conventional combustion and gasification conditions.  Coal conversion
tests were performed in the pressurized DTF (PDTF) for Illinois No. 6 coal using furnace
conditions that ranged from 1000&#176; to 1500&#176;C, 50 to 150 psi, and 1.0 to 2.0
oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio.  For comparison, the Illinois No. 6 coal was also tested in the PDTF
under highly oxidizing conditions. <p>

     The PDTF is a laboratory-scale entrained-flow tube furnace designed for the investigation of
pressurized combustion and gasification of coal.  Sampling was performed using a modified
version of EPA (Draft) Method 29.  The sampling method consisted of  using a multicyclone 
and final filter assembly, which was kept at the system pressure but under a lower temperature
of 150&#176;C.  Trace metal concentrations were measured for As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, Se, and Hg by
collecting the entrained ash at the bottom of the PDTF using a multicyclone and impinger
sampling train and analyzing the particulate and liquids using atomic absorption spectroscopy
methods.  Average closure for Hg over twenty tests was 90% to 100%.  Noticeable impacts of
gas composition, expressed as O/C ratio, were observed on the partitioning and speciation of
Hg.  At lower O/C ratios or under more reducing conditions as would be encountered in a
gasification system, Hg appears to be driven to more volatile reduced forms.  Hg
concentrations in the submicron particulate or vapor-phase fraction of a sampling train are
greater at lower O/C ratios.  Speciation of Hg can be discerned indirectly by noting the
distribution of Hg concentrations in the impinger solutions used to capture vapor-phase Hg. 
The impinger system consists of hydrogen peroxide in the first impinger, which captures either
oxidized forms of Hg, such as Hg<sub>2</sub>O, or HgCl<sub>2</sub> and potassium
permanganate in the second
impinger, which captures reduced forms of Hg, such as elemental Hg.  Testing in the DTF
showed consistently more reduced forms of Hg being produced for lower O/C ratios.  The
greater amount of reduced Hg species would be more prevalent in the finer particulate or
vapor-phase fractions of the sampling train.<p>

     The transformation of As, Pb, Ni, Hg, and Se during combustion of Beulah lignite and the effects
of precombustion addition of kaolin, lime, and zeolite on the partitioning behavior of these same
metals were studied in the bench-scale atmospheric DTF (ADTF).  The ADTF is very similar in
construction and capabilities to the PDTF, except that for these tests, metal surfaces in the
furnace quench zone and multicyclone stages and filter assembly were Teflon-coated to
minimize sample contamination or reaction. The parent Beulah coal and coal-additive blends
were tested in the ADTF using conditions typical of pulverized coal-fired boilers.  Samples of
size-fractionated ash were collected using a multicyclone.  Trace elements present in the flue
gases were collected using EPA (Draft) Method 29.  As and Ni were almost completely
partitioned into the ash in all the ADTF tests.  In contrast, Hg was partitioned strongly into the
vapor phase.  Pb was partitioned into both the ash and vapor phase in the Beulah parent coal and
in the kaolin- and zeolite-coal blends.  Results for Pb in the lime-coal blend were ambiguous
because of poor mass balance closure.  Poor closure in mass balance results for Se indicated a
measurement problem, assuming that Se was not deposited on surfaces within the ADTF during
testing.  An investigation of Se sampling and measurement methods is required to avoid this
problem in future tests.  Ni was uniformly distributed among the different particle-size fractions,
suggesting that it did not vaporize and subsequently condense.  The vaporization-heterogeneous
condensation process would have resulted in the enrichment of Ni in the smallest size fraction
because of greater particle surface area per unit volume.  The smallest ash particle-size fraction
was significantly enriched in Pb, indicating control by a vaporization-condensation mechanism.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Combustion and Gasification System Development and
Testing</h3></font> 
     The construction of a conversion and environmental process simulator (CEPS) is near
completion.  The furnace stainless steel module shells have been assembled and installed into
the support structure.  Currently, refractory and the inner ceramic reaction tube are being cut
and fitted into the module shells.  Molds have been fabricated for molding castable refractory
sections of the furnace.  When completed, CEPS will enable the burning of liquid and/or
pulverized fuels at 40,000 Btu/hr.  The samples produced will be used to elucidate
transformation mechanisms and test various pollution control technologies.  An additional
system planned for development is a bed-burning reactor such as a stoker or a rotary kiln for
emulating waste-to-energy systems.<p>

<h2> Background </h2>
<p>
     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center
(EERC) of the University of North Dakota (UND) emphasizes research, development,
demonstration, and commercialization of innovative environmental cleanup technologies
through partnerships between government, industry, and the EERC in the areas of  applied
science and engineering.  CATM was established by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and is focused on minimizing the effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the
environment.  The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 require regulatory actions
addressing 189 substances, including air toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM
is working with industry and government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals
to provide a scientific basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate
and impacts of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  CATM-related
programs are focused on the development of methods to minimize the release of air toxic

Mechanisms, Program Area 2 - Analytical Methods Development, Program Area 3 - Control
Technologies, Program Area 4 - Modeling and Database, and Program Area 5 - Technology
Commercialization and Education.<p>
<p>
     Acid rain and the passage of legislation to reduce emissions of acid rain precursors continue to
be prominent issues in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan.  Emissions of fine
particles are of concern because these particles can be deposited in the lower respiratory
system through normal breathing.  The potential problem is further compounded because
hazardous trace elements, such as selenium and arsenic, are known to be concentrated on such
fine particles.  The CAAA address the issue of emissions of acid rain precursors, require the
investigation of air toxic emissions, and provide for possible expansion of visibility protection
measures.  Therefore, a current need exists to develop superior but economical methods to
control emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and air toxic trace elements.  The
best method to minimize
emissions is to improve collection of trace metal species via sorbent injection, minimize
reentrainment of fine particulates, or install high-efficiency fine-particle control devices.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     Program Area 3 is focused on pursuing and identifying opportunities for minimizing/controlling
trace element emissions in combustion and gasification systems, including prevention/minimization
of toxic element formation (e.g., fuel-to-energy conversion efficiency improvements, recycling);
capture by sorbents using precombustion, combustion, and postcombustion injection techniques in
conjunction with high-efficiency fine-particle control; and implementation of innovative
technologies.  The work in this area is closely tied to efforts in Program Area 1.  Specific goals
are as follows:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">As a means of control, encourage industry to implement
pollution
preventive practices and techniques<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">Identify and investigate ways to improve existing emission
reduction technologies relative to toxic metals<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">Develop new technologies that will minimize or revent toxic
metal emissions<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">Encourage waste reduction by developing innovative management
and utilization strategies for solid residue<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">Develop technologies that are environmentally safe<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">Develop technologies and techniques that are cost-effective to
implement<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">Develop partnerships with industry to market new or improved
reduction technologies<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Control of air toxic metals emissions focused on the following technologies.<p>
<p>
<h3>Sorbent Injection</h3>
<p>
     A matrix of eight tests was executed to evaluate a number of commercially available sorbents
for their ability to remove elemental mercury and/or mercuric chloride from simulated flue gas
streams (utilities or incinerators).  Five different sorbents were evaluated:  1) American Norit
DARCO FGD, a steam-activated lignite carbon; 2) American Norit DARCO KB, a
chemical-activated hardwood;
3) American Norit PC 100, a chemical-activated bituminous coal; 4)
Barneby &amp; Sutcliffe Corporation CB, an iodized steam-activated coconut shell; and 5) Alcoa
Mersorb LH, a sulfur-impregnated steam-activated carbon.  An effectiveness ranking based on
total mercury adsorbed or removed was established.<p>
<p>
     Based on the limited testing performed, the flue gas components, O<sub>2</sub> and
SO<sub>2</sub>, each appeared to affect the performance of the activated carbons toward
elemental mercury removal.  Overall, both species tended to improve the mercury removal efficacy
for the DARCO KB, DARCO FGD and, most notably, Mersorb LH.  An exception was with the
DARCO PC 100 in which the presence of SO<SUB>2</SUB> significantly diminished the
removal efficiency.<p> 
<p>
     An attempt was made to assign a preliminary ranking to the activated carbons for the
adsorption of elemental mercury under the conditions of 0 to 4 vol% O<sub>2</sub>, 0 to 500
ppm SO<sub>2</sub>, and 100 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> Hg<sup>0</sup>.  The
ranking was based on the area under the mercury removal efficiency curve where a larger area
indicates higher adsorption capacity.  The Barneby &amp; Sutcliffe CB iodated activated carbon
appeared to be the consistently superior sorbent, while the American Norit Darco KB appeared to be
consistently the least effective.  However, because of the apparent effect of variables (notably
O<sub>2</sub> and SO<SUB>2</SUB>) on elemental mercury removal efficiency,
additional testing is needed
to elucidate the range of conditions in which the Alcoa Mersorb LH, Darco FGD, and Darco PC 100
may each have a decided advantage.<p>
<p>
<h3>Reentrainment of Fine Particulates</h3>
<p>
     Testing was conducted to determine the size distribution of ash reentrained from the
electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and baghouses during cleaning cycles since this may be a major
source of fine-particle emissions.  The ESP reentrainment tests were performed with the ESP
on the particulate test combustor (PTC) at the EERC.  The baghouse reentrainment tests were
performed with the three-bag pulse-jet baghouse on the PTC.  For the ESP, the concentration
of submicron particles in the entrained ash was lower than for the pulse-jet baghouse.  This
appears to have been caused by the increased cleaning energy of the pulse-jet system. 
However, the overall concentrations of particles downstream of the pulse-jet bags were lower
than the concentrations for the ESP.  As expected, pulsing pressure and operating pressure
appeared to have a noticeable effect on redispersion of particles within the baghouse.  As a
side note, the ashes were expected to redisperse into different distributions because they should
each have somewhat different cohesive properties.  However, there was little difference
between the injected and the redispersed ashes, which may be a limitation (or characteristic) of
the ash injection system.<p>
<p>
<h3>High-Efficiency Fine Particulate Collection</h3>
<p>

     To test various types of filter material, a bench-scale system was set up.  For the tests conducted,
the observed emission level achieved by the GORE-TEX&reg; felt with the GORE-TEX&reg;
membrane is over four orders of magnitude lower than for the woven fiberglass and two orders of
magnitude lower than for the Ryton felt. Review of the data indicated that several fabrics utilizing an
expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane appear to be capable of obtaining results similar to those
for the GORE-TEX&reg; product.<p>  
<p>
<h3>Management of Solid Residues</h3>
<p>
     The management, whether utilization or disposal options are considered, of solid residues is an
important issue that must be addressed.  The mobility and stability of trace metals were examined
for several coal-producing combustion by-products.  Several techniques were employed, some
with relative success, some requiring modification.  Work from several related projects was
combined to provide insight into the importance of trace elements in coal combustion by-products
(CCBs) and their disposal and utilization.  Additionally, work continued in the area of methods
development and standardization to provide more predictive capabilities for evaluating trace
element mobility when CCBs are placed in the environment.  Methods development continued to
identify specific properties of CCBs that may be used to better characterize and classify these
unique materials.

<h2> Coal Mineral Matter and Stack Emission Opacity Relationship </h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Background</h3></font>
     A utility plant equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was exceeding the opacity
compliance limit of 20% when burning pulverized coal from a particular seam of its supply mine. 
In a preliminary investigation, the utility conducted test burns of samples from various coal
seams.  Measured opacity levels ranged from 9.5% to 24%.  The scattering of light by fine ash
particles was identified as the most likely cause of the opacity problem.<p>

     The concentration of fine ash particles emitted from a utility's stack is related primarily to coal
mineral matter characteristics.  The test burn coal samples were analyzed using energy dispersive
x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and SEM
digital image analysis.  The test burn and coal analysis results were used to examine the
relationship between coal mineral matter characteristics and opacity.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objective</h3></font>
     The objective of this investigation was to identify possible coal mineral matter sources of the fine
ash particles responsible for stack emission opacity.<p>



<font color="#990066"><h3>Results</h3></font> 
     ESPs require a specific range of ash resistivity, generally
10<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>10</sup> ohm-cm, to operate properly.  A change in this
parameter
can cause ESP collection efficiency to decline, especially for fine ash particles, which are the most
effective in scattering light.  The resistivity for each of the coal ashes was estimated using predictive
equations.  The predicted resistivities of the high-opacity coal ashes were greater by about
10<sup>0.5</sup> ohm-cm for a given temperature.  This relatively small change in ash
resistivity may have adversely affected ESP performance and contributed to the opacity problem. 
Variations in ash chemical compositions, most notably Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
content, accounted for the differences in calculated ash resistivities.<p>
   SEM-image analysis results indicated that the high-opacity coal samples contained a greater
proportion of kaolinite grains that were excluded from macerals.  Excluded kaolinite grains are
less likely to coalesce during combustion and can fragment to produce fine ash.  The relationship
between kaolinite fragmentation and opacity was originally proposed by the project sponsor. 
The results from this work, however, indicate that it is the amount of excluded kaolinite available
to fragment that is most important to consider as a source of fine ash.<p>
     The high-opacity coals were also found to be enriched in fine-grained (10 &#181;m or less)
mixed-clay minerals.  The Na, Mg, and Ca associated with these mixed-clay minerals may have
vaporized during combustion and subsequently condensed to form fine ash particles.  The
vaporization of fine-grained minerals is favored because they heat more rapidly, attain higher
temperatures, and have a shorter diffusion path to the particle surface.<p>
     The results of this investigation indicate that a combination of coal mineral matter characteristics
are responsible for enhancing fine ash production and, therefore, opacity.  A comparison of fine
ash and coal mineral compositions is required to verify the correlations noted in this
investigation.

<title>Review and Assessment of Results from
the Comprehensive Characterization of

<h2>Review and Assessment of Results from the Comprehensive Characterization of Air Toxic
Emissions from
Coal-Fired Power Plants </h2></center>
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Background</h2></font> <p>


     Significant concern exists over the impact of increasing energy consumption on ambient air
quality.  Acid rain and the passage of legislation to reduce emissions of acid rain precursors
continue to be prominent issues in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan.  Emissions
of fine particles are of concern because these particles can be deposited in the lower
respiratory system through normal breathing.  The potential problem is further compounded
because hazardous trace elements such as selenium and arsenic are known to be concentrated
on such fine particles.  Recent studies indicate that current levels of fine particles in the
atmosphere are causing up to 60,000 deaths per year and that the current ambient air quality
standard for PM10 may not adequately protect public health.  In addition to potentially causing
adverse health effects, fine particles, including secondary sulfates, are the primary cause of
visibility impairment in the atmosphere.  The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990
address the issues of emissions of acid rain precursors, require investigation of air toxic
emissions, and provide for possible expansion of visibility protection measures.  Therefore, a
current need exists to develop superior but economical methods to control emissions of
SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, fine particles, and air toxics.<p>
    To help meet the requirements of the CAAA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
sponsored a project entitled "Comprehensive Characterization of Air Toxic Emissions from
Coal-Fired Power Plants." Results from the investigation are intended to provide the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with data to help decide whether regulation of air
toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants is necessary.  Draft reports which detail air toxic
emissions from eight power plants were completed, and the EERC served as an independent
reviewer of these reports.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives </h3></font>
     The objective of this project is to provide an independent review of reports produced from the
DOE Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center air toxic emissions investigation, evaluate the
scientific validity of the conclusions, identify significant correlations between emissions and
fuel or process parameters, compare the data with available results from Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI) studies, and make recommendations for possible future studies.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Results </h3></font>
     Task 1 of this project consisted of the review of nine Phase I draft contractor field reports by
the EERC review team.  Comments were compiled for each report to serve as a guide for the
individual contractors to prepare their final reports.  Conference calls were held between the
EERC, DOE, and the respective contractors for each of these reports to discuss comments and
form a consensus as to required changes for the final contractor reports.  Task 1 activities
were completed in June 1994.<p>
    Task 2 required preparation of a report to DOE summarizing recommendations for improving
the quality of data to be collected during Phase II field tests.  The recommendations report was
based on review of the Phase I contractor draft reports and past EERC experience.  Specific
recommendations addressed 1) pre-field-sampling laboratory preparation and qualification, 2) a
data reporting and flagging system, 3) organic sampling and analysis, 4) inorganic sampling
and analysis, 5) radionuclides, 6) particulate and solid-vapor sampling and analysis, and 7) a
recommended format for reporting hazardous air pollutant data.  The report also summarized
recommendations made by individual contractors that were not site- or process-specific and
were considered to be of high priority by the EERC review team.  This report, entitled "Task
2 - Recommendations for Phase II Field Test," was completed in April 1995.<p>
     Task 3, currently ongoing, is focused on the preparation of a report summarizing the data
collected by the contractors at the eight Phase I field sites.  The report will also contain a
concise overview of the important findings from the Phase I effort.  A draft of the Phase I
summary report is scheduled to be completed by the end of May 1995, at which time it will be
submitted to DOE for review.<p>

     Task 4, currently ongoing, involves a comparison of the trace element emissions data from the
DOE Phase I data set with trace element emissions data that are available from EPRI-sponsored field
tests.  An
evaluation of correlations between emission factors and the coal,
process, and operating conditions will be completed, along with development of general
conclusions for the combined data set.  Completion of a draft report summarizing the results of
the Task 4 effort is scheduled for late May 1995, at which time the draft report will be
submitted to DOE for review.<p>

     In Task 5, currently ongoing, relevant DOE and EPRI data will be incorporated into the
database on air toxic metals that is part of the Center for Air Toxic Metals, which EPA
established at the EERC.  Upon completion, the database will supply well-organized
information on toxic metals to DOE, EPA, EPRI, and the general public.  Completion of the
database is scheduled for July 1995.

<h2>Enhanced Air Toxics Control </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Background </h3></font>
     The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) address the issue of air toxic emissions by
requiring their investigation from coal combustion systems.  Fabric filters and electrostatic
precipitators (ESPs) are already capable of providing a sufficiently high level of particulate
control to meet the 0.03 lb/MMBtu total mass particulate emission standard.  However, fine
particulate removal efficiency deteriorates significantly in ESPs and somewhat in baghouses. 
Emissions of fine particles are of concern because these particles can be deposited in the lower
respiratory system through normal breathing.  The potential problem is further compounded
because hazardous trace elements such as selenium and arsenic are known to be concentrated
on such fine particles.  Control device removal efficiency is lowest for respirable particles, so
that a situation exists where the potentially most hazardous particles from coal combustion are
collected with the lowest removal efficiency.  Since most of the toxic metals present in coal
will be in particulate form, a high level of fine-particle control appears to be the best approach
to achieving a high level of air toxic control.  However, over 50% of mercury and a portion of
selenium emissions are in vapor form and are not typically collected in particulate control
devices.  If these vapor-phase metals could be retained in a particulate control device by the
use of a conditioning agent or sorbent, an effective method of controlling all metal air toxic
emissions would be available at a minimum impact on existing boiler systems.<p>

     The ability to remove mercury from power plant flue gas may become important because of
the CAAA requirement that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assess the
health risks associated with these emissions.  One approach for mercury removal, which may
be relatively simple to retrofit, is the injection of sorbents, such as activated carbon, upstream
of existing particulate control devices.  Activated carbon has been reported to capture mercury
when injected into flue gas upstream of a spray dryer baghouse system applied to waste
incinerators or coal-fired boilers.  However, the mercury capture ability of activated carbon
injected upstream of an ESP or baghouse operated at temperatures between 200&#176; and
400&#176;F is not well known.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives</h3></font>
     The overall objective of the proposed work is to evaluate the potential to remove trace metal
air toxic emissions from coal combustion in conventional particulate control devices.  A
specific goal of the work  is to determine the sorbent type, sorbent concentration, and process
conditions that result in effective mercury control.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Results </h3></font>

     The level of mercury in raw coal is very small, typically only 0.05 to 0.1 ppm, which results
in a trace mercury concentration at the stack of approximately 10 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> or
about 1 ppb.  Special sampling and analysis techniques are required to quantify these low-level
mercury concentrations under various test conditions.  However, the EERC has achieved excellent
agreement when comparing the actual measured mercury concentrations at the inlet to the baghouse
with expected concentrations based on the mercury in the coal.<p> 

<p>

     Simultaneous inlet and outlet mercury sampling was conducted according to EPA (Draft)
Method 29, also known as a multimetal sampling train method.  Method 29 does not claim to
speciate between oxidized and elemental mercury, but bench- and pilot-scale results indicate
that oxidized mercury will be trapped in the peroxide impingers and elemental mercury in the
permanganate impingers.  However, further research is being conducted at the EERC to
evaluate the mercury speciation ability of Method 29.  <p>
     Test variables included coal type, sorbent type, sorbent addition rate, collection media, and
temperature. The three coals tested to date include Powder River Basin subbituminous coals
from the Absaloka mine, a similar coal from the Belle Ayr mine (Comanche), and a
bituminous coal from the Pittsburgh No. 8 seam, Blacksville mine.  Since the level of mercury
in the coals ranged from 59 to 85 ppb and the coal feed rate to the combustor is about 60
lb/hr, the required sorbent add rate is only about 2-20 g/hr to achieve sorbent-to-mercury
ratios of 1000-10,000.  For all sorbent tests, the additive was injected into the flue gas duct
just upstream of the particulate collector, which was held at temperatures ranging from  200&#176;
to 400&#176;F.  Fabric type included Ryton and GORE-TEX&reg; membrane on GORE-TEX&reg;
Felt. The two primary carbon-based sorbents used in this investigation included a lignite-based
activated carbon, commercially available from American Norit Co., Inc., and an activated carbon
impregnated with an iodine compound obtained from Barnebey &amp; Sutcliffe Corp.  In addition to
the pilot-scale combustion tests, separate sorbent screening tests were completed with oxidized and
elemental forms of mercury using simulated flue gas.<p> 
    Preliminary conclusions are as follows:<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Inlet mercury speciation for the three coals was significantly
different and was highly dependent on the Method 29 filter temperature.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Iodine-impregnated activated carbon provided effective mercury
control at 300&#176; and 400&#176;F  with one subbituminous coal but was ineffective for a second
subbituminous coal.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Iodine-impregnated activated carbon was highly effective at
reducing the outlet elemental mercury concentration for all three coals; however, in some cases, the
elemental mercury is apparently converted to oxidized mercury and is not captured.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Lignite-based activated carbon provided some mercury control at
lower temperatures for all three coals but appeared to work best for the Comanche coal.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Mercury may interact with the Ryton fabric under some
conditions to affect mercury speciation and control effectiveness.<br>

<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Bench-scale screening tests may not be good indicators of
sorbent
effectiveness unless flue gas conditions are adequately simulated.<br>
</ul>
<p>

     Future work planned for this project includes optimizing process conditions to achieve the
most economical control of mercury in an ESP or baghouse.<p>

<title>Mitigation of Air Toxics from Lignite
Generation Facilities</title>

<h2>Mitigation of Air Toxics from Lignite Generation Facilities</h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Concerns over emissions of trace metals, considered air toxics, from coal-fired power plants
are increasing.  The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 list 189 substances as
potentially hazardous air pollutants.  Further, the CAAA established a schedule under which
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to establish maaximum
achievable control technology (MACT) standards for existing major sources of hazardous
pollutants.  A major source is any source which emits (or has the potential to emit) more than
10 tons per year of any one listed pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of
listed pollutants.  Coal combustion is thought to be an important source for eleven metals on
the list of 189 substances (antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead,
manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium).<p>

<p>

     Emission reduction strategies for trace elements in both conventional and advanced combustion
systems face the concurrent problems of 1) collection and removal of trace concentrations on a
large scale, 2) the costs associated with the removal, and 3) eventual disposal of the trace
species once collected.  Current control strategies are focusing on the use of sorbents as the
removal method.  The use of sorbents is an existing technology with many applications, and
handling, injection, and recovery methods are already available.  The primary concern is the
selection of the best, most cost-effective sorbent or sorbents for a specific purpose.  The
sorbents to be examined are either readily available materials where a large volume of low-cost,
disposable
material with modest sorption capacity is used or new, innovative materials
that require a small volume of more expensive material with high sorption capacity from which
the trace metals are recovered and the sorbent material reused.  In either case, cost injection
rate and effectiveness are critical issues that must be addressed.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective of this project is to determine the usefulness of sorbents in controlling
the emission of trace elements during the combustion of lignite coals.  The sorbents include
precombustion, combustion, and postcombustion injection materials, along with possible
gas-conditioning
agents.  The specific objectives of the project are as follows:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To determine the concentrations of eleven trace elements from
six
representative North Dakota lignite coals and one Powder River Basin (PRB) coal<br>
<p>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  To determine the anticipated emissions from generation facilities
by simulating the combustion process using bench- and pilot-scale test equipment<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To investigate the current state-of-the-art sorbents as trace

</ul><p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The air toxic control technologies that were investigated included precombustion, combustion,
and postcombustion sorbent injection, along with gas-conditioning agents.  In addition,
because the alkali and alkaline earth components (sodium, magnesium, calcium) in these coals
may adsorb many of the trace metals of concern, the ash constituents were also considered as
possible sorbents.  The potential for these technologies to provide mitigation of trace metal
emissions was reviewed, and the most promising techniques tested.<p>

<p>

     The most promising sorbents selected for mitigation of trace metal emissions were identified as
the precombustion sorbents zeolite, kaolinite, and lime and a postcombustion sorbent of
lignite-based activated carbon.  Bench- and pilot-scale testing of the sorbents and conditioning
agents were performed on Beulah, Falkirk, Freedom, and PRB coals to accumulate data on
effectiveness.<p>

<p>

     The three precombustion sorbents selected were tested in a bench-scale, laminar-flow, drop-tube
furnace (DTF) to determine their effectiveness in capturing the trace species.  Both
particulate and gas samples were obtained during the tests to determine their trace element
contents.  After completion of the DTF testing, the lime sorbent was selected for further
testing.  The selected precombustion sorbent (lime), postcombustion sorbent (activated
carbon), and gas-conditioning agent (SO<sub>3</sub>) were each separately tested in a
pilot-scale,
550,000-Btu/hr particulate test combustor (PTC) equipped with a baghouse.  The mitigation
tests were conducted with four of the seven previously analyzed coals.  These were the
Beulah, Falkirk, Freedom, and PRB coals.  Particulate and gas samples were collected and
analyzed using currently accepted EPA methods.<p>

<p>

     Results from the PTC tests show that mercury can be effectively controlled (captured) with the
use of activated carbon injected upstream of a baghouse for the conditions and coals tested.  In
some cases, the additional control (capture) of mercury was minimal.  In these cases, the level
of control without the use of any sorbents was quite high, above 80%.  Consequently, for
these tests, the addition of sorbents (lime or activated carbon ) showed little improvement.  In
all tests, the use of lime as a precombustion sorbent for mercury control proved to be
ineffective.  However, capture/collection of arsenic and selenium did improve in some cases. 
In short, based on the coals tested, activated carbon can be used to effectively control mercury
but does not improve collection of other toxic metals.  Lime, as a precombustion sorbent, is
not effective at controlling mercury emissions but showed some capability of improving
collection of other toxic metals (i.e., arsenic, selenium).

<title>Effective Sorbents for Trace Elements</title>

<h2>Effective Sorbents for Trace Elements </h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Trace element emissions arise from coal combustion and gasification systems, waste
incineration, crematoriums, chlorine/alkali plants, and metallurgical operations.  The trace
species mercury, arsenic, and selenium are of concern because of their release as gases or
submicron fume and their potential toxicity to the ecosystem.  Sorbent technology is being
investigated and used to collect trace elements.  Sorbents consist of a large volume of
inexpensive, activated coal or char with modest sorption activity.  Alternatively, regenerable
sorbents with enhanced sorption capacity can be used from which trace metals can be
recovered.<p>

<p>

     Carbon sorbents have been used to trap mercury species with varying success because of
interfering reactions (e.g., with oxygen) and the nature of the sorbent. Insufficient data exist
for optimizing the effectiveness and for understanding the kinetics and mechanism of the
process of capture by carbon sorbents for different mercury species.  <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective is to identify the conditions for effective capture of trace elements by
carbon sorbents and the controlling processes for trace element sorption in combustion and
gasification systems. Specific objectives entail determining the conditions controlling  capture
of mercury species by selected carbons in the presence of various flue gas components, such as
O<sub>2</sub>, CO, and SO<sub>2</sub>, and developing a preliminary understanding of
the kinetics and mechanism of mercury sorption.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     A fixed-bed reactor system with continuous Hg<sup>0</sup> analysis capabilities was
constructed and operated to evaluate commercial carbon sorbents for the removal of elemental
mercury from simulated flue gas containing N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>,
SO<sub>2</sub>, and HCl.  Sorbents included powdered forms of steam-activated lignite,
chemical-activated hardwood, chemical-activated bituminous coal, iodated steam-activated coconut
shell, and sulfur-impregnated steam-activated bituminous coal.  <p>

<p>

     Iodated activated carbon was a consistently superior sorbent regardless of the simulated flue
gas atmosphere, with over 99% mercury removal according to EPA Method 101A.  Chemical
activated hardwood was the least effective.  <p>

<p>

     Data indicated that increasing the O<sub>2</sub> concentration from 0 to 4 vol% reduced
the effectiveness of the steam-activated lignite, chemical-activated hardwood, and sulfur-impregnated
steam-activated bituminous coal.  Increasing the SO<sub>2</sub> concentration from 0 to 500
ppm, however,
appeared to have a more selective effect, increasing the mercury removal by the sulfur-impregnated
carbon
relative to the other carbons.  Increasing the HCl concentration from 0 to
50 ppm had the apparent effect of enhancing the mercury removal efficiency of the
sulfur-impregnated and
chemical-activated bituminous coals to a level comparable to the iodated
carbon.  Mercury removal by the chemical-activated bituminous coal exceeded 97% according
to EPA (Draft) Method 29.  Further, data indicated possible conversion of mercury to chloride
form(s).<p>

<h2> Trace Element Emissions</h2> </center> 
<hr>



<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Trace element emissions pose a potential problem to two emerging coal gasification electric
power generating systems:  integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and integrated
gasification fuel cell (IGFC).  The potential problems associated with trace elements are the
release of elements considered air toxics into the environment and the degradation of fuel cell
efficiency because of contamination with minor elements.  As a result of amendments to the
Clean Air Act, the control of nearly 200 additional air toxics or chemical contaminants is
required.  The trace elements being studied in this project are lead, mercury, nickel,
chromium, arsenic, selenium, and cadmium.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The objectives of this project are to identify and model important physical and chemical
transformation mechanisms of the trace elements during gasification as a function of coal
compositions (trace element abundance and association) and gasification conditions. 
Identification of the reactions and transformations coupled with the ability to accurately model
trace element behavior will provide essential information for the identification of the form of
the inorganic species.  This information will be used to identify the most effective control
technologies.  Emphasis is placed on providing a model that will benefit industry's use of coal
gasification processes.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Progress concentrated in three areas during the first half of the project.  The first area
encompasses the analysis of coals, ashes, and chars for trace and bulk species.  Sample
preparation and analysis techniques have been continually enhanced as the project has
progressed.  Many of the analytical methods developed in this project will be used in support
of better techniques worldwide.<p>

<p>

     The second area has been the production of samples from bench-scale units and the
interpretation of their results.  A pressurized drop-tube furnace and an integrated bench-scale
gasifier are being used to produce samples similar to those of full-scale gasification processes. 
The samples generated are analyzed using advanced analytical methods and their results
summarized in tables and graphs.  The partitioning of the trace elements between the solid,
liquid, and vapor phases has been the major emphasis in this area.<p>

<p>

     The third area is the production of a model to predict the transformations of trace species
during gasification.  The model is based on a previous stochastic code, with enhancements in
the areas of thermodynamics and kinetics.  The model is intended for use by researchers,
operators, and manufacturers of gasification processes.<p>

<title>Catalytic Fabric Filtration for
Simultaneous NO<sub>x</sub> and Particulate
Control</title>

<h2>Catalytic Fabric Filtration for Simultaneous NO<sub>x</sub> and Particulate Control
</h2> </center> 
<hr>



<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     In 1990, the first major reauthorization of the Clean Air Act since 1970 was enacted by
Congress and signed into law by the President of the United States.  Although SO<sub>2</sub>
emissions are still the primary focus of acid rain control, studies in Europe and the United States
investigating the role of NO<sub>x</sub> in acid rain formation and ozone chemistry have
resulted in NO<sub>x</sub> control being an important component of the 1990 Clean Air Act
Amendments.  Expectations are that NO<sub>x</sub> emissions will be regulated more strictly
at the local level (state and local regulatory agencies) than as currently addressed under the
reauthorized Clean Air Act.  Therefore, technology capable of achieving higher levels of
NO<sub>x</sub> control than those demonstrated by low-NO<sub>x</sub> burners must be
developed.  The development of a catalytic fabric filter is expected to help meet this need.  <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The objective of the catalytic fabric filter effort was to develop a catalyst-coated fabric filter
for NO<sub>x</sub> and particulate control that would provide high removal efficiency of
NO<sub>x</sub> and particulate matter, an acceptably long bag and catalyst life, and a cost
savings over a conventional selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system and baghouse.  Specific goals
of the program were to develop a catalyst-coated fabric that would provide the following:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  80% to 90% NO<sub>x</sub> removal with &lt;25 ppm of
ammonia slip<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  A particulate removal efficiency of &gt;99.5%<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> A bag/catalyst life of &gt;1 year<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  A 50% cost savings over conventional fabric filter and SCR
control technology<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Compatibility with SO<sub>2</sub> removal systems<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> A nonhazardous waste material<br>
</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

     Previous bench-scale experimental results have shown that over 90% NO<sub>x</sub>
removal can be achieved, the catalyst/fabric has promising self-abrasion characteristics, and the
potential exists for a substantial cost reduction compared to conventional SCR/fabric filtration
technology.  Several aspects of the technology required optimization and/or further evaluation.  These
included air-to-cloth ratio, ammonia slip, SO<sub>2</sub> oxidation to SO<sub>3</sub>,
temperature cycling, catalyst-coated fabric preparation, fuel impacts, fabric cleaning (reverse-gas
versus pulse-jet), catalyst life (poisoning and resistance to erosion), and filter performance/life
(particulate control, differential pressure, and abrasion resistance).<p>

<p>

     The specific approach selected to address these issues is represented by the following:<p>

<p>
<ul Plain>
          Task 1 - Program Definition<br>

          Task 2 - Design and Construction of Test Unit<br>

          Task 3 - Experimental Program and Data Reduction<br>

          Task 4 - Conceptual Design and Economic Evaluation<br>

          Task 5 - Test Unit Removal<br>
</ul>
<p>

<p>

     Bench-scale catalyst deactivation experiments demonstrated that strong acids (0.1 M HCl and
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and a strong base (0.1 M NaOH) destroy catalyst
reactivity on used fabric samples having a light residual ash layer.  Although the degree of catalyst
reactivity loss was greater for residual ashes containing greater concentrations of alkali, the end result
in all cases was a significant decrease in catalyst reactivity, which would require catalyst-coated bag
replacement.<p>

<p>

     Catalyst-coated fabric samples coated with any one of several chemical forms of alkali (Na,
Ca, and K) and then exposed to a severe moisture dew point demonstrated a significant loss of
catalyst reactivity.  Independent of chemical form, sodium had a greater effect than calcium,
and calcium a greater effect than potassium, consistent with the increasing Br&oslash;nsted acidity of
the ions.<p>

<p>

     Results from the pilot-scale 100- and 500-hour pulse-jet tests have shown that catalyst loss or
erosion from the fabric did not occur and 80% NO<sub>x</sub> reduction is possible with an
ammonia slip of 7.5% of the inlet NO<sub>x</sub> concentration at an air-to-cloth ratio of 3
ft/min.  Assuming a typical inlet NO<sub>x</sub> concentration of 300 to 400 ppm, the
resulting ammonia slip would be roughly 20 to 30 ppm.  Based on previous work, decreasing the
air-to-cloth ratio would result in an increase in NO<sub>x</sub> reduction and a decrease in
ammonia slip.  Recent bench-scale tests with new fabric samples prepared using 10 coats of catalyst
rather than the seven coats used previously have shown improved reactivity.  Assuming further
bench- and pilot-scale data substantiate the improved performance, 80% NO<sub>x</sub>
reduction could be achieved with an ammonia slip of &lt;10 ppm, or 95% NO<sub>x</sub>
reduction could be achieved with an ammonia slip of &lt;20 ppm.<p> 

<p>

     Particulate collection efficiency was typically &gt;99.9%, easily meeting the current New Source
Performance Standards of 0.03 lb/MMBtu.  Baghouse differential pressure was easily controlled at
4- to 6-in. W.C. (water column) using on-line pulse cleaning.  Sulfur dioxide oxidation to sulfur
trioxide was not observed to be a problem.<p>

<p>

     A single set of nine catalyst-coated DE992 bags was evaluated in a slipstream baghouse for
5136 hours, resulting in 13,820 cleaning cycles, while firing subbituminous coal in a stoker-fired
boiler at the University of North Dakota steam plant.  Supplemental ash injection was used to
augment fly ash from the stoker-fired boiler.  Baghouse operating conditions included flue gas
temperatures of 500&#176;-700&#176;F, filter face velocities of 3-5 ft/min, and differential
pressures of 2-6 in. W.C.  No catalyst-coated fabric failures occurred as a result of the 5136 hours of
normal baghouse operation.  Data from MIT Flex, Mullen burst, and bench-scale reactivity tests
with various fabric samples demonstrated that catalyst-coated fabric strength and reactivity did not
degrade with time.  Fabric samples tested represented 840, 1642, and 5136 hours of flue gas
exposure.<p>

<p>

     Particulate collection efficiency for the slipstream baghouse, as determined by a modified EPA
Method 5, ranged from 99.96% to &gt;99.99% for inlet mass loadings ranging from 1.5-5.7
gr/scf.  Differential pressure across the slipstream baghouse was effectively controlled using
on-line cleaning, a reservoir pulse pressure of 43 psig, and a pulse duration of 0.1 seconds. 
These pulse system conditions resulted in a pulse volume of roughly 0.3 ft<sup>3</sup> per
bag.<p>

<p>

     To determine the commercialization potential of the catalytic fabric filtration (CFF) concept,
Raytheon Engineers &amp; Contractors (RE&amp;C) was asked to develop a conceptual design and
prepare an economic evaluation of the CFF process to estimate capital, operating, and
levelized costs for two commercial pulverized coal-fired boiler applications:  a new 500-MW
plant and an older 250-MW plant.  In both cases, the CFF concept was compared to
conventional hot-side SCR for NO<sub>x</sub> control and cold-side pulse-jet fabric filtration
(PJFF) for particulate control.  The economic analysis was prepared based on Electric Power
Research Institute technical assessment guidelines.<p>
<p>

     The economic evaluation showed that the total installed plant investment for the CFF concept
was 5% higher than the total installed plant investment for the SCR/PJFF combination,
$145/kW versus $138/kW, for the new 500-MW plant and 4% lower for the 250-MW plant,
$213/kW versus $221/kW.  On a levelized-cost basis, the CFF concept was somewhat less
costly than the SCR/PJFF system for the new 500-MW plant, 5.91 versus 6.33 mills/kWh,
and for the 250-MW retrofit, 9.15 versus 10.07 mills/kWh.  Levelized costs for the CFF are
driven by catalyst-coated bag replacement costs.  Elements driving levelized costs for the
SCR/PJFF included SCR catalyst replacement costs and the additional induced-draft fan power
requirements to offset pressure losses across the SCR reactors and the PJFF.  The conceptual
design and economic evaluation completed by RE&amp;C indicates that the CFF is economically
competitive with the SCR/PJFF, but further CFF development is necessary in order to
compete commercially with the better-developed technologies.  Therefore, future CFF
development efforts must focus on reducing the cost of catalyst-coated bags, demonstrating a
bag and catalyst life of &gt;2 years, and improving performance with respect to
NO<sub>x</sub> reduction and ammonia slip at air-to-cloth ratios equivalent to or higher than
those used in this evaluation.

<title>Catalyst for Utilization of Methane in

<h2>Catalyst for Utilization of Methane in Selective Catalytic Reduction of
NO<sub>x</sub></h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

     The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO<sub>x</sub> in flue gas or engine exhaust gas
with hydrocarbons as the reductant has great potential for less expense, less pollution, and easier
operation than SCR with ammonia.  Methane is the preferred reducing gas because of its low cost
and low toxicity.  Stable, low-cost catalysts for SCR with methane are required to demonstrate this
technology for controlling NO<sub>x</sub> emissions.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective of the proposed work is to demonstrate that catalysts consisting of metal
ion impregnated on a clay or pillared-clay support or on a highly stable composite carbon support
are effective for SCR of NO<sub>x</sub>.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The efficiency of the clay-supported nickel and cobalt catalyst for NO reduction with methane as
the reducing gas was poor.  Evidently, the only catalyst that can effect this reaction is that
reported by Li and Armor (Li, Y.; Armor, J.N.  <i>Applied Catal. B. Environment
<b></i>1993</b>, <i>2</i>, 239.), who claim a zeolite-supported cobalt catalyst will
activate methane for the NO reduction.<p>

<p>

     Results from the two-step experiments conducted at two temperatures are much more interesting. 
The carbonaceous material formed from methane dissociation at 400&#176;C not only reduced NO to
N<sub>2</sub>O at lower temperatures, but also prevented oxidation of NO to
NO<sub>2</sub>.  Unfortunately, the carbonaceous forms that reduce the NO are not available
for reactions at 400&#176;C in the presence of oxygen.  A two-step process employing this chemistry
would be difficult, because the catalyst would have to be cycled between the two temperatures.  Also
the desired reduction in nitrogen is not very efficient.<p>

<h2>Evaluation of Owens-Corning Products for Filtration Applications </h2> </center> 
<hr>



<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The variables that determine the performance of a filter media can be divided into three
categories:  filter media properties, dust properties, and process conditions.  The main filter
media property that determines collection efficiency is pore size, which depends upon fiber
diameter and the filter media structure (e.g., type of weave or felted construction).  If the
average pore size in the filter is smaller than the median particle size, the filter itself will
achieve near 100% collection efficiency independent of dust properties and process conditions. 
Commercially available membrane-type fabric filters would fit into this category.  In such a
case, other parameters such as pressure drop primarily determine the amount of filtration area
required for a specific application.  However, for most cleanable filter media, it is not
practical or even desirable to achieve a pore size smaller than the dust being filtered.  A
compromise must be reached between achieving an acceptable pore size for good particulate
collection efficiency and constructing an economical, cleanable, and durable fabric.  Woven
glass fabrics with 100-200-&#181;m pores can achieve acceptably low particulate emissions for
some dusts at low air-to-cloth (A/C) ratios.  However, woven-glass fabrics are subject to high
emissions for some dusts and are not as durable as desired.  Needled felt fabrics (both glass
and synthetic fibers) generally provide better particulate collection efficiency, but have large
enough pores so that for some applications particulate collection efficiency is lower than
desired.  In addition, needled felt fabrics do not always achieve a sufficient bag life.  A goal
for the development of a superior filter media is to provide a durable fabric that can withstand
the harsh physical and chemical environment of many processes, while improving upon the
particulate collection capacity of existing woven or felted filter media.  This means that
significant optimization must occur to achieve the best balance among fabric pore size, fabric
weight, and durability for a variety of dust types and process conditions.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective of the project is to demonstrate that the filtration performance of fabric
samples manufactured using Owens-Corning (OC) products is as good as, if not better than,
commercially available filter media.  Specific goals for the bench-scale experiments include
demonstrating that fabric samples manufactured using OC products will achieve a minimum
overall mass emissions control level of 99.99%, demonstrating that fabric samples
manufactured using OC products will achieve a minimum emissions control level of 99.9% for
fine particles (&lt;5 microns), and developing insights concerning differential pressure
characteristics and the cleanability of the OC products relative to commercially available filter
media.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Key issues to be addressed in the overall evaluation of OC fabric samples include mechanical
strength and durability, resistance to chemical attack, filtration characteristics, and fabric
cleanability.  The EERC has focused its effort on fabric filtration characteristics. Performance
data developed include total mass collection efficiency, fine-particle collection efficiency,
differential pressure data and fabric cleanability, and fabric durability for a range of fly ash
physical and chemical properties.  The results from this project are proprietary and, therefore,
cannot be included in this summary.<p>

<h2>Nitrous Oxide Emissions</h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

     Because of growing public concern relating elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
concentrations to changes in the global climate, other trace gases including methane
(CH<sub>4</sub>), chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) have
become suspect as contributors to the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.  N<sub>2</sub>O
is reportedly increasing in atmospheric concentrations at an estimated rate of 0.7 ppb per year and
was measured (1988) in the atmosphere at a concentration of 307 ppb.  Although the atmospheric
concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O are low (1100 times less than CO<sub>2</sub>), the
relative strength of N<sub>2</sub>O as an infrared absorber is reportedly 200 times greater than
that of CO<sub>2</sub>.  In addition, N<sub>2</sub>O, being a stable compound, is
transported to the stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to NO (nitric oxide), the major
contributor to catalytic ozone depletion.  The association and/or contribution of
N<sub>2</sub>O to the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion has led to considerable interest in
determining the natural and anthropogenic pathways to its formation and destruction.  Typical
N<sub>2</sub>O measurements from fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) range from 50 to 200
ppm.  Therefore, contribution of N<sub>2</sub>O from FBCs will require attention in the
future, even though they may not be a major source of N<sub>2</sub>O.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

     <p>

     The purpose of this investigation was to determine the contribution of N<sub>2</sub>O to
the atmosphere from FBC of coal.  Additionally, goals were to establish a comprehensive engineering
model to assist in the prediction of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions based upon coal type and
operating and design considerations and to develop abatement techniques.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

     The effects of operational parameters and coal type on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in a
1-MWth pilot-scale circulating FBC (CFBC) were examined.  Operational parameters included
combustor temperature, excess combustion air, limestone feed rate, and primary:secondary
combustion air split.  Seven coals ranging in rank from lignite to high-volatile A bituminous were
used to investigate coal- and fuel-related effects.  In addition, a petroleum coke derived from the
"fluid" coking process and another from the "delayed" coking process were used as CFBC fuels.  At
typical operating conditions (20% excess air, 1120 K), N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from lignite
coals ranged from 40-65 ppmv, while subbituminous and bituminous coals had emissions from 30-40
ppmv and 130-190 ppmv, respectively.  The delayed coke produced N<sub>2</sub>O emissions
similar to bituminous coals at 142 ppmv, while the fluid  coke yielded the highest overall
N<sub>2</sub>O emissions at 211 ppmv.  The impact of CFBC operational parameters on
N<sub>2</sub> O emissions follows theapproximate relationships:  temperature &gt; excess air,
air split &gt; sorbent feed.<p>

<p>

     Increasing combustion temperature was shown to decrease N<sub>2</sub>O emissions,
while increasing excess air was shown to increase N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.  Actual
measurements from pilot-scale data indicate that N<sub>2</sub>O emissions decreased at a rate
of 0.36 ppm/K for low-emitting fuels at low excess air conditions and at a rate of 2.0 ppm/K for
high-emitting coals under high excess air conditions.  The effect of limestone addition was shown to
be coal-dependent, with decreasing trends in N<sub>2</sub> O emissions observed. 
Primaryair-to-total air ratio has a minimal impact on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions but tends to
decrease emissions at higher temperatures, while the opposite trend occurs at lower
temperatures.<p>

<p>

     Although N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from FBCs as high as 460 ppm have been reported in
the literature, these have been for operating extremes.  Typical N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from
utility plants are in the 30- to 120-ppm range, with emissions from pilot plants being higher for
similar coals and operating conditions.  Data indicate that several techniques exist to keep the
N<sub>2</sub>O emissions at low levels, including operating at higher bed temperatures and
lower excess air levels.  Another control method is afterburning a gaseous fuel in the cyclone or
freeboard of the combustor.  Therefore, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from FBC should not halt
the technology from moving forward.

<h2> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/American Plastics Council Thermal Recycling of
Plastics </h2>
</center> 
<hr>
<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>
     The purpose of this project is to investigate and optimize processes for waste plastics recycling
via thermal depolymerization to yield economically viable fuel and chemical feedstocks. 
Thermal depolymerization breaks down plastics under an inert atmosphere using catalysts and
heat.  The products of thermal depolymerization processes are a variety of organic materials,
the composition and yields of which are dependent on processing variables such as
temperature, bed material (catalysts, sorbents, inert materials), residence time, and feed
material composition.  The EERC has completed a scoping study for the American Plastics
Council (APC) in which the general depolymerization characteristics of several polymers were
investigated, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE),
linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), nylon, polyurethane, and acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (ABS).<p>

     Thermal depolymerization products, such as ethylene, propylene, butylenes (light olefins), and
terephthalic acid (TA), could be used as monomer feedstocks for production of recycled
consumer plastics.  Other organic liquids produced could be used as chemical feedstocks. 
Preliminary findings of the EERC depolymerization work have indicated that the most
practical alternative for the organic products not used for direct polymer production might be
as a feedstock to a petroleum refinery, where the variety of process entry points provides the
options needed for processing of such diverse materials (many depolymerization products
contain 300 or more components, ranging from light olefins and aliphatics to heavy aromatics
and waxes).  With the relatively high cost of curbside plastics collection and preparation for
recycling, the number of unit operations required for processing and separation needs to be
minimal, so that capital costs are kept low.  While some countries, including Japan and
Germany, have commercial depolymerization processes in place and others, including Great
Britain and the Netherlands, are well on their way, the process proposed here is different in
that it will deal with the higher levels of PET found in U.S. postconsumer plastics streams. 
Even with PET bottle sorting, PET levels are anticipated to be between 10% and 30%.  One
of the findings of the above-mentioned APC investigation is that the presence of PET in waste
plastics mixtures (at levels greater than about 5%) can cause severe operational difficulties. 
Another important finding is that when steam is present as a reactant, it is possible to
decompose PET to TA at higher temperatures than are normally used in a hydrolysis process. 
These two findings are relevant to the project in light of the current (and projected) high
demand for high-purity TA as a chemical feedstock.<p>

     Tests will be performed to investigate optimum reaction temperature, bed material composition
(calcium oxide will be added to the feed material to act as both a catalyst and a sorbent for
chlorine capture), gas residence time, reaction atmosphere, and waste plastics feed material
mix.  The feed material to be used in tests to optimize light (C<sub>2</sub> to
C<sub>4</sub>) olefin production will be the same as that used in the current APC program:  a
postconsumer (waste plastics) mix from the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area.  The feed material for
tests to optimize TA production will consist of the Minneapolis postconsumer mix to which virgin
PET will be added.  Compositional analysis of the postconsumer feed material will be performed by
Southwest Research Institute (SRI) of San Antonio, Texas.  SRI has already performed one analysis
of the Minneapolis postconsumer mix.<p>

     Testing will be performed using the EERC 1- to 4-lb/hr continuous fluid-bed reactor (CFBR),
which is rated for use at temperatures of up to 815&#176;C (1500&#176;F) and pressures of up to
170 psi.  The reactor consists of a 33-in.-high bed, having a nominal 3-in. inside diameter (ID).  The
freeboard section is 17 in. high, with a nominal 4-in. ID.  Any liquid used in the fluidization gas mix
is first preheated, then mixed with heated fluidization gas, and finally heated to reaction temperature
in a superheater.  Because plastics have a very low density, an inert bed material can be used to
facilitate adequate fluidization.  Waste plastics are fed into the reactor either through a dual-auger
arrangement or a modified ball valve "star feeder."  In the dual-auger arrangement, the first auger,
horizontally situated, meters out the feed material.  The metered feed drops to the second auger. 
This second auger, at a 30 angle from horizontal, delivers the feed material quickly into the hot
reactor.  The modified ball valve feed system involves a cup cut into a solid ball that drops a metered
amount of material onto an auger, which delivers the material quickly into the reactor.  Because
plastics soften and get sticky at a fairly low temperature, it is important to keep the feed at a low
temperature until it enters the reactor.<p>

     Spent (reacted) solids are collected from the reactor through a top-bed drain leg.  Material is
collected in a lock hopper-type pot.  Gas, volatiles, and fine solids leave the top of the reactor
and enter a 3-in.-ID cyclone where the fines are removed.  The gas stream enters one of the
two identical condensation trains (the system is configured to enable switching from one train
to the other to allow sampling and cleaning without shutting down the system).  A fixed bed,
which can be used for postreactor sorbent testing, is located upstream of one of the
condensation trains.  The fixed-bed cartridge is made of 3-in., Schedule 10, 304 stainless steel
pipe.  Two cartridges are available for use:  one 4 in. and one 8 in. long.  The cartridge and
lines leading to it are externally heated.  The two condensation trains consist of a water-cooled
indirect heat exchanger, followed by two glycol-cooled indirect heat exchangers.  The gas
stream that emerges from the condensation train is depressurized and metered and may be
sampled for on-line Fourier transform infrared spectrometry analysis.  Data collection and
process control are accomplished with a Genesis&copy; software package.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

     The two primary objectives of the project are 1) to identify processing conditions that provide
a maximum yield of "light olefins," a gaseous mixture consisting of ethylene
(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), propylene (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), and
five butylenes (1-butene, <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>- 2-butene, isobutylene [all
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>], and butadiene [C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>])
from a specific postconsumer plastics feed material and 2) to identify processing conditions that
provide a maximum yield of TA.<p>

     The EERC has completed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Quality Assurance Plan
(Category IV) document and 14 of the 24 tests.  The olefin tests program has been completed,
with the remaining testing for terephthalic acid production.

<h1>Thermal Recycling of Plastics </h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Plastics currently account for about 20% by volume of the materials entering a landfill. 
Landfilling and, to a lesser extent, incineration have been the traditional means of waste
disposal.  With ever more stringent regulations on material entering a landfill and the desire to
recycle more products, an effort is under way to reduce the volume of material disposed by
traditional means.  Although many products can be recycled directly back to their original
forms (e.g., paper, aluminum cans, high-density polyethylene [HDPE] bottles), others must be
recycled via alternative means to be economically viable.  The EERC is currently conducting a
program, sponsored by the American Plastics Council (APC), to examine the thermal
decomposition products resulting from the fluid-bed pyrolysis of polymers typically found in
postconsumer waste streams.  APC is a consortium of the 25 largest U.S. plastics producers. 
Thermal degradation of postconsumer plastics produces liquids and gases very similar to the
petroleum feedstock materials used in producing these plastics.  If located near a petroleum
refinery, the most cost-effective option might be to return the degradation products to the
refinery or olefin plant.  Not only would landfill volume be reduced, but the amount of
petroleum dedicated to polymer production would be decreased.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives are threefold:  to examine product yields (olefins, hydrocarbon liquids,
terephthalic acid) as a function of temperature, bed material, gas residence time, and feed
composition; to identify chlorine concentrations with varying processing conditions; and to
identify potentially troublesome products (e.g., organochlorides).<p>
<p>
<h2>Results </h2>
<p>
     The program has successfully demonstrated the conversion of plastics into liquids, gaseous
olefins, and terephthalic acid.  Results indicate that each of the products would be suitable for
entry into an olefin plant, refinery, or other chemical facility.  Materials tested included
polypropylene (PP), HDPE, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene
(LLDPE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), nylon, polyurethane, acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and several postconsumer plastics
with PET levels up to 20%.  Liquid yields ranged from 20% to  100%, and olefin yields
approached 50% at selected conditions.  Organochloride formation, which is a hindrance to
product acceptability, was found to be inhibited through the use of certain bed materials used as
chlorine sorbents.<p>

<title>Feedstock Recycling of 3M Postindustrial
Products</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1> Feedstock Recycling of 3M Postindustrial Products</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Over the past several years, there has been a desire on the part of the public to recycle and/or
reuse more of the material currently being landfilled or incinerated.  Many communities have
initiated collection and recycling of some postconsumer materials, such as aluminum, glass,
paper, and selected types of plastics (mainly polyethylene terephthalate [PET] and high-density
polyethylene [HDPE]).  While the recycling emphasis has been on marketable postconsumer
material, some industrial manufacturers, such as the 3M company, have initiated efforts to
increase both recycling of industrial scrap and recovery and subsequent recycling of products
from consumers.  These products are materials that would not be eligible for traditional
recycling processes.  Much of the 3M scrap is polymer-based and may contain significant
levels of solids.  Because of the solids content and because many 3M products are
combinations of two or more types of plastics, traditional recycling methods are inappropriate. 
For example, about three-quarters by weight of magnetic tape is PET.  While technologies
exist to recycle PET (hydrolysis, methanolysis), no existing process can accept material with
high solids loading, with PET in combination with other types of plastics, or with other
organic material (e.g., mineral oils).<p>
<p>
     The EERC was given the opportunity to investigate the feasibility of recycling selected 3M
products by thermal degradation to hydrocarbon liquids and gases.  Materials examined
included magnetic tape pellets, Scotchpak<sup>TM</sup> pellets (with both high and low PET
content), pelletized polymer sheet material, a face mask skeleton scrap, and three types of reflective
tape.  Thermal depolymerization tests were performed in the EERC 1-4-lb/hr continuous
fluid-bed reactor (CFBR) system.  Eleven products were tested, with forty-two test points
attempted.  Results of the work indicate that several of the low-PET products can be
decomposed to yield a usable liquid, with hydrocarbon liquid yields ranging from 24% to 66%
over a temperature range of 475&#176; to 550&#176;C.  A high-Btu gas is also produced that could
potentially be used for process heat.  This option needs further investigation, since buildup of
trace contaminants in a recycle loop is a concern.  Conversion of high-PET materials focused
on terephthalic acid (TA) recovery, since TA may be worth substantially more than the oils
produced, possibly as much as 30% more.  An exact determination of product value cannot yet
be made, since it depends upon the level of purity attainable.  <p>
<p>
     Oils produced in the process can either be blended with boiler fuels and used in-house at 3M
or sold to a refinery for introduction to a higher-value unit, such as a cat cracker.<p>
<p>
     Products containing levels of PET greater than 10% were known to have limits on their
processing conditions prior to the investigation.  A goal of this program was to help outline
these boundaries.  Previous work had indicated that processing PET at temperatures above
about 600&#176;C resulted in coking and agglomeration in the bed.  Processing at almost all
temperatures without steam also resulted in a prohibitive amount of coking.  At the higher
temperatures, CO<sub>2</sub> is released from the ring structures, leaving behind a radical
site.  These radical sites stick together, forming a network of aromatic rings.   (Sharp, L.L.; Ness,
R.O., Jr.; Randall, J.C.; Aulich, T.A.  "Thermal Recycling of Plastics," report to American Plastics
Council; EERC publication, 1994.)  Previous attempts at lower temperatures
(450&#176;-550&#176;C) were unsuccessful; initially it was thought that this was due to insufficient
energy (low temperatures) to break down the other polymers present in the mixed plastics feed
used.(Sharp)<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     In this investigation, several tests were performed in a steam atmosphere in an attempt to
convert PET to TA by a reverse esterification reaction.  Using steam, PET in polymer
concentrations from 10% to 100% was successfully decomposed.  TA was produced, with
yields ranging from 1% to 110%.  Note that these are yields, not conversions, and that
starting PET concentrations ranged from 10% to 100%.  While some tests showed respectable
TA yields, it was determined that impracticably high steam-to-PET ratios were necessary for
the solids and gas residence times tested.  The highest TA yields observed were seen when a
high-PET Scotchpak<sup>TM</sup> was processed using a 10:1 water-to-PET ratio.  It is not
yet known
which process condition is responsible for this high yield.  Feed composition, residence time,
steam-to-PET ratio, bed material, or a combination of factors may be responsible for this
promising result.  Further testing is needed to investigate the possibility of lower steam ratios. 
Variations in solid and gas residence times may permit processing at reasonable steam flows.<p>
<p>
     Both high- and low-PET-content Scotchpak<sup>TM</sup> pellets were processed with
minimal difficulties.  The high-PET material, processed with an approximate 10:1 steam-to-PET
ratio, gave the highest TA yield of any product tested.  The low-PET Scotchpak<sup>TM</sup>,
processed with minimal steam (2:1 and lower), gave much lower TA yields.  In addition to the higher
steam ratios, gas residence time in the high-PET material tests was much shorter than in the low-PET
tests.<p>
<p>
     The white face mask material, composed mainly of polypropylene (PP) and PET, decomposed
easily, yielding a liquid similar in composition and boiling point distribution to diesel fuel. 
Liquid yields ranged from 31% to 39% over a temperature range of 500&#176; to
550&#176;C.<p>
<p>
     A product of 3M's Occupational Health &amp; Environmental Systems Division (OH&amp;ESD)
was tested at 500&#176; and 550&#176;C.  While the test at 500&#176;C was successful, resulting
in a liquid yield of 51%, the test at 550&#176;C was terminated because of reactor plugging.<p>
<p>
     Face mask material mixed with PP tape was tested at temperatures of 475&#176; and
500&#176;C and found to decompose readily, producing a liquid yield of between 40% and
49%.<p>
<p>
     Reflectolite<sup>TM</sup> contains a high amount of silica-based paper.  This product,
decomposed alone or when processed with other tapes at a level of 30%, showed agglomeration
tendencies.  It is recommended that this product be diluted prior to processing.  The limiting
composition is not precisely known, but is below 30%.  The two other tapes tested, High
Intensity<sup>TM</sup> and Diamondgrade<sup>TM</sup>, were easily decomposed,
producing liquid yields between 24% and 66% over a temperature range of 500&#176; to
550&#176;C.<p>
<p>
     One test was performed on a polymer sheet material known to contain fluorine.  One test only
was performed in order to determine the possibility of producing perfluoroisobutylene (PFIB),
a highly toxic substance.  Product gas was sampled and later analyzed by a 3M lab.  PFIB was
detected in significant quantities.  Testing with this material was terminated.<p>
<p>
     While several of the liquids produced had boiling point distributions heavier than might be
desired for use as a boiler fuel substitute, blending in some proportion may be acceptable
using currently known conditions.<p>
<p>
Based on a recent residence time investigation conducted at the EERC using postconsumer
plastics (not yet published), (This work consisted of a series of tests in the EERC 1-4-lb/hr CFBR. 
Most tests were conducted at 625&#176;C; various gas  residence times were completed.  The feed
material had the following approximate composition:  67% HDPE, 9% polyvinyl    chloride (PVC),
12% PET, 6% PP, 2% polystyrene (PS), and 4% other.) a slightly longer gas residence time will
yield a considerably lighter product liquid.  It is not yet known what effect a longer gas residence
time will have on PET coking or on TA conversion.  While the magnitude of the effects of both gas
and solids residence time on TA yield and PET coking is not yet fully understood, much progress has
been made since the initial tests in this (3M) work, in which bed coking and plugging were
severe.<p>
<p>
     The EERC began a program sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the American Plastics Council (APC) in October of 1994.  A goal of the investigation is to
examine TA recovery.  If the EPA-APC work indicates that reasonable TA yields can be
attained at practicable steam ratios, it will be recommended that development of a TA recovery
process by 3M continue, since TA recovery will most likely enhance process economics. 
While it can be stated that TA is a more valuable product than the hydrocarbon oils produced,
it is not known what degree of purity of TA is attainable or the costs associated with attaining
varying degrees of purity.  If TA recovery is pursued, a test plan should cover optimization of
TA yields and characterization of the hydrocarbon liquid coproducts.  A decision as to whether
high-PET streams will be processed along with low-PET streams will dictate specific program
goals.  If high-PET and low-PET-content products are to be processed separately, products
with low to moderate PET contents should be tested at several other gas residence times to
optimize liquid quality and yield, separate from TA optimization studies.<p>

<h1>Development of an Airplane Deicing Concept </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2
<p>
     Aircraft are deiced to prevent a buildup of ice that would compromise safe flight.  The most
commonly used deicing agent is an ethylene glycol-based formulation called a Type 1 deicer. 
In the past, no effort was made to collect the runoff from the spraying operations.  However,
environmental regulations have been tightened, necessitating a change in procedure to include
collection and processing of the deicer runoff.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The objective of this research program was to determine if spent Type 1 deicing fluid could be
recycled to produce either deicing fluid or polyester-grade ethylene glycol that could be used
in the production of new deicing fluid.<p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     The research determined that spent Type 1 aircraft deicing fluid can be processed to produce
polyester-grade ethylene glycol suitable to be the basis for the production of Type 1 deicing
fluid.  The most effective recycling scheme tested consisted of physical separation of
suspended inorganic and organic debris followed by a series of mass transfer unit operations to
separate polyester-grade ethylene glycol from water and other organic liquids.  The success of
this research indicates that process scheme optimization and scaleup be performed, with the
resulting data used to determine the cost-effectiveness of this concept.

<h1>Treatment of Mixed Wastes</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Mixed-waste sites make up the majority of contaminated sites, yet remediation techniques used
at such sites often target only the most prevalent contaminant.  A better understanding of the
most common types of contamination, current remediation techniques, and combinations of
techniques would provide insight into areas in which further research should be performed.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives of this work effort are to 1) perform a detailed literature search dealing with
common types of contamination and current techniques (and combinations of techniques) used
to treat mixed wastes and 2) assess each of the remediation techniques, combining them in
various ways appropriate to mixed-waste protocol.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     A comprehensive literature survey of common types of mixed-waste contamination as well as
current state-of-the-art treatments for mixed wastes has been completed.  The documents
identified by the survey are under review.  Data gathered during the survey are being
incorporated into two other remediation technology databases.

<h1>Aqueous-Phase Thermal Oxidation Wastewater Treatment </h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Aqueous-phase waste streams pose a significant disposal problem.  These streams are made up
of by-product streams produced by industrial activity, process water, and contaminated
precipitation and have a volume totaling tens of millions of gallons per year.  Current
technologies used for aqueous stream cleanup include incineration, gravitational oil-water
separation, chemical stripping, activated carbon adsorption followed by desorption, and
microbial action.  Some of these technologies  cannot meet increasingly stringent release
requirements, and many are not economically viable.  Improved technologies capable of
dealing with this type of waste in an economic, environmentally acceptable manner are
needed.  Wet-air oxidation could be an appropriate technology if the high costs associated with
maintaining necessary reaction temperature and pressure could be reduced.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objective of this project is to shake down a novel wet-air oxidation apparatus that operates
in a manner that greatly reduces the high costs associated with maintenance of the required
reaction temperature and pressure.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Fabrication of the apparatus is nearly complete, and shakedown testing will subsequently
follow.

<title>Coal Ash Resources Research Consortium</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Coal Ash Resources Research Consortium</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Coal by-products are produced in high volumes worldwide each year.  Disposal of these
materials is an important economic and environmental issue to electric power utilities and is
frequently a major deterrent to the advancement of certain clean coal technologies.  Disposal
costs have risen dramatically for conventional coal ash, and since many clean coal technologies
produce an even greater volume of by-product, these costs are expected to increase as well. 
The costs associated with disposal generally result from meeting regulatory requirements
applied to ensure environmentally sound disposal.  Coal ash utilization has long been
economically advantageous, but with the forecast for some stringent environmental regulations
and the increasing disposal costs, the ash utilization option is likely to become a more
economically viable alternative.  In order to meet the research and development needs of the
ash use industry, the Western Fly Ash Research, Development, and Data Center (WFARDDC)
was formed in 1985 to facilitate the promotion of coal ash utilization through scientific and
engineering research.  The WFARDDC was reorganized to become the Coal Ash Resources
Research Consortium (CARRC, pronounced cars).<p>
<p>
     CARRC is the core research group for coal ash utilization at the EERC.  CARRC is a
consortium of member organizations, scientists, and engineers dedicated to performing
research and developing techniques related to coal combustion by-products.  This research and
development program involves work spanning from ash generation through utilization or
disposal.  The strength of CARRC research lies in the expertise and experience of the research
scientists, engineers, and member organizations.  A multidisciplinary team approach is
emphasized in every aspect of the research effort, and member organizations provide valuable
direction, insight, and perspective to the overall research program.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The primary goal of CARRC is to work with industry to solve ash-related problems and promote
the environmentally safe, economic utilization and disposal of these highly complex materials. 
Secondary goals include the generation of scientific and engineering information regarding
regulations and specifications for coal combustion fly ash; the development of improved
characterization methods for coal by-products; the demonstration of new or improved coal ash
use applications; and technology commercialization.  Specific research objectives for 1994-1995
are summarized as follows:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Advance predictive capabilities for and demonstrate ash behavior
in utilization applications<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Promote high-volume use applications for coal ash<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Develop valid environmental test procedures for coal ash
applicable to utilization and disposal<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Develop a database of utilization applications requirements<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Investigate advanced technological utilization applications and
promote innovative ash use<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Promote product performance to evaluate products containing coal
ash<br>
</ul>
<p>
     These objectives are consistent with the primary goal of CARRC.  CARRC members are
encouraged to participate in defining specific yearly objectives and research tasks to achieve
these objectives.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2></font> <p>
<p>
     CARRC has developed the Coal Ash Properties Database for over 800 fly ash samples from
around the world.  This database includes physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties that
have proven valuable to researchers, users, producers, and marketers.  The database was made
available to CARRC members in a user-friendly, interactive database management system. <p>
<p>
     CARRC researchers have worked with local ash marketers and contractors in placing
high-volume fly ash concrete in commercial projects.  These projects are visually inspected on a
regular basis, and laboratory specimens are evaluated to determine strength and durability of the
various mix designs.  North Dakota lignite ash samples were characterized for performance and
environmental criteria.  Mix designs for a wide variety of road-building applications are under
development.<p>
<p>
     CARRC researchers have developed new characterization protocols for coal combustion
by-products including leaching procedures, application of computer-controlled scanning electron
microscopy, and heat of hydration.  Research has also focused on the hydration of coal
combustion products as these reactions play an important role in the behavior of these materials
in utilization applications.  CARRC participated in the development of new standards for coal
combustion by-product utilization through the American Society for Testing and Materials and in
regional and national coal combustion by-product promotional groups and activities.<p>

<title>Development of a Coal By-Product
Classification Protocol for Utilization</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h2>Development of a Coal By-Product Classification Protocol for Utilization </h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     A major barrier to coal ash utilization is the lack of an effective classification system for coal
fly ash.  A large volume of fly ash is produced that does not meet current American Society
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specifications for cement and concrete but could be used for
other applications.  In many cases, coal ash is required to meet ASTM specifications, even
when they are clearly inappropriate for the application (i.e., controlled low-strength material). 
The disposal of this fly ash creates environmental problems as well as economic considerations
for the utilities.  Because current disposal facilities are rapidly being filled, many utilities face
the development of new disposal facilities.  These new facilities are generally more stringently
regulated by state environmental agencies and will be much more costly for the utility. 
Furthermore, the current focus on reducing trace element emissions may cause an increase in
the trace elements in coal by-products such as fly ash, which may further impact disposal
requirements for the utility and cause greater environmental concern.<p>

<p>

     Creating a classification system for fly ash that facilitates the use of performance-based
specifications for use applications will broaden the utilization options for coal ash, resulting in
avoided disposal costs, and will provide opportunities for industry to develop new products
and expand the use of coal ash in existing products.  The inadequacy of the current
classification system is one of the major technical barriers to increased coal by-product
utilization.  This project is ideally suited to the EERC multidisciplinary approach and involved
personnel from several groups.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The goal of this project was to develop a classification system for fly ash based on parameters
that relate to performance specifications of engineering and construction applications.  The
new classification system will provide a means of evaluating the suitability of coal ash for use
in certain products that currently have no realistic standards or classifications.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     A flowchart to facilitate the identification of appropriate coal combustion fly ash materials for
use in structural fill applications was developed.  The first screening criterion for the materials
selection is the environmental or leaching characteristic of the material.  If the material is
environmentally suitable, physical and engineering properties, detailed in the ASTM standard
guideline for use of coal fly ash in structural fill, are determined.<p>

<p>

     Two samples of North Dakota lignite fly ash were evaluated using this procedure and found to
be good candidates for structural fill and other fill applications.

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Coal residuals, like any other material, must be understood before they can be effectively
managed. 
To
fully assess coal combustion ash for its utilization potential, a thorough evaluation of its physical,
chemical,
and mineralogical characteristics is essential.  This evaluation will reveal what is in the material,
what form
it is in, how reactive it is in given situations, and how it will behave as a component in a product
setting.  <p>

<p>

     Until recently, virtually all utilization attempts were empirically, rather than scientifically, carried
out. 
This
resulted in no predictability or reliability and, consequently, little industrial enthusiasm to use ash.  A
well-designed research and development program in coal ash utilization is needed to match the
material
properties available with existing products to develop new products and markets.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     In recent years, a more scientific approach to ash utilization research has been developed at the
EERC. 
Significant progress has been made in understanding the chemistry and phase assemblages of these
highly
complex materials.  The understanding and interpretation of the inorganic transformations responsible
for
ash production during coal combustion have also been greatly improved in recent years.  The
research from
this project is an aggressive step towards integrating the transformations into a comprehensive ash
management plan, including the specific details relevant to the Clay Boswell power generation
facility. 
Several environmental and economic benefits are anticipated as a result of this project, including 1)
reduced
waste from coal combustion, 2) reduced ash disposal costs, and 3) production of a stable product in
addition
to electricity generation.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Samples were collected to represent high-load, low-load, start-up, and shutdown conditions at
Minnesota
Power's Clay Boswell Station Unit No. 2.  These samples were thoroughly characterized and
represent the
coal ash quality as background samples.  A test burn at the Clay Boswell Station was done with
varying
plant loads and operational parameters in order to determine the impact of these parameters on ash
quality
and consistency.  Samples were collected during the test burn, characterized, and related to the plant
operational parameters that have an effect on ash quality.

<title>Solidification and Stabilization of Wastes Using Coal Fly Ash</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Solidification and Stabilization of Wastes Using Coal Fly Ash</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Fly ash and fly ash with additives have been used to stabilize and solidify a wide variety of waste
materials.  A large number of laboratory-scale tests have been done using fly ash to stabilize
various wastes such as sludge, methanol, xylene, benzene, radioactive wastes, heavy metals, and
oils.  Because coal fly ash is often considered a waste material, its use is often overlooked or
questioned by remediation contractors and regulatory personnel.  However, several documented
sites exist in which fly ash was successfully used for the solidification and stabilization of
wastes.  The work requested by the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) was focused on
providing useful information on site performance of fly ash as a solidification and stabilization
material for waste remediation sites.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The primary objective of this project was to assemble definitive information on the use of coal
fly ash and other coal conversion solid residues for the solidification and stabilization of
wastes.<p>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
     During the project, opportunities and needs related to fly ash and other residues for solidification
and stabilization of wastes were identified.  From the information compiled, a well-documented
article, "Solidification and Stabilization of Wastes Using Coal Fly Ash:  Current Status and
Direction," was prepared by the EERC for publication by the ACAA.  This document lists a
number of research projects as well as commercial applications of solidification and stabilization
of wastes using coal fly ash.  A list of the various wastes that have been successfully stabilized
using coal fly ash is given as well as the technical and regulatory issues concerning the use of
coal fly ash in the solidification/stabilization process.  Several case histories are cited as well as a
list of recommendations to Congress by the U.S. Department of Energy to increase the use of
coal fly ash.

<title>Use of Coal By-Products for Removal and Solidification/Stabilization of Hazardous
Wastes</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Use of Coal By-Products for Removal and Solidification/Stabilization of Hazardous Wastes</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Increasing demand for carbon sorbents and catalytic supports has been stimulated by their
burgeoning use in controlling environmental pollution as well as optimizing the dispersion and
reducing the cost of catalysts.  Specialty carbons are being successfully used in numerous
applications such as selective pollutant sorption and high-temperature sorbents.  Currently,
brown coal coke and bituminous coal-based carbons are being used to adsorb sulfur dioxide,
hydrogen chloride, and mercury vapor as well as volatile organic compounds at power utilities
and waste incineration plants in Germany and Japan.  With the addition of ammonia to the flue
gas stream, NO<sub>x</sub> can also be controlled.  As the environmental regulations in the
United States become more stringent, the demand for adsorbent carbons will substantially increase
their application as sorbent materials in stacks at power utilities, cement factories, and waste
incineration plants, to give a few examples.<p>
<p>
     Low-rank coals (LRCs) are believed to be excellent precursors for sorbent carbons because of
their inherently high surface areas, which can be enhanced by thermal pretreatment.  Carbon
sorbents can also be made more selective in their application (e.g., for mercury species control)
by chemical treatment.  LRCs have a relatively higher oxygen content than high-rank coals do,
assisting in the development of optimum pore structure during activation.  In addition, LRCs are
available in plentiful supply and at low cost.<p>
<p>
     A second area of opportunity involves the use of coal ash.  It would be highly advantageous, both
for government and commercial sectors, to develop standard practices for the use of coal
conversion by-products in the development of solidification/stabilization (S/S) technologies for
the environmentally acceptable and economic disposal of mixed wastes.  The federal government
has a broad range of sites requiring remediation where S/S technologies using coal utilization
wastes may be the best available technology.  The use of coal combustion by-products and/or
ettringite formation has been found to have potential for the fixation and stabilization of
hazardous wastes.<p>
<p>
     Additional research is needed to understand the long-term performance potential of waste
stabilization using fly ash and clean coal technology by-products.  A better understanding of
mineral reactions involving metal hydroxides and substituted ettringites is a key part of
predicting the fixation and retention of hazardous trace metals over time using coal combustion
by-products.  In general, the chemistry of fly ash interactions with inorganic waste constituents
bears a close similarity to concrete chemistry, which can, therefore, be used to investigate
inorganic fixation.  Long-term stability is particularly difficult to define, and predictive modeling
must be used to project stability parameters.<p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The objective of the project is twofold:  1) to produce and characterize test quantities of an
activated carbonaceous adsorbent and 2) to investigate the potential for application of coal
conversion by-products in waste stabilization settings with a focus on the potential for ettringites
and ettringitelike mineral forms for the fixation and retention of hazardous materials.<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Gascoyne lignite chars were prepared at 400&#176;C and subsequently steam-activated at
750&#176;C for 30 min.  The I<sub>2</sub> (iodine) numbers of the char and the activated
carbon were found to be 283 and 290, respectively.  The lack of improvement in surface area during
steam activation can be attributed to the mineral-catalyzed gasification, as with the leonardite chars. 
Thus several experiments with chemically cleaned lignite were preformed.  Nitric acid-washed
Gascoyne was prepared and carbonized at 400&#176;C.  The I<sub>2</sub> value was quite
low (183), probably because the pores collapsed to a greater extent during carbonization in the
absence of the calcium ions.  Steam activation of the char from the cleaned coal gave an
improvement in the I<sub>2</sub> value (283), but this value is still very low.  The char
produced from lignite cleaned with sulfurous acid had an I<sub>2</sub> number of 271.  Steam
activation of this char gave a carbon with I<sub>2</sub> = 317.  Although this value is low
compared with those of commercial carbons, it indicates that acid washing is essential for obtaining
usable carbons from LRCs.  A further demonstration of the mineral effect was obtained by washing
the 400&#176;C char from the uncleaned coal and then activating the cleaned char.  In this case, the I<sub>2</sub> number decreased for the 30-min activation, but increased substantially for the
60-min activation to 454.  Thus the kinetics of steam gasification in the absence of the calcium are
very slow, and a long activation time is required to develop the desired porosity.<p>
<p>
     Two samples of coal combustion by-products were selected for investigation in this project. 
These samples were submitted for laboratory testing, including bulk chemical analysis,
evaluation of mineralogy and phase association, physical and engineering properties, and
leaching studies.  As part of the leaching studies, an evaluation of the hydration reactions will
also be performed.  Several other regional coal ash samples are being evaluated for utilization
potential, and all relevant information available from this project will also be evaluated relative
to solidification/stabilization.  In addition to the stabilization of potentially hazardous trace
elements, such as boron and selenium, characterization results from all of these materials will be
evaluated for potential use for soil stabilization in roadbase, subbase, and slope protection.

<title>Sulfate Resistance of Fly Ash Concrete</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h2> Sulfate Resistance of Fly Ash Concrete </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) has identified the issue of conflicting and
misrepresented information on sulfate resistance of fly ash concrete as one that may be highly
detrimental to the maintenance and expansion of the fly ash market for concrete.  The ACAA
determined that the initial step in addressing this issue is to summarize and evaluate available
technical information; the second step is to identify and prioritize research needs.  ACAA and
the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center funded an effort at
the EERC to review key literature related to sulfate resistance of fly ash concrete and to
identify the research needs for technical support of the utilization of coal combustion fly ash in
concrete subject to a sulfate environment.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The primary objective of this project was to assemble definitive information on sulfate
resistance of fly ash concrete and develop a prioritized list of research needs for the coal by-product
industry
in this field.  The work consisted of a comprehensive review of literature
addressing the sulfate resistance of fly ash concrete. <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The literature review and evaluation performed by the EERC for this effort indicate that the
common difficulties, such as the empirical nature of research, materials variability, variable
methodologies, limited documentation, and limited studies, described in coal ash research also
apply to research on sulfate resistance of fly ash concrete.  The literature review identified
specific cases of conflicting research conclusions by researchers from various backgrounds.<p>

<p>

     Research needs were identified both directly from the literature and from the review and
evaluation of the information available in the literature.  Research is needed in the following
key focus areas:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Impact of fly ash on sulfate resistance of concrete<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Evaluation of fly ash for sulfate resistance potential<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Procedures for evaluation of sulfate resistance<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Mechanisms of sulfate attack on concrete<br>
</ul>
<p>

     It is also recommended that this effort be designed as a cooperative venture among several
research groups to provide ongoing peer review and maintain an unbiased viewpoint.  Direct
input from the coal ash industry is recommended to facilitate the performance of the best
possible project and documentation.

<title>Testing of Radcon Formula #7 for
Resistance to Chloride Ion Penetration</title>

<h2>Testing of Radcon Formula #7 for Resistance to Chloride Ion Penetration  </h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h3> Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The use of salts for combating ice formation on concrete surfaces is common practice in cold
regions of the United States.  The infiltration of chloride ions from these salts can cause severe
concrete degradation.  In the case of bridge spans, the chloride ions can attack the embedded, 
reinforced steel.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The objective of this project was to evaluate the product, Radcon Formula #7, for its potential
to resist chloride ion penetration.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     ASTM Test Method C672, "Scaling Resistance of Concrete Surfaces Exposed to Deicing
Chemicals," was used to evaluate Radcon Formula #7.  Concrete samples were fabricated, and
the finished surfaces were treated with the Radcon Formula #7.  These surfaces were then
exposed to a 3% sodium chloride solution.  After the prescribed exposure duration, cored
specimens were retained and evaluated for total chloride ion content.<p>

<p>

     The results indicated that Radcon product effectively reduced chloride ion penetration to the
specification levels prescribed by the American Concrete Institute and the North Dakota
Department of Transportation.  The use of the Radcon product will promote more construction
using concrete mixtures.  This, in turn, may promote the use of more coal by-products such as
fly ash.

<h2> Use of Coal Ash in Ceramics</h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Previous empirical tests at the EERC have indicated that coal combustion by-products are a
viable starting material for the production of a variety of ceramic products, including brick,
tile, and high-flexural-strength ceramics.  The EERC has focused on high-temperature
properties of coal and has provided valuable insight into ash transformations, fouling, and
slagging for the utility industry.  The information generated in these past projects will be used
to develop material selection criteria and product manufacturing techniques based on scientific
and engineering characteristics of the ash.  Commercialization of the use of coal combustion
by-products in ceramics is more likely to become viable if a quality-assured product can be
made, and predictive materials selection is a key component of a quality-assured product.<p>

<p>
<font color="#990066"><h2>  <b>Objective</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The objective of this project is to demonstrate the development and  production of a ceramic
material utilizing coal ash as a key component.  Chemical and high-temperature properties of
ash will be carefully determined, with the goal of identifying criteria for materials selection
and manufacturing options for ceramic production.  <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     A variety of coal fly ash samples have been selected from the Coal Ash Properties Database. 
A review of key chemistry parameters indicated that sodium and iron have an effect on the
behavior of ash subjected to high temperatures, and so the ash samples selected have a range
of sodium and iron concentrations.  Additional characterization techniques are being
performed on the selected ashes.  Preliminary mix designs for high-flexural-strength ceramics
have been developed, and laboratory specimens of ceramic will be prepared.<p>

<h2>Use of Coal Ash in Recycled Plastics and Composite Materials </h2> </center>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Coal fly ash has been used as an inert filler in paints, plastics, and other manufactured
products.  Unfortunately, the properties of coal ash have not been considered to upgrade these
materials or to produce a unique material.  Coal ash exhibits a broad range of characteristics
that appear to have potential to be used beneficially in plastics and other composite materials. 
Baseline investigations of the use of coal ash in plastics, particularly recycled plastics, will use
information already being generated regarding the inorganic constituents in plastics and will
provide further information on the suitability of coal fly ash for use in recycled plastics and
other composite materials.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The goal of this research is to determine the potential for coal ash to serve as a functional filler
in plastics and other composite materials, with special emphasis on the interaction of coal ash
and recycled plastics in simple formulations designed to produce building or decorative tiles.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Several samples of ash were considered for use in production of a plastic sample.  The ash types
selected for laboratory trials included a glassy, granular boiler slag, a pulverized coal fly ash, and
cenospheres.  Plastics that might be expected in postconsumer streams were reviewed.  Several
plastic types were selected for preliminary trials.  Polyester and acrylic were used to produce a
number of prototype tiles incorporating the various coal combustion by-products (CCBs) at
several different levels.  The tiles vary in appearance because of color and particle-size variation
in the CCBs.  The tiles are lighter than conventional ceramic tiles.  Performance criteria,
including flexural strength and resistance to abrasion, will be evaluated.  Testing the
compatibility of these tiles with adhesives and grout is also planned for future projects.<p>

<title>Ash Utilization in the State of North
Dakota</title>

<h2>Ash Utilization in the State of North Dakota</h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The use of coal combustion fly ash of appropriate quality to replace a portion of the portland
cement in concrete is one of the more established ash utilization options, such as in the
construction of the EERC laboratory addition.  Typically, 25% of the cement is replaced with
fly ash.  For this project, 70% of the cement was replaced with fly ash, and the performance
of the high-cement-replacement concrete was evaluated.  The use of controlled-density
flowable fill is also a high-volume use of fly ash that was demonstrated.  Finally, concerns
over the environmental acceptability of these materials were addressed.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The objectives of this project were:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To demonstrate the use of high-fly-ash-replacement concrete for
the construction of several heavy-duty roads and parking lots at the Coal Creek Station near
Underwood, North Dakota.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To demonstrate the use of controlled-density flowable fill using
Coal Creek Station fly ash.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> To determine any environmental impacts on groundwater resulting
from the use of high-fly-ash-content concrete and fill.<br>
</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Approximately 20,000 square yards of 8-in. concrete paving were placed at the Coal Creek
Station in 1988 and 1989.  The concrete mixture was innovative because Coal Creek fly ash
was used to replace 70% of the conventional portland cement.  The performance of the
high-fly-ash-replacement concrete was monitored, and the groundwater at the construction site was
sampled to evaluate the potential for trace element leaching from the concrete.  Cored
specimens and visual inspection have been performed, and results show strength and durability
similar to conventional concrete pavement.  High-volume fly ash concrete pavement competes
economically with asphalt pavement for placement with a longer life span.  The high-volume
fly ash concrete pavement remains in service today in heavy traffic areas at the plant site and
maintains excellent performance.  Laboratory and field results indicate no adverse impact from
leaching of the concrete.  Extensive laboratory testing was also performed to evaluate potential
environmental impact and engineering performance of controlled low-strength material
(CLSM) using 100% coal fly ash.  Following approval from the North Dakota State
Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories, CLSM was placed in an abandoned
underground mine at Wilton, North Dakota.  The CLSM can be used for subsidence abatement
and is easily placed because of its excellent flowability.  Environmental monitoring of the
Wilton mine site indicated no detrimental impacts as a result of placement.  Environmental
monitoring will continue under another project.<p>

<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Effective management of wastes from advanced coal utilization processes requires a detailed
understanding of the physical properties of the waste streams.  This project was undertaken to
develop chemical and mineralogical property data for a variety of advanced process wastes and
to evaluate the suitability of different management practices for the wastes.  These materials
were collected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) over a period of several years and
originate from a variety of projects.  This effort completed the characterization database for
these materials.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objective</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The objective of this project was to characterize the disposal-related properties of a wide range
of different waste materials produced from advanced coal utilization processes.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Eight solid wastes collected from various facilities employing advanced coal combustion and
coal conversion technologies were characterized for this work.  The characterization protocol
used for each waste included an extensive set of waste management-related physical properties,
bulk chemical analyses, and mineral analyses.  The characterizations of the eight advanced
process wastes were completed, and the results are summarized in a technical report.  The
most significant disposal-related property exhibited by many of the advanced process wastes
was the self-heating behavior when they were conditioned with water.  Work on the first eight
advanced process wastes was completed in 1993.<p>

<title>National Mine Land Reclamation Center: Research Program for the Western Region</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>National Mine Land Reclamation Center: Research Program for the Western Region</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The National Mine Land Reclamation Center (NMLRC) was established in 1988 as three
regional centers--the Western Region center located at and administered by the EERC, with
research support provided by the North Dakota State University (NDSU) Land Reclamation
Research Center; the Midwest Region center at Southern Illinois University; and the Eastern
Region center at West Virginia University (WVU) and Pennsylvania State University.  This
program is sponsored by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, with WVU performing the overall
national program administration.  The NMLRC consortium brings together experienced
research teams that address regional and national reclamation issues with an interdisciplinary
approach.  The NMLRC Western Region at the EERC has more than two decades of research
experience in natural materials characterization, hydrogeology, and geochemistry of
environmental systems and process design and operation ranging from conceptual to
commercial in scale.<p>
<p>
     Reclamation of a landscape disturbed by surface coal mining involves addressing a number of
related issues, including degradation of groundwater quantity and quality, degradation of plant
growth potential, and instability of the reclaimed materials.  In order to determine the
environmental impacts due to surface mining, the total landscape must be evaluated, which
involves determining the relationships between surface morphology, physical and chemical
characteristics of the disturbed and reclaimed materials, and hydrogeology and geochemistry
of the saturated and unsaturated zones.  Reclamation design that is fundamentally sound,
appropriate, and effective in the long term must integrate and incorporate research on all of
these landscape components--surface and subsurface.  This applies to both abandoned mine
lands and current mining areas. <p>
<p>
     The Western Region center of the NMLRC conducts research on reclamation issues of
regional and national significance.  Overall, the Western Region program continues to
emphasize relationships between composition of materials, geochemistry, hydrogeology, soil
hydrology, and water quality problems at field sites in several western states, including North
Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.  Understanding that reclamation is an inseparable part of
mining activities will result in programmatic planning and substantial economic benefit for all
participants in the mining process.<p>
<p>
     The projects in the Western Region program, participating research institutions, and location
of field research sites, respectively, are as follows:<p>

<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The overall objective of this program is to develop information and techniques for successful
long-term reclamation of abandoned mine lands and current mining areas, considering
differences in geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, climate, and topography.  Previous
Western Region research projects focused on water occurrence and movement in the
landscape, mineral-water interactions, and geochemical evolution of subsurface water, and
more recent projects have included the investigation of generation, migration, fate, and
remediation of contaminants related to 1) coal ash disposal/utilization, 2) selenium in mine
spoils, and 3) metal mining wastes.<p>

<p>
<h2>Results</h2></font> 

<p>
<h3>Project ND01:  Surface and Root Zone Hydrology of
Mined Lands</h3>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Undisturbed soil profiles with permanent grass vegetation have
the highest capacity for infiltration, mostly through a network of macropores; spoil piles in
abandoned mine lands have the least capacity for infiltration, although desiccation cracks and pores
are abundant.  Well-vegetated topsoil and subsoils and depressional areas in abandoned mine lands
have equally high potential for infiltration.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Infiltration capacity of post-Surface Mining Conservation and
Reclamation Act (SMCRA) reclaimed soils on top of spoil material is higher than when these sodic
spoils are left alone.  Compared to undisturbed soil profiles, the hydraulic conductivity of reclaimed
soils is significantly lower because of a lack of macropore and micropore permeability caused by
spreading, layering, and compaction activities during reclamation.  Some premine soil profiles
severely compacted by traffic or overgrazing have lower conductivity than reclaimed profiles.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> There was a general lack of subsoil recharge during 1989-1992
due to low precipitation.  Only in depressional areas with nonspoil materials in abandoned mine land
profiles was there recharge to deeper soil depths.  Soil water storage and water levels on depressional
ponds at the Indian Head mine were depleted because of lack of precipitation and snowmelt runoff. 
During 1993, precipitation in the region was unusually abundant, making it necessary to continue
monitoring and evaluating the new data in contrast to drought conditions present during the preceding
few years.<br>
</ul><p>
<h3>Project ND02:  Groundwater Movement and Chemical
Evolution from the Root Zone to the Water Table</h3>
<p>
     Detailed assessment of principal hydro- and geochemical processes participating in pore and
groundwater chemistry evolution was carried out at three surface mine localities in North
Dakota--the Fritz, Indian Head, and Velva mines.  Extensive field and analytical work allowed
for generation of sufficient information on geology, hydrogeology, mineralogy, soil
characteristics, and pore and groundwater chemistry.  Geochemical model MINTEQA2 and
advanced statistical analysis coupled with traditional interpretive techniques were used to
determine site-specific environmental characteristics and to compare the differences between
study sites.<p>
<p>
     ND02 key project results finalized in the project report submitted to the U.S. Bureau of Mines
in 1995 are as follows:<p>
<p>
<ul palin>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Site-specific porewater and groundwater are typically of the same
chemical type.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that sulfate, magnesium,
calcium, gypsum saturation index, and sodium contribute the most to overall differences in
groundwater chemistry between study sites.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> SO<sub>4</sub> anion-enriched aqueous solutions in the
vadose zone enter the saturated zone and influence the quality of groundwater.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Soil paste extract pH and EC measurements performed on over
3700 samples document extremely acidic soils at the Fritz mine.  The number of samples with a pH
&lt;5.5 reaches 80%-90% of total samples from discrete depth near the top of the soil profile at the
Fritz mine.  Samples from Indian Head and Velva do not exceed the limit at all.  The percentage of
samples with an EC &gt;3 mS cm<sup>&#45;1</sup> is between 20%-40% at the Fritz mine
and below 20% for samples from Indian Head and Velva.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The concentration of the sulfate anion in pore water and
groundwater reflects the presence of acid- generating minerals (pyrite) within the soil profile and
dramatically impacts pore water quality (lower pH, increased electrical conductivity).<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Pyrite was detected in soils at the Fritz mine by scanning electron
microscopy point count (SEMPC) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses.  Pyrite was not detected in
soils from Indian Head and Velva.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Results of geochemical modeling indicate an increased tendency
for gypsum saturation within the vadose zone, particularly within the lands disturbed by mining
activity.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Project ND03:  Stabilization of Underground Mine
Voids by Filling with Coal Conversion Residual Materials</h3>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Emplacement of a formulated fly ash grout in a short stretch of
underground tunnel at the old Wilton mine to stabilize the subsidence hazard was completed and will
be followed by evaluation of the engineering and environmental performance of the grout, focusing
on strength, permeability, mineral diagenesis, and chemical behavior of the grout mixture in the
environment.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Project ND04:  Comparative Evaluation of Methods of
Selenium Analysis for Determining Potential Environmental Problems</h3>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Numerous overburden core samples from the Cordero mine near
Gillette, Wyoming, were screened for total selenium, and 18 were chemically analyzed and leached
using four different extraction procedures (to develop a comparative database of total selenium,
selenium species, relative of mobility, and potential for environmental problems).<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Data from ammonium bicarbonate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (AB-DTPA), hot-water soluble, synthetic acid rain, and synthetic groundwater leaching
procedure (SGLP/leaching tests), indicated that the SGLP test was most relevant for simulating
natural conditions and provided flexibility for variable field situations. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Project ND05:  Physical and Geochemical Modeling of
Waste Migration from Mining-Contaminated Floodplains, Phase I, Process Analysis
</h3>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Efforts at Silver Bow Creek by the University of Montana team
have resulted in establishing the general groundwater flow field using a network of monitoring
instruments in the soil and groundwater zones and also the patterns of metals contamination and
general groundwater quality relative to flow fields and concentrations of metals in site sediments. 
<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Laboratory simulation of EM on Silver Bow Creek site sediments
has been completed and parameters established for an initial field demonstration to test the technical
and economic feasibility of large-scale application.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Electrode arrays were installed at the Silver Bow Creek site,
followed by a program of monitoring and assessment to determine the viability of this technology to
remediate the toxic hazards. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Project ND06:  Modeling Soil Water Status of Mine
Land Profiles</h3>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Field research conducted by the NDSU Land Reclamation
Research Center at the Indian Head and Velva mines in North Dakota under Project ND01 "Surface
and Root Zone Hydrology" has resulted in a database for estimating the amount of runoff, runon, and
evapotranspiration water available for plant growth and potential sites of groundwater recharge in
various topographic positions at these mines.<br>
</ul>
 <p>
<h3>Project ND07:  Wetland Hydrology of Mine Lands</h3></font> <p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Field monitoring is continuing at wetlands sites at the Coteau
mine, Falkirk mine, Indian Head mine, Velva mine, and several other wetlands in central North
Dakota, covering the comparative spectrum from reconstructed wetlands in reclaimed areas, to
wetlands in abandoned mines, to more natural and pristine wetlands in the glacial drift prairie.<br>
</ul><p>
<h3>Project ND08:  Diagenesis and Leaching Characteristics of
Aged Coal Conversion Solid Residues from Mine Disposal Environments</h3>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Coal conversion solid residue (CCSR) utilization is currently
very
limited so that disposal is usually the only alternative.  Resultant environmental concerns focus on the
interaction of CCSR leachate with surface water or groundwater.  There is a general lack of suitable
technical information on the physical, chemical, mineralogical, and leaching properties of CCSRs
that have aged for any significant periods of time.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> This research will generate data on the mineral diagenesis
(transformations) and leachability of CCSRs subjected to long-term environmental exposure over
decades.  Studies will be performed on a variety of disposed ash materials taken from undisturbed
cores from typical mine disposal settings.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Mineral transformations have been varied and dramatic.  Early
reactions with water transformed reactive mineral phases in raw materials to various cementitious and
hydrated phases.  Significant amounts of ettringite, thaumasite, tobermorite, and some Na-Al zeolite,
Na-Ca sulfate, calcite, and gypsum were identified.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> SGLP leachates had pH levels of 10-11 and a typical composition
of sodium and sulfate.  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other important metals in the
ash cores did not leach during lab tests.<br>

<h1>Analysis of Pollutant Organics from Contaminated Solids Using Off-Line Supercritical Fluid
Extraction and On-Line SFE/IR </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The remediation of U.S. Department of Energy sites requires rapid and accurate methods for
the determination of organic pollutants on soils and sediments.  Ideally, these methods should
be easily performed at the contaminated sites, with a minimum of laboratory support.  While
many field-portable instruments are available to analyze soil extracts, methods needed to
extract soil samples are generally not amenable to performance in the field.  Supercritical fluid
extraction (SFE) has been developed to the point where field-portable instruments can easily be
moved and yield excellent extraction efficiencies in relatively short times (usually less than 30
minutes).  In addition, coupling SFE with infrared spectrometry (IR) can yield rapid
determinations for many organic pollutants without the need to collect extracts for subsequent
analysis.  SFE/IR has the potential to provide a reliable and sensitive field-portable instrument
for surveying organic pollutants in soil samples without requiring any organic solvents to be
present on-site.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The objectives of this project are:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To develop and demonstrate the use of SFE under field conditions
for extracting organic pollutants from soil in preparation for analysis by conventional field-portable
analytical methods.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To develop and demonstrate the use of on-line SFE/IR under field
conditions for the rapid and solvent-free determination of organic pollutants. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Field demonstrations have been performed showing that commercially available SFE
instrumentation can  be operated easily and reliably in the field without the need for a
laboratory support vehicle.  Good quantitative agreement between field SFE and laboratory
extractions has been achieved for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from soil.  Over
30 soil samples can be extracted in a day using only a portable electrical generator.  A field
demonstration for the field determination of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) is planned. 
Future work will also evaluate the use of enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) combined with
SFE for the rapid field determination of PAHs and PCBs from contaminated soils.  Results of
field and laboratory work demonstrate that SFE can be used in the field to extract most
commonly measured organic pollutants for subsequent determination by any suitable
technique.<p>
<p>
     Laboratory work on the SFE/IR system has demonstrated robust operational characteristics
and good sensitivities (sub-ppm detection limits).  For example, SFE/IR analyses of total
petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) on contaminated soil can be performed in 15-30 minutes with
no organic solvent, and the quantitative results agree with conventional Soxhlet extraction,
which requires 4 hours of extraction with Freon-113 solvent.  Peer-reviewed publications
describing the results of this investigation are available upon request.  Discussions with a
leading instrument manufacturer are now being held for commercializing the SFE/IR interface.

<h1>Centrifugal Membrane Filtration</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The EERC will team with SpinTek Systems,  LP, a small business and owner of a novel
centrifugal membrane filtration technology, to establish the applicability of the technology to
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) site remediation and the commercial viability of the
technology for liquid mixed-waste-stream remediation.  The technology is a uniquely
configured process that utilizes ultrafiltration and microporous membranes at pressures of up
to 100 psig in combination with centrifugal force to remove suspended and dissolved solids to
as low as 200 molecular weight.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The overall project consists of several integrated research phases related to the applicability,
continued development, demonstration, and commercialization of the SpinTek centrifugal
membrane filtration process.  Specific objectives of Phase I research activities include 1) a
problem and opportunity assessment to identify applicable waste streams associated with DOE
sites, 2) the development of detailed process data that will provide information with regard to
the application of the technology at DOE sites, 3) testing and evaluation of a laboratory
centrifugal membrane filtration unit using surrogate waste streams under a variety of operating
conditions, and 4) the development of process data that will allow optimization of the
technology for appropriate DOE waste streams.<p>

<p><h2>Results</h2>

     The project is scheduled to begin in the near future.

<title>Stabilization of Wastes Through Vitrification</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Stabilization of Wastes Through Vitrification</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Simply vitrifying a material into a glassy slag does not necessarily produce an environmentally
stable product.  In order to make it so, the chemistry of the materials will need to be assessed
and, possibly, modified with additives and nucleation agents.  The incorporation of toxic
metals and radionuclides into stabilized phases will also need to be determined.  The ability of
a material to produce stable phases is largely dependent upon chemical composition, time, and
temperature.  A leaching protocol developed at the EERC called the synthetic groundwater
leaching procedure (SGLP) and a long-term leaching (LTL) procedure will be applied to
vitrified waste materials.  Long-term leaching will determine the mass of leachable materials
and will also predict the rate of leaching.  This project will contribute to the U.S. Department
of Energy's (DOE) identified technical needs in waste characterization, low-level mixed-waste
processing, disposition technology, and improved waste forms.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2></font>
<p>
     The specific objectives of this project are to 1) demonstrate a waste vitrification procedure for
enhanced stabilization of waste materials and 2) develop a testing protocol to understand the
long-term leaching behavior of the stabilized waste form.<p>
<p>
     The work will proceed in four major steps:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Selection and characterization of test mixtures for
vitrification<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif">  Fabrication and characterization of optimized vitrified test
wastes<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Environmental assessment of vitrified and crystallized waste
forms using advanced leaching protocols<br>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Refinement and demonstration of vitrification and crystallization
methods leading to commercialization<br>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     To date, a literature review has been completed that provides an overview of low- and high-level
nuclear waste immobilization.  The objective of the survey was to make a concise
summary of glass properties with nuclear wastes and/or hazardous elements for their effective
immobilization and to specify directions of further tests to produce durable and highly stable
glasses. Emphasis is on technologies based on borosilicate glasses, since this glass will be used
in the United States and Europe to immobilize radioactive high-level liquid wastes for ultimate
geological disposal.<p>
<p>
     Vitrification of aqueous radioactive wastes will achieve large-volume reductions (86-97 vol%)
and will ensure their stabilization.  Borosilicate waste glasses are the most studied and
probably best understood waste form that has been developed.  Also, the application of
synrocs, cements, and bentonites for radionuclide immobilization will be explored.<p>
<p>
     This survey indicates that there is lack of information in the following areas:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Vaporization of heavy or radioactive metals from the melts and
whether vaporization behavior could be controlled by modifying the heating environment in order to
separate the hazardous materials from the bulk waste.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> How to avoid the formation of molten sodium sulfate on the cold
cap.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Catalytic activity of radionuclides at the surface of the glass and
glass corrosion in water.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The effect of glass cooling rate on generation of residual stresses
below the temperature of glass transformation and its effect on the leachability of nuclear waste
glass.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> The effect of foaming of the melt on the homogenization of
nuclear waste during vitrification using plasma technology.<br>
</ul>
<p>
     In addition, a two-pronged literature survey of cleanup sites has begun, focusing on studies of
the leaching of vitrified wastes at the sites as well as a general survey of existing DOE
hazardous waste sites and waste stabilization technologies (other than vitrification) that are
currently in use at the sites.  A preliminary assessment of leaching studies indicates that the
testing procedures currently in use to determine the leachability of the waste materials are
geared to short-term procedures directed toward regulatory compliance rather than realistic or
predictive testing.  This survey is scheduled for completion in June 1995.<p>
<p>
     The survey of DOE waste sites is part of this larger survey.  The information already reviewed
indicates that there are a wide variety of mixed wastes containing low-level nuclear material or
radionuclides.  Some of the wastes are suited for vitrification.  Others would be better
stabilized with alternative technologies because of the nature of some of the constituents. 
These include mixed wastes with chlorinated hydrocarbons, explosives, and pesticides.  These
types of wastes will not be considered in this project.<p>

<title>Selective Subcritical Water Extraction of Aromatic and Aliphatic Organic
Pollutants from Petroleum Industry Soils and Sludges</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Selective Subcritical Water Extraction of Aromatic and Aliphatic Organic Pollutants from
Petroleum Industry Soils and Sludges </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
     <p>
     Samples contaminated with petroleum industry wastes often contain complex mixtures of
aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.  The analysis and remediation of such solids would be
facilitated by a selective extraction method that could extract the toxic components without the
need for organic solvents.  The EERC has previously demonstrated that subcritical (hot
pressurized) water is an efficient extraction solvent for nonpolar organics present in petroleum
wastes, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
     <p>
     The use of subcritical water to selectively extract aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons from
petroleum waste solids will be developed.  Preliminary determinations of the solubility
behavior of liquid fuels in subcritical (hot pressurized) water will also be performed.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Subcritical water extraction conditions have been developed that allow quantitative removal of
aromatic hydrocarbons, ranging from BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene)
components to high-molecular-weight PAHs from a petroleum waste sludge.  Efficient
(&gt;98%) removal of polar organics such as phenols occurs with low-temperature (50&#176;C)
extractions.  BTEX organics extract efficiently at 100&#176;C, while PAHs are not extracted until
temperatures are increased to 150&#176;-250&#176;C.  At 250&#176;C, water is sufficiently
nonpolar to extract all regulated PAHs from sludge in 15 minutes, while few of the matrix hydrocarbons
(e.g., large alkanes) are extracted.  Peer-reviewed publications describing the results of this
investigation are available upon request.

<title>Hot-Water Extraction of Organics, Metals, and Halogens from Coal and Contaminated Soils</title>

<h1>Hot-Water Extraction of Organics, Metals, and Halogens from Coal and Contaminated Soils
</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The EERC has previously demonstrated that supercritical and subcritical (hot pressurized)
water can be used to extract sulfur from coal (including sulfate and pyrite) and nonpolar
organic pollutants from soils.  Depending on the temperature and pressure of the extractant
water, the solubilities of inorganic and organic pollutants vary by several orders of magnitude. 
However, the variations in solubility that occur and the potential for extracting a wide variety
of organic and inorganic pollutants are not well understood.  The reactivity of supercritical
water (i.e., it has both higher H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&#45;</sup> concentrations
than water at ambient conditions) may also cause the release of pollutants from solid samples.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The potential for using supercritical (&gt;374&#176;C and &gt;220 atm) and hot pressurized
water (&lt;374&#176;C) to extract halogens and toxic metals from coal and contaminated soils will
be evaluated as well as the use of hot water to extract organic pollutants such as polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs).<p> 
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Preliminary results demonstrate that supercritical water is an efficient extraction solvent for
removing mercury from coal and from soil samples.  For example, when Illinois Basin coal is
extracted for 30 minutes with supercritical water (450&#176;C and 350 atm), &gt;85% of the
mercury is removed as well as ca. 70% of the coal sulfur.  However, over 70% of the carbon content
of the coal remains.  When soils contaminated with mercury were extracted for 30 minutes,
more than 99% of the mercury was removed, and more than 50% of the arsenic and selenium. 
At milder conditions (steam at 300&#176;C), PCBs are removed from contaminated soil in less than
5 minutes using liquid water at 250&#176;C and 50 atm.  These results indicate that both
supercritical and subcritical water should be useful for analytical- and remediation-scale
extractions of toxic metals and organics from coal and soil.  Future studies will determine the
ability to extract halogens and other toxic metals.  Peer-reviewed publications describing the
results of this investigation are available upon request.

<title>Solventless Extraction of Organic Pollutants from Water with Solid-Phase 
Microextraction</title>

<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Solventless Extraction of Organic Pollutants from Water with Solid-Phase Microextraction
</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     The analysis of organic pollutants in water currently requires extraction with large volumes of
halogenated solvents.  Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) can allow direct extraction of the
pollutants into a solid phase, with no need for liquid solvents.  The analytes are then
determined by conventional gas chromatography or spectroscopic techniques.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The theoretical basis and practical applications of SPME with gas chromatographic analysis
are being developed.  In addition, a new approach using direct spectroscopic determination of
organic pollutants absorbed from water samples is being investigated.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     SPME with gas chromatography has been demonstrated to give better detection limits for
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related pollutants than conventional techniques,
while requiring no organic solvent and much less time.  Detection limits for PAHs in water
range from &lt;1 ppb for low-molecular-weight aromatics (e.g.,naphthalene) to as low as 0.03
ppb for higher-molecular-weight PAHs (e.g., pyrene).  SPME with ultraviolet spectroscopy
has also been shown to yield very low detection limits for aromatic pollutants (e.g., low- to
mid-ppb) and has excellent potential for very simple and sensitive field screening methods
using a conventional ultraviolet instrument.  Peer-reviewed publications describing the results
of this investigation are available upon request.<p>

<h1>Oil Spill Recovery Sorbent Evaluation</h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Petroleum product spills are detrimental to the environment in numerous ways.  Industrial
accidents involving spillage of crude oil or motor fuels are of increasing importance.  Recovery
of oil spilled on water or land with a minimum amount of labor is desirable.  Biomass-derived
sorbents have proven to be applicable to recovery of spilled crude oil or motor fuels which has
been spilled on water or land.  In addition, these same sorbents are being applied for collection of
other types of water contaminants, such as pesticides.  Biomass-derived sorbents are also
desirable since once used to absorb spillage, they may be used as a fuel.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
     The goal of this project was to evaluate the performance of a new biomass-derived sorbent
material for its applicability to recover crude oil from water or land.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     The candidate sorbent material was compared to two different commercially available sorbent
materials designed specifically for oil spill recovery.  All sorbents in the project were subjected
to testing in accordance with Canadian General Standards Board "Method for Testing Sorbents,"
CAN/CGSB-183.2-94. This test is designed to evaluate sorbents for the applications described
above.  Results of the work indicated that the proposed sorbent material did not perform as well
as commercially available sorbent materials.

<title>Spectroscopic Field Screening of Hazardous Waste and Toxic Spills</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Spectroscopic Field Screening of Hazardous Waste and Toxic Spills </h1> </center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
     <p>
     Field screening of petroleum product spills to determine the extent of soil contamination can
be time-consuming and expensive.  This project is investigating the applicability of coupling
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with cone penetrometry (FT-IR/CPT) as a means of
quickly and inexpensively characterizing the extent of soil contamination from petroleum
hydrocarbons.  Previously, researchers have demonstrated the ability of laser-induced
fluorescence spectroscopy-cone penetrometry (LIF-CPT) as a means to estimate the extent to
which a region of soil has been contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.  The LIF-CPT
technique is currently limited to detection of aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons
are a small portion of a petroleum spill and represent the most volatile and mobile portion. 
The alkanes represent the vast majority of a typical petroleum spill and are more likely to
persist as residual contamination. Therefore, a rapid, cost-effective technique would more
likely approximate the total hydrocarbon mass that is present in the soil matrix.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
     <p>
     The feasibility of using FT-IR/CPT as a field screening technique will be determined through
laboratory investigation. The specific objectives of this work are the following:<p>
<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To design an accessory for use with FT-IR which interfaces the
spectrometer to a cone penetrometer.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To characterize the response of the FT-IR accessory to petroleum
hydrocarbons in a laboratory- simulated field environment.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> To determine the ability of the FT-IR/CPT instrument to measure
hydrocarbon contamination in soil by direct comparison with gas chromatography of hydrocarbons
extracted from the same soil.<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
     <p>
     Current project work is evaluating various stationary-phase materials for use in coating optical
fibers in order to provide the remote-sensing capability necessary for implementation of the
FT-IR/CPT.  The ideal stationary phase will be oleophilic and hydrophobic, allowing it to act
as a collection medium for soil contaminants.  Laboratory work has shown
polydimethylsiloxane to be useful as a reusable stationary phase for solid-phase
microextraction of volatile organic compounds.<p>

<title>Development and Testing of Technologies for the Remediation of Mercury-Contaminated Soils</title>
</head>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<center>
<h1>Development and Testing of Technologies for the Remediation of Mercury-Contaminated
Soils </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Mercury manometers have been used for decades to measure natural gas flow at wellheads and
through gas pipelines.  As a result of the unintentional release of mercury from the
manometers, contamination of surrounding soils has occurred.  Under current regulations (the
Land Disposal Restrictions), only one identified technology, thermal treatment, is acceptable
for soils contaminated with higher levels of mercury, such as those common at natural gas
metering sites.  Concerns are that existing thermal treatment facilities designed to treat
mercury-contaminated soils do not have sufficient capacity to handle the potentially large
volumes of mercury-contaminated soils and that more economic alternatives should be
investigated.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The overall objective of this project is to select, develop, demonstrate, and evaluate alternative
treatment technologies for the remediation of mercury-contaminated soils.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Technology selection for development and testing was based on subcontractors' proposals
submitted in response to a Request for Proposals.  The selected technologies included a
prototype portable thermal treatment process, a bench-scale chemical leaching process, and a
prototype combination physical separation/chemical leaching process.<p>
<p>
     Each technology was evaluated using two different soil types:  a sandy soil from New Mexico
and a clayey soil from Ohio.  These soils, collected from contaminated natural gas metering
sites, were intended to represent dissimilar soil types and contamination conditions.  Soil
samples were mixed, split, and shipped to the three subcontractors for testing. 
Demonstrations of all three technologies were completed in late 1993.  The EERC's roles were
to witness and sample each demonstration, provide quality assurance/quality control oversight,
and summarize the results of each test in a final report entitled "Remediation of
Mercury-Contaminated Soils: 
Development and Testing of Technologies."<p>
<p>
     Thermal treatment was the most effective in removing mercury from the soils, based on both
percent total mercury removal and leachable mercury (by the toxicity characteristic leaching
procedure) after treatment.  However, both chemical leaching processes, when combined with
physical separation, were shown to be effective in reducing total and leachable mercury to
levels that would satisfy most regulatory requirements.<p>

<title>Ettringite Formation as a Fixation Technology for Immobilizing Trace Elements</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h1>Ettringite Formation as a Fixation Technology for Immobilizing Trace Element </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
     Operations involved in natural gas production, processing, and transport can result in solid
wastes or solutions containing arsenic, boron, chromium, molybdenum, selenium, or
vanadium.  These elements are typically in solution as oxyanions or other complex ions and
may be readily available for incorporation into hydrated mineral phases such as ettringite. 
Incorporation of these potentially hazardous trace elements into ettringite may be a means of
chemically fixing or stabilizing them in the environment.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
     Several key issues must be addressed to evaluate the potential effectiveness of ettringite
formation as a fixation technology for hazardous trace elements:<p>
<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Determination of the lower limit of concentration reduction of
thetrace elements<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Determination of the optimal formation conditions of
ettringite<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Determination of the structure of substituted ettringite<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Investigation of the release of fixed species from the ettringite
mineral under various conditions<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Investigation of the potential substitution of oxyanions into
previously formed existing ettringite<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Investigation of ettringite formation in commercially available
products and its applicability to natural gas industry wastes<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Evaluation of various materials as starting materials for ettringite
formation<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Investigation of the degradation products of ettringites under
thermal and chemical stress<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Investigation of how water is bound in the ettringite structure and
the effect of dehydration<br>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2></font> 
<p>
     Research on the use of ettringite as a fixation technology for immobilizing trace elements is
complete.  The research demonstrated that the formation of ettringite can be accompanied by a
reduction of solution concentrations of boron and selenium of up to two orders of magnitude. 
The process is economical and highly effective.  Enhanced ettringite formation is in the process
of being patented as a waste treatment technology.  The final report for this project has been
submitted for review by Gas Research Institute.  Numerous aspects of this project have been
related to the research, but not directly related to waste treatment.  Among these are the
development of advanced characterization techniques and understanding leading to the use of
ettringite in numerous areas such as mine land reclamation, use options for advanced coal
combustion process solid residues, and analytical chemistry and atomic spectroscopy.  A
continuous process for waste treatment has been demonstrated, and it has been determined that
the economics of this process are favorable for commercialization.<p>

<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h2>Fuel Quality Advisor</h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Background</h3></font>

     The ability to predict effectively the impacts of operational and fuel changes and fluctuations
within a utility boiler has long been the desire of many engineers.  The Fuel Quality Advisor
is a project to integrate a large portion of the work performed by the EERC and others into a
user-friendly computer program that can provide information on the effects of fuel quality on
design and performance of power systems.  The goal of this project is to aid utilities, fuel
processors, engineers, researchers, coal companies, and others to allow for efficient and
proper use of the volumes of complex results.  The project is initially focusing on integrating
current computer algorithms for conventional combustion ash transformations and deposition
along with new algorithms for coal handling, low-NO<sub>x</sub> ash transformations, and
entrained gasification ash transformations.  Limited work is also being done on identifying other
potential algorithms for the Fuel Quality Advisor, such as heat and mass transfer properties of
new and existing systems (computational fluid dynamics modeling), ash transformations and
deposition in fluidized-bed combustors, effectiveness of conventional particulate cleanup
processes and hot-gas cleanup loops, emissions of hazardous air pollutants from coal-fired
systems, and other processes related to the various aspects of coal utilization.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives </h3></font> 
     The overall objective of this program is to integrate the many complex correlations and
algorithms available into a single, or series of, computer program(s) to allow non-research-oriented
users to
benefit from their development.  By developing a standardized interface, both
current and future users will benefit from the universal operation of the program.  In addition,
the currently available algorithms for ash formation, ash deposition, and coal handleability will
be enhanced to be more reliable across a broader range of coals and operating conditions.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Results</h3></font>
     A Windows-based computer program is being developed which will utilize state-of-the-art
coal characterization data and operational information and produce a series of coal rankings for
common coal-related problems.  Indices for slagging, high-temperature fouling, low-temperature
fouling, and
coal handling are being included in the program.<p>
     The indices included in the program are based on engineering theory and enhanced with
bench-, pilot-, and full-scale information. To gain the necessary research information, tests are
being conducted in the EERC pressurized drop-tube furnace, conversion and environmental
process simulator, and coal handleability test loop.  Release of Version 1.0 of the Fuel Quality
Advisor will take place at the end of 1995.<p>

<title>Computer Systems Used for Prediction of
Impacts of Changing Fuel Quality on
Power Systems</title>

<h2>Computer Systems Used for Prediction of Impacts of Changing Fuel Quality on Power
Systems </h2>
</center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Background </h3></font>
     The effects of coal quality on utility boiler performance are difficult to predict using
conventional methods.  As a result of environmental concerns, more utilities are blending and
selecting coals that are not the design coals for their units.  This has led to a wide range of
problems, from grindability and moisture concerns to fly ash collection.<p>

     To help utilities predict the impacts of changing coal quality, the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have initiated a program called
Coal Quality Expert (CQE).  The program is undertaken to quantify coal quality impacts using
data generated in field-, pilot-, and laboratory-scale investigations.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives</h3></font>
     The overall objective of the program is to provide the utility industry with a personal
computer-based expert system to confidently and inexpensively evaluate the potential of
coal-cleaning,
blending, and switching options to reduce emissions while producing electricity at
the lowest cost.<p>

     The goals of the work being conducted by the EERC include the following:<p>

<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Characterize coal, ashes, and deposits collected during field-,
pilot-, and bench-scale testing using state-of-the-art methods<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Use a bench-scale drop-tube furnace (DTF) to determine the
critical temperatures and conditions under which deposits form and develop strength<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Identify key characteristics in the coal and ashes responsible for
ash deposit formation in utility boilers<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Use the results from the field-, pilot-, and bench-scale work to
develop a framework for fouling and slagging algorithms that will enhance CQE<br>
</ul>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Results</h3></font>

     Eight different coals were used in bench-, pilot-, and full-scale tests to determine the effects of
coal quality on boiler performance.  The coals and related ash and deposit samples were
characterized and the results used as input for algorithms to predict fouling and slagging
behavior.  The project is approximately three-quarters complete and will be concluded by the
fourth quarter of 1995.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Task 1 - Coal Characterization Through
Computer-Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy</b> </h3></font> <p>

     The eight coals were analyzed using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy
(CCSEM) to determine composition, size distribution, and mineralogy.  The results helped to
elucidate the mechanisms involved in inorganic transformations of the coals and served as
input to the slagging and fouling algorithms.  The CCSEM results were also useful in
determining the effectiveness of coal-cleaning processes.<p>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Task 2 - Bench-Scale Ash Deposition:  Drop-Tube
Furnace Testing</b> </h3></font>  <p>



     The eight coals were tested in the optical DTF, which consists of a high-temperature furnace
equipped with optical access for observing the formation of deposit growth.  Deposits were
characterized using SEM point count (SEMPC), which yields bulk oxide chemistry.  Results
were similar to those obtained for the pilot- and full-scale tests (Tasks 3 and 4).  Data from
both CCSEM and SEMPC analyses were used as input for the fouling and slagging algorithms.<p>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Task 3 - Characterization of Samples from the ABB
Combustion Engineering Fireside Performance Test Facility</b></h3></font> <p>


     The eight coals were used in pilot-scale tests at ABB Combustion Engineering.  The resultant
fly ash and deposits were analyzed at the EERC using the same methods applied to the samples
produced through bench-scale testing (Task 2).<p>



<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Task 4 - Characterization of Field Test Samples</b>
</h3></font> <p> 


     Field testing was conducted to compare the results of the smaller-scale testing.  The three sites
used were the Public Service of Oklahoma Northeast Station, Mississippi Power Watson
Station, and Northern States Power Company King Station.  Samples of coal, entrained ash,
slagging and fouling deposits, and fly ash were analyzed using CCSEM and SEMPC methods
to verify the results of the pilot- and bench-scale testing.  The strengths and growth rates of
fouling and slagging deposits observed in the full-scale tests were similar to the results of the
smaller-scale tests.<p>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Task 5 - Development of Algorithms to Predict
Convective
Pass Fouling</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     FOULER is a mechanistic model which predicts the coal ash deposition in a utility boiler. 
The model was placed into a C-based computer code that will be added into the CQE model
being developed by EPRI and DOE.  The CQE code is designed to explore a broad range of
economic and operational factors involved in the combustion of coal.<p>

<p>

     FOULER predicts both growth and removal of fouling deposits through the interaction of
several submodels:  deposit growth, strength development, thermal properties, deposit
removal, and sootblower effectiveness.  Inputs for the FOULER code include advanced coal
characterizations, boiler parameters, and operational conditions.  These submodels interact to
produce outputs, based on  time, for deposit mass, strength, resistivity, removal rates, and
sootblowing effectiveness.  The data generated from the program are used to predict the
resistance to heat transfer caused by the deposits.  The FOULER code has been constructed
and is currently being enhanced and integrated into the CQE program, with completion
expected by August 1995.<p>

<p>

     The EERC, in collaboration with PSI PowerServe, has developed and coded a computer
model, SLAGGO, that predict the effects of furnace slagging in a coal-fired boiler.  The
required inputs for the SLAGGO code include ash size and composition, boiler parameters,
and operational conditions.  These input values are provided by the PSI PowerServe mineral
matter transformation model and the CQE interface shell and heat-transfer modules,
respectively.  Using these input values, SLAGGO predicts both growth and removal of
slagging deposits through the interactions of the following submodels:  ash formation, deposit
growth, thermal properties, and deposit removal.  These submodels interact to produce
outputs, based on user-defined time intervals, of deposit mass, strength, and a cleanliness
factor.<p>

<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3>Background </h3></font>
     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center
(EERC) of the University of North Dakota (UND) emphasizes research, development,
demonstration, and commercialization of innovative environmental cleanup technologies
through partnerships between government, industry, and the EERC in the areas of applied
science and engineering.  CATM was established by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and is focused on minimizing the effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the
environment.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing
189 substances, including air toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM is working
with industry and government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a
scientific basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate and impacts
of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  CATM-related programs are
focused on the development of methods to minimize the release of air toxic metals via practical
prevention and control methods based on scientific understanding and principles.  To facilitate
research efforts and dissemination of information, CATM is organized into five integrated
program areas:  Program Area 1 - Air Toxic Metals Transformation Mechanisms, Program
Area 2 - Analytical Methods Development, Program Area 3 - Control Technologies, Program
Area 4 - Modeling and Database, and Program Area 5 - Technology Commercialization and
Education.  Program Area 4 focuses on the development of advanced computer applications
that serve as tools for the understanding and mitigation of air toxic metals.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives</h3></font>
     Modeling and Database Applications Program Area 4 focuses on three primary areas:  1) the
development of a database for the storage and retrieval of air toxic metal analytical,
engineering, and report information; 2) the development of models and algorithms
(nomograms) for predicting trace metal partitioning and the control and release of trace metals
from energy-producing systems; and 3) the creation of a user-friendly graphics package and
modem link for the database and the various trace metal models that are currently being
planned and/or developed.  Access to database information is available to government
agencies, academia, and industry through CATM.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Results</h3></font>
     A first-generation, state-of-the-art database running on a Sun Sparc 10-51 workstation with a
database enhancement package has been created.  The first-level database utilizes three
different types of information:  analytical data, engineering information, and reporting
citations.  Data generated from the other program areas were used for implementation of the
first-level model.  This database will allow researchers, fuel buyers and sellers, system
designers, and managers to make educated decisions on the operation of energy- producing and
waste-incinerating facilities.  The database will allow users to compare information from
different systems and view information from specific systems.  A fully functional version of
the database will be operational at the end of 1996.<p>

     In addition to the development of the database, work was also conducted on developing an
interface for accessing the database and models at the EERC through outside computers. 
Tentative plans include both an Internet and modem link into the systems at the EERC.  An
interface has been designed for Internet access, and a modem link consisting of a dedicated
computer server that will handle all communication between the user and system is currently
under design.<p>

     Modeling activities to date have been conducted as enhancements to existing projects and
computer codes.  Modeling work was coordinated with a parallel project at the EERC "Trace
Element Emissions" (TEE), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.  The TEE project
is developing a computer program to predict the physical state and concentration of various
trace metals within a gasification system.  This project aided in the research of thermochemical
equilibrium programs and in the development of a user-friendly graphical interface.  The
development of a  submicron particle formation model was also initiated through the
cooperation of Flemming Frandsen, a visiting scientist from Denmark at the EERC.

<h1>Resource Data Evaluation and Geographic Information System Technologies </h1>
</font> 
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
     Advances in computer hardware and software technology are reshaping approaches to data
acquisition, management, and analysis.  Data sharing and data availability have become an
important outcome of the increase in agencies and institutions striving for an integrated
approach to resolving the myriad of complex global concerns.  At the vanguard of integrative
technologies is an approach known as geographic information systems (GIS).  GIS is a
software technology that permits the input, manipulation, analysis, and display of
geographically referenced data.  GIS provides a set of tools to perform these functions by
integrating map information and associated attribute data.  The portrayal and analysis of such
information can occur at many levels of specificity.  The strength of GIS utility, however, is
its capability to integrate and portray the relationship between data typically left unassociated
because of the lack of a means to bring different types of information into one format and
method of analysis (e.g., the cost relationship between geology and urban sewer systems). 
With GIS technology and appropriate data management techniques, investigation, not
compilation and display, becomes the central research issue.<p>
<p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
     The Resource Data Evaluation initiative consisted of two basic components that represent a
single objective to develop an understanding of the analysis capabilities across the spectrum of
program areas at the EERC in order to support data management needs as part of the decision-making
process.  These program areas include energy and environmental policy and planning,
mine planning and reclamation, energy resource occurrence, groundwater resource
occurrence, and waste management studies.  <p>
<p>
     Resource Data Integration research is developing an approach to fully integrate a
geographically based resource management system that will interpret the complex relationships
between capability, utilization, and reclamation.  The integration of resource data across the
large number of energy and environmental concerns requires specialized programming and
hardware specific to the information-intensive applications of multilayered attribute data
associated with GIS.  Commercially available GIS software is utilized with advanced
computing systems to analyze these relationships.  This research is focused on the
methodology and system requirements to undertake a sequence of pilot projects.  <p>
<p>
     Resource Data Correlation research is undertaken to apply GIS technologies by example to
determine programming and hardware requirements for a variety of data types.  Examples
include research areas in the Paleocene-age coal-bearing strata of the Williston Basin in North
Dakota and adjacent areas in Montana.  The objective of this project is to develop existing
EERC databases to integrate coal-related information with geologic information for the
specific purpose of summarizing the status of coal bed recognition and correlation in the
Williston Basin.  The resulting approach is specifically designed for earth resource evaluation
and characterization, with applications for groundwater and environmental concerns, by
providing the means of defining bed and other lithosome correlations in specific areas.<p>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
     Recent research in Resource Data Evaluation has begun to restructure the EERC geological
observation databases, using relational database management methodologies to develop a more
fully integrated approach to resource management and characterization.  This restructuring
permits the direct integration of digitized data derived from GIS activities with associated
attribute information.  The developing table or file organization is analogous to those
previously reported (Hartman, 1992, 1994a, b) using a flat-file database manager (Q&amp;A&reg;
by Symantec Corporation).  The major difference between flat-file and relational data
management philosophies is the ability of relational data managers to link tables in one-to-many
relationships. 
This capability, along with that of being able to directly link tables in
many-to-one or many-to-many relationships, significantly affects how data are organized into
subtables within and between databases.  In a relational data manager, queries represent a
method of data retrieval that permits the design of new combinative tables, based solely on
linkages, to which new data retrieval requests for information can be posed across multiple
tables.  The simplified database system example highlights selected database design features
using the relational management techniques incorporated by Microsoft Corporation into
Access&reg;. <p>
<p>
     The accompanying figure has, as its background, a portion of a surface geologic section
(M4772), which shows inclined lower Paleocene strata assigned to the Ludlow Formation,
exposed on the west side of the Cedar Creek Anticline in Dawson County, Montana.  These
rocks represent the lower portion of a sequence of coal-bearing strata comprising the Fort
Union Group in the Fort Union Coal Region of the Williston Basin.  The section includes two
fossiliferous horizons, Localities L6207 and L6207a, which are being used to paleontologically
date and correlate the section to other outcrop areas in the northern Great Plains.  The tables
(or files) noted on the accompanying figure illustrate a few of the most significant components
of a geological observation database system.  Surface and subsurface geologic observations are
included in an MNO database, which includes, among other tables, MNO (M-number) and
UNITS (section units) tables.  Paleontologic observations are maintained in an LNO database,
which includes LNO (L-number), SPPID (specimen identification), and other tables.  GIS
data, including unique machine numbers and digitized latitude and longitude values for L-numbers
and M-numbers, are included in a GIS table in a GIS database.  Other primary tables
include MAPS, for map data, MOLLES, for classification information on specimen
identifications, and BIB, for bibliographic references.  Any number of additional primary or
secondary tables could be added to manage project-specific information (e.g., analytical data
of a particular coal bed).  All of these tables were separate databases in Q&amp;A&reg;, variously
linked in many-to-one relationships through the construction of tabular reports (Report
Module).  In Access&reg;, these tables are linked through a query to effectively produce a
seamless master database.  <p>
<p>
     In addition, MNO and LNO relational and flat-file database or table designs differ radically in
their internal structure.  Using the table for paleontological observations as an example, the
main LNO table includes primarily location information, but summarizes other locality-specific data
noted below.  The main table (LNO) in the LNO database includes the following
cross-referenced fields:  LNO (locality number), REF (reference, e.g., author and year),
MNO (section number), UNIT (unit number within a section), STATE, and QUAD (U.S.
Geological Survey, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle).  In addition, there are 12 fields
managing seven discrete reference categories (including other numbering systems); 11 record-keeping
fields (e.g., date and time last modified); 48 fields managing 12 discrete location
categories (e.g., country, state, elevation); and nine fields managing general stratigraphic
categories (e.g., Formation).  The LNO database includes secondary or subtables that manage
specific information categories.  Description subtables include Location, Stratigraphy, General
Comment, Fauna, and Identifications.  Subtables are also maintained for Reference Affiliation,
Discovery, Collection, and Horizons (i.e., referential data pertaining to locality stratigraphy).<p>
<p>
     The value of the database design described above is that it provides the user with the ability to
integrate stratigraphic, location, and identification data directly, with the opportunity to
display the results of questions posed to the database in a map format using GIS.  <p>
